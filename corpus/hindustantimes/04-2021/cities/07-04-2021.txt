The written examination was scheduled for April 18. “The junior high school headmaster/assistant teacher recruitment exam-2021 that was scheduled on April 18 now stands postponed due to the three-phase Panchayat Elections-2021 taking place in the state. New date of the exam would be announced later,” said Anil Bhushan Chaturvedi, secretary, Exam Regulatory Authority, UP. Exam Regulatory Authority, UP has sent copies of its notification, issued on Wednesday, in this regard to all divisional joint directors (education) and district inspector of schools besides all divisional commissioners and district magistrates. The move comes following a green signal for the postponement of the recruitment exam given by the state government on April 6 that came through special secretary RV Singh in his missive sent to secretary of Exam Regulatory Authority. Earlier, the Exam Regulatory Authority, UP had sought permission to postpone the recruitment exams as the exam were being held close to the panchayat polls of 16 districts set to take place for April 19 and which could prevent thousands of government primary and upper primary teachers who are applicants from appearing in it due to their poll duties. Polling is set to be held in 16 districts of the state on April 19 in the second phase of the panchayat polls. These 16 districts, includes Muzaffarnagar, Baghpat, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Bijnor, Amroha, Badaun, Etah, Mainpuri, Kannauj, Etawah, Lalitpur, Chitrakoot, Pratapgarh, Lucknow, Lakhimpur Kheri, Sultanpur, Gonda, Maharajganj, Varanasi and Azamgarh. The proposal to postpone the recruitment exams had followed letters from various District Magistrates to Secretary of Examination Regulatory Authority, UP pointing out that the entire administrative machinery would be busy during the elections. Due to this, it would not be possible for them to conduct the examination on April 18. Hindustan Times had highlighted this issue in its report “Teachers in a fix over panchayat poll duty and recruitment exam” published on March 4. More than 3.25 lakh candidates have applied for this recruitment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/to-avoid-clash-with-panchayat-polls-teacher-s-recruitment-exam-postponed-101617820108849.html

Chairing a meeting of the State Flood Control Board through video conferencing, Captain Amarinder Singh ordered the placing of ₹10 crore at the disposal of the deputy commissioners of flood-prone districts to deal with any emergent situation arising due to heavy rain/floods. The CM directed DCs of flood-prone districts to prioritise their tasks and submit the list of projects requiring immediate attention to the finance department for sanction of funds. He also directed the DCs to undertake de-silting and cleaning of drains in consultation with the water resources department. Reviewing the status of reservoirs and dams, the CM expressed concern over existing low levels of water, which he said was the lowest in the past 40 years. Chief secretary Vini Mahajan underscored the need to carry out the necessary works with a holistic approach. In Jalandhar, the district administration claimed that it was all set to start a number of flood-protection measures along the Sutlej River, besides cleaning of drains. Deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori, who participated in the meeting with CM, said, “A total of 99 flood protection works along with cleansing of different drains have been identified in all five sub-divisions of the district at an outlay of ₹34.2 crore, with proposals already sent to the government.” During the floods that rocked the state in 2019, 21 breaches were reported in the district, which affected 103 villages, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/punjab-cm-sanctions-rs-130-cr-for-flood-protection-measures-101617820049369.html

Through the reconstruction, the width of the bridge will be increased from 3.7 metres to 12 metres at a cost of ₹7 crore. Councillor Mamta Ashu and Road Safety Council member Rahul Verma, along with officials of GLADA, visited the site on Wednesday.Ashu said the current width of the bridge was quite narrow to deal with the traffic volume, which caused frequent snarls. “Areas surrounding Jhammat village have witnessed development of a large number of residential colonies and some educational institutions have also been established. This has contributed to more traffic movement,” she said.The matter was taken up by cabinet minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu in the past, following which officials of GLADA and irrigation department conducted a survey to resolve the traffic woes, she said.“The project has been divided into reconstruction of bridge and laying concrete on the approach roads connecting Jalandhar via Laddowal Bypass. GLADA will be the executive agency. Currently, work is at tendering stage. Construction will be completed within two months after issuance of the work order,” the councillor said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/plans-afoot-to-widen-sidhwan-canal-bridge-in-ludhiana-101617819989550.html

In fact, their dream of joining the army and serving the nation remains unfulfilled. The Yogi-government has taken good step for the madarsa students. The government’s biggest decision is to register the madarsa board with COBSE,” official said.Zirgamudin said that the madarsa board has started the registration process with COBSE. “The work of preparing documents is being done. A meeting has been held with the officials of the government as well. It is expected that the madarsa board will be registered in COBSE by the start of the new session. This will be a major achievement for the madarsa board,” the official said.Earlier, the UP government had introduced NCERT books in madarsas so that the students could connect with modern education along with the traditional Dini Talim or religious education.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-madarsa-board-to-register-with-cobse-soon-101617819990091.html

07-04-2021||Noida||Noida authority allows pets in city parks||Noida: Acting on a direction from the Animal Welfare Board of India (AWBI), the Noida authority’s horticulture department has allowed entry of pets in city parks.“We have started removing the line that says ‘pets are prohibited inside’ from the boards installed in city parks. Soon this line will be removed in all city parks, mostly in this month,” said Indu Prakash Singh, officer on special duty of the Noida authority heading horticulture department.The warning boards have been revised in several parks in sectors 1 to 12, 14, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 34, 50, 51 and 53, and officials said changes will be made in the rest of the city “in another 20 days”. There are 726 parks under the authority across the city.Early February, a group of dog lovers had moved the AWBI and submitted photographs of the boards prohibiting entry of pets that the authority had put up. The issue was resulting in regular confrontations in residential blocks across the city, they argued.Acting on the petition, AWBI issued directions to the Noida authority in the last week of February to allow entry of pets in parks. Officials said the authority started removing the warning message from the parks from March 10. “After the horticulture department started removing this (banning entry of pets) line in their zones in parks, some people wanted to know if the authority bans the entry of pets in parks and we informed them that we do not prohibit the entry,” said Ritu Maheshwari, chief executive officer of the Noida authority.While pet lovers have welcomed the move, it has, however, not gone down well with a few.Pet lover Sanjay Mahapatra, who runs a free animal clinic in sector 54 footpath, is among those who are overjoyed by the decision. “Stray animals, be it dogs, cats, birds and other animals, are part of our ecosystem and we, as human beings, need to take care of these animals. In cities, other than parks, there are no other open areas. We need to make feeding points for not only dogs but also for birds, who depend on us for food,” he said.However, colonel (retd) MS Saxena, who is the former president of sector 30 residents’ welfare association, said, “The Noida authority should first make adequate arrangements where dogs can answer nature’s call. The dog owners do not clean up the excreta of their dogs, thus creating sanitation issues in local parks. The authority must impose some fine for such dog owners.”Meanwhile, Noida officials clarified that pet owners will soon issue guidelines, which will include specific timings for pets in parks, for pet owners. Security guards will also be deputed at large parks to make sure only pets with leashes are allowed inside and that the owners are carrying scoops and poop bags.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-authority-allows-pets-in-city-parks-101617818729375.html

The broken median is also an access for those who wish to move from these areas to the DME and onwards to Dasna and Meerut.The setup is risky with fast moving traffic from both sides, leaving sudden brakes difficult to execute. The upper speed limit on the DME in Uttar Pradesh is 100 kmph. “It is a big risk that commuters have to take but that has been the situation for months now. The underpasses that could have avoided this have not be opened up even though the DME was opened officially on April 1,” said Namita Gaur, resident of Crossings Republik. An alternative route that the more cautious commuter takes is Vijay Nagar to Greater Noida link road (to and fro) which is near Pratap Vihar. This involves an estimated additional travel of 3-4 kms in order to reach Greater Noida (West).The area near the ABES College is also major traffic junction for commuters. Just 500 metres away is the under construction railway over bridge (ROB) at Chipiyana. At the point, a 14-lane DME is suddenly bottlenecked into the current four-lane ROB.“In the absence of the underpasses, commuting has become risky on DME due to high flow of traffic and poses serious risk of accidents. There is no signage indicating the diversion towards Crossings Republik Township. Residents of Greater Noida (West) also move through the median of DME and take the Shahberi Road to go to their destination,” said Tarun Bharat Chauhan, president of Crossings Republik Owners & Members Association. The junction and the ROB are part of the DME’s phase 2 which is about 19.2km linking UP Gate and Dasna. It is estimated that around 60,000 passenger car units (PCU, a parameter that is determined by taking into account different vehicle types that ply on the road) per day. “The junction area is also poorly lit at night,” said Chauhan. “At the junction, there is major issue of wrong side driving as commuters have no alternative. When commuters further go to the ROB, there are traffic snarls due to pending construction and it sometimes results in long traffic jams up to the junction,” said Namita Gaur. NHAI officials said they had opened the median as a temporary measure for commuters. “The underpasses will be made operational soon and others works will also be taken up as required. Proper lighting and signage will also be put in place,” said Mudit Garg, project director of NHAI. “Six more lanes of the ROB will be complete by June and the rest by December-end,” Garg added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/commuters-of-crossings-republik-greater-noida-face-issues-as-dme-underpasses-still-not-operational-101617818728714.html
07-04-2021||Noida||NHAI opens interchange linking Delhi Meerut Expressway to Eastern Peripheral Express||With number of commuters growing since the four-phase Delhi Meerut Expressway (DME) opened fully for traffic on April 1, the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) has now connected it with the Eastern Peripheral Expressway (EPE) through an interchange.The interchange is located about 3kms away from Dasna at Rasoolpur Sikrod. “Commuters can now travel easily to Baghpat or to Gautam Budh Nagar via the EPE. They will be charged a toll through the reading of their FASTag (an electronic toll collection system) at the entry and exit points of the EPE,” said Mudit Garg, project director from NHAI. According to official figures, the DME, which links Delhi to Meerut under 60 kms, has recorded one-side traffic of about 30,000 passenger car units (PCU, which is a unit to measure traffic depending on the type of vehicle) daily. So far, the interchange was blocked as the tolling for DME is yet to take off pending approval of the rates by the Union ministry of road transport and highways. Different operators manage the tolling systems for DME and EPE. “Once tolling starts at DME, the toll calculation will be between entry and exit points. In case a commuter uses the interchange, the toll will be so calculated as to pay the toll operator depending on the toll rates of each expressway,” Garg said.In February, the central government had mandated every vehicle to carry a FASTag. If any commuter opted to pay via cash, they would be charged double the toll rate for the entire DME stretch, said Garg. Officials said that the toll for DME is expected to be in range of ₹1.55 to ₹2.15 per kilometre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/nhai-opens-interchange-linking-delhi-meerut-expressway-to-eastern-peripheral-express-101617818668704.html

In February, he was released on bail.Dinesh Kumar, station house officer of Badalpur police station, said, “In 2011 he had allegedly murdered a trader named Jay Chand. That murder case was regsitered at Dadri police station and Chand’s wife Sangeeta Tomar (40) is pursuing the legal battle. On April 4, Dujana waylaid Tomar and told her to turn hostile in the case or there would be consequences.”But Tomar did not back down. She lodged a complaint with the Badalpur police.“Based on the complaint, a case under section 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code was registered against Dujana. Though he is on bail, he is not at his Greater Noida home,” the SHO said. He added that Tomar had been given security since her husband’s murder.Dujana’s criminal cases include murder, attempt to murder, extortion, criminal intimidation, among others. After bail, he had married a woman named Pooja, a resident of Baraut in Baghpat. Jitendra Nagar, Dujana’s advocate, said that the cases against his client are false. “There are only 15-16 active cases against Dujana now. Pooja wanted to contest the Zila Panchayat election from Ward No 2. She had bought the form and was making preparations. We got to know about recent FIR against Dujana. This is a fictitious allegation as Dujana is not in Greater Noida,” he said. Nagar said that the case appears to be rival’s ruse to stop Pooja from contesting. “We suspect if Pooja contests, Dujana will be arrested to prevent him from campaigning for her. Pooja has decided against contesting the election now,” Nagar said. Pooja’s political banners and posters were also removed on Wednesday. Dujana and his wife were not available for a comment. Dujana had won the Zila panchayat election while contesting from the jail in 2016. He had defeated Sangram Singh, who carried out his election campaign wearing a bulletproof jacket, by 10030 votes.DCP (Noida Central) Harish Chander said that since Dujan had violated the terms of his bail, he’d be arrested. “We would also appeal to the high court against bail.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/out-on-bail-anil-dujana-booked-for-criminal-intimidation-101617817708648.html
07-04-2021||Noida||UP govt allows increase in floor area ratio for plots in Greater Noida: Officials||GREATER NOIDA: The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday allowed amendment of the Greater Noida Industrial Area (Fifth Amendment) Building Regulations, 2021. The revised rules and regulations for the construction of buildings will help certain categories of allottees to construct more areas over a plot, and build taller towers in some categories of plots, according to the officials.The amendment came after the Town and Planning Department in Greater Noida sent a proposal to the Uttar Pradesh government, that finally issued a gazette notification, allowing an increase in the floor area ratio (FAR) — which is the proportion obtained by dividing the total covered area (plinth area) on all floors by the area of the plot. Information technology and other such companies will be able to construct double the number of floors than what has been allowed so far, since the FAR allowed for such housing complexes was increased from 1 to 2.The non-polluting industrial units, including biotechnology, research and development companies, will be allowed to construct 4.25 times of space over the size of the plots. While the FAR for 2 will be given to them at the time of the allotment, an additional 2.25 FAR can be bought by paying the required premium. The FAR for new residential group housing, commercial and mixed-use projects will remain the same, capped at 5.25.SP Shukla, Officer on special duty (industries), said that the planning department had assessed the demand of the allottees, and requested the government to revise the rules.“With the FAR for 1, an allottee having a plot of 5,000-square-metre can construct floors having a cumulative area of 5,000-square-metre. With the FAR of 2, an individual can construct 10,000-square-metre of floor space over the same plot. The FAR is increased or decreased to make investments in a town more lucrative than the neighbouring cities, or to bring down congestion levels,” said Narendra Bhooshan, chief executive officer (CEO), Greater Noida authority.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/up-govt-allows-increase-in-floor-area-ratio-for-plots-in-greater-noidaofficials-101617817588559.html

Out of 442 patients, 212 of them are in home isolation and 55 admitted to government hospitals while the rest taking up treatment in private hospitals, the officials said. At the end of March when the district had 309 active cases, about 400 beds were available for Covid-19 patients in the government hospitals, they said.“The severity of infection is almost similar to what prevailed during the last year. Majority of the patients at present are asymptomatic and about 48% patients are in home isolation,” Gupta added. District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls. Of the 518 Covid beds under the district administration, 400 are at Santosh Medical College which is an L3 category facility (for moderate patients), while 118 are at Sanjay Nagar government hospital which is an L2 category facility (for critical patients). “We have 10 patients in our hospital and they have mild to moderate symptoms. We have put only one of them on oxygen as a precautionary measure,” said Dr Sanjay Teotia, chief medical superintendent of Sanjay Nagar hospital. Meanwhile, Ghaziabad on Wednesday reported 76 fresh cases, taking the total number of positive cases in the district to 27,712, which included 102 deaths. So far, a total of 27,165 patients have been discharged in the district, as per the health bulletin.Experts said that the present wave of infection is more contagious than the last year’s. “The infection is spreading fast. The spread is more as there is no check on movement of people and many are still not following precautions like social distancing or wearing of face mask,” said Dr VB Jindal, former president of Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad). “The good thing is that we have just about 5% cases which have gone to severe condition,” said Jindal. To gauge the spread of infection in the district, the sample positivity rate in Ghaziabad during the month of March stood at 0.69% while it is now about 1.36% during first five days of April. Sample positivity rate refers to the number of samples testing positive per 100 samples tested. Sometimes patients take more than one test for confirmation and so, total positive samples can be higher than total positive cases, the officials explained. The state officials said that UP has 31,987 active cases, besides 8,964 deaths and 604,979 patients discharged till April 7. “Of the total active cases, we have 18,679 patients who are in home isolation and 668 in private hospitals while the rest are taking up treatment in government health-care facilities,” said Amit Mohan Prasad, UP’s additional chief secretary (health).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-scales-up-covid-beds-to-about-1-500-as-cases-rise-101617817529230.html
07-04-2021||Patna||Madhubani killings: RJD, Congress raise the heat||Stepping up attack on the Nitish Kumar government over the recent killing of five persons, including an assistant sub-inspector of the Border Security Force (BSF), at a village in Madhubani district, the Opposition on Wednesday accused the state administration of giving patronage to the accused and demanded a fair probe.Leader of the opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, who visited the victim’s family at Mahmudpur village, sought a probe into the alleged links between BJP MLA from Benipatti Binod Narayan Jha and the main accused in the case, Pravin Jha , who allegedly runs a private army called Ravan Sena and was arrested from Nepal on Wednesday.Addressing a press conference, Yadav said, “Neither chief minister Nitish Kumar nor the deputy chief ministers visited the village. It was only after I visited the site of incident and talked with the family of the deceased that the main accused was arrested. It shows the government only acted when there was pressure from the opposition.”He also alleged that the police and state administration were giving patronage to “Ravan Sena” chief all these days after the incident took place on March 29 because of Jha’s political links. “I was told by family members of the deceased and locals about BJP MLA Binod Narayan Jha’s close links with the Sena chief. We want police to seek call details of the BJP MLA and probe his alleged links with the main accused,” Yadav said.The RJD scion also demanded immediate removal of the district’s superintendent of police (SP) and the deputy SP, saying the kingpin enjoyed close proximity to them.The BJP MLA has dismissed the charge. “Criminals have no caste. I have never had links with such people and can never dream of keeping any such association. I want those involved in the killings to get death punishment,” Jha said.Meanwhile, a six-member fact-finding team of the state Congress, led by former minister Awadhesh Kumar Singh, said the bloodshed could have been averted had the district authorities responded swiftly and reached the spot on time. “The incident happened barely three kilometres from the subdivisional office of Benipatti, but the police took four hours to reach there despite frantic calls made by the villagers,” Singh said.The Madhubani massacre has snowballed into a major issue in the state and even the constituents of the ruling alliance had questioned the role of police.Forest and environment department minister Neeraj Kumar Singh alias Bablu, who visited the village a week after the incident, said, “This is not an ordinary crime. Yet, no action against the police officials was taken.”A delegation of JD(U) leaders led by former minister Jai Kumar Singh also met the victim’s family and later briefed the CM about the incident.On Tuesday, the CM has said no one involved in the killings would be spared.On the day of Holi on March 29, around 35 armed men had opened fire on the family of one Ranvijay Singh over a land dispute in the village.Singh and his cousin brother Virendra Singh were killed on the spot. Three other family members, BSF officer Rana Pratap Singh, Amrendra Singh and Rudra narayan Singh, succumbed to his injuries a day later.Another injured person, Manoj Singh, is currently being treated at the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.The police said that about a dozen persons, including the main accused in the case Navin Jha, have been arrested so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/madhubani-killings-rjd-congress-raise-the-heat-101617816359396.html

Yadav said that as per the MCG’s street vending policy, original licensees of the carts cannot lease or transfer the ownership to another person.Around 1,600 street vendors are operating in MCG’s 125 street vending zones. The MCG’s first street vending zone opened in November 2016, on a vacant plot opposite Medanta Hospital in Sector 32. An MCG street vending zones is a designated area where street vendors, mainly food or beverage vendors, sell their products to residents at affordable rates.“As per the rule, a street cart can neither be transferred in the name of another nor can it be given to any other person on rent. During the survey and investigation, it has been found that some people have rented the cart to others or have been transferred in the name of others. This type of process is illegal, and the violators have been directed to surrender their cart or else legal action will be initiated by the MCG against them and their belongings confiscated,” said Yadav.Yadav said that street vendors in Sector 56, which had the highest number of violations, 75, were also called to his office on Monday for a meeting and were given until Wednesday evening to hand over their carts.“We are taking action against all street vending zones in a phased manner. On Wednesday, street vendors of Sector 44 market were called to my office and they will also be given a two-day deadline to hand over their carts of face action. Within this week, all vending zones will be covered,” said Yadav.Yadav also said that street vendors were also reminded that ovens (tandoor) and furnaces cannot be used on top of the cart as per the street vending policy and they needed to be removed immediately.During last month’s MCG House meeting, the street vending policy had become a major topic of debate among councillors and officials. Officials of the MCG too argued the matter, with MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh cautioning Yadav repeatedly to keep the decorum of the House.As per an MCG estimate, there are around 18,000 street vendors in Gurugram.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/unauthorised-street-vendors-asked-to-return-carts-101617816630573.html

07-04-2021||Gurugram||Two-storey building, adjoining shop gutted in fire at Sadar Bazar||A three-storey building and an adjoining shop were gutted in a major fire at Sadar Bazar on Wednesday evening as firefighting operations continued beyond 11pm, at the time of filing of the report. However, no injuries were reported in the incident.According to fire department officials, they received a call about the fire at 6.43pm and more than 20 fire tenders deployed to contain the fire. The cause of the fire was yet to be determined, said officials.The fire broke out in a three-floor hardware store, located at the point where the Basai Road starts. Initially, one fire tender was sent. However, upon arrival, fire department officials called for more vehicles due to the intensity of the blaze. “The entire three-floor hardware store is gutted. The fire broke out when shopkeepers and staff were present inside. However, they all managed to escape unharmed. We are yet to ascertain the cause of the fire. It is likely to have been caused by a short circuit,” said a fire department official at the spot.The official cited above also said that the hardware store had highly flammable objects, due to which the intensity of the fire continued to increase and spread to a one-storey plywood store located to the left side of the building. Officials said that the hardware store and plywood store shared boundaries.Fire department officials said they broke the shutters to start dousing operations. In the interim, they also used a 42-metre hydraulic ladder to douse the fire on the third floor of the hardware store, as the intensity of the fire was the highest there and they wanted to prevent it from spreading to other shops in the vicinity.As roads leading to the spot were narrow, traffic from Rajiv Chowk moving towards Sohna Chowk was also diverted.Officials turned off the power at the site as a section of overhead electric cables was also located in close proximity to the hardware store.With more than 1,200 shops and 350 street vendors, Sadar Bazar receives a high footfall in the evening hours. The fire department and Gurugram police officials cordoned off the site due to a high number of onlookers and also directed shopkeepers and other customers to move their vehicles to a safe distance.“Around 20-25 fire tenders are dousing the blaze. We are expecting to control it around midnight. No person has suffered any injuries in the incident. The fire has gutted two shops and dousing operations are underway to prevent it from spreading to other nearby shops,” said Sunil Adlakha, fire safety officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/twostorey-building-adjoining-shop-gutted-in-fire-at-sadar-bazar-101617816628651.html
07-04-2021||Gurugram||RWAs find it tough to track residents’ travel history||Even as the residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) across the city started enforcing the Covid-19 protocols in their societies and condominiums, following directions from the district administration on Tuesday, many said they were unable to ascertain the travel history of residents.“We received the circular on Wednesday and the directions related to wearing masks, thermal checking, sanitizing common areas is being taken up. It will be difficult to track flight plans as people cite privacy concerns and also don’t want to give too much information to RWAs,” said Sanjay Lal, former vice-president, Lagoon RWA.However, RWAs said they have started implementing safety measures with ease.At Ramprastha City, where around 1,200 families live in three condominiums, the RWA on Wednesday decided to restrict the entry of car cleaners and domestic helps who were working in houses from where new cases were reported. They have been asked to self-quarantine, said RWA members, adding that strict checking of visitors and thermal scanning of food delivery persons was also started.“Apart from taking these measures, we are organising a Covid test camp for all maintenance staff that includes horticulture, housekeeping technical workers,” said Pradeep Rahi, president, Ramprastha City Welfare Association, adding that from Thursday, they will start penalising residents who don’t wear masks.The administration on Tuesday put the onus of tracking travellers on RWAs, even as the city continued to witness a spike in Covid-19 cases, with 611, the highest single-day spike this year, reported on Wednesday. The number of active cases, which was at 534 on March 15, rose to 3,905 on Wednesday. The district administration said that the Covid-19 norms should be implemented strictly and violators will be charged under sections of the IPC and Disaster Management Act.At Vatika Seven Lamps in Vatika City, the RWA said it has shared guidelines issued by the district administration with residents and asked them to follow them strictly.“We are regularly sharing information, such as notices from administration, testing and vaccination with residents related. We are working towards limiting the entry of visitors and asked residents to declare their recent foreign travel history,” said Mamta Yadav, president, The Seven Lamps RWA.Yadav, however, said that getting travel details and other personal information was difficult for RWAs, as residents fear they would be forced into quarantine.RWA functionaries said that some residents even avoid testing, as a positive result could bring their work and travel plans to a halt. “People prefer staying at home and getting treated silently as Covid-19 is still considered a stigma,” said an RWA member, requesting anonymity.On Sohna road, Dharmender Jha, the president of Rosewood RWA, said all curbs will.be implemented fully in two to three days. “If home deliveries are banned, people start fighting with the RWA. So instead of banning these, we have decided to enforce thermal checks and sanitization of visitors. We are also strict on wearing masks for everyone and challans will be issued to violators,” he said.Parveen Malik, a resident of Sare Homes, said that their RWA had already put in place several measures but these are being made more stringent. “People not wearing masks will be fined, we already have a database of senior citizens, who will be cared for. Entry of outsiders will be restricted,” he said.Agencies maintaining condominiums also said that they had activated the safety protocols and are working towards implementing the norms. “We are closely following the rising Covid cases in the country, specifically across Delhi/ NCR. We have been sending out communication in the form of mailers and WhatsApp to residents, so that they adhere to Covid-19 safety guidelines,” said AK Singh, president and chief executive officer of Enviro, a maintenance agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/rwas-find-it-tough-to-track-residents-travel-history-101617816510745.html
07-04-2021||Gurugram||GMDA to repair, de-silt drains to prevent road cave-ins||In a bid to prevent road cave-ins during monsoon, the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA) proposed a project to repair sewer lines across the city and de-silt them, officials said on Wednesday. A proposal for the project, along with rehabilitation and strengthening of old master sewer lines, is likely to be tabled before the chief minister for approval during the authority’s board meeting scheduled on Friday.“During monsoon, overflow from drains and sewer lines is reported from many areas and to curb that, we have made this proposal with the idea of Gurugram heading towards a silt-free area. This will be a round-the-clock project with special focus on areas where all kinds of waste are dumped in the sewer lines, leading to heavy silting and blockage,” said Pradeep Kumar, chief engineer for infrastructure-II division of GMDA.Kumar said that such areas are being identified and work will start after approval. However, no timeline has been set for the completion of the work.According to GMDA officials, instances of heavy waste in sewer lines have been often reported from Iffco Chowk and stretches along the Mehrauli-Gurugram Road in the past few years. With roads built over the sewer lines, there is a potential danger of accidents, if the sewer line breaks due to pressure, he said.The city has a 135-kilometre-long sewer network, for which de-silting will be done in phases. The authority has already carried out de-silting (as part of other projects currently underway) for 33 kilometres and an estimate for de-silting 53 kilometres has been made. De-silting will not be needed for 25 kilometres of the network as the sewer lines are comparatively new, said officials.The project is estimated to cost around ₹130 crore.Kumar said, “Due to production of gases like methane, carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulphite and others, the internal surface of the pipelines that have been there for over 25-30 years starts decaying. Over time, stretches where heavy waste (like industrial waste) is dumped in sewer lines become more prone to damage and for that, we have planned to repair some particular stretches.”The authority has also kept a provision for cured in place pipe (CIPP) for repairing sewer lines on a 15-kilometre stretch. Such repair work has already been done over 9 kilometres in the last year. Through CIPP, specific stretches of the sewer network where heavy damage has been caused, due to accumulation of silt along with the production of toxic gases from waste dumped in the sewer lines, are repaired. This process is followed to avoid changing the whole sewer line, which can cause inconvenience to the public.In May last year, the GMDA found around 48 points in the city where sewer lines from the neighbouring residential and commercial establishments were connected to the surface drains illegally. Such illegal connections add to the burden of the pipelines, resulting in faster decay and damage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gmda-to-repair-de-silt-drains-to-prevent-road-caveins-101617816509893.html
07-04-2021||Gurugram||Speeding car rams motorbike, kills two||Two persons died after the motorcycle they were riding was hit by a speeding car ahead of an under-construction toll plaza on Sohna Road on Tuesday night. The police said that the car driver allegedly fled the scene leaving the vehicle behind. He has been identified but was yet to be arrested. The police said the accident took place around 10.15pm. According to the police, the victims, identified as Majlis Habib and Mohammad Salamuddin of Dhunela in Bhondsi, worked as motor mechanics in a private workshop in Shivaji Nagar in Sector in 11. Jagbir Singh, station house officer of Bhondsi police station, said that it was a head-on collision and due to the high speed of the car, victims were flung to the other side of the road, around 50 metres from the spot of the collision, due to the impact. “The car driver was speeding and driving rashly. Due to the toll plaza construction, the route is one way. The driver lost control and rammed the motorbike from the front. Both men fell on the road and sustained critical injuries to their heads and bodies. The car driver must have also suffered injuries due to the heavy impact,” he said. The police said that the motorbike and the front side of the car were completely damaged due to the impact.After passersby informed the police, a team from Bhondsi police station took the injured persons to Sohna Civil hospital, but doctors declared them brought dead. Rashid Khan, a cousin of Habib, said he was riding on his motorcycle a few metres away when the accident took place. “Every day after work I along with Habib and another mechanic used to ride back together to our village. On Tuesday, after closing my workshop in Sector 15, I called them and we met at Subhash Chowk. They were around 50 metres ahead of me when they met with an accident,” he said. Police said they were checking the CCTV footage from different locations on the stretch to establish the speed of the car. A case was registered against the suspect under sections 279 (rash driving) and 304A (death by negligence) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Bhondsi police station on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/speeding-car-rams-motorbike-kills-two-101617816508506.html

07-04-2021||Gurugram||Properties get costlier as admin sanctions circle rate hikes||Homebuyers in the city will have to shell out more for buying property as the district administration has announced a hike in circle rates and the same would be implemented from Thursday.As per the new rates, the buyers of independent floors in the Haryana Shahari Vikas Pradhikaran (HSVP) sectors will have to shell almost 20% more as the circle rate has been increased from ₹5,500 per square feet (psf) to ₹6,500 psf. The rates for apartments in group housing societies in HSVP sectors has been increased from ₹3,600 psf to ₹7,500 psf.In a significant move that would also make apartments more expensive on the upscale Golf Course Road, the district administration had proposed that circle rates for DLF Aralias, Magnolias and Camelias be increased from ₹20,000 psf to ₹25,000 psf.The circle rates in group housing societies on Sohna Road and MG Road has also been increased from ₹8,000 psf to ₹9,000 psf. However, the circle rate for plots for residential plots on HSVP sectors and markets has not been changed.The circle rate for apartments in group housing societies in sectors 15 to 57 has been increased from ₹5,000 psf to ₹7,000 psf. Likewise, the circle rate for flats in group housing societies of sectors 58 to 63A has been increased from ₹3,500 psf to ₹5,000 psf.The district administration said that new circle rates will be implemented from April 8. The increase in circle rates, however, has not gone down well with properly dealers as they said that this will further drag the market down“The circle rates have been reduced in Delhi and many other states of the country. This hike in rates will further demotivate the buyers in Gurugram and Haryana, as the taxes are already high here. The government should have offered relief, but instead, hiked rates,” said Ramesh Singla, a real estate consultant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/properties-get-costlier-as-admin-sanctions-circle-rate-hikes-101617816449606.html

The central government will send two lakh doses of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin and 10 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine of Pune-based Serum Institute of India, state health department officials said.“The Government of India (GoI) will send two lakh doses of Covaxin vaccine by Thursday, while 10 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine is likely to reach Ranchi by Friday. With this, the state now has adequate doses of the two vaccines for second dose of vaccination,” Ravi Shankar Shukla, state mission director, National Health Mission (NHM), said.The state health department currently has 97,037 doses of Covishield and 20,124 doses of Covaxin at its disposal as on Wednesday evening, Shukla said.The state recently on April 3 requested the GoI for five lakh doses of the vaccines in wake of the drying stock.Besides, the ongoing vaccination drive across the state was also regulated due to the depleting stock of vaccines, particularly Covaxin. An order was issued a couple of days ago asking districts not to use Covaxin for first dose and use it only for the second dose. One of the worst-hit districts, East Singhbhum (Jamshedpur) was only left with 960 doses of the two vaccines, 430 doses of Covishield and 530 doses of Covaxin, by Tuesday night. This was after obtaining 3,500 doses of Covishield from West Singhbhum and 730 doses of Covaxin from Seraikela-Kharsawan districts. Jamshedpur alone requires 12-15,000 doses of the vaccines per day.The state till 6pm on Wednesday administered first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine to 1,827,886 beneficiaries and second dose to 278, 989 persons. The need of rapid and wide coverage of the vaccination drive has become an absolute necessity with the fast spreading infection and steep spike in the number of fresh cases across the state, especially Ranchi and Jamshedpur. During past 24 hours, the state detected 1,265 new Covid-19 cases, of which 539 were found in Ranchi alone. Jamshedpur, on the other hand, detected 340 new Covid-19 patients. The state reported 13 Covid-19 deaths during the past seven days, according to the health department’s bulletin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/jharkhand-to-get-12-lakh-vaccine-doses-in-2-days-101617814648261.html
07-04-2021||Patna||No V-C for four new Bihar varsities, under additional charge||All the three new state universities, carved out of existing bigger universities in 2018, have slipped under ad hoc arrangement after the term of their vice-chancellors fell vacant. The latest to join the list is Munger University.While the term of Munger University vice-chancellor (V-C) Ranjit Kumar Verma ended last month, Patalputra University V-C Gulab Chand Ram Jaiswal quit in January a few months before his tenure’s end. Purnea University V-C Rajesh Singh had resigned in September last year for a new assignment in Uttar Pradesh. While, TM Bhagalpur University V-C Neelima Gupta is holding the additional charge of Munger University, Lalit Narayan Mithila University (Darbhanga) V-C SP Singh has the additional charge of Pataliputra University, as the term of Pro-V-C in both the universities has also ended. In Purnea University, however, Pro-V-C RS Yadav is the acting V-C. The vacancies at the top are likely to affect Bihar’s quest for certification of its colleges by the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (NAAC). NAAC has already set 2022 deadline for certification of all colleges in the country. Bihar has been slow on that count and even the best of state’s colleges that went in for certification have fumbled due to lack of teachers, facilities, intent and poor feedback from students. Aryabhatt Knowledge University (AKU), set up in 2010 to regulate all technical institutions by bringing them under one umbrella, has also been without a regular V-C since September 20, 2020, when the term of Arun Kumar Agarwal ended. Since then, AKU Pro-V-C Syed Mohammad Karim has been holding the additional charge of V-C, though he, too, is set to retire in a couple of months. The Raj Bhawan had invited applications afresh for the appointment of V-C at the AKU in January this year after cancelling the September 2020 advertisement “due to unavoidable reason”. The candidates who had applied earlier were asked to apply afresh, if interested. The last date ended on March 1. Bihar Agriculture University, Sabour, is also without a V-C since the term of Ajoy Kumar Singh ended earlier this year. Director, extension, BAU, RK Sohana, is the acting V-C since then. Nalanda Open University (NOU) in Patna is also continuing under interim measure after the sudden resignation of HN Prasad in November last. Besides, Animal Science University, set up in 2017, does not have a Pro-V-C. The situation is similar in the Kameshwar Singh Darbhanga University (KSDSU). More vacancies are likely to occur in the months to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/no-v-c-for-four-new-bihar-varsities-under-additional-charge-101617814588285.html
07-04-2021||Patna||Madhubani killings: Caste militias in spotlight again||The Madhubani killings, in which five persons of a family in a village were shot dead on March 29 on the day of Holi, has once again turned the spotlight on the infamous militias in Bihar, mostly formed on caste lines.The main accused in this case, Pravin Jha (30), who calls himself Ravan for reasons not yet clear, was heading a private army which he named “Ravan Sena”, mainly consisting of Brahmins in the area.Police say the violence took place for fishing rights in a local pond, which is a source of income of many in the area. The dominant Rajput community of the village had control over the pond which Jha wanted for Brahmins. Private caste armies are nothing new to Bihar, the most notorious being Ranvir Sena (of Bhumihars). Others were Lorik Sena (Bhumihars) , Bhumi Sena (Bhumihars) and Kisan Sangh (Rajputs).Caste armies hit headlines mostly in 1990s when they executed massacres, mostly in central Bihar.The “Ravan Sena” of Benippati in Madhubani district was raised in 2018 and is the second of its kind militia group in the Brahmin community, with its influence mainly confined to Madhubani. “Of late, it has become active on social media in some pockets of Gopalganj as well,” said a police officer on the condition of anonymity.The first private army of Brahmins, called the “Parshuram Sena”, was formed by dreaded gangster Santosh Jha, who broke away from CPI (Maoist) in early 2000 and formed “People’s Liberation Army”, also known as “Parshuram Sena”, in Nepal. The outfit has been known to demand and collect extortion from contractors executing road projects. Its members allegedly killed over a dozen engineers and supervisors in the last one decade. Jha, who was serving a life term for the murder of two engineers and was facing trial in about 20 criminal cases, was shot dead on court premises in Sitamarhi on August 28, 2018. “The Parshuram Sena operates in Sheohar, Sitamarhi, Samastipur, Darbhanga and Madhubani districts of north Bihar, besides adjoining Nepal, and has a more wider reach that Ravan Sena,” said a police officer.According to his Facebook’s profile, Jha of Ravan Sena was preparing to contest panchayat election and had already declared himself as Mukhiya. Police sources in Darbhanga said he had been an active member of the Bajarang Dal and was a former president of its district unit. “Yes, I am villain for those who are dividing the society for vested interests, those who are promoting injustice,” one of the posts uploaded by him on his FB page says. A legislator of the ruling JD (U), who visited the village after the killings as a member of the party’s fact-finding team, described Jha as a “ruffian who indulged in extortion”. Madhubani’s superintendent Dr Satya Prakash said only two cases were lodged against Pravin of Ravan Sena in the district. “We are interrogating him for more details.” Rival political parties alleged he was also into illegal liquor business. However, police said no case had been lodged against him for liquor recovery. “Only a case for recovery of illegal arms had been lodged,” said a police official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/madhubani-killings-caste-militias-in-spotlight-again-101617814528269.html

Addressing a press conference, Yadav said, “Neither chief minister Nitish Kumar nor the deputy chief ministers visited the village. It was only after I visited the site of incident and talked with the family of the deceased that the main accused was arrested. It shows the government only acted when there was pressure from the opposition.” He also alleged that the police and state administration were giving patronage to “Ravan Sena” chief all these days after the incident took place on March 29 because of Jha’s political links. “I was told by family members of the deceased and locals about BJP MLA Binod Narayan Jha’s close links with the Sena chief. We want police to seek call details of the BJP MLA and probe his alleged links with the main accused,” Yadav said. The RJD scion also demanded immediate removal of the district’s superintendent of police (SP) and the deputy SP, saying the kingpin enjoyed close proximity to them.The BJP MLA has dismissed the charge. “Criminals have no caste. I have never had links with such people and can never dream of keeping any such association. I want those involved in the killings to get death punishment,” Jha said. Meanwhile, a six-member fact-finding team of the state Congress, led by former minister Awadhesh Kumar Singh, said the bloodshed could have been averted had the district authorities responded swiftly and reached the spot on time. “The incident happened barely three kilometres from the subdivisional office of Benipatti, but the police took four hours to reach there despite frantic calls made by the villagers,” Singh said. The Madhubani massacre has snowballed into a major issue in the state and even the constituents of the ruling alliance had questioned the role of police. Forest and environment department minister Neeraj Kumar Singh alias Bablu, who visited the village a week after the incident, said, “This is not an ordinary crime. Yet, no action against the police officials was taken.” A delegation of JD(U) leaders led by former minister Jai Kumar Singh also met the victim’s family and later briefed the CM about the incident. On Tuesday, the CM has said no one involved in the killings would be spared. On the day of Holi on March 29, around 35 armed men had opened fire on the family of one Ranvijay Singh over a land dispute in the village. Singh and his cousin brother Virendra Singh were killed on the spot. Three other family members, BSF officer Rana Pratap Singh, Amrendra Singh and Rudra narayan Singh, succumbed to injuries a day later.Another injured person, Manoj Singh, is currently being treated at the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital. The police said that about a dozen persons, including the main accused in the case Navin Jha, have been arrested so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/madhubani-killings-rjd-cong-raise-the-heat-101617814468787.html
07-04-2021||Patna||Munger police firing: HC shifts Munger SP, 7 others, orders ₹10 lakh for slain boy’s father||The Patna high court on Wednesday ordered to shift eight police officers of Munger district, including its superintendent of police M S Dhillon, within three days and asked the state government to pay a sum of ₹10 lakh to the father of an 18-year-old boy who was killed allegedly in police firing during the immersion of Durga idol on October 26 last year. Arguing for Amarnath Poddar, father of the slain boy Anurag Kumar, Supreme Court lawyer Alakh Alok Srivastava told the court of Justice Rajiv Ranjan Prasad that two months had passed but nothing had been done so far to give justice to the family. The HC was hearing a criminal writ petition filed by Poddar seeking a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and a compensation of ₹5 crore.Observing there was no allegation that the petitioner’s son was involved in any act of violence, the HC directed the state government to pay ₹10 lakh to the petitioner within a month. It further said the additional director general of CID shall decide on the constitution of an SIT of senior officers above the rank of DSP to interrogate the police personnel who are likely to be investigated. “... in order to ensure free and fair investigation of the case, the state respondents shall ensure that all the eight members of the SIT, including Munger SP, be shifted to some other place for the present within three days. The court, however, makes it clear that the order to shift them elsewhere be not taken as any indictment of all those officers by this court and no adverse inference shall be drawn against them for this reason alone,” reads the order. The court said the CID shall submit its first report in a sealed cover before it within a period of four weeks Advocate Srivastava said the HC had earlier refused to grant an urgent hearing in this case, after which the victim’s father filed a petition in the Supreme Court, which asked the HC on January 25 to decide the case within two months. Poddar said there was some hope of getting justice for his deceased son.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/munger-police-firing-hc-shifts-munger-sp-7-others-orders-rs-10-lakh-for-slain-boy-s-father-101617814468158.html
07-04-2021||Patna||Madhubani killings: Kingpin arrested, top cop rules out caste angle||The police on Wednesday arrested five persons, including the main accused, in connection with the sensational killing of five members of a family, including a BSF officer, at Mahmudpur village in Madhibani district on March 29.The main accused, Pravin Jha, runs a militia called Ravan Sena, mainly consisting of Brahmins.According to Jitendra Kumar, additional director general (ADG), police headquarters, a police team led by Madhubani’s superintendent Dr Satya Prakash raided at a house at Raghauni village on Madhubani-Darbhanga border falling under Bisfi police station and arrested four named accused, identified as Pravin Jha alias Ravan, Chandan Jha, Mukesh Safi, Bhola Singh, and the house owner who gave them shelter. On the day of Holi, more than 50 armed men opened fire at the family of one Ranvijay Singh, with whom they had a running dispute over fishing from a local pond. While Ranvijay Singh and his cousin brother Virendra Singh died on spot, three other family members, Rana Pratap Singh (assistant sub-inspector in BSF), Amrendra Singh (interstate cricketer) and Rudra Narayan Singh, succumbed to injuries a day later. Another injured person, Manoj Singh, is currently being treated at Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.Members of the victim family have demanded a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) and threatened to commit suicide before the chief minister’s residence if all named accused are not arrested within four days.Preliminary investigation suggests that the pond is owned by one Sanjay Singh (brother of Ranvijay), but another group wanted to take it over. On November 20, two separate cases were lodged by Sanjay and Mukesh Safi (close associate of Pravin Jha) against each other and Sanjay is currently lodged in a jail. Ajitabh Kumar, inspector general of police (Darbhanga range), said the incident was a fallout of battle for supremacy between two groups, and not two castes. “A case has been lodged against 35 people, including 18 Brahmins and 13 Rajputs, and dozens of unidentified accused. So far, 14 named accused have been arrested and sent to jail while one of the prominent accused, Navin Jha, is still absconding. The administration has attached his property,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/madhubani-killings-kingpin-arrested-top-cop-rules-out-caste-angle-101617814408316.html
07-04-2021||Pune||In two months, 10 stranded leopard cubs reunited with mothers in Junnar||Three leopard cubs not more than 15 days old, who were found stranded in a sugarcane field in Vadgaon Sahani village, in Pune district’s Junnar taluka last week, were reunited with their mother on during the early hours of Tuesday. This is the second such rescue operation in the area since March 20, when two 45-day-old cubs (similarly found in a sugarcane field in Junnar’s Ozar village), were reunited with their mother. A total of 10 cubs have been rescued and reunited with their mothers since February in the region.In all cases, the cubs were found by farmers who were harvesting sugarcane crops, the season for which runs from December to late March-early April. Officials said that farmers in the area are accustomed to the occasional sight of leopards, especially around this time of the year. The farmers immediately altered the district forest office, who in turn roped in rescuers with Wildlife SOS, which runs a leopard rescue and rehabilitation centre in Junnar.“While harvesting their sugarcane crops, local farmers stumbled upon three tiny leopard cubs huddled together amidst the tall, dense fields in Vadgaon Sahani village... The cubs were brought to the Wildlife SOS Leopard Rescue Center for a brief medical examination. Identified as two males and one female, the cubs were estimated to be about fifteen-days-old,” Wildlife SOS said in a statement.Veterinarian Dr. Nikhil Bangar, who examined the cubs for ticks and injuries, found them to be in good health. An initial attempt to reunite the lost cubs with their mother on the weekend remained unsuccessful. However, the cubs were placed in a box and left in the same field where they were found late Monday night.“After a long night of waiting, the mother leopard was seen slowly approaching the field at dawn. Relieved to be reunited with her cubs, the leopard quickly knocked over the box and took her precious babies away to a safer location,” said Dr Bangar. The operation was captured with a camera trap placed nearby.Kartick Satyanarayan, CEO, Wildlife SOS, said, “Harvest season in Maharashtra often coincides with leopard cub season, which puts both humans and these elusive wild cats in a rather sensitive and conflicting situation. We are grateful to the villagers who took the right step by informing the Forest Department.”Yogesh Ghodke, Range Forest Officer in charge of the area, explained that the Junnar region has a significant leopard population, which -- due to rapid loss of forest cover -- are being forced to seek safe refuge in tall, dense sugarcane fields, leading to such encounters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/in-two-months-10-stranded-leopard-cubs-reunited-with-mothers-in-junnar-101617812727991.html

Callers can also get help with an ambulance, surveillance, contact tracing, home isolation and sanitisation using 18004192211," Bhushan told PTI.Administration officials appealed to the residents to collectively support the government's surveillance and contact tracing efforts to check the spread of the infection."People can just call on the helpline number and government officials will take care of the rest. The response on the helpline number has been better in urban areas as compared to rural areas in the district in terms of providing information about the arrival of outsiders," said an official who did not wish to be named.District Magistrate Suhas L Y had recently directed all concerned officials to ramp up contact tracing of new Covid-19 cases and ensure their surveillance in order to check the spread of the deadly virus.He had also formed a 10-member dedicated team for contact tracing comprising of officials from education, GST and health departments.The team on Wednesday traced contacts of 116 new Covid-19 patients in Gautam Buddh Nagar, with an average of 25 to 30 contacts of each infected person being traced, Bhushan said."Their reports have been sent to the RRT (rapid response team) and the sampling team for further action," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-noida-administration-asks-residents-to-inform-it-about-arrival-of-outsiders-101617810431647.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Credai-Pune Metro to conduct mass vaccination drive for construction workers||Credai and Pune Metro have planned a mass Covid-19 vaccination drive for construction labourers across the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), the Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) and the Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) regions, according to office bearers. The association, which has received support from municipal authorities, will strengthen the vaccination drive that will benefit millions of labourers after getting requisite approvals from the government. During last year’s lockdown period, the association was involved in several activities including setting up ICU units and oxygen beds in government-run hospitals, distributing rations to the poor and distributing sanitisers, masks and cooked food to the labourers at construction sites. Apart from that, the association has expressed concerns over the hike in interest rates by several banks, including the State Bank of India (SBI), and has said that such a move will further weaken the already struggling real estate sector. Anil Pharande, president, Credai, said, “With measures like lower interest rates from banks and reduction in stamp duty last year there was some hope for the industry’s revival, but unfortunately, banks have again hiked their interest rates which can have an adverse effect on the sector. There are around 250 allied industries along with millions of labourers dependent on real estate. It should be reconsidered.” The association has also said that migration of labourers due to the second wave of Covid-19 can spell more trouble as the developers who are struggling to meet the deadlines and commitments need the workers at their sites.“The real estate sector has just begun to revive and there have been reports of migrants leaving the city due to the fear of another lockdown. We are already providing sanitisation and hygiene measures and medical treatment at the labour camps, but another migration will prove uncertain for the revival of the sector,” said Pharande.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/credaipune-metro-to-conduct-mass-vaccination-drive-for-construction-workers-101617812007943.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Pune RTO reports drop in overall vehicle registrations, excluding ambulances, tractors||Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, a considerable drop in vehicle registrations have been reported for the financial year 2020-21 at the Pune Regional Transport Office (RTO), excluding ambulances and tractors. Most sectors faced an economic crunch last year due to a complete lockdown, and a similar drop was seen in auto sales and registrations. However, while all other vehicle registrations dropped, there was a considerable increase in the number of ambulance and tractor sales and registrations. Due to the pandemic situation, several private and government bodies purchased new ambulances. On a similar note, in the agriculture sector, the demand and supply were huge throughout the year and hence, many farmers purchased new tractors for their day-to-day farming work. The highest number of ambulances registered was in 2020-21, in comparison to data from the last five years. A total of 108 ambulances were registered in 2020-21; 45 ambulances in 2019-2020; 48 ambulances in 2018-2019; 76 ambulances in 2017-2018; and 31 ambulances in 2016-2017. Similarly, the last financial year saw a total of 2,160 tractor registrations, the highest number in the last five years in the Pune RTO division. A total of 1,530 tractors were registered in 2019-2020; 1,200 tractors were registered in 2018-2019; 853 tractors were registered in 2017-2018; and 1,249 tractors were registered in 2016-2017. Last year, a total of 1,43,958 vehicles of 17 different types were registered under the Pune RTO division from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2021.Before that, in every financial year the number was two lakh and higher. In 2019-20 it was 2, 47,225; in 2018-19 it was 2, 61,410; in 2017-18 it was 2,91,117; and in 2016-17 it was 2,70,307. There has been a drastic drop by 1,03,267 vehicles registration in the previous financial year compared to data from the last five years. “There was a decrease in the number of total vehicles registered under the Pune RTO division with above 1 lakh vehicles in comparison to previous financial years. It was an impact of Covid-19 pandemic and we hope that this financial year there is a good response to overall vehicle sales and registrations.” said Pune deputy regional transport officer Sanjeev Bhor. Prashant Bandal, president of Shivshakati Tarun Mandal from Kothrud who bought an ambulance last year to help patients said, “The situation was worse after August last year, there were no beds and even ambulances were not available. So, members of our mandal decided to buy a new ambulance with individual contributions and started a free service for public,”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-rto-reports-drop-in-overall-vehicle-registrations-excluding-ambulances-tractors-101617811887872.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Cash for judgement: ACB arrests Gaikwad’s associate in bribery case||The Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) has arrested Ajay Gopinathan, an associate of the main accused, Shubhavari Gaikwad, in connection with the cash-for-favourable judgement bribery case, which has already seen the arrest of Wadgaon Maval’s sitting judge, Archana Jatkar, on April 1. Gopinathan is known to Gaikwad and has been remanded to police custody until April 8 by special judge SR Navander. According to the ACB sleuths, Gaikwad and Gopinathan are known to each other for the past year-and-a-half. On the day of her arrest, Gaikwad had given her old mobile handset to Gopinathan. When interrogated over the issue, she has been giving evasive answers, public prosecutor Vilas Ghogare Patil informed the court during his submissions. Patil demanded police custody on grounds that voice samples had to be recorded. Wadgaon Maval judicial magistrate (first class) Archana Jatkar whose role was under the scanner by the Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) was arrested by the ACB at 11 am on April 1. Jatkar whose bail application was rejected by the Supreme Court (SC) surrendered at the ACB office after which she was immediately taken into custody and placed under arrest. The court rejected her bail application and, in its order, sent her to police custody until April 5. The district court later released her on bail. The investigation report in the bribery case was lodged at Dehuroad police station for offences under section 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and relevant sections of the prevention of corruption act. The ACB has already arrested Shubhavari Bhalchandra Gaikwad (29), a resident of Talegaon; Sushant Baban Kenjale (35) of Ravet; and dismissed police inspector Bhanudas, alias Anil Jadhav of Mumbai. They are currently lodged in jail under magisterial custody remand (MCR), while Ajay Gopinathan , a resident of Kharghar, Navi Mumbai, was wanted in the case until Wednesday. Jatkar was under ACB radar since the arrest of Shubhavari Gaikwad on January 15, who was caught red-handed accepting a bribe of ₹2.5 lakh. Gaikwad had promised to manage the court’s decision in favour of the complainant identified as Swapnil Madhukar Shevkar, a resident of Induri in Maval taluka. Shevkar who runs a milk dairy in the name ‘Kadjai Mata Dudh Sankalan’, used to supply milk to Amul dairy of Khed. Gaikwad approached him on January 4-5 falsely pretending to be ‘Mhatre Madam’ and told him that there is a criminal case filed against him in the court of the applicant judicial officer. She also showed him a copy of a criminal complaint and pointed out that it was posted for hearing on January 6 and gave him an assurance that the case will be dismissed by the presiding officer if he made a payment of ₹5 lakh. Shevkar showed displeasure after which she reduced the amount to ₹3 lakh. The complainant, therefore, approached the office of ACB on January 6 and filed a complaint, after which a trap was laid leading to her arrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cash-for-judgement-acb-arrests-gaikwad-s-associate-in-bribery-case-101617811707915.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Vaccination camps at workplaces on the cards||Private firms from Pune will soon hold Covid vaccination camps at workplaces, following permission from the government. The programme will be launched from April 11 and all states and union territories have been asked to stay ready with preparations. “I’m very glad to finally see this circular. We have been asking for this for the past few days. Many Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture (MCCIA) members are very keen to launch vaccinations on their premises,” said Prashant Girbane, director general, MCCIA Pune. Around 3,000 companies are associated with the MCCIA of which 200 have already shown an interest in the vaccination camps. The letter from the Central government states, “With support of the state governments/UT administration, the efforts have been to consistently make the vaccination drive more pragmatic and also more acceptable and purposeful to the beneficiaries”. “On similar lines, in order to increase the access of vaccine to these populations, Covid-19 vaccination sessions may be organised at workplaces (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these workplaces with an existing Covid Vaccination Centre (CVC),” the letter states. “We have already shared the first list of such companies with the district administration. We will look forward to working with the district authorities and supporting them in this initiative to vaccinate most company employees at the company premises so that there is more bandwidth available with the district machinery to vaccinate others. Together we shall achieve the goals of wider and speedy vaccination among the eligible ones,” added Girbane. Companies like Bharat Forge, Atlas Copco, Thermax, GE India Industrial Private Limited, ArcelorMittal Nippon Steel India are few firms ready to conduct the vaccination camps. Companies like ADP India have also decided to sponsor the Covid-19 vaccines for all employees. Employees only The letter also states that only employees of the workplace aged 45 years and above will be allowed to take the vaccination. No outsider including eligible family members will be allowed for vaccination at the “CVC at workplace.” Beneficiaries must be registered on the Co-win portal prior to vaccination. CVC nodal officers will ensure registrations of all targeted beneficiaries and on the spot, registrations will also be available but only to employees of the workplace. Vaccination in housing societies Many hosuing societies have been also planning to hold vaccination camps. However, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) is yet to take a decision on the same.In Pune, the PMC allowed Amanora Township to start a vaccination centre on its premises to benefit residents of the area. “During the Covid-19 pandemic everyone is required to wear a mask, maintain social distance and observe hygiene. I also appeal to all citizens above the age of 45 to take advantage of such vaccination drives,” said Chetan Tupe, MLA from Hadapsar during the inauguration of the Covid Vaccination Centre set up by the Pune Municipal Corporation at Amanora Township.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/vaccination-camps-at-workplaces-on-the-cards-101617811527863.html

07-04-2021||Pune||Students of Classes 9, 11 to be promoted without exams||On Wednesday, the Maharashtra state education department announced that students of Classes 9 and 11 will be promoted directly without any examination. Priya Salunkhe, a student of Class 9 from a Pune-based school said that there was a lot of confusion initially, but now she is happy with the decision. “Earlier there was no clarity about the exams. Now that the exams are cancelled, I feel much better. The whole year we have adjusted to online education and with the ongoing confusion on whether the exam will be conducted or not there was a lot of stress. The decision is good. I can now fully focus on class 10 syllabus as it matters more,” said Salunkhe. Amruta Kulkarni, a parent of a Class 9 student said that the school exam timetable was just out. “The students were very anxious and confused because of the uncertainty, but the decision is welcomed. However, I feel at an individual school level, schools should continue taking tests so that the child builds confidence, and the doubts of the student will be clarified. This will also ensure that students know how much they have understood the syllabus as class 9 is important for concepts that are later taught in class 11 but now that the burden of exams are over, students can start focusing on Class 10 and Class 12,” said Kulkarni. Archana Kakade, Pune-based parent whose son is in Class 11 this year said that the colleges have just started, and the first online unit test is scheduled in April. “There is a lot of confusion and especially among Class 11 students. The academic year started late due to the admission process. If it was not for private coaching, my son would have faced a lot of challenges for this year. The syllabus in the coaching was completed fairly quickly and this has helped my son,” said Kakade. She further added that students from other streams like Commerce and Arts are facing a lot of issues. “Class 11 is the base for many important concepts. Now that the burden of exams for this year are over, the child can focus on Class 12th completely and the competitive exams,” said Kakade.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/students-of-classes-9-11-to-be-promoted-without-exams-101617811287870.html
07-04-2021||Other||SGPC writes to Twitter CEO to block hateful tweets against Sikhs||Comparing hateful tweets against Sikhs with the anti-Jew propaganda of the Nazis in Germany, the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) on Wednesday asked Twitter to block handles posting hate speeches against the community.In a letter to the chief executive officer (CEO) of the microblogging and social networking service Jack Dorsey, the gurdwara body president Bibi Jagir Kaur has sought instructions for Twitter’s India-based staff to monitor, flag and remove hateful tweets against Sikhs.She termed the ‘direct and deleterious hate-filled’ tweets against the Sikhs as the result of state farmers’ movement against the three agri-laws that the Centre has passed. Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping on the borders of Delhi since November 26, demanding a repeal of these laws.“Sikh organisations have supported farmers’ movement in India. Since then, there have been a lot of direct and deleterious hate-filled tweets against Sikhs on Twitter. These hate tweets have intensified after the recent resolution passed by the SGPC against the Rashtriya Swayamsewak Sangh (RSS)’s bid to make India a Hindu Rashtra,” Kaur says in the letter.The apex gurdwara management body had passed the resolution last month during its budget session. The resolution had also called upon the Centre to work for the protection of the rights and freedom of religion of all religions instead of being ready to implement RSS’ efforts. In response, BJP national spokesperson RP Singh had said that the SGPC kept raising false bogey of Hindu Rashtra to cover up its failures, especially in terms of the Sikhs embracing Christianity in Punjab.The SGPC chief termed the hate tweets an attempt to create bitterness between Hindus and Sikhs. “At the same time, after the unfortunate incident in Malout with Abohar MLA Arun Narang, there has been an open attempt to create hate against the Sikhs and also bitterness between Hindus and Sikhs,” she said, alleging that calls of repeating 1984 genocide with the Sikhs, calling farmers as terrorists are commonplace on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sgpc-writes-to-twitter-ceo-to-block-hateful-tweets-against-sikhs-101617809188273.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Restriction Day 2 evokes protest from shop owners, traders in Pune||Pune: For the second consecutive day, on Wednesday, shops in commercial areas like Bajirao road and Camp, opened in defiance of the newly imposed strict restrictions on non-essential stores remaining closed in the city. Several non-essential shops opened on Wednesday, and even the police were on the backfoot with no major action taken. The Federation of Trade Association of Pune (FTAP) has given an April 9 ultimatum to the state government to allow the opening of shops, or else, on Friday, all shop owners in Pune will open their shops at 10.30 am. A protest has been planned on Thursday, from 11 am to noon, where traders and shop owners will walk along Laxmi road, from Vijay Talkies to Quartergate chowk. “Due to these new strict restrictions imposed by the state government, traders are very angry, not only in Pune, but across the state. A meeting was held of all the trader associations across Pune district and it was unanimously decided to protest against this injustice. All the shop owners and traders will be protesting on Laxmi road with social distancing and holding banners in hand. On Friday if the new orders are not given, then all non-essential shop owners will open up their shops from 10.30 am till 6 pm,” said Fatechand Ranka, president of the association. Kiran Baheti, a shop owner on Tilak road said, “I cannot afford to keep my shop closed for even a single day, as I am paying ₹30,000 rent per month. Already there is no business and when we were hoping to do some business during the Gudi Padwa festival, these restrictions were imposed.” Pune city BJP party leaders also protested against the new restrictions. BJP MLA Madhuri Misal said, “When we had a meeting with the deputy chief minister last Friday, there was discussion about strict restrictions. Suddenly, after the chief minister’s address, the new norms were declared to close down all shops, which is not right. We protest against it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/restriction-day-2-evokes-protest-from-shop-owners-traders-in-pune-101617809127626.html

Mohol said, “It is true that complaints are coming in, but it is also true that the numbers are busy, which means the staff is attending to some other patient’s call.

07-04-2021||Mumbai||SC to hear pleas of Maharashtra government, Anil Deshmukh against HC order on Thursday||The Supreme Court will on Thursday hear the pleas filed by Maharashtra government and its former home minister Anil Deshmukh who have challenged the Bombay High Court order directing a CBI probe into the allegations of corruption and misconduct levelled against him by former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh.As per the cause list uploaded on the apex court website, both the pleas would come up for hearing on Thursday before a bench comprising Justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta.In its plea filed in the top court, Maharashtra government has questioned the procedure adopted by high court saying the state was heard on question of maintainability of the pleas seeking CBI investigation against Deshmukh on allegation of corruption, and the order too was reserved on that issue, but the court finally ended up directing the probe.After the high court order on April 5, Deshmukh, a veteran politician from Vidarbha, had resigned from the state government.In his appeal filed in the apex court, Deshmukh has said the high court order raises issues of seminal importance which “impact not just the federal structure of the country, impact on our polity, but also the manner in which, and the institutions through which investigations are to be conducted”.He said that without lodging an FIR, the court could have directed that an application be filed before the magistrate for investigation under section 156(3) of the CrPC.“The fact that the court did not direct the petitioners before the court to follow this procedure suggests that the court believed that entire state machinery was untrustworthy; that no investigation could have been made within the state by a state investigating agency, and reposed faith in an outside agency by referring to it as an ‘independent investigating agency’ knowing fully well that its credentials in the past are not such that the court can repose absolute faith in such an agency,” Deshmukh said in his plea.He said that in the annals of judicial history, there has hardly been an occasion when the court has taken the statements made against a sitting minister at face value and proceeded to direct an outside agency, without calling for a response from the minister, to conduct a preliminary inquiry.“That presently, the CBI today is being headed by an interim director, the legality of which is also sub-judice before this court. This also is a factor that should have been taken into account, before the court passed the order that it did”, the plea said.He said the court must have been aware of the fact that the Maharashtra government had withdrawn its consent for the CBI to investigate matters in the territory of the state.The former minister, who has sought ex-parte stay on the high court order said, that since now he has resigned from the post, the state machinery can freely conduct its investigations, and the apprehensions expressed by the high Ccourt contained in the impugned order no longer exist.Dealing with the allegations levelled by Param Bir Singh, Deshmukh said there is not an iota of substantive evidence that is placed before the court to even prima facie establish that any of the allegations made have an element of truth and is “pure hearsay”.Singh, in his plea filed on March 25, had sought a CBI probe against Deshmukh who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Waze, to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants. Deshmukh has denied any wrongdoing.Bombay-based lawyer Jayshree Patil, on whose criminal writ petition the high court had ordered the CBI probe, had on Tuesday filed a caveat in the top court seeking to be heard before any order is passed in the matter.In its 52-page judgement, the high court said Singh's allegations against Deshmukh had put at stake the citizen's faith in the state police.Such allegations, made by a serving police officer, against the state home minister could not be left unattended, and were required to be probed into, if prima facie, they made a case of a cognisable offence, the high court said.The high court's verdict came on three PILs including one filed by Singh and a criminal writ petition filed last month, seeking several reliefs as also a CBI probe into the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/sc-to-hear-pleas-of-maharashtra-government-anil-deshmukh-against-hc-order-on-thursday-101617806881214.html

State urban development minister Eknath Shinde, at a meeting on Tuesday, directed divisional commissioners, district collectors, municipal commissioners and chief executive officers of nagar panchayats and municipal councils, to implement the government order strictly, under the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Bombay Police Act. However, society members allege that the temporary powers could be used to settle scores with opponents and impose unilateral decisions leading to internal fighting. A section of the housing society office-bearers, however, have supported the move and said it would curb the surge in Covid-19 cases. Dhananjay Patil, an resident of Kalpvriksha Housing Society in Narhe, said, “There is no society in the city where there is no clash between society residents and office-bearers. We have seen that in otherwise normal situations, there is always a game of one-upmanship between society members and office-bearers. This power might be misused by society office-bearers and hence, the decision must be rescinded.” Sanjay Sharma, secretary, Tulips and Turnips Society in Yerawada, said, “The decision to empower the chairperson and secretary to keep Covid-19 patients indoors is welcome. It will ensure that residents don’t break the law and follow the health protocols, as it is in the interest of society.” Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA) director Sanjeev Kumar Patil said, “Currently, the residents need to be disciplined as they are violating the protocols and guidelines with impunity.” BJP state vice-president Madhav Bhandari said, “This decision to designate the society chairperson and secretary as special police officers will trigger internal conflicts. Every society member is doing his/her level best to mitigate the crisis. Decisions like this will create tensions and spread misunderstanding in the societies. The Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is shirking away from its responsibility by taking such type of decisions.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/giving-powers-to-housing-society-heads-to-tackle-covid-gets-mixed-response-in-pune-101617804027149.html

Under the pilot initiative, the district jails of Lucknow, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Azamgarh and Chitrakoot besides the central prison at Bareilly are being equipped with high-end gadgets for better security and surveillance, say state home department officials. “The work has started in earnest and we expect the five prisons to get fully ready in around two years’ time,” says additional chief secretary, home, Awanish Kumar Awasthi. “The plan is not just to arm the prisons with high-tech equipment, including a network of CCTV cameras with a central control room, but also to impart special training to jail staff to handle new-age equipment and also arm them with modern weapons needed to undertake their responsibilities effectively,” he added. Some of the equipment being installed in these prisons include non-linear junction detectors (used for detecting hidden electronic items like smart phones etc) besides dual-view baggage scanners, x-ray based full human body scanners, drone cameras to high-end hand-held metal detectors among others. After taking over, CM Yogi Adityanath in 2017 had initiated an exercise to equip prisons in the state with improved mobile phone jammers having proper power back-ups, CCTV cameras and metal detectors to check the activities of criminals who operate their gangs and execute crimes from behind the bars. The decision to transform the five prisons into high-security jails is in line with this very initiative, say the officials privy to the development. For this purpose, the state government has recently sanctioned ₹20.35 crore. In follow-up, UP prison administration and reforms department has already floated e-tenders for procuring dual-view baggage scanners and x-ray based full human body scanners that are to be procured at a cost of around over ₹6.5 crore. “For the staff of these jails also, night vision binoculars and body worn cameras are being procured,” said an official aware of the development. “In these jails, the state government also plans to put up concertina wire fencing (specially designed spiral wire, broadly used for fencing purposes) as well as construct meeting rooms having contactless glass akin to those in prisons in developed countries so as to prevent physical contact with visitors and chances of their passing on a banned item to an inmate,” the official added. “These prisons will also have effective and reliable intercom system, state-of-the-art firefighting capabilities like water mist and CFR fighting systems as well as adequate capacity to stop illegal and banned items from entering the prisons and their search by use of metal detectors and even deep search metal detectors that can detect items buried underground and in walls,” he added.

The huge demand for tests is causing delay in furnishing reports which in some cases is almost 36 hours. While it may not lead to any delay in treatment of critical patients, it delays isolation of Covid positives and asymptomatic patients continuing to spread the infection in the community, according to public health experts. As of March 30, Pune has 36 RT-PCR and 56 RAT (rapid antigen test) laboratories in the district. As per the presentation by the district collector to the chief secretary, government of Maharashtra, the district has conducted 2,839,453 tests, of which 519,600 are positive which takes the positivity rate to 18.3%. Of this RT-PCR has a positivity rate of 19.29% and RAT of 16.73%. The collector in the presentation had highlighted that RT-PCR test capacity for the district needs to be increased as National Institute of Virology (NIV) and other central government labs has reduced their RT-PCR testing for district. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) recently made it mandatory for those in essential services to either get vaccinated or submit a negative RT-PCR report every 15 days. Pallavi Jain, managing director, Krsnaa Diagnostics Ltd, said, “The new restrictions in place in Pune and also the surge in Covid cases are definitely leading to more demand for testing in the city. Since the sample is collected it takes between 18 and 24 hours. Also, we have been strictly asked by the administration to first provide information, including address in case of positive report, to them before sharing it with the patients. Hence, it takes another six hours. In case of critical patients, we alert the hospital. However, until the SMS is not sent through and the detailed address is not in, the sample testing is put on hold which further delays it. Shortage of staff and the cost capping by the government has further added to the delay.” Another private city hospital lab manager said, “We have prioritised home sample collection of those bed ridden or critical patients who cannot visit us. We mostly request suspected patients to visit our nearest branch and submit the samples. We have advance booking for two days for home collection for samples and the reports come in by at least 36 hours. We have 2,200-2,300 samples pending for testing.” Dr HK Sale, executive director of Noble Hospitals, said, “There is definitely a delay in submitting reports. In case of critical patients based on the HRCT (high-resolution computed tomography) we decide the treatment line without awaiting the report. However, in case of asymptomatic or those with mild symptoms, if the results come in late then they continue to spread the infection and the chain of infection continues to grow.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/rise-in-testing-count-delays-rt-pcr-reports-by-up-to-36-hours-leading-to-possible-spread-of-infection-in-pune-101617801746740.html

The main accused, Pravin Jha, is suspected to be the force behind a newly-formed private army named ‘Ravan Sena’, made up of upper caste ‘Maithil Brahmins’ in the region.Opposition Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) has alleged that Jha has links with former minister and BJP MLA from Benipatti, Binod Narayan Jha. “The BJP MLA has close links with Pravin Jha. The family of the deceased, locals have all vouched for it. Police should look into the call details of the BJP MLA and a fair investigation should be conducted,” Tejashwi Prasad Yadav, leader of the opposition, said in Patna on Wednesday.However, the BJP MLA has denied any link in a video message in circulation on social media.On the day of Holi, more than 50 armed men opened fire on members of Ranvijay Singh’s family, which was involved in a dispute between Muhammadpur and Gebipur villages over fishing from a pond. In the gang war like attack, Ranvijay Singh and his cousin brother Virendra Singh were killed on the spot. Three other family members -- Rana Pratap Singh (a BSF officer), Amrendra Singh (a cricketer) and Rudra Narayan Singh succumbed to their injuries a day later. Another injured person, Manoj Singh, was currently admitted to the Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital.Family members of the deceased staged a protest demanding a CBI probe into the killings and threatened to die by suicide before the chief minister’s residence if the accused, named in their complaint, were not arrested within four days.Preliminary investigation suggested that the pond was owned by one Sanjay Singh (brother of Ranvijay), but another group from Gebipur wanted to capture it. On November 20, two separate cases were lodged by Sanjay and Mukesh Safi (a close associate of Pravin Jha), which led to Sanjay getting jailed.Additional director general (ADG) headquarters, Jitendra Kumar confirmed that the prime accused were arrested by a Special Investigation Team (SIT) led by Madhubani superintendent of police (SP) Dr Satya Prakash, who, acting on a tip-off, raided a house at Raghauni village, situated on Madhubani-Darbhanga border, falling under Bisfi police station and arrested four accused identified as Pravin Jha alias Ravan, Chandan Jha, Mukesh Safi, Bhola Singh and the house owner, for giving them shelter. A police post was also set up in the village to prevent any untoward incident.Darbhanga range IG Ajitabh Kumar told HT that the massacre was the result of a fight for supremacy between two groups and not two castes. “A case has been lodged against 35 persons and dozens of unidentified accused. 14 named accused have been arrested while property of one of the chief accused, Navin Jha, who is still absconding, has been attached,” said a police officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/madhubani-massacre-case-main-accused-arrested-links-with-bjp-mla-alleged-101617801207370.html

07-04-2021||Kolkata||'Was cornered in TMC for resisting cut money culture...': Rajib Banerjee||Former minister Rajib Banerjee, considered to be one of BJP's prized scalps in its quest to assume power in Bengal, alleged that he was relegated in the TMC for opposing "cut money culture" and had to face "step-motherly" treatment throughout his second term, which ultimately prompted him to sever ties with the ruling party.Banerjee also mocked the Trinamool Congress government for promoting the state's numero uno position in implementation of the MGNREGA, contending that the distinction is testimony of the lack of jobs for the youth of West Bengal.Click here for full election coverageThe former forest minister, once a key figure in the Trinamool Congress, said he had considered retiring from active politics, but took up the challenge to contest in the assembly elections with the hope that the BJP will usher in a new era of development in the state.Banerjee, 51, who switched over to the saffron camp in January, is vying for a third term from the Domjur constituency, where he has won twice as a TMC candidate since 2011.Referring to his "bitter experiences" in the Backward Classes Welfare Department, Banerjee said he had once received a complaint of irregularity in distribution of cycles among students under the 'Sabuj Sathi' project, and flagged it to the chief minister's office."The result of pointing this out was I was removed from the department, as I tried to put an end to the cut money culture," the former Backward Classes Welfare Department Minister told PTI in an interview on the sidelines of hectic campaiging.Accusing the TMC dispensation of not clearing files for development projects for his constituency, Banerjee claimed that he was shunted out of every ministry that he headed whenever he tried to come in the way of vested interests of a section of senior officials and party members."I had worked hard to get the nod for drinking water projects in Domjur, but then, a ₹33-crore proposal for free water connection to households was not approved. The local TMC administration is now demanding money from people to go ahead with it. I wanted to execute the project without charging a penny," he said.Attacking the TMC government over its "failure" to create job opportunities, Banerjee sought to punch a hole in the ruling party's poll plank of securing the the top spot for implementation of the 100-day rural job scheme, declaring it as "a reflection of West Bengal, a failed state"."There are over 5.5 lakh vacancies in state government departments, and no efforts were made to recruit people for the posts. Instead, the TMC dispensation hired a few thousand contractual workers."People do not have jobs, and that is why they sought work under the MGNRGA scheme. Youths are leaving the state," Banerjee, who holds an MBA degree, said.Asked about allegations that he enjoyed all the power and perks of his position before ditching the TMC prior to the elections, the former Irrigation Minister said people of the constituency are well aware of his development work in the area."Let the TMC leaders say whatever they want. People will decide on April 10 (the day of polling in Domjur)... I know they will not disappoint me, said Banerjee, who is believed to have considerable influence in several seats of Howrah district.The TMC turncoat, however, maintained that he has immense respect for TMC supremo and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, and had to desert the party with a heavy heart as he was cornered."Unfortunately, I was not allowed to work independently in the second term and sidelined in the party. I had to face personal attacks for airing grievances against a section of top leaders."I was also meted out a step-motherly treatment ever since winning from the constituency with more than one lakh votes for a second term in 2016," he claimed.Banerjee also took a swipe at TMC's 'khela habe' (game will happen) poll slogan, insisting that such a discourse by the ruling party shows it has become politically bankrupt.Attired in a traditional 'kurta pyajama', Banerjee, the nephew of former state minister in the Congress government Mritunjay Banerjee, has been traversing the length and breadth of Domjur, around 16 km from Kolkata, exuding confidence of a hat-trick win.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/was-cornered-in-tmc-for-resisting-cut-money-culture-rajib-banerjee-101617796283227.html

07-04-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: Islamic powers conquer Deccan, Sufism arrives in Pune||The 13th century symbolises a vital change in the socio-political and cultural environment of Deccan, so much so that it was named as the Islamic or medieval period by colonial historians. In 1296, Ala-ud-din Khalji of the Delhi Sultanate successfully raided Devagiri. Khalji restored it to Ramachandra in return of his promise of payment of a high ransom and an annual tribute. However, this was not paid and the Yadava kingdom’s arrears to Khalji kept mounting. In 1307, Khalji sent an army commanded by Malik Kafur, accompanied by Khwaja Haji, to Devagiri. Their huge army conquered the weakened and defeated forces of Devagiri almost without a battle. Khalji reinstated Ramachandra as governor in return for a promise to help him subdue the Hindu kingdoms in South India. Ramachandra’s successor Simhana III challenged the supremacy of Khalji, who sent Malik Kafur to recapture Devagiri in 1313. Simhana III was killed in the ensuing battle and Khalji’s army occupied Devagiri. Thus, the mighty Yadava Empire was completely annexed by the Khalji sultanate in 1317. Malik Kafur conquered most parts of Maharashtra, including Pune, thus bringing the significant Deccan territory under Islamic rule.In the year 1320s, the Tughluq Dynasty occupied the Delhi throne and shortly after in 1327, Muhammad bin Tughluq’s shifted his capital from Delhi to Deogiri.This period was the most productive period in the work and ideology of the early Sufi Shaikhs, who also became the guiding factor for later mystics and rulers.Propagation of the Sufi sect in Deccan was greatly supported by spread of political powers. It was around the same time, mysticism movement in Islam in the form of Sufism started growing and many Sufi saints travelled with their disciples for propagation of the sect. The devotional mysticism of the Bhakti movement in Deccan provided an ideological overlap with the Sufism, which led to syncretic practices accepted by Dakkhanis.Deccan provinces provided fertile grounds for development of medicine, astrology and trade, some of the primary Sufi interests. It was during this time, Shaikh Nizamuddin Avaliya with his 700 followers descended south to propagate the Sufi sect. One of his followers, Sheikh Sallauddin Gazi Chisti, alias Sheikh Salla (son of Sheikh Abdulla of Ghor), came down to Pune with his four followers from the Middle East and settled on the banks of the river Mutha near present day Shaniwar peth. Pune Pet Kafiyat, a Maratha period manuscript discovered by Dr Uday Kulkarni documents a rather peculiar tale related to Shaikh Sallauddin. The saint Sallauddin was camping in the Masjid gardens (now absent) near Kumbhar Ves. The Saint performed the miracle of raising the dead bullocks belonging to the grief-stricken gardener of the temple named Divekar. The delighted gardener informed the keeper of the fort Kondhana (then Sinhagad), Annaji Shirke about the astonishing miracle and invited him to visit Shaikh Avaliya. Ailing son and limbless daughter of Annaji were healed completely by Shaikh Avaliya’s touch and recitation of verses. This incident helped build the trust of locals in the immigrant group of Sufis. Shaikh Sallauddin’s death in the year 1358 was commemorated by his followers by forcibly converting the Yadav period Narayaneshwar temple into his memorial dargah.This dargah lies to the left of Shaniwanwada, along the river Mutha, and is popularly known as Thorla (senior) Shaikh Salla Dargah. When the temple of Narayaneshwar was demolished, the Vedic Brahmin priest of the temple Shyambhat Rajarshi (Kulkarnis of Pune) converted to the Islamic faith and became disciples of Shaikh Salla Avaliya. He requested his teacher to grant him religious rights as per Islam and Avaliya arranged for him to be appointed as Kazi of the town of Pune. The Kazi of Pune and Pirjadye of the Shaikh Salla dargah are the successors of Shyam Bhat. Further, Shyam Bhat was conferred Inam of Mauje Erandwane and Mauje Kalas villages for the management of the Sheikh Salla Dargah. The main tomb, which has a plain doorway, is approached by a flight of steps. The space inside is very uneven and is now a regular burial ground with numerous graves around the central tomb, which is a circular domed room. The ruins of the original Yadava period Narayaneshwar temple are still scattered about to the south-west of Sheikh Salla’s tomb. They consist chiefly of stone columns and lintels, some in their places and others strewn over the ground. A few years later, Sayyad Hisamuddin Kattal Zanjani (a religious advocate belonging to the sect of Makhdum Mit Ashraf Samnani), came to Pune and settled on its banks near Kumbhar Ves. Saint Hisamuddin died in 1390. Punyeshwar Temple on the banks of Mutha near Kumbharwada was brought down and converted into the memorial dargah of Shaikh Hisamuddin. This led the fleeing of priest of Punyeshwar with the Shiv-linga to the base of Purandar fort.Behind the mosque, a flight of steps lead from Punyeshwar’s temple to the river bed. Pillars of this temple match the pillars of Kasba Ganpati temple. In the front courtyard to the left is a tiled building where a bier or tabut is kept and where congregations are held for prayer.The domed structure on the tomb was added later. It is the second oldest dargah in Pune built after Thorla Shaikh Sallah Durgah. The campus of Dhakta Shaikh Salla also houses the memorial of Mohiul–milaat the grandson of Aurangzeb Badshah, son of Kambaksh. Aurangzeb was in Pune in 1702 during his south Indian campaign. Aurangzeb had named the city of Pune as Muhiyabad, in his own name; Muhi-ud-Din or to commemorate his grandson, Muhi-us- Sunnat, according to some scholars.Apart from the mosques’ religious significance, they have great historical and architectural importance and are a designated protected heritage site.

07-04-2021||Delhi||Night curfew to contain Covid-19 spike, puts wedding celebrations in crisis||One would imagine ticking off the last-minute wedding tasks, preparing for the celebrations for their big day but couples planning to tie the knot this month are in a bind following the imposition of night curfew from 10pm to 5am in Delhi and 8pm to 7am in Mumbai, to stem Covid-19 in both cities.While some have decided to postpone the date again, others are weighing alternate solutions, with day weddings being touted as one. “The moment it was announced, we received a call from the venue to move the function to the day, but it might be difficult,” says Saurabh Aswal, an IT professional who is getting married on April 25.  Another groom-to-be, Akhil Narang, a businessman, shares, “It is a state of chaos. The date is so near and the venues are saying they need to check the availability for day timings. We have already given ‘minimum guarantee’ to the venues but now with the option of day function, they’re not willing to reduce the cost. They need to understand that not all the guests will be able to attend in day time.”It is proving to be an equal drawback for couples who decided to skip the wedding venues in the Capital due to a cap on maximum guests to 100 and 200 and opted for venues in NCR, as now commuting and returning before the curfew timings may be of a concern. For Abhishek Pateria, a research scholar, who took two months off from his work in Poland for his wedding and booked a venue in Surajkund, Haryana, changes will be tough. “There’s no chance of postponing as I have to fly back or even switching to day functions due to shubh muhurat. It will be difficult for guests who will attend the wedding all the way from Delhi or Noida,” he says. Over the last year, wedding venues have started to observe the change in preferences of couples due to pandemic. Shivan Gupta , creative director, Amaara Farms says, “We have been receiving queries from couples for a brunch or moving towards day weddings, and also noticing the conscious efforts from our clients to keep their gathering intimate.”Not just the couples and venues but other wedding vendors such as planners and photographers are in conflict as well about last-minute refunds, cancellations and postponement challenges. Vishal Punjabi, founder and director, The Wedding Filmer, says, “There have been a few cancellations because family members have contracted Covid-19.” However, he feels that when things like this happen, it teaches us to value what we have. “Now isn’t the time to party and a wedding doesn’t have to be a big party,” he adds.As couples are navigating through the challenges to find an alternate solution, “They are taking suggestions to navigate the best possible ways to go ahead since so many vendors are involved. It has a lead to a lot of chaos and disturbance in the planning done so far. Due to very limited auspicious dates this year, the clients are not too convinced with the idea of even postponing the weddings,” says cinematographer Ritin Kumar, director and head storyteller, Cinelove Productions. Another wedding photographer, Amrit Arora, founder, The Wedding Files, shares, “I do have 6-7 weddings in Delhi for April. As of now, none of our clients called it off but one of them called to inform that they are planning to shift it to day wedding now. There were 2-3 queries which were going on and we were expecting them to get close but now they put it on hold.”For planners, the months put into planning and organising a wedding have gone down the drain. Aanchal Bagaria, co-founder, The Wedding Soul who had weddings scheduled in April with three-day affairs, says, “Now it’s all wrapped up to one single wedding to an afternoon lunch. Either couples are all together pushing dates to November, or opting for a sundowner wedding from 4-7pm. All our efforts and months of planning have gone in vain but have to face the fact.” She also states even for the month of May, weddings are uncertain as venues are not taking up bookings for large numbers. Wedding planners, Kaveri Vij and Akshay Chopra of Designer Events Inc. feels it is a recap of the last year as Vij says, “Just when we thought things have started to normalise, this comes a shocker. We are still hoping and keeping our fingers crossed that we do survive this. Few days before any wedding are the most hectic for us and we literally burn midnight oil to complete all the tasks at hand.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/night-curfew-to-contain-covid-19-spike-puts-wedding-celebrations-in-crisis-101617788790675.html
07-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab bans political gatherings, extends night curfew till April 30||As Covid cases continue to remain high in the state, Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Wednesday ordered a total ban on political gatherings till April 30 and said that violators, including political leaders, will be booked under the Disaster Management and Epidemics Act. The chief minister also announced extension of night curfew from 9pm to 5am, which hitherto was imposed in 12 districts, to the entire state and reduced the number of attendees at funeral/cremations/weddings to 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors. Wearing masks has been made mandatory for all government employees while in office. Also read: What is driving India’s second Covid-19 wave?Schools stay closed, but relief for shop owners in malls These restrictions, coupled with the ones imposed earlier, which include the closure of schools and educational institutions, shall remain effective till April 30. However, there was some respite for shop owners in malls, as the entry of 10 people in a shop at any given time has been allowed, as against the earlier order of not allowing more than 100 people in a mall at one time. This would imply that 200 people will be allowed in a mall with 20 shops at any given time. In his weekly review of the Covid situation, the chief minister expressed concern at the high positivity and mortality rates in the state. He said it was matter of concern that over 85% of cases in Punjab are of the UK strain, which is more contagious and virulent. He said he had no option but to go in for stricter measures to further control the surge, even though the number of positive cases had somewhat stabilised in the last few days due to curbs imposed earlier. He said he had been forced to order a ban on political gatherings, as his pleas to all parties to refrain from organising such events had been ignored, despite the fact that the Congress had unilaterally announced its decision of not holding any rallies or public meetings last month. Amarinder guns for rallies by Kejriwal, Sukhbir Expressing surprise at the behaviour of certain political leaders, including Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and Shiromani Akali Dal president Sukhbir Singh Badal, who had been attending political rallies without following safety protocols, the chief minister said such irresponsible conduct doesn’t behove them. “How do you expect people to be serious about the spread of the disease if senior political leaders behave like this?” he said, adding that his government would need to be tough to tackle such violations and political leaders would also need to be booked. He ordered the police and the district administrations to register cases against political leaders, organisers and participants of such gatherings under the DMA and Epidemics Act, besides booking the owners of the tent houses, who provide the infrastructure for such gatherings. He said even the venue owners, who would provide space for such events, will not be spared and they would be booked, and their venues sealed for three months. No social, cultural or sports gatherings allowed He said that no social, cultural or sports gatherings and related functions will be allowed till April 30. In-person public dealing shall be restricted in all government offices and online and virtual modes for grievance redressal shall be encouraged. All government employees will need to compulsorily wear a mask while attending office. Capt Amarinder Singh said restrictions of running cinema houses at 50% of their capacity and the closure of schools and educational institutions, except medical and nursing colleges, shall continue till April 30. The chief minister directed Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta to ensure strict implementation of the night curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-bans-political-gatherings-extends-night-curfew-till-april-30-101617788188351.html

07-04-2021||Bangalore||RTC strike: Decision on invoking ESMA depending on situation, says Karnataka CM||With bus services being hit across the state, due to the strike by road transport corporations employees, Karnataka Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa on Wednesday indicated that a decision on invoking Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA) will be taken depending on the situation. Pointing out that the public were inconvenienced, he called on striking employees to get back to work. The CM also alleged that "selfish motives" of some people were behind the strike. "We have fulfilled 8 of their (workers) nine demands, despite this they are adamant and have stopped buses, and are creating trouble for the public. I appeal to them, get back to work, we can talk," Yediyurappa said. Speaking to reporters here, he said the government has agreed for an 8 per cent increase in salary as an interim relief, but it cannot be implemented immediately as the model code of conduct is in place and a letter has been sent to the Election Commission seeking permission. "Though we have made alternate arrangements with the help of private operators, still they (RTC workers) going for a strike, which is wrong... they should not give room for us to take strict measures and cooperate," he added. Workers of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) and North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC), under the banner of Karnataka State Road Transport Employees League, have given a call for strike from April 7. The protest is against the government's "failure" to implement a salary under the 6th Pay Commission for the RTC workers. Alleging that despite knowing the reality some people were behind the strike for their "selfish motive", Yediyurappa said we will wait and see today and tomorrow and take strict action depending on the situation. Asked if the government will invoke Essential Services Maintenance Act (ESMA), he said, "we are discussing everything, depending on the situation, we will take appropriate decisions." The employees' league has decided to go ahead with the strike, despite the government warning of strict action and ruling out any negotiations with them. The government had also made clear that the implementation of the 6th pay commission for transport workers was not possible, but has agreed for an 8 per cent increase in salary as an interim relief. Responding to a question on complaints regarding private services including buses, autos and cabs charging exorbitantly, the CM said strict instructions have been given in this regard and on receiving any complaint action will be taken. "I appeal to them (private operators) not to charge exorbitantly taking advantage of the situation.. we will not allow it," he said. Deputy Chief Minister Laxman Savadi, who holds the Transport portfolio too said despite the government stating that it was ready for pay hike after permission from the election commission, some people have intentionally pushed for strike. "I wont say those behind it are from political parties or others, it will be known in the days to come.." he said without revealing much. The DCM said some buses are operating and their numbers will increase in all the four corporations in two days. "Private buses are being provided facilities at our bus terminals to operate from. They have been allowed to operate without permit, but with insurance for the convenience of the passengers. In two days we will increase their numbers and from tomorrow about 4,000 private buses, those who have surrendered permits, will operate" he added. Appealing to employees to get back to work, Savadi said income has completely stopped. "It will be difficult to pay salary in the days to come, as long as you continue the strike it will harm you.."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/rtc-strike-decision-on-invoking-esma-depending-on-situation-says-karnataka-cm-101617786755627.html

The court of district and session judge Manoj Kumar Singh also imposed a fine of ₹1.5 lakh on each convict on Tuesday.The case dates back to September 21, 2016, when a Railway Protection Force (RPF) team nabbed the four women -- Ruby Devi alias Shakuntala, a resident of Raxaul; Sangita Devi alias Bagad, a resident of Turkaulia; Pinki Devi alias Sunaina and Rita Devi alias Baby, both from Banjaria, from a general compartment of Satyagrah Express at Narkatiaganj railway station.According to the special public prosecutor, Suresh Kumar, the RPF team got intelligence input from the 44th battalion of Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB) that four women were travelling in the train with banned drugs. The suspects were bringing narcotics from Nepal hidden in six bags. The RPF team, with the help of the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), seized over 31kg of opioid from their possession.All the four women were arrested after they could not produce any licence or permit for carrying the contraband and a case under the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered against them.The 1,751-km border with Nepal is notorious for smuggling drugs, weapons and fertilizers, besides human trafficking, data showed.

Bathinda and adjoining districts also got mild rainfall after the high-velocity wind. It’s the second spell of rough weather in a fortnight when the semi-arid region has faced untimely rains and gusty winds. Also read: Punjab sets up 3,700 mandis for procuring wheat amid Covid surgeFarm experts say irrigated wheat fields, or the late sown varieties are likely to face maximum damage. According to Punjab Agricultural University’s observatory at the Bathinda-based regional research centre, south Malwa witnessed winds with a velocity of up to 92.6 kmph on Tuesday evening. The winds damaged vegetable and mustard crops in the final stage of harvest. Ripened wheat not prone to damage: Expert Mansa chief agriculture officer Manjit Singh said ripened wheat plants lose weight and they are not prone to much damage despite strong winds. Preliminary inputs don’t suggest any major crop loss due to the storm, he said. “Major rabi crop of the region is in the last phase of maturity and no widespread damage is expected from the thunderstorm. Field staff has been deployed to assess the extent of the crop damage,” he said. May delay harvest but not expected to hit yield Farmer Budh Singh of Bibiwala village in Bathinda’s periphery said the storm caused lodging of up to 60% of his wheat field on Tuesday night. Gurjit Romana, a farmer from Danewala Satkosi village near Abohar in Fazilka district, said the dust storm lasted for 40 minutes. “Kinnow orchards were worst hit, while lodging of mustard plants occurred,” he said. Balwinder Tikka, a progressive farmer from Malout in Muktsar district, said waterlogging in the low-lying fields will delay the wheat harvest. “The crop has been flattened in several areas though eventually a bumper yield is expected,” he said, adding that the inclement weather at this stage is a concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/thunderstorm-in-south-punjab-leaves-wheat-growers-worried-101617779784522.html

07-04-2021||Delhi||Private car is a public place, masks mandatory even when driving alone: Delhi HC||It is compulsory for people to wear a mask in a private vehicle even if they are driving alone, the Delhi High Court ordered on Wednesday, ruling that a private vehicle on the roads is also covered under the definition of a public place.The high court also chided four lawyers who petitioned the high court last year against fines imposed by the Delhi Police for violating the mask rule, observing that compliance by lawyers encourages common people also to wear the masks needed to curb the spread of the coronavirus disease.Justice Prathiba M Singh said a private vehicle on the road is a public place and it is mandatory to wear a mask even when one is travelling alone in the car. “A mask acts as a suraksha kavach (protective shield) which would prevent the spread of the deadly virus,” the high court said, recalling that several experts, doctors and researchers have emphasised on the need to wear face masks right from the early days of the pandemic.Saurabh Sharma, a lawyer who was fined ₹500 for not wearing a mask last year, had challenged the penalty in his petition filed in September last year. Sharma said the officers who imposed the fine had failed to provide any executive order to establish that it was mandatory to wear masks while travelling alone in a private vehicle.Sharma’s petition echoed a view that had been articulated by many people on and off social media who argued that people should be allowed to take off their masks when driving alone.The central government, which had first made it compulsory for people to wear masks in public places in April last year, did not take a stand and left it to state governments to see how they wanted to implement the rule. Residents of the national capital, however, have reservations about the high court ruling.BS Vohra, president of East Delhi’s joint RWA forum, said the decision was “not fair”. “We have no option other than to obey the court order. But I think wearing a mask while driving a car with all windows closed should not be made mandatory. When all windows of a car are closed and the person is in the vehicle then it is a private environment. The court should also take cognisance of political rallies and protests where hardly anyone is seen wearing masks or following social distancing norms,” Vohra said.Sanjay Rana, president of Greater Kailash-2 RWA, echoed Vohra’s statement, and said, “I feel that masks should be mandatory when a person is driving alone with the windows open; but if all windowpanes are closed and the driver is alone in the car, then there should be no such compulsion. The court  should do something about crowding in markets and other public places as it poses more danger than a single man driving a car.”A day before Saurabh Sharma filed his petition, the Chandigarh administration told police personnel to stop prosecuting people for not wearing masks if they are alone in the car.In this case, the Delhi government supported the prosecution of the lawyers during proceedings in the high court.It is not clear if the Delhi high court’s ruling would persuade other states to review their stand on this issue.Political parties seem to have opposing views on the ruling. Mudit Aggrawal, vice-president of Delhi Pradesh Congress Committee, said, “I would urge the court to reconsider their decision… This would lead to unnecessary harassment and corruption without any actual benefits in controlling Covid-19 cases.” He added that by this logic, people must wear masks even at home especially if the door and windows are open.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), however, welcomed the decision.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “We support the court’s ruling. We have even run mask and sanitiser distribution campaigns. We call upon our workers to encourage use of masks by distributing them wherever they are needed.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/private-car-is-a-public-place-masks-mandatory-even-when-driving-alone-delhi-hc-101617775284405.html
07-04-2021||Mumbai||CBI may record Param Bir Singh’s statement in Bombay HC-directed inquiry today||A six-member team of the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which arrived in Mumbai from Delhi on Tuesday, is expected to record the statement of former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in the preliminary inquiry ordered by the Bombay high court on April 5. The high court had ordered the inquiry based on a petition filed by city-based lawyer Dr Jaishri Patil seeking a probe into Singh’s allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh in his March 20 letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Dr Patil had approached the high court after the Malabar Hill police failed to take cognizance of her March 21 letter seeking the registration of an FIR against Deshmukh. Dr Patil, in her petition, not only sought directions to the Malabar Hill police station to register an offence but also sought a CBI probe into the allegations. Also Read | Deshmukh, Maha govt move SC against high court’s order for CBI probeThe bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni in its 52-page order delivered on April 5 observed that as the police force was under home minister Deshmukh there could not be an unfair, impartial and unbiased inquiry and hence directed the CBI to conduct a preliminary inquiry within 15 days. The court, however, restrained the CBI from registering an FIR based on Dr Patil’s complaint. The court also left it to the discretion of the director of CBI to decide on the further course of action after the preliminary inquiry. After arriving in Mumbai on Tuesday, the CBI registered a preliminary inquiry and is expected to start recording the statements of Singh and other officers mentioned by Singh in his allegations. The statement of Dr Patil will also be recorded by the six CBI officers. The high court noted that it could not remain a “mute spectator” to the complaints received against high-level officers and ruled, “It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of state machinery, which would stare at face when confronted with the expectations of law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials. This court cannot be a mute spectator in these circumstances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/cbi-may-record-param-bir-singh-s-statement-in-bombay-hc-directed-inquiry-today-101617770124242.html
07-04-2021||Patna||Lone Lok Janshakti Party MLA Raj Kumar Singh joins JD(U) in Bihar||In another setback to the Lok Janshakti Party (LJP), its only member of legislative assembly in Bihar, Raj Kumar Singh, joined the Janata Dal United JD(U) on Tuesday in presence of chief minister Nitish Kumar. Earlier in February, the party’s only member of legislative council (MLC), Nutan Singh joined the BJP. Now, the LJP has no representation left in the state legislature. Raj Kumar Singh, an MLA from Matihani constituency in Begusarai district, was served a show cause notice by the LJP last month for voting in favour of the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) candidate for the post of deputy Speaker. The switch comes in the backdrop of the assembly campaign in the run up to November 2020 assembly elections, which saw the LJP continuously target the JD(U) and chief minister Nitish Kumar, while being friendly to the BJP, which was in alliance with the JD(U) in the state. Though the LJP only won a single seat, the party’s 143 candidates badly hurt JD(U) candidates’ prospects on many seats, analysts say. Chirag Paswan-led LJP has seen heavy defection with over 200 party leaders and office bearers joining the JD(U) recently. Singh first sparked speculations of jumping the ship to the JD(U), following his meeting with the chief minister and a state minister last month.The LJP was founded in the year 2000 by former Union minister and Dalit icon Ram Vilas Paswan, who died on October 8, 2020 ahead of assembly elections in Bihar. Under senior Paswan, the party won 29 assembly seats in the 2005 Bihar assembly polls and emerged as a major force in the state. However, it saw a continuous decline ever since as its number of MLAs came down to 10 a few months later in 2006, when elections were held again in the state. In 2010 elections, the party could only win 3 seats. Later, in 2014 general elections, it won 6 of the 7 Lok Sabha seats it contested in alliance with the BJP. However, in assembly elections held a year later, it could only win two seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lone-lok-janshakti-party-mla-raj-kumar-singh-joins-jd-u-in-bihar-101617768444228.html

If a housing society is found flouting the rules several times, they will have to pay ₹20,000 for the consecutive time.In the second wave of the pandemic, slums and chawls are reporting fewer cases than residential buildings in Mumbai. According to BMC's April 6 data (which has details till April 5), there are 73 active containment zones in the city, which includes slums and chawls, while 740 buildings remain sealed. The number of containment zones in the city is likely to go up as the civic body has decided to create micro containment zones consisting of one housing society having more than five active Covid-19 cases.The KW ward has the 196 actively sealed buildings, the highest in the city, followed by the D ward which has 116 sealed buildings.According to the new rules in the wake of the second wave of the pandemic, police personnel will be deployed at the entry gate of sealed buildings and no visitors will be allowed at the society which has more than five active Covid-19 cases. The housing societies will have to put up a board outside their gates informing visitors about the Covid-19 cases in their premises.Delivery of essential items will also not be allowed to flats falling in such micro-containment zones. Delivery will have to be made at housing society offices. To go out of the housing premises, for emergency, individuals of such micro-containment zones will need the permission of the society authorities and the police deployed at the gate.On Tuesday, Mumbai recorded 10,040 new cases. Maharashtra, on the other hand, reported 55,469 fresh Covid-19 cases.

07-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi Covid cases cross 5,000-mark for first time since November 27||The Covid graph in the city continued its steep upward climb on Tuesday, with the number of daily cases breaching 5,000-mark — first time since November-end. The city on Tuesday recorded 5,100 new cases and 17 deaths due to the viral infection, even as it set a new record for daily tests.The increase in cases has been sharper during the “fourth wave” – as the Delhi government refers to the current surge, with the numbers rising from under 1,000 to over 5,000 in just 15 days..Experts, however, say this is the second spike that the city is witnessing.Despite the high number of cases, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – remained below 5% due to the high number of tests conducted. The city reported a positivity rate of 4.93% on Tuesday, with 103,453 test having been conducted the previous day, as per the health bulletin. Tuesday was the first time the city has seen over 100,000 tests in a day.“The number of cases has definitely gone up faster this time around. This is because many people who are positive are moving around and restaurants and gyms are open. Normally, there is a surge in cases within 60 to 100 days of easing of restrictions. This is the natural behaviour of the virus. And, this is likely to continue till April or maybe May,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. He headed Delhi government’s first committee on control and management of Covid-19 cases.He added that the number of cases this time might even cross the record of daily cases set during the “third” peak of November. On November 11, Delhi had reported 8,593 cases, the highest till date for the city.In addition to the night curfew, Sarin said that studies have shown that the restaurants should only offer outdoor seating or give takeaways.“Restaurants and bars lead to the spread of the infection; you have to remove your mask if you have to eat or drink. An interesting study from the Columbia district in Washington DC showed that when restaurants were opened up after following strict masking norms, the number of cases increased 10-fold and number of deaths five-fold in 100 days,” he said.The experts said that asymptomatic transmission was a major cause of concern during the current surge. “It has now been established that nearly 60% of the transmission can happen from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Targeting only those with symptoms, such as fever, is not good enough. We need to trace more contacts and quarantine them,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.He added, “The pool of people transmitting silently will only increase as more and more people get vaccinated. This is because those who receive even one shot of the vaccine get some amount of immunity and are likely to have milder symptoms. They are also likely to not get tested and hence transmit it on to others.”Dr Sarin agreed, adding, “The antibodies which form after an infection or immunisation are almost same. And, over 50% of Delhi’s population is seropositive. They are moving around and if they get the infection, and they can, they will have mild symptoms and may pass on the infection to others.”Both experts said that there is a need to increase vaccinations. With the Centre opening up vaccination for everyone over the age of 45 years, Delhi’s drive has also picked up pace. A record 87,678 doses were administered on Monday, of which 73% were given at government facilities, said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain.As per provisional reports, 74,642 doses were administered on Tuesday. This comes a day after the government announced that at least one-third of the vaccination centres in 33 Delhi government hospitals will run 24x7 Tuesday onwards.“Around 95% of the total slots in government centres were utilised as compared to 67% in private hospitals. The trend was the opposite initially when the vaccination drive had begun. However, people are now happy with the facilities in government centres and are coming there,” said Jain. So far, 1.38 million persons in Delhi have been administered at least one shot of the vaccine.Meanwhile, the cases increase, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has stopped walk-in registrations at its out-patient clinics which had been restarted in December. “To optimise diversion of available manpower and material resources … Covid-19 disease, it has been decided to temporarily close down routine walk-in OPD,” read an order from the medical superintendent of the hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-covid-cases-cross-5-000-mark-for-first-time-since-november-27-101617764044822.html

Data from Central Pollution Control Board showed that the hourly air quality index (AQI) at 7 am stood at 286. On Tuesday, the average 24-hour AQI was 279, which is in the higher-end of the poor category.Also Read | India saw third warmest March in 121 years: IMDAn AQI between zero and 50 is considered "good", 51 and 100 "satisfactory", 101 and 200 "moderate", 201 and 300 "poor", 301 and 400 "very poor", and 401 and 500 "severe".On Tuesday, Union ministry of earth science’s air quality monitoring centre, System of Air Quality and Weather Forecasting and Research (Safar) said, “The overall Delhi air quality is in the Moderate category with PM10 continuing as the lead pollutant due to dominance of dust lifting under dry and warmer environments. Surface wind speeds are moderate and east north-easterly. A marginal increase in dust long-range transport is expected today [Tuesday] and tomorrow [Wednesday].

07-04-2021||Delhi||Starting today, night curfew in Delhi from 10 pm to 5 am amid rising Covid cases||The Delhi government on Tuesday clamped a curfew on movement and assembly of people between 10pm and 5am every day until April 30, in an attempt to arrest spiking infections, mirroring similar restrictions in other major cities such as Mumbai reeling under the second wave of Covid-19 cases.Government officials, essential workers, those travelling to and from airports, railway stations, interstate bus terminals, Covid-19 vaccination centres or hospitals will be exempt from the seven-hour night curfew. All restaurants, markets, wedding halls, pubs and commercial establishments will have to now close by 10pm, but home delivery of food and other items will be allowed, said a senior government official.The night curfew is the first restriction imposed by the government in the Capital, where the rate of new cases has jumped 130% in just the past week. On Tuesday, the city recorded 5,100 cases and 17 deaths, the highest since November 27. The Capital also conducted more than 100,000 tests for the first time since the pandemic hit the country last March.Experts are divided, however, over the efficiency of night curfews in curbing infections, especially in the absence of any other curbs.“The trend needs to be monitored, and we are keeping a close watch on it. Currently, the positivity rate has crossed the 5% mark for the entire country. However, in Delhi, we are completely alert and are being cautious,” said health minister Satyender Jain.On Tuesday, largely on account of the increasing testing, the positivity rate — a measure of positive cases to total tests conducted — dipped below 5%, the threshold that the World Health Organization recommends must not be breached if testing is adequate. The rate had risen about 5% for the first time in the city in 124 days.The Delhi government order said the night curfew will come into effect immediately and be in force until April 30 or further orders.It added that employees of private companies and those involved in essential services will have to get e-passes for travelling within the city during the curfew. The e-passes applications are available on www.delhi.gov.in and passes will be required for those travelling for vaccination, which was expanded to operate 24 hours a day from Monday. Anyone with a medical emergency will also be exempted.Public transport, including Delhi Metro, shall function during the curfew hours for people exempted from the curbs.“The situation of Covid-19 in NCT [National Capital Territory] of Delhi has been reviewed and it has been observed that there has been a sudden increase in Covid-19 cases in recent past along with high positivity rate and therefore, it is felt that night curfew needs to be imposed in the territory of NCT of Delhi from 10pm to 5am, except for essential activities/services, as an emergency measure for well being and safety of people,” acting chief secretary Satya Gopal said, on behalf of the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).Night curfews are among the most common non-pharmaceutical interventions used by governments to check the pandemic in Punjab, Rajasthan, Gujarat and Maharashtra.In Maharashtra, which is contributing roughly half of all cases in India, authorities have imposed a night and weekend curfew, ordered non-essentials businesses to shut down, and asked most offices to switch to remote working.Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), said the night curfew will have a limited impact. “After 10pm, only restaurants, bars, and maybe some cinemas are open. All workplaces are closed, nobody goes to a mall after 10 o’clock...Simple measures like wearing a mask, staying at home, washing hands frequently, changing clothes soon after entering the home — these cannot be enforced all the time. And, ultimately these are the measures that help in curtailing the spread of the infection,” said Dr Khilnani.Delhi Police said it will enforce the rules, except for the exempted categories.“Delhi Police had earlier issued movement passes to facilitate the movement of persons engaged in essential services/commodities. Fresh movement passes will be issued on demand. Those requiring it and qualifying for it can also visit Delhi Police website to apply for it. All field functionaries will be available in their jurisdictions to enforce the DDMA order and to facilitate the exempted categories,” the police said in a statement. Officials said the police will start issuing passes in a few days to ease the application load on the state government’s website.In case anyone is found violating the instructions, the defaulting person(s) shall be proceeded against as per the provisions of sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, Section 188 of IPC and other applicable laws.The Delhi government order clarified that there was no restriction on interstate and intrastate movement, transportation of essential or non-essential goods. The order added no separate permission or e-passes will be required for such movement. Those arriving in the city at airports, railway stations, and interstate bus terminals will be allowed to travel on the production of valid tickets.A senior revenue official said the enforcement will be largely based on trust, like it was during the lockdown months last year. “The police and our enforcement officers are also able to judge who is telling the truth or who is faking it. No one will be distressed because of the curfew, but at the same time the rules will be followed in letter and spirit,” said the official on condition of anonymity.BS Vohra, president of east Delhi RWAs joint front, said the night curfew will create fear among the masses and make they stay indoors. “We support the move as it aims to discipline people and remind them that the virus is still far from gone. However, government should also launch a crackdown in markets and eating joints as Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is brazenly being flouted,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/starting-today-night-curfew-in-delhi-from-10-pm-to-5-am-amid-rising-covid-cases-101617749825918.html
07-04-2021||Delhi||Smoke from fires in Uttarakhand worsens Delhi’s air quality||The Capital’s air quality index (AQI) has moved from moderate to poor to very poor over the past four days, the result of raging forest fires from Uttarakhand (and to a lesser extent, Himachal Pradesh) and winds blowing in from the northern state that has lost around 200 acres of forest to fires in the past few days.At 279, Delhi’s air quality was in the “poor” category overall on Tuesday, which according to the Central Pollution Control Board’s Sameer app means “breathing discomfort to most people on prolonged exposure.”“Delhi’s air quality is on the poor zone as suddenly the dispersal of pollutants has gone down and pollutant load has increased because of many reasons and forest fires is probably one of them,” said Anumita Roy Choudhary, an air quality expert with Centre for Science and Environment.It isn’t just Delhi, several cities in the northern plains are facing the same problem. For example, Sharanpur in Uttar Pradesh recorded AQI of 331 on Tuesday and Yamunanagar in Haryana AQI of 289. And some areas in the foothills of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh witnessed haze like conditions on Tuesday.Uttarakhand has reported close to 100 forest fires in the last 48 hours and close to 250 in the past week. The intensity of forest fires in Himachal is lower, with close to 60 forest fires reported in the last 24 hours.Most of the forest fires are in lower hills, which have pine tree forests that shed highly immflamable needles in this season. As there is no mechanism to collect the needles, a spark can cause fire, said Himachal’s forest minister Rakesh Pathania.What has further contributed to forest fires is the dry hot weather. In the month of March and in first week of April, there was 79% rain deficiency in Uttarakhand and 65% in Himachal Pradesh, according to the India Meteorological Department.A CPCB official, who asked not to be named, said that till the last week of March the wind direction was taking the smoke from forest fires towards the north, thereby not contributing much to the air pollution levels in the plains.According to an Uttarakhand pollution control board official, there has been an increase in pollution levels in even within the state because of the forest fires. “We will be able to provide the data on the increase after few days as raw data was being analysed,” the official said.“There are some forest fires in Uttarakhand, but air quality hasn’t declined in NW India only because of that. Winds are northwesterly here. Air quality is in poor category mainly because of dust and lack of moisture.

While the university experts were seen preaching to farmers about the methods to save water and promoting drip irrigation during an hour-long programme on the final day of the virtual Kisan Mela, the gardeners of the varsity were seen watering its lawns using hose pipes.Interestingly, the two-day virtual mela was based on the theme ‘Aao kheti kharchey ghataiye, vadhu paani, khad na payee; Sahayek dhandey naal apna ke, kheti laheywand banaiyeh (Let us cut farm expenses, reduce the use of water and fertilizers; adopt subsidiary occupations and make farming profitable)’.At a few places in the university, the taps were either broken or water was left running in utter disregard to the depleting groundwater level. The freshwater could be seen going straight into the sewerage or getting accumulated on the ground.The gardening staff appeared to be unaware of the latest techniques of water conservation and were seen watering the gardens using traditional methods.When contacted, estate officer Ashok Kumar said that the matter will be looked into. “Saving water is our top priority. The broken taps and pipes, if any, will be fixed. And wastage of natural resources will not be tolerated,” he added.PAU’s advice to farmers regarding water conservationDuring the virtual Kisan Mela, a panel session on ‘Natural resource management with special reference to water-saving technologies’ was organised wherein experts deliberated on water conservation technologies and shared their experiences. Ajmer Brar, a senior agronomist, was the moderator of the panel discussion.Rakesh Sharda, principal scientist, extension (soil and water engineering) advised the farmers to adopt drip irrigation system, which provides water as per the crop requirement.“It is a water-saving technology and 80% subsidy is being given by the Punjab government for this technique, ‘’ they said.Besides, there are two underground pipeline schemes for individual farmers (50% subsidy) as well as community (90% subsidy), they informed. Experts also suggested sowing of PR 126 rice variety which is early maturing and consumes less water.Besides, they appealed to the farmers to say no to paddy straw burning and instead adopt crop residue management technologies, such as PAU Happy Seeder and Super Seeder for soil health improvement and a pollution-free environment.Jaskarn Singh Mahal, director of extension education, who was the chief guest, said, “Last year, the virtual Kisan Mela was the first virtual mela of India. It has set a fine example in corona times.” He expressed his gratitude to chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh, officials of the line departments, agricultural and veterinary scientists, farmers, farm women, and the rural youth for their participation in the mela.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pau-does-not-practice-what-it-preaches-101617740302938.html

Seeking compensation, Sukhminder Singh and Tejinderpal Singh, the owners of GK Plating, said, “The debris from the auto parts factory fell into our factory and destroyed machinery worth over ₹10 lakh. Four of our employees were injured while one worker Sagar Kumar died. While two employees were discharged, another one, Santosh Kumar, is said to be critical. The government has announced ₹2 lakh compensation for the deceased and free treatment for the injured, but nothing has been announced for us, even as we suffered the losses without any fault on our end.” Tejinderpal said, “We were not even involved in the illegal activity and were not even aware of the illegal activity being taken up by the owner of the adjoining factory-- Jasmail Singh and Sons. Our machinery and shed worth over ₹10 lakh has been damaged. We have also taken up the matter with the administration but only assurances are being given by the officials.”The owners stated that the NDRF and SDRF teams are also dumping the debris of the building which collapsed in their factory, which might further damage the machinery which is left in the factory. Sukhminder Singh said, “The owner of the adjoining building should have informed us before taking up the construction work so that we could have kept the factory closed and ensured the safety of our labourers .

All of them were the sole breadwinners of their families. The bodies of three of the victims, Mustkeen, Peechu of Kakowal road and Imitiaz of Kakowal road, were handed over to their kin after post-mortem while authorities are waiting for Sagar’s kin to reach Ludhiana.Mohammad Ehsan, brother of the victim, Mustkeen, said that all three brothers had migrated to Ludhiana just two months ago. “What will I tell Mustkeen’s wife and three children? Life has played such a cruel joke on them,” he said. “While I work in Gurdaspur, my two brothers Mustkeen and Mohammad Akram had been working in Ludhiana. I had asked Akram to find a job for Mustkeen at one place but the contractor took him along to the construction site,” Ehsan added.Mohammad Gulzar, son of the victim Mohammad Khurshid alias Peechu, said he, along with his father and two brothers, had migrated to Ludhiana in the hope of earning a decent living. “But after this tragedy, I don’t want to stay here anymore. I will return to my native village,” he said.Shamsul, the brother of the victim Imtiaz, said they had been working with the contractor Mohammad Harun for some time.

Just as we are were lifting the slab, the roof came crumbling down. “I was standing in a corner and fell into the adjoining factory and survived, but my brother was trapped inside and died,” he said.Imtiaz is survived by his wife and three children.Additional deputy commissioner of police (ADCP, City 2) Jaskiranjit Singh Teja said the bodies have been dispatched to Bihar in an ambulance after the postmortem.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/they-had-come-to-ludhiana-in-hope-of-finding-jobs-lost-their-lives-101617739703886.html
07-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra notifies 269 sq. km. Kanhargaon Wildlife Sanctuary, state’s 50th||The Maharashtra revenue and forest department on Monday notified the Kanhargaon Wildlife Sanctuary, which will be spread over 269 square kilometres in Chandrapur district. This takes the state’s total tally of wildlife sanctuaries to 50. The move comes eight years after the proposal was first tabled in April 2013, with officials attributing the delay largely due to resistance from the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra, which had large-scale logging operations in the area.The move to notify the area as WLS under the Wildlife Protection Act (1972) — which received the chief minister’s assent during a meeting of the state wildlife board in December 2020 — will enhance protection for the area’s tiger population (20 tigers including cubs), and also give legal sanctity to this key wildlife habitat falling in the tiger corridor between Tadoba tiger reserve in Chandrapur and the Kawal wildlife sanctuary in Telangana’s Mancherial district.“The tiger population in Chandrapur has grown considerably over the last 10 odd years, and the area which has now been notified is a known tiger breeding area/ corridor that facilitates dispersal of the population from one protected area to another, between Tadoba and Kawal,” said state wildlife board member Kishor Rithe.The benefits of this move, Rithe said, would not only help to reduce human-tiger conflict in the region (which has seen over 150 human deaths due to tiger conflict in the last 13 years), but will also give an impetus to wildlife tourism and education measures. “There is a chance now to provide gainful employment to members of the local community, but also generate revenue for the state,” Rithe added.Of the 269 sq. kms, which have been notified on April 5, about 18 sq. kms. come under the Central Chanda forest division, while 251 sq. km. comes under the control of the Forest Development Corporation of Maharashtra, which will no longer be allowed to harvest timber in the area. Instead, officials said, the state government would compensate the FDCM, which has sought allocation of alternate 250 sq kms of productive forest land. The FDCM has also sought employment for van majdoors as part of the Widlife Sanctuary.The area, which Rithe said is one of the last remaining tracts of primary forest in Maharashtra, boasts a rich biodiversity, including leopards, sloth bears, wild boar, wild dogs, jackals and gaur. “It is all the more important to bring the area under protection because it is a pristine forest. Even though a the forest area has been affected due to commercial forestry and timber extraction by the FDCM,we still have natural old trees and natural forest composition, which you rarely find in other parts of the state,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-notifies-269-sq-km-kanhargaon-wildlife-sanctuary-state-s-50th-101617739581256.html

In its notification issued on Sunday, the state said all workers have to be vaccinated. It also stated that until they get vaccinated, the workers must carry a valid negative RT-PCR test certificate, which will be valid for 15 days. The rule will come into effect from April 10, the notification stated. The same rule applies to construction workers and e-commerce employees too. Sudhir Mehta, president, Mahratta Chamber of Commerce, Industries and Agriculture, on Tuesday said, “Conducting RT-PCR tests every 15 days is completely untenable and will result in chaos. The order will instead delay the test results for those with symptoms. There might be small industries who would not bear the cost and instead ask temporary workers to not come in for a month.” Mehta said the trade body, with close to 3000 members, has also written the state to reverse the decision. Santosh Mandlecha, president of MACCIA, also said the decision is impractical. “The problem is the state is taking decisions without consulting the industry. It is practically impossible to conduct tests every 15 days,” Mandlecha said, adding all trade bodies were going to meet virtually on Tuesday evening, before presenting their demands to the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/partial-lockdown-rules-upset-maha-traders-101617739461794.html

They also directed the officials to lodge FIRs against owners and contractors indulging in the practice. Lifting of lintel with jacks is illegal but building owners prefer this over installing a new beam as its saves time and money. “Raising the height of a roof after installing a new beam takes around a month or so but lifting the lintel with jacks takes just around three to four days. The cost is also lower. While installing a new beam costs around ₹450-500 per sq feet, lintel lifting costs around ₹80-100 per sq feet. But the lifting of lintel is an extremely dangerous process and is never recommended by certified architects.”An MC official on the condition of anonymity said, “The illegal practice is prevalent in many parts of the city but it is difficult to keep track of where such activities are taking place as the jacks are kept inside the buildings. In Daba area itself, pamphlets of contractors offering such services can be seen pasted on the walls.” Municipal town planner (MTP) SS Bindra said, “The building where the mishap took place on Monday is about two decades old. The practice of lifting lintel is dangerous and illegal. We have recommended FIRs against building owners and contractors involved in this illegal activity.” Other illegal practicesDuring the site visit on Tuesday, cabinet ministers Bharat Bhushan Ashu and Sundar Sham Arora are said to have noticed several other anomalies in construction activities in Daba area and recommended action against erring owners. MTP Bindra said building inspectors of the area will soon be taking action against illegal construction works.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/day-after-roof-collapse-ludhiana-mc-recommends-fir-against-lintel-lifting-101617739341698.html

In a press conference, the parents said private schools were withholding the results of the students whose fees were not deposited. They accused the schools of not following the directions of the Supreme Court on the fee issue. Association president Raju Ambedkar said the result of his two children was withheld by a private school over pending dues. “When I expressed my inability to pay various funds, the school administration told me that I had money for private trips to Rajasthan but not for paying fee. Later, the management told me that they had seen pictures of my trip on social media,” he said. Chetan Sharma, another parent, said, “When we questioned a private school for charging different funds, a superintendent told me that we didn’t have money to pay fees of our child even my wife wore expensive jewellery.” They requested district administration to intervene in the matter and ensure the implementation of the Supreme Court directions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/private-schools-tracking-our-social-media-accounts-allege-parents-101617739282332.html

Sawant was under the impression that there would be a complete lockdown only on Saturdays and Sundays, while on other days, he would have to close by 8pm considering the night curfew in place. “How can we survive with such lockdowns? We could hardly survive last year somehow and any new one means massive losses,” rued Sawant.Similar confusion was witnessed in the adjoining Hindmata market. On being asked to down the shutters, the shop owners reached the Bhoiwada police station, but were told sternly that a mini lockdown was in place and only essential items are allowed.Across the state, traders resorted to sloganeering and protesting against the mini lockdown. The wholesale markets across the states however had announced the closure and many even closed their main shutters.Protests were held across the state at various places like Mumbai, Thane, Pune, Nagpur and Satara where traders were seen holding placards and sloganeering against the government.By afternoon, a majority of Mumbai wore a deserted look as shops were closed down and there were hardly any people on the streets. The wholesale markets which are normally full witnessed hardly any citizens.Nirmal Nahar, a cloth wholesaler from the Mangaldas market at Kalbadevi, who says that lockdown has come at the wrong time. “This is a wedding season and even Ramzan festival is arriving next week. This complete closure means total loss for me,” said Nahar. “The problem is if we shut shop, our consumers will buy from Gujarat.”On the streets, the citizens were also worried about the fall out of this mini lockdown. “We faced huge problems during the last lockdown and still we were not able to contain the Covid-19 virus. There are many things one needs apart from medicines and groceries. The government cannot deny us these,” said Mehboob Sayed, a resident of Pydhonie in South Mumbai.The state government’s decision to ensure 50 percent attendance in government offices and allow only companies with financial dealings to function in private officials witnessed a significant drop of commuters in trains and buses. “There was a noticeable dip in train passengers,” said a senior official of the central railways.The bus conductors refused to take standees which resulted in many of the passengers not being taken inside.Rahul Sharma, who travels from Shivaji Park to Byculla for work, said he could not take three buses as all seats were full. “I had to go to Mahim depot to get the bus. It was quite a comfortable travel as usually buses used to be fully packed,” said Sharma.Many running financial institutions also did not come to work as they have been asked to ensure that their workers are fully vaccinated fully or else have a RT-PCR negative Covid-19 test result every 15 days. Nitin Nikalje, owner, Gati Investments which deals in stocks and insurance, said it was better to skip work. “How can I force my employees to take the test every 15 days? They will not agree to it,” said Nikalje.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-sees-deserted-streets-chaos-on-day-1-of-partial-lockdown-101617739281217.html

07-04-2021||Mumbai||Doctors flag early lung infections as new Covid-19 concern||A couple from south Mumbai in their 60s consulted a doctor last week after having a fever for two days. As the doctor examined them with the help of a stethoscope, he heard what is known as bilateral crackles: typical sounds from the lungs that suggest pneumonia. A Covid-19 test returned positive and a CT scan of the lung confirmed pneumonia. But what surprised the doctor, consultant internist at Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, was the progression of the lung infection. In the past, Covid-19 linked pneumonia was seen after at least 10 days of symptoms, but in this senior couple, pneumonia had set in on the third day.“Involvement of the lung within the second or third day of the onset of symptoms is concerning,” said Dr Samrat Shah, who treated the senior couple. Shah said that their lungs were considerably diseased, and the CT scan severity score was above 7, which meant that they had already crossed the mild stage.As Mumbai grapples with a surge on account of the second wave of the Covid pandemic, doctors across the city say that CT scans of positive patients are revealing faster pulmonary changes even as severity scores are rapidly turning to severe.Given their age, the couple was an ideal candidate for hospitalisation. But they could not find a bed in a private hospital. They were put on intravenous steroids and antiviral medication at home and are now on the road to recovery. According to Dr. Shah, almost 30% of his patients are coming with early lung infections. During the last wave, only some of the immunocompromised patients would turn up with such early infections, he said.Dr Khusrav Bajan, a physician, and intensivist at the PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim said almost 15% of his Covid-19 patients are suffering from an early lung infection. “Last year, such cases were about 5% to 10%,” said Dr. Bajan, adding that the CT scans of these patients are deteriorating faster, within one or two days of admission.A CT-scan severity score, ranges from 0 to 25; 7 to 12 indicates moderate infection; above 12 indicates a severe infection; below 7 indicates mild infection.“I have so many patients who are slipping from a score of 5 to 20 within a day. They typically have pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Also, a peculiar trend is that younger people, under 45 years of age, are coming with such early infections,” said Bajan.From reporting an average of 526 cases per day in January, Mumbai’s daily average rose to 655 cases per day in February and jumped exponentially to 2866 cases per day in March. The surge continues further this month with the city reporting an average of 9500 per day in the first five days. The active cases in the city have jumped by over 700% within a month’s time: from 9055 on March 5 to 73,281 on April 5.According to BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard, 12707 patients are currently hospitalised. Of these, 1776 are admitted to intensive care units. Another 1937 patients are admitted in Covid Care Centre (CCC2) that are meant for positive, asymptomatic patients. Around 2% of the total active cases are critical.“Even as the numbers have risen, and more patients are symptomatic, the response rate to therapy is much better. This helps as patients don’t get to the critical state,” said physician Dr. Pratit Samdani who is currently treating one unusual case of a 65-year-old jeweller who developed lung fibrosis on the seventh day of hospitalisation. Lung fibrosis is a severe condition wherein the lung tissues are severely scarred and the damage is irreversible. “We generally see fibrosis after three to four weeks. It is unusual to develop fibrosis so soon,” he said.However, experts also said that the sheer volume of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing second wave has resulted in doctors observing such trends more clearly. “Some patients definitely deteriorate faster. We are also seeing significantly affected lungs in patients but we did see a similar trend last year too,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a critical care physician at Fortis Hospital and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “I think what is concerning right now is the overwhelming number of cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/doctors-flag-early-lung-infections-as-new-covid-concern-101617738921137.html

The total donations received this time at Takht Kesgarh Sahib, Kiratpur Sahib and 43 other historic gurdwaras managed by the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) around the historic town founded by ninth Sikh master Guru Tegh Bahadur are ₹58 lakh less than the previous year. It was here that his successor Guru Gobind Singh founded the order of Khalsa. The festival celebrations are held for 7 days. Malkeet Singh, manager of Takht Kesgarh Sahib and other historic gurdwaras run by the SGPC, said the heavy rush of devotees was witnessed for only 3 days this time. “Devotees donated ₹2.66 crore this time against the last year’s ₹3.25 crore. Even the last year’s donations were ₹70 lakh less than the preceding year due to the panic created by the pandemic,” he added. “This time, other factors also led to the less footfall. First, the Rupnagar district administration issued a statement that it will be mandatory for the devotees to carry a Covid-19 negative report for participating in the festival. Though the decision was modified later saying it will be applicable only for foreigners, it created confusion among people. Besides, the administration had announced that booths will be set up to conduct on-the-spot Covid-19 tests but nothing was done,” he claimed. The shutdown call given by the farmer unions on March 26 also contributed to a less footfall as many devotees could not come to Anandpur Sahib to participate in the festival which concluded on March 29, Malkeet Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/pandemic-effect-hola-mohalla-donations-at-anandpur-sahib-gurdwaras-dip-this-year-again-101617738861669.html

Of these, nearly half are permanent purchase centres while the rest have been created temporarily. The Punjab Mandi Board, which along with the food and civil supplies department regulates procurement in the state through four agencies, will start issuing passes to farmers from Wednesday (April 7) for bringing their produce to the mandis. Passes to the farmers will be issued 72 hours in advance. Nearly 130 lakh tonne wheat arrival is expected during the procurement season. The government on Monday received ₹21,658 crore from the Reserve Bank of India towards cash credit limit (CCL). But the issue over direct bank transfer (DBT) remains unresolved as the central government is not willing to relent to Punjab’s demand to allow payment to farmers though arhtiyas (commission agents). The Centre has fixed the minimum support price (MSP) of the crop ₹1.975 per quintal, hiking it by ₹50 from the last year’s ₹1,925. On Wednesday, the board is likely to issue 40,000 passes to the farmers to bring produce in a staggered manner. On Tuesday, produce started arriving in the mandis at Patran, Patiala, Sangrur, Mansa, Fatehgarh Sahib besides some parts of Bathinda, Samrala and Khanna. State food and civil supplies minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu is expected to meet Union food and public distribution minister Piyush Goyal on Thursday to discuss the DBT issue seeking an extension of its implementation. Also, he will take up issues of rural development fund, movement of food stocks from the state godowns and release of pending incidentals. BJP questions state govt’s sincerity The BJP’s Punjab unit on Tuesday said the Amarinder Singh-led government in the state was playing “politics of deception” by scuttling Centre’s DBT scheme for state farmers. State general secretary Subhash Sharma said at the insistence of farmer organisations the then state government had agreed to implement the scheme in 2013 and submitted an affidavit in the Punjab and Haryana High Court assuring that suitable provisions would be made in the agriculture marketing rules. “The state government and the Centre signed pact in February to integrate an online payment system and agreed to make amendments to the Punjab Agricultural Produce Markets (General) Rules for transfer of funds to farmers directly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-sets-up-3-700-mandis-for-procuring-wheat-amid-covid-surge-101617738745947.html

Besides, announcing five Vidhan Sabha candidates in the state, the party has launched a publicity campaign in Ludhiana through hoardings and billboards, but the face of party’s patriarch Parkash Singh Badal is conspicuously missing. The billboards, however, carry pictures of almost all top leaders, including party president Sukhbir Singh Badal, Bikram Singh Majithia, YAD president Parambans Singh Romana and Sharanjit Singh Dhillon. Party’s district president Ranjit Singh Dhillon distanced himself from the faux pas. “First the hoardings were installed by the Youth Akali Dal and not by SAD. I strongly believe that it (missing Senior Badal) was unintentional. Parkash Singh Badal is and will always remain the face of the party,” he said. In the hoardings, some YAD leaders have been congratulated for being appointed office-bearers.

The move came more than a week after the Supreme Court directed the Punjab government to hand over the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA to UP authorities within a fortnight. The Mau legislator was taken in an ambulance to the Banda jail under heavy security at 2 pm. The 8-vehicle cavalcade also included a Vajra van. Earlier, a team of doctors conducted medical tests of Ansari, who has been in the Rupnagar jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion FIR registered by a Mohali-based builder. The UP cops led by deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Satya Prakash reached Rupnagar at 4:30am and remained in the central jail for two hours to complete the formalities. The Yogi Adityanath-led government in UP had moved the apex court seeking the custody of Ansari, wanted in several criminal cases in the state, after the Punjab government refused to shift him. Inquiry ordered into abandoned ambulanceRupnagar senior superintendent of police (SSP) Akhil Chaudhary ordered a probe into the circumstances under which an ambulance (UP-41-AT-7171) that ferried Ansari from the central jail to a Mohali court on March 31 was found abandoned near a dhaba. As an FIR of fake registration was registered in Barabanki, a police headed by a DSP had reached Rupnagar to probe the case. The team found that the vehicle was not bullet proof and its chassis number was also the same as registered in UP. “Our technical team will inspect the vehicle once we reach UP,” DSP Naveen Kumar, who led the team from Barabanki, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-hands-over-bsp-legislator-mukhtar-ansari-to-up-police-101617738683003.html

SDRF and district administration officials stated that though it is unlikely that more people may be trapped inside the building, they will continue with the debris clearing work to avoid taking chances. State disaster response force (SDRF) in-charge, inspector Manoj Singh said, “The rescue operation was very difficult. When a part of a building collapses, we have to move very slowly to prevent further damage as the lives of the rescue team members are also at stake in such operations.”Deputy commissioner Varinder Sharma said, “NDRF, SDRF, MC, fire brigade, and local police have been working tirelessly since Monday morning and 36 labourers have been rescued. Out of this, five are undergoing treatment at various hospitals in the city. Two of them are in a critical condition. The bodies of the deceased have been handed over to the next of kin. The operation to clear the debris is going on and it is expected to take two more days. It is suspected that no one is now trapped in the building.” Cabinet ministers visit spotCabinet ministers Sundar Sham Arora and Bharat Bhushan Ashu visited the spot on Tuesday to take the stock of the situation. The ministers stated that an inquiry has already been marked to the divisional commissioner by chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and strict action will be taken against erring officials, including those in the municipal corporation. Arora said the state government has already announced ₹2 lakh compensation for the families of deceased, besides offering free treatment for the injured labourers. Ashu appealed to people to not put any life at risk for their vested interests. He said the public should take proper permission from authorities for carrying out any construction work and once permission is given, all safety standards must be followed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-more-feared-trapped-debris-clearing-on-at-ludhiana-roof-collapse-site-101617738441702.html
07-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC restrains Faridkot DC from holding meet to elect Kotkapura MC chief||The Punjab and Haryana High Court on Tuesday restrained Faridkot district administration from convening meeting of the municipal council to elect president of Kotkapura MC till further orders. The high court acted on the plea of Mahinder Kaur and one more, who had contended before court that the April 1 guidelines of urban local bodies department lay down that the selection of the president is to be made as per the reservation and out of the winning members of the ward concerned of that category would be violative of the Article 243-T of the Constitution. The Supreme Court has already opined that wherever office of the president of a municipality is required to be filled in by a member belonging to a Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe or backward class as the case may be, it would be enough if one belongs to one of those categories irrespective of the fact whether they have been elected from a general ward or a reserved ward, the court was told about interpretation rendered by SC of the Article 243-T. A total of three backward class candidates have won from non-reserved wards but if state’s imposed condition is followed, these three candidates will be deprived of the chance to become the president. And if only one candidate is allowed to contest for the post of president, then no-confidence motion can never be moved against him as there would be no competition, thus defeating the purpose. The Kotkapura municipal council has 29 wards of which 10 were reserved. Only one candidate has won on the reserved category seat, as per the plea. The case will be taken up again on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-restrains-faridkot-dc-from-holding-meet-to-elect-kotkapura-mc-chief-101617738382257.html

Gurmej Singh, 45, of Jamalpura village was shot dead by unidentified assailants in June 2019. Those arrested have been identified as Jashanpreet Singh, alias Jashan, of Noordi village and Arshdeep Singh, alias Arsh, of Tarn Taran. Police said Jashan, who had been stalking the victim’s daughter, hatched a conspiracy to commit the crime with the help of Arsh and one Amritpal Singh of Bachre village. Gurmej, who had been living in the SGPC’s Tarn Taran quarters, was gunned down when he was on the way to his sister’s place in Alawalpur village. “My uncle used to visit us on his motorcycle every evening for fetching milk. Around 10 pm on June 25, 2019, I was informed that my uncle was lying dead on a road near Bachre village. We reached the spot and found that he was shot,” the victim’s nephew (sister’s son) had told the police. A case under sections 302 (murder) of the Indian penal code (IPC) and 25-27-54-59 of the Arms Act was registered against some unidentified persons at City police station in Tarn Taran. Addressing a press conference, senior superintendent of police (SSP) Dhruman H Nimbale said, “We have also recovered a .32 calibre pistol and five cartridges from the possession of the accused. The same weapon was used to kill Gurmej. Jashan was obsessed with the victim’s daughter.

07-04-2021||Mumbai||Mansukh Hiran murder case: NIA to quiz DCP-rank officer||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will question a deputy commissioner of police (DCP)-rank officer of the Mumbai crime branch who allegedly visited the crime intelligence unit (CIU) office on March 3, when Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran – whose body was found from a Mumbra creek – was present at former police officer Sachin Vaze’s office in CIU.At the time, Vaze was the head of CIU. He was arrested by NIA on March 13 for allegedly planting an SUV with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threating letter near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia in February. Hiran is linked to the SUV.“The agency wanted to verify certain details with all the people concerned in the case who were present at the CIU office when Hiran had met Vaze. The agency will verify details and examine the facts,” said an NIA official.However, a senior Mumbai Police officer clarified that the DCP in question had visited the CIU office for some other work and was not part of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran.As of now, NIA has recorded the statements of around 40 people and further investigations are on in the Antilia explosives scare as well as Hiran’s death case, added the NIA officer.On Monday at 11.40pm, a group of eight to 10 NIA officers – while recreating the crime scene in the Hiran death case – took Vaze to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT) after they discovered during investigation that the suspended cop had taken a train from there to Kalwa station on March 4, the day Hiran went missing. A team from Pune’s Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CSFL) was also present at the time of crime scene recreation, and they recorded a video of Vaze walking on platform number 4, from where he had boarded a train around 7pm on March 4.Hiran was allegedly murdered on March 4 and his body was found floating in a creek at Retibunder in Mumbra the next day. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) was investigating the Hiran murder case, before it was handed over to NIA.ATS officers during their probe had found that Vaze had got off at Kalwa railway station and had allegedly contacted Hiran around 8.29pm. They spoke for around 11 minutes and Vaze allegedly asked him to meet near Ghodbunder Road. However, he requested Hiran to tell his family that he was going to meet an officer named Tawade from Kandivli police station. Vaze allegedly called Hiran from a mobile number provided by another arrested accused Naresh Gor. He also did not use his mobile phone to make the call. The phone used to call Hiran was later destroyed, said NIA.On Monday night, the officials also took Vaze to Kalwa railway station by road, where he was made to walk from the platform to the station’s exit, said the NIA officer. The agency has also taken custody of the CCTV footage of CSMT and Kalwa station, added the officer.NIA had seized a high-end bike in the case from Daman on Monday. It is registered at Thane in the name of a woman, suspected to be known to Vaze, said NIA. She was seen in a CCTV grab while entering a five-star hotel at south Mumbai, where Vaze was staying between February 16 and 20, with a currency counting machine. The bike was bought five years ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mansukh-hiran-murder-case-nia-to-quiz-dcp-rank-officer-101617738261013.html
07-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat procurement: Uncertainty over mode of payment haunts farmers||Even as wheat procurement is slated to start in Punjab on April 10, uncertainty continues to loom large around the process on the ground.Field officials engaged in the massive procurement exercise said on Tuesday that elaborate arrangements are being made across the state for the smooth purchase, but there is still no official word on the mode of payment to farmers.Officials familiar with the development say though the Punjab government has been stating that payments will be done through arhtiyas, quoting Agriculture Produce Market Committee (APMC) rules, but explicit details in this regard are still awaited.“We understand that arhtiyas will stay in the picture for wheat procurement as directions have been issued by the state authorities that the farmers will be allowed to come to grain markets and other procurement centres on basis of coupons issued through the commission agents,” said a district official. For the second consecutive year, wheat will be procured in a staggered manner to avoid mass gatherings in view of the second wave of Covid-19 outbreak. The Food Corporation of India (FCI) in March had asked the state government for the land records of farmers to enable direct, online payment of minimum support price (MSP). The payment is routed through arhtiyas or commission agents under current practice.People familiar with the development say according to a nine-page communication of the food and civil supplies department dated Apri 1, payment for wheat purchase will be done online through Punjab government’s “anaaj kharid portal”.“We are yet to get the standard operating procedure (SOP) for the online payment. The state authorities have directed the mandi board to make all arrangements to purchase each foodgrain in mandis. All purchase agencies are working in tandem for procurement,” said the district mandi officer of Bathinda Preet Kanwar Singh Brar.Punjab is expected to produce 130 lakh MT and FCI is scheduled to buy 20% or 26 lakh MT. Rest stock will be bought by four state agencies where Pungrain will buy 29.9 lakh MT followed by Markfed and Punsup at 28.60 lakh MT each. Punjab warehouse is slated to procure 16.9 lakh MT.Bathinda, the largest district of southern Punjab is expected to procure 10.31 lakh metric tonne wheat, a marginal increase of 31,000 MT than the previous season.Besides 182 conventional mandis, additional 150 sites will be used for purchase in a phased manner.Fazilka district food and supplies controller (DFSC) Gurpreet Kang said a shortage of bags will be overcome before the mass arrival of rabi crop in the next few days as bulk supplies of gunny and plastic bags are underway.“There are no serious space constraints and the old stock is continuously transported by different agencies. For this year, FCI has ensured to provide ample storage space,” said Kang.Mansa district mandi officer Rajnish Goel said a farmer will be entitled to sell 50 quintals of produce“From today we started Covid-19 vaccination for all those eligible persons engaged in procurement including, arthiyas, loaders, mandi board officials and farmers,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-procurement-uncertainty-over-mode-of-payment-haunts-farmers-101617738143147.html

07-04-2021||Other||Allegations against Anil Deshmukh: CBI team reaches Mumbai, begins probe||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a preliminary inquiry based on the Bombay high court (HC) order on the petition filed by lawyer Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil. In her petitions, Patil had sought directions to Malabar Hill police station to take cognisance of her letter, which sought an inquiry into the allegations by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. According to CBI sources, a team comprising six officers reached Mumbai from Delhi on Tuesday. The half-a-dozen officers will probe the allegations and it involves examining several persons including Mumbai Police officers, hotel owners, restaurants etc, said an officer who didn’t want to be named. Officials cited above said they will examine Singh, who had levelled serious allegations against Deshmukh in a letter written to state chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20, days after he was shunted out to a low key post in the department. The agency will also record Patil’s statement. They added Deshmukh is also likely to be examined in the later. HC on Monday, in its 52-page judgment, had directed CBI to conclude the preliminary probe within 15 days. The court had observed that Malabar Hill police had failed to take action on Patil’s complaint, which had pointed to a “cognisable offence” being committed by Deshmukh. HC noted that it could not remain a “mute spectator” to the complaints received against high-level officers and ruled, “It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of state machinery, which would stare at face when confronted with the expectations of law, and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials. This court cannot be a mute spectator in these circumstances.” It further observed that as the state police force was under Deshmukh [he resigned after HC’s directions for probe], it would serve the ends of justice if a preliminary probe was conducted by an independent agency such as CBI. “Deshmukh is home minister. The police department is under his control and direction. There can be no fair, impartial, unbiased and untainted probe if the same were entrusted to the state police force. As of necessity, probe has to be entrusted to an independent agency like CBI,” noted the bench in its judgment on Monday. “The allegations made by Shri Param Bir Singh are serious in nature and against the highest functionary of the government of Maharashtra, when it comes to the functioning of the police department. Prima facie, the issues are such that the very faith of citizens in the functioning of the police department is at stake. If there is any amount of truth in such allegations, certainly it has a direct effect on the citizens’ confidence in the police machinery in the state. Such allegations, therefore, cannot remain unattended and are required to be looked into in the manner known to law when prima facie they indicate commission of a cognisable offence. It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of the state machinery, which would stare at the face when confronted with the expectations of the law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials,” the court observed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/allegations-against-anil-deshmukh-cbi-team-reaches-mumbai-begins-probe-101617738142027.html

The cops have been identified as ASI Amarjeet Singh and Moga City-1 SHO inspector Jaswant Singh.Police officials confirmed that the men were locked up and confined to a stock without registration of an FIR. Action against the erring cops came after advocate HC Arora sent a demand notice to the chief secretary and police brass.In the video circulating on the social media, the youths can be seen sitting with their feet fixed to a stock (called ‘kath’ in local parlance). The video was recorded by a social activist on March 26 and released a few days ago.HC Arora said, “With their legs and feet fixed to the ‘kath’, they cannot go even go to the toilet. It is inhuman and humiliating. It is a violation of fundamental rights to life and dignity of a person. I will move high court to end this practice at police stations.”Social activist Mohinderpal Singh Loomba, who had recorded the video, said, “On March 25, an advocate, who works at district attorney office, and his friend scuffled with a 21-year-old security guard and a 25-year-old employee of a courier company over parking space. The police picked both the youths the same day and shackled them in the ‘kath’.

07-04-2021||Other||1 more Maharashtra min will resign in 8 days: State BJP chief||High on morale, after two Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) ministers’ resignation in the past 35 days, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has decided to up the ante against the state government. Maharashtra BJP chief Chandrakant Patil on Tuesday said that one more MVA minister will resign in the next eight days.Speaking at Pune on the occasion of BJP’s 41st foundation day, Patil said there are at least seven ministers with serious criminal offences in MVA government.“There are six-seven ministers in the state cabinet who are facing serious criminal charges. One of the ministers is facing imprisonment for assaulting a policeman, while another has recently revealed his relationship outside wedlock. One minister’s son-in-law is in jail in connection with a drug case, while another is facing charges of beating a party worker. We are not interested in taking the resignation of any minister, but it is going to happen naturally. Like in cricket, the first few batsmen bat for a longer time, but the tail-enders fall quickly. Similarly, the next resignations from MVA ministers will come at shorter intervals,” he said, adding that while the list of wrongdoings of some MVA ministers has already been in the public domain, a few more names will be added to it in the next few days.“The MVA government will collapse under its own deeds. There is no need to put in special efforts to topple it. BJP will fight the elections on its own and form the government without joining hands with any other party,” Patil said.According to BJP leaders, the state unit has decided to go become more aggressive against MVA government over the issues of corruption and lockdown. “We have no specific strategy to topple the [Uddhav] Thackeray government as it would not benefit us in any given way. Even immediate elections would not help us in winning the seats required to form the government. As such, our aim is to taint the ruling parties as much as possible and create negative public sentiments against them. For that, we have been capitalising every given opportunity, which keep coming without any great effort,” said a BJP leader, requesting anonymity.On Monday, leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis had also said that more names will come to light for their involvement in the “extortion” case during the Central Bureau of Investigation’s (CBI) probe. “There are few more names that will be exposed in the course of investigation. The alleged involvement of the [former] home minister is just the tip of the iceberg. I believe many heavyweights from the ruling parties are involved in the entire case of extortion,” he said.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary Sachin Sawant said that the claims by BJP leaders are out of the helplessness and grid for power. “They are talking about the charges faced by our ministers but what did they do about their ministers who faced even more serious charges? CBI had lodged an FIR (first information report) against Sambhaji Patil Nilangekar (labour minister in the Fadnavis government), despite which he was made a minister. Many other ministers from their cabinet faced serious charges, but were clean chits. There is no substance in what Patil is saying,” said Sawant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/1-more-maharashtra-min-will-resign-in-8-days-bjp-chief-101617737841056.html
07-04-2021||Mumbai||55,469 new Covid-19 cases reported in Maharashtra||Amid the partial lockdown imposed in the state, Maharashtra on Tuesday recorded more than 50,000 cases with 55,469 new Covid-19 infections (its second-highest single-day spike after April 4) and close to 300 deaths with 297 deaths, taking the tally to 3,113,354 and toll to 55,469. Mumbai also registered upwards of 10,000 new cases, with 10,040 new cases and 32 deaths. The state has 472,283 active infections, as of Tuesday. According to the Centre’s Ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW), seven of the top 10 districts with high active cases are in Maharashtra. These include Pune (84,309), Mumbai (79,368), Thane (61,127), Nagpur (57,372), Nashik (31,688), Aurangabad (17,818) and Ahmednagar (17,405). The other districts include Bengaluru Urban, Delhi, and Durg in Chhatisgarh. The state accounts for 58% of all active cases and 34% of all Covid-related deaths in the country, the ministry said. Starting Monday 8pm, the state has imposed a partial lockdown with all non-essential shops shut, a night curfew of 11 hours, and a stricter weekend lockdown.Experts say that with the health infrastructure burdened, the restrictions can help control the spread. Dr Shashank Joshi, a member of the state-appointed task force said that the situation will improve in the coming two to four weeks.Cases in Maharashtra have increased from an average of 3,000 in February to more than 40,000 every day since April 1. The state’s weekly positivity rate had also decreased to 6% towards the beginning of February, which has now increased to 24% last week.However, amid the grim statistics, the state on Tuesday said that more than 8 million people have been vaccinated in the state. Dr Pradip Vyas, principal secretary, state health department, said the state had received more than 10 million dose, of which, 8.8 million has been utilised. The state vaccine wastage is around 3% and more than 400,000 people are being vaccinated every day in the state, Vyas said. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, on Monday, also wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to provide more doses, especially for the six affected districts in the state. On Tuesday, state health minister Rajesh Tope also reiterated the state’s demand for more doses. In his interaction with union health minister, Tope also said that the Centre must ask states to divert their oxygen supply to Maharashtra, considering the increasing number of cases in the state. “The state produces 1200MT of oxygen, of which, 80% has been reserved for medical and pharmaceutical purposes. However, the demand in the state is increasing. The Centre must direct states which are not utilising much oxygen to divert it to Maharashtra,” Tope is said to have informed the Centre. He also reiterated the demand for opening vaccination for all those above 25 years of age||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/55469-new-covid-19-cases-reported-in-maharashtra-101617737727513.html
07-04-2021||Chandigarh||CII to partner with Punjab govt for infrastructure gap analysis||The Confederation of Indian Industry (CII) will partner the Punjab government to carry out an infrastructure gap analysis for a development roadmap for the state. CII Punjab chairman Bhavdeep Sardana and vice-chairman Amit Thapar, who met Punjab chief minister’s chief principal secretary Suresh Kumar, chief secretary Vini Mahajan and other top officials of state government here on Tuesday, said the gap analysis will look at the existing industry and the type of industry required along with the infrastructure requirement. “It will also study the available infrastructure, what is needed and the gap. We will take inputs of sectoral experts from the industry having first-hand experience. They can give their customised inputs and practical solutions, telling us about policy changes and rail or road linkages, landing sites and other facilities are needed to give a push to industrial infrastructure in the state. This will be done jointly with the government,” the newly elected state head of CII, one of the largest industry bodies in the country, said, listing robust infrastructure, better freight connectivity, ease of doing business and capacity building initiatives among priorities. At the meeting, the state government also sought CII’s help to reach out to homegrown entrepreneurs and encourage them to invest more in the state, particularly in industrial parks, cycle valley and pharmaceutical cluster, according to the industry body. CII also agreed to set up focused sectoral sub-groups of its prominent members which would work with the state government. The meeting was the first between CII’s new team and the state’s bureaucratic top brass. The state industry had faced a double whammy during the year gone by – first ravaged by the coronavirus-induced six-week long national lockdown, and then the farmers’ agitation, particularly the two-month rail roko, that brought the movement of raw material and manufactured goods in and out of the state to a halt. ‘INDUSTRY HAS BOUNCED BACK, CREDIT OFF-TAKE UP’ Sardana said the industry has bounced back from the impact of Covid-19 and the protest related disruptions. He said production capacities are getting expanded and fresh investments being made with credit off-take also showing up. “The industry suffered losses and its patience was tested, but it was a temporary phase and the state government was supportive. We support farmers and want these issues to be resolved amicably,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cii-to-partner-with-punjab-govt-for-infrastructure-gap-analysis-101617737662165.html
07-04-2021||Other||Our aim is to create transparent police force: New Maharashtra home min||Maharashtra’s new home minister Dilip Walse Patil, who assumed the charge on Tuesday, has plenty of challenges before him to ensure the ‘cleansing’ of the police force from the current mess. The minister, on day one of his new role, has hinted at transparency in administrative dealing and ‘zero political interference’ in police force. Experts in the police force and the home department feel that if the home minister walked the talk, the task will be half completed. Soon after taking the charge, Walse Patil said there would be no political interference in the police administration. “The general public, especially the women, keep a lot of hope from the police force. Our aim is to make the force public centric and maintain maximum transparency in administration.” When asked about the groupism and factionalism within the police force, the minister said, “I am yet to hold meetings with senior police and home department officers. I am yet to take stock of the situation. The police force should work unitedly without any infighting. We will attempt to put things in place.” Walse Patil is taking charge at a time when the partners of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government were caught unaware by the Bombay high court’s Monday ruling, forcing the alliance to drop Anil Deshmukh as the home minister. The resignation came on the heels of two serious allegations of ‘forced extortion’ and corruption in police transfers. Former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh in his letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray had alleged that Deshmukh had asked crime branch officers to collect ₹100 every month from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours. Another IPS (Indian Police Service) officer and former intelligence department chief Rashmi Shukla had submitted a report last August to the state government over the alleged exchange of money for police transfers. Taking the cognisance of Singh’s allegations, HC had ordered a preliminary inquiry by Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) against Deshmukh. “The image of not only Mumbai and Maharashtra Police, but also that of the government has maligned. The corruption in the police force or by politicians is a known fact, but their open endorsement [for corruption] affects the public sentiment a lot. It seems that the new home minister knows where it has hurt the most and hence, spoke about transparency, zero interference and people-centric police force. The indiscipline, groupism and sycophancy in the force need to be dealt with iron hands, and at times with a pinch of sacrifice of power and gains,” said an IAS (Indian Administrative Service) officer from the government. Officials from the home department also pointed out at the undesired political interference in police postings and transfers, which take a toll on discipline and lead to more corruption. “The Supreme Court directives given in 2006 in the Prakash Singh case are blatantly violated while appointing senior officers. The recommendations by the Police Establishment Boards are overruled without just reasons. This not only leads to the discontent among meritorious police officers, but also gives encouragement to malpractices intended towards wooing the political bosses. I have worked with the then home minister RR Patil, who would respect the views of the officials, and at times would have courage to justify the decision on record while overruling our recommendations,” said a retired IAS officer, requesting anonymity. Walse Patil said transfers will take place as per the set system. “There is system in place at various levels for the transfers of various posts in the police force. The decision about the postings and transfers would be taken accordingly,” he said. Retired IPS officer Sudhakar Suradkar said the biggest challenge before the new home minister would be to control and reduce political interference and give a free hand to the police force. “Also, high-ranking police officers should respect their own powers, without bowing before their political bosses. I firmly believe that an uncontrolled police personnel inclines towards criminal act and should be controlled by their bosses, court and by public sentiments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/our-aim-is-to-create-transparent-police-force-new-maharashtra-home-min-101617737661027.html

He has written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday, demanding changes in the lockdown norms.Fadnavis has also pointed at the discrepancies in lockdown norms. “You have allowed the transportation to operate, but related businesses such as spare parts shops and garages have been shut. There are many such examples that have emerged out of the [state’s] notification issued. It has led to discontent among people, leading to the protests in many parts of the state. The decision of restrictions on small shopkeepers, hoteliers and salons needs to be tweaked immediately by issuing a revised order,” he wrote.Fadnavis also said that Thackeray, during their conversation ahead of imposing the stricter curbs, had spoken about only a two-day lockdown. “But the type of curbs that have been imposed, it appears to be an undeclared month-long lockdown,” said Fadnavis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fadnavis-writes-to-maharashtra-cm-calls-for-relaxation-of-curbs-101617737486920.html

The latest warrant of precedence also places DDC members above Members of Parliament in terms of precedence. Besides this, the order also put ”District Magistrates, Officers of the rank of Brigadiers and equivalent, Major Heads of Department, Conservator of Forests, District & Session Judges, Chairpersons, Block Development Councils, Presidents of Municipal Councils and Municipalities under the same protocol.” In the maiden DDC polls in the UT, Farooq Abdullah-led People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) won 110 seats while the Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the single largest party by securing 75 seats. On March 9, the newly-elected DDC members, irrespective of their parties, boycotted a two-day programme and staged a protest against a government order on their honorarium and protocol here. “This is our insult and humiliation,” Shabir Ahmad Lone, DDC member from Rafiabad, said then. The protest was, however, called off a day later following an assurance by Lt Governor Sinha to address the issue.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-order-lists-j-k-ddc-chiefs-above-mps-101617737362680.html

The official said that directions have been issued to vaccinate people who are engaged in the tourism sector. “It was decided in the meeting that staff deputed on the Amarnath Yatra will be inoculated as well,” said an official.In the meeting, special emphasis was laid on tracing and testing mechanisms. The divisional commissioner expressed satisfaction over the tracing, but asked to put more focus on contact-tracing. “Also, it was directed to notify new micro containment zones and 100% testing of all people within three days,” the official said. It was observed that Baramulla has the highest fatality rate at 2%, followed by Kulgam (1.95%). J&K on Tuesday, meanwhile, logged 561 new cases taking the tally to 1, 34,015.

A division bench comprising Justice Tarlok Singh Chauhan and Justice Chander Bhusan Barowalia passed these orders on a writ petition challenging the penalty order passed by the director. The petitioner has alleged that he has been mala fide involved in a fictitious case and even in the departmental inquiry initiated against him, no proper opportunity was afforded to him and no rules or principles of natural justice were followed. The court observed that the record reveals that even the employer — the director of agriculture — had come to a firm conclusion that the petitioner had misappropriated ₹26.69 lakh of the sale proceeds and had not deposited this amount in the government treasury, yet he, instead of imposing major penalty on the petitioner, only imposed a minor penalty of ‘censure’. The court said it has failed to understand and appreciate as to what was the source of power or authority of the director of agriculture to pass an order of censure. The court directed the respondent state to file reply within a period of four weeks and posted the matter for May 18.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/26lakh-graft-himachal-hc-asks-agri-director-to-explain-his-position-101617737301577.html

Parents and students took to social media to urge government officials to cancel board exams and mark students on the basis of online or internal assessments. “Please do not expose the students and their near ones and risk their lives, by forcing them to give offline exams in this second wave of Covid-19 which is affecting youngsters too at a rapid speed!,” stated one such tweet. Students urged all the boards to cancel Class 10 and Class 12 board exams this year. “These are unprecedented times, and the government should treat the year as an exceptional one and mark students on the basis of internal assessments now,” stated another student from the city. Meanwhile, the education department is mulling various options for conducting the exams in the current scenario. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad will be holding a series of meetings with several stakeholders to come up with various contingencies for the exams. “Opinions are being sought from various experts and stakeholders to understand if there can be back up options in case the exam cannot be conducted on the dates scheduled.

07-04-2021||Chandigarh||After HC rap, Panjab University announces senate poll schedule||Panjab University on Tuesday announced the polling dates for various constituencies of senate, which are pending since August last year.The move comes days after the Punjab and Haryana high court pulled up PU vice-chancellor (V-C) Raj Kumar for the delay and told the university to conduct the senate polls within two months.The revised polling dates were proposed by the varsity and have been approved by the Vice-President of India, M Venkaiah Naidu, who is the chancellor of PU.The polling will start from April 26 with the constituency of faculties which has 12 candidates in the fray and 754 eligible voters.The senate is a 91-member apex governing body of the university. While 36 are nominated by the university chancellor, two are nominated from the Punjab assembly, six are ex-officio members and the remaining 47 are elected.The four-year term of the previous senate had ended on October 31, 2020. While the elections were scheduled in August last year, these were postponed twice by V-C Raj Kumar due to the pandemic.According to the revised dates finalised by PU, the election for the constituencies of principals of technical and professional colleges and the staff of technical and professional colleges will be held on May 3.The polling for the constituencies of professors and associate/ assistant professors of the university teaching departments is scheduled on May 10, while the constituency of heads of affiliated arts colleges will go to polls on May 16. Also, election for the constituency of associate professors/ assistant professors of affiliated arts colleges will take place on May 16.As per the election schedule, polling for the registered graduate constituency, which is the largest among the constituencies of the PU senate, will be held on May 16. The registered graduate constituency has 3,61,879 eligible voters for which polling booths are set up in different states apart from Chandigarh and Punjab.Former senator Navdeep Goyal, who is contesting from faculties, said, “This is a positive step taken by the university in the wake of the high court ruling. The governing body should be in place for the smooth functioning of the university.”Last week, hearing the plea of seven former senators who had moved the high court on December 22 seeking directions to PU to hold the senate polls, the bench of justice Fatehdeep Singh had observed that provisions on governance have been thrown “off to the winds” and the university is being run as a “one-man show”. “No doubt the V-C is empowered to postpone the elections for the time being, but this does not clothe him with unbridled powers to carry on indefinitely when throughout the country elections are being held,” the bench added.PU had earlier written to six states for permission to set up polling booths for the conduct of senate polls. However, only Punjab and Delhi have given permission so far. PU’s official spokesperson Renuka Salwan said, “The other states have been intimated about the directions of the high court for the conduct of senate polls.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/after-hc-rap-panjab-university-announces-senate-poll-schedule-101617737072024.html

With this, the death toll has gone up to 458, with 25 being reported in just six days this month.

07-04-2021||Other||Polling for 404 seats in south ends, high voter turnout||Chennai/Thiruvanthapuram Marking the end of the election cycle, the single-phased polls across 404 seats in Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Puducherry on Tuesday concluded peacefully even as few incidents of clashes and complaints against candidates were reported from some areas. The electoral process, which was held from 7 am to 7 pm, registered a high voter turnout as officials ensured strict security and adherence to Covid-19 protocols. Those arriving at poll stations were provided hand sanitisers to clean their hands and a disposable glove. Some people who arrived without masks were asked to wear one to be able to vote. In Tamil Nadu, a voter turnout of 71.79 per cent was recorded as polling in 234 seats was conducted at a brisk pace across the state. On Tuesday, the state held its first assembly election after the death of two Dravidian stalwarts and former chief ministers M Karunanidhi of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and J Jayalalithaa of All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK). The DMK-led alliance is looking to unseat the AIADMK government after being out of power for 10 years.Chief minister Edapaddi Palaniswami, accompanied by his grandson, cast his vote at Siluvampalayam in his native Salem district and urged all people to do the same. “I request (all) to perform our democratic duty,” he told reporters.Celebrities like Rajinikanth was among the early voters while top actor Vijay rode a bicycle to the polling booth leading to speculation by social media users who asked if it was a subtle ‘sign’ of opposition to rise in fuel prices. His publicist, however, clarified that he cycled as the booth was nearby and he didn’t want to create any parking issues. After visiting a poll booth in Coimbatore, Makkal Needhi Maiam (MNM) chief ministerial candidate Haasan alleged cash distribution and submitted a complaint in this regard. “There is widespread cash distribution. They are giving tokens for it to be exchanged for cash. I got these reports,” he told reporters. Chief electoral officer (CEO) Satyabrata Sahoo sought a report from Chennai district election officer on an AIADMK complaint against DMK chief M K Stalin’s son and Chepauk-Tiruvallikeni candidate Udhayanidhi for sporting the party flag and rising sun symbol on his white shirt. Similarly, the DMK complained against BJP Thousand Lights candidate Khushboo Sundar for coming to the polling station in a car bearing the party flag. DMK candidate for Thondamuthur assembly segment, Karthikeya Shivesenapathy lodged a complaint alleging that he was mobbed by some AIADMK workers, when he was proceeding to a polling station. A minor clash ensued between workers of the two parties which was quickly resolved by local police. Stone pelting was reported in Theni district from where deputy chief minister O Panneerselvam is contesting. His son and Lok Sabha MP O P Ravindranath’s car was reportedly damaged, prompting additional forces to take position in the area. CEO Sahoo, meanwhile, dismissed reports that the electronic voting machines (EVMs) at a polling station in Virudhunagar displayed only a particular symbol regardless of whichever candidate they selected. Only the symbol that was chosen gets recorded in the EVM and the same was corroborated in the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail units, he said.The officer also brushed aside reports that one or two poll officials died during duty.Voters who had tested positive for Covid-19 were allowed to cast their ballot during the last hour of polling (6 pm to 7 pm) and were provided with PPE kits, officials said. DMK MP Kanimozhi, who tested positive for Covid-19 last week, arrived at her polling booth in an ambulance during this period to cast her vote. Kerala, which is witnessing a fierce fight between the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) and Congress-led United Democratic Front (UDF), registered heavy polling with 73.58 per cent of the total 2.4 crore voters casting their franchise in 140 seats. Despite the scorching heat and sporadic rain in many parts, people stood in long queues to take part in the electoral process. Three senior citizens, waiting to cast their vote in Pathanamthitta and Kottayam districts, collapsed and died, officials said.Constituencies in northern Kannur, Kozhikode, Palakkad and Thirssur were among those districts which recorded comparatively higher polling percentage while southern districts like Pathanamthitta and Idukki reported lower percentage, according to people familiar with the developments.Barring a few complaints of bogus voting and altercation between rival party workers, polling turned out to be peaceful in the state where the LDF is attempting to buck the trend of political parties swapping power every five years to return for a historic second consecutive term by beating the UDF. A traditional third in the state’s bipolar politics, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance has also made some swift moves to stay afloat, including naming Metro Man E Sreedharan as its chief ministerial candidate. “The BJP will have an impressive show this time. There’s no doubt about it. I will win from the Palakkad constituency with a big margin. My entry into the BJP has given a different image to the party,” Sreedharan, who is contesting from Palakkad constituency, was quoted as saying by news agency ANI after casting his vote. Senior Congress leader AK Antony believed that the UDF will make a strong comeback. “For the last few days, an anti-government wave is sweeping all over the state. The voters of Kerala will throw LDF out of power. The UDF will come back with thunder. The Congress-led UDF government will be formed in Kerala strengthening Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi in their fight against anti-people policies of the Centre,” he told reporters after casting his vote in the state capital. In Taliparambha in north Kerala, the UDF sought re-polling in several stations, alleging booth capturing and bogus voting. In Kazhakootam (Thiruvananthapuram), a violent clash between Communist Party of India (Marxist) and BJP workers left five persons injured from both camps. The ruling party workers also allegedly manhandled Abdul Rasheed, the UDF’s candidate from Adoor.A presiding officer in Payyanur constituency in Kerala’s Kannur was hospitalised after he was allegedly attacked by CPI(M) activists for reportedly preventing a man from voting without an identity document. Voting was stopped for half an hour and another officer was appointed to replace him. In a month-long campaign, political parties have clashed on contentious issues, including allegations of gold smuggling against some officials in the chief minister’s office and the controversy around the entry of all women in to the Sabarimala Temple. The temple issue, however, returned on polling day after G Sukumaran Nair, general secretary of the Nair Service Society, a socio-educational body of the upper caste Nairs, said devotees were yet to get justice and this would reflect in the assembly results. “The NSS general secretary and opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala gave an impression that the election was a battle between believers and non-believers. Invoking religious issues is against the poll code of conduct,” state law minister A K Balan said in his complaint to the chief electoral officer. For the 30-member Puducherry assembly,81.64 per cent of 1,004,507 electors exercised their franchise to decide the fate of 324 candidates. The Union Territory slipped into a political crisis shortly before the elections were announced, when the Congress-led government fell due to defections.Yanam, where the AINRC leader N Rangasamy is contesting, registered a higher percentage of polling than the other three regions from the beginning. Rangasamy is seeking election to the territorial Assembly from Thattanchavady segment in Puducherry region also.The contest here is keen between the AINRC-led NDA and the Congress-led Secular Democratic alliance.There was tight security across all booths and polling remained peaceful throughout the day.Several leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Congress leaders Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra urged voters to cast their votes. Union home minister Amit Shah and defence minister Rajnath Singh also appealed to voters in the four states and one Union Territory to exercise their franchise in record numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/polling-for-404-seats-in-south-ends-high-voter-turnout-101617736820959.html

07-04-2021||Other||Opposition, party members slam BSY over Covid orders||Bengaluru: The opposition and a section of the Bharatiya Janata Party has hit out at chief minister BS Yediyurappa for his U-turns on Covid-19 related decisions and raised questions over the quality of administration and leadership. “Without any doubt, the government is taking Covid-19 very lightly. We can’t see even 10% of the steps taken during the first 30 days of the pandemic. Apart from there is no consolation or any attempt to take the experts and the Opposition into confidence over the steps taken by the government to fight the pandemic. A decision such as allowing full occupancy in theatres and to open gyms etc is not the right step, but the government is not ready to listen to anyone,” said Congress legislator and former minister HK Patil. A BJP leader, who didn’t want to be named, said that Yediyurappa’s indecisiveness is putting the state government in a difficult position. “Prime Minister Narendra Modi is leading the country by example during the pandemic, but here in our state, the leader is confused. Taking a U-turn has become a trend for the state government. This needs to be changed,” he said. The BS Yediyurappa-led government since the start of the Covid-19 induced national lockdown last year, has reversed its orders quite a number of times, drawing flak from different quarters. On May 3, 2020, during the peak of the nationwide lockdown, the Karnataka government started facilitating Sharmik trains to ferry migrant workers to various states. Just three days later, the BS Yediyurappa-led government decided to stop these trains and within two days reversed this decision. Close to a year later, as the state witnesses a second wave of infections, the government on Sunday decided to reduce the occupancy of movie theatres to 50 % and close down gyms in the state as a preventive measure. But this decision was reversed within a day. These are several such instances when the state government did flip-flops on key decisions on Covid-19 prevention. Yediyurappa’s indecisiveness has been a matter of discussion since the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis. In April 2020, during the lockdown, the government first allowed the movement of two-wheelers and the opening up of the Information Technology (IT) offices with one-third of the workforce. But on April 19, just a day before this decision was to be implemented, the order was rolled back. Within few days, on May 1, 2020, Yediyurappa announced that migrant labourers would have to pay for buses ferrying them. Even this decision was reversed on May 2, 2020, after objections were raised by activists, claiming the bus operators are charging exorbitant fares. Then came the decision to stop the Sharmik trains for migrant workers after a meeting with a real estate delegation on May 6. “The government allegedly told that letting migrants go home would severely hamper developmental, construction and other industrial activities. But when media started showing stories about the migrant workers walking back home since there were no trains, he reversed the decision within two days,” said Vinay Srinivasa, a Bengaluru-based lawyer and activist. The other decision that he reversed were stopping the supply of free food to daily wage workers in government-run Indira Canteens. This decision was pulled back within 24 hours of its announcement on March 23, 2020. Another section of the saffron party, however, argued that this shows that the government believes in course correction based on expert opinion. Defending the chief minister, revenue minister R Ashok said that the situation in the state is changing constantly and the chief minister is taking decisions that would ensure people’s safety and economic activities. “This simply shows that the chief minister is willing to listen to both the health experts and the industry, act without any ego,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/opposition-party-members-slam-bsy-over-covid-orders-101617736520891.html

07-04-2021||Chandigarh||Night curfew back in Chandigarh||Amid a steep surge in Covid-19 cases, the Chandigarh administration on Tuesday decided to enforce night curfew in the city from 10pm to 5am. Formal orders will be issued on Wednesday and will come into effect immediately.During the curfew hours, no gatherings, parties or non-essential activities will be allowed. Even restaurants will be required to close by 10pm.Stricter measures like weekend curfew and closure of apni mandis and other crowded places will also be considered, unless people start abiding by the guidelines for Covid appropriate behaviour, said UT administrator VP Singh Badnore while chairing a review meeting where the decision was taken. He also directed police to ensure strict implementation of the night curfew. The curfew will be reviewed in case the situation improves.The move comes on the day the Centre raised concern over the pandemic situation in Chandigarh.The UT again recorded 300+ cases on Tuesday, with 319 people testing positive. Two deaths were also reported. While more than 1,700 cases have been added to the tally within six days this month, the number of active cases has bumped up to 3,037, among the highest since the outbreak last March. Though 25,375 of the 28,798 people tested positive so far have been cured and discharged, recovery rate has dropped to 88%. On February 13, when the UT had lowest number of active cases (123) this year, recovery rate was 97.7%.‘Big jump in cases for a small UT’Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, during a media briefing in New Delhi on Tuesday, flagged Chandigarh as the only area of concern among small states and union territories. Bhushan said that Chandigarh is a small UT in terms of population as well as area, but Covid-19 cases being reported daily have gone up from less than 20 on an average to 287, while average deaths have remained between 1 to 3.While noting that positivity rate has climbed to 14%, the health secretary appreciated the fact that the share of RT-PCR tests as compared to the lesser reliable antigen tests has increased to 81%.Even on March 24, the Union health ministry had listed Chandigarh among eight states and UTs that have led to an exponential increase in the number of active cases in the country.In response to this, the Centre had deputed a three-member team in the city to assist the local administration. It has observed that contact tracing and vaccination coverage need to be improved, though no formal report has been submitted yet.Get tested, vaccinated: BadnoreDuring the review meeting, Badnore expressed serious concern over the rising numbers. He appealed to market associations to ensure that their employees are tested and vaccinated, as provisions for both are available at government centres for free.He also directed hospitals to ensure that all health workers get themselves vaccinated at the earliest, as the administration is considering withdrawal of priority to frontline workers soon. Coverage stands at 54% and 60% among healthcare and other frontline workers, respectively. While urging eligible citizens to get vaccinated, he directed all to avoid non-essential travel outside the city, keeping in view the high rate of infection spread all over the country.Dr Jasbinder Kaur, director principal, Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, informed Badnore that many patients from Punjab and Haryana who can be easily treated in their district hospitals are unnecessarily travelling to Chandigarh and crowding the hospital beds. She said Sood Dharamshala in Sector 22 will be opened on Wednesday to take care of mild Covid cases. Municipal commissioner KK Yadav said 52 teams have been constituted to conduct sanitation operations across the city and MC teams are tracing on an average 15 contacts of each positive case. The central team had recently told the UT to increase this number of 25-30. 28 new micro-containment zones, total reaches 75 The Chandigarh administration on Tuesday declared 28 more micro-containment zones in the city. With this, the total has increased to 75 within a month, said Arun Gupta, UT home secretary, during the Covid-19 review meeting. Deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar said the affected areas were identified by a committee on the basis of the number of cases being reported from there. While three micro-containment zones have been declared in Sectors 28 and 30, there are two each in Sectors 22, 27, 41 and 44 besides Manimajra (Pipliwala Town and Uppal Apartments). Others are spread across Sectors 10, 11, 19, 20, 46, 48 and 63 besides Ram Darbar, Hallomajra, Kishangarh, Mauli Jagran and Dhanas.Brar said regular screening and monitoring of the areas will continue and frequent sanitisation will be conducted. He also advised the residents to strictly maintain social distancing norms, wear masks and follow hand hygiene. Helpline numbers issuedThe administration has made Covid helpline for patients under home isolation operational at Chandigarh Housing Board office again. The numbers are 7657977818, 7657977819 and 7657977820.Dedicated phone numbers of the help desk at GMSH, Sector 16, are 9779558282, 0172-2752038, 0172-2720105 and 0172-27228703.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/night-curfew-back-in-chandigarh-101617736401814.html
07-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC seeks vigilance response on plea alleging scam in medicine purchase||The Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) has sought response from the Haryana vigilance bureau and Enforcement Directorate (ED) in a plea alleging scam in the purchase of medicine in Haryana.The plea by Hisar resident Jagwinder Singh Kulharia alleges instances of serious offences of the institutionalised form of corruption in the purchase of medicines and medical equipment in at least nine districts in Haryana.It estimates the scam at ₹300 crore and further alleges that the purchases were made from the firms, which were running out of fake addresses. The petition was listed before a single judge bench in February, which forwarded the matter to the chief justice in view of larger public interest involved.On Tuesday, the HC bench of chief justice RS Jha issued notice of motion in the matter in which the vigilance department and ED have been arrayed as parties.The petitioner is a retired deputy superintendent from the health department and claims that he had a “deep knowledge of corruption and money laundering happening in the sale-purchase of medicines and equipment.”The petitioner, through the RTIs, obtained documents on the basis of which he requested the vigilance bureau to register FIRs.However, the department, rather than registering the FIR, disclosed his name and contents of information to the officers who are potential accused in the scam, culminating into the victimisation and threats to the petitioner, the plea alleges before HC seeking probe by the ED.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-seeks-vigilance-response-on-plea-alleging-scam-in-medicine-purchase-101617736289187.html

Deputy CM Dushyant Chautala, who holds the industry department portfolio, was also present.An official spokesperson said that the HEPB granted approval in view of the increasing demand of warehousing from e-commerce companies.According to the state government, the land allotted at ₹3.22 crore per acre to Instakart Services Private Limited, a Flipkart Group company, will give impetus to further investments in the region and boost market access opportunities.“Representatives of Flipkart Group said that Instakart is planning to set up a series of fulfilment centres and associated logistics infrastructure across India to enable its market growth,” the spokesperson said.“To achieve this goal, the company aims to provide best services to customers and is thus planning to construct regional distribution centres (RDC) across country to strengthen its network,” the official added.The company is planning to build a logistics campus in the NCR, in proximity to Gurugram. They are planning to build a campus spread over 140-acre to cater to the demand in North India.“This centre will essentially cater to parcel goods, white goods and furniture,” the spokesperson said.The land has been allotted with the condition that the Haryana State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (HSIIDC) will not provide either external or internal infrastructure for the site and creating it will be the responsibility of the allottee. “Only the infrastructure development charges will be levied,” an official said.The allotment was earlier approved by the executive empowered committee in October last year at ₹3.09 crore per acre bare shell cost.While Flipkart had deposited about ₹22 crore as earnest money, the allotment process was put on hold after the deputy CM had intervened to seek clarifications on the allotment price of ₹3.09 crore per acre.Subsequently, the HEPB had asked the HSIIDC to put a few more warehousing sites for e-auction to explore the market. In January, the HSIIDC had put up four warehousing sites of comparatively smaller sizes for auction, but there was zero response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ecommerce-giant-to-set-up-fulfilment-centre-in-haryana-s-manesar-to-be-one-of-its-largest-centres-in-asia-101617736161757.html

In fact a door-to-door vaccination programme should be chalked out,” the court added.The court also directed the state government to also examine viability of imposing night curfew to check late evening social gatherings. “The state government may also examine viability of providing masks and sanitizers to all by utilising the amount recovered on account of violation of Covid-19 protocol,” the court observed.While listing the next hearing of the case on April 8, the court said the general public should also realise its responsibility towards Covid-19 protocol. Elaborating the need for passing these directives, the court observed, “Though the state government has taken necessary steps to meet the threat of the second wave of Covid-19, but it is noticed that the directions have not been complied with by the public at large and that is an issue of concern. Having considered all the objective conditions, we deem it appropriate to direct the district magistrates of all districts in the state of Uttar Pradesh to ensure strict and definite compliance of the directions issued by the government of Uttar Pradesh from time to time to meet with the threat of Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-second-wave-hc-asks-authorities-to-ensure-cent-percent-face-masking-101617735740845.html

Government officials, essential workers, those travelling to and from airports, railway stations, interstate bus terminals, Covid-19 vaccination centres or hospitals will be exempt from the seven-hour night curfew, according to the order issued by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA).The district magistrate of south zone called an emergency meeting of the district disaster management authority to fix responsibility for each stakeholder. “We have asked the South Delhi Municipal Corporation to ensure that restaurants and other non-essential shops are shut by 10pm. The deputy commissioner of police (DCP) will ensure there is no movement or assembly of people during the curfew hours, except for those exempted,” said a senior district official, who did not wish to be named.Also Read| Traders say Delhi govt should have consulted before announcing night curfewThe south district received around 2,500 applications for e-passes, the official added.Ramchandra Shingare, additional district magistrate (east) said police was asked to barricade roads to ensure restricted movement of traffic.“We have asked Delhi Police for enhanced deployment of staff in the night to implement the curfew. The police will barricade the roads and ensure no movement of people, except the exempted categories, without e-pass,” Shingare said.Sub-divisional magistrates (SDMs) in all districts have been directed to be on the field from 9pm to midnight to monitor the situation, said officials with knowledge of developments. District magistrates have also ordered deployment of administration teams to assist the police.

07-04-2021||Delhi||One arrested over demolition of Sai Baba statue||New Delhi: The Delhi Police on Tuesday said they arrested a 50-year-old man in connection with the demolition of a statue of Shirdi Sai Baba in a temple in South Delhi’s Shahpur Jat last week. Police said the arrested man, identified as Padam Panwar, was purportedly seen in a video clip, which was widely circulated on social media, proclaiming that Sai Baba is a Muslim and not a God.Panwar, a resident of Shahpur Jat, was arrested on Monday, a day after police registered a case under Indian Penal Code sections 153 A (promoting enmity between different groups on grounds of religion, race, place of birth, residence, language, etc., and doing acts prejudicial to maintenance of harmony) and 295 A (deliberate and malicious acts, intended to outrage reli­gious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or reli­gious beliefs), said a senior police officer who did not want to be named.The officer said that police began enquiring into the demolition after receiving a complaint from local devotees on April 3. The first information report was registered on April 4. “Panwar was arrested after his role was confirmed. He has been sent to jail,” the officer added.Police said that during questioning, some people claimed that they intended to replace the statue as it was found to be cracked. However, when HT contacted Panwar, he had said that he decided to get it removed as Sai Baba was a Muslim. “I personally got the statue installed in 2009. But now that I got to know that Sai Baba was a Muslim, I got the statue removed. Sai Baba was no God, he was a common man,” Panwar, who is in the real estate business, had said.In the video doing the rounds of social media, a man is purportedly seen using tools to demolish the statue after which Panwar comes to the fore, and says, “This temple was constructed by my ancestors even before Shirdi Baba was born. But I have got to know he is Muslim. He cannot share the same space that is occupied by Hindu gods.”A video also emerged in which Panwar is purportedly seen in the company of Yati Narsinghanand Saraswati -- a priest of Dasna Devi temple in Ghaziabad -- who was booked by the Delhi Police on Saturday for allegedly making inflammatory comments against the Prophet at a press conference in the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-arrested-over-demolition-of-sai-baba-statue-101617735021989.html
07-04-2021||Delhi||Traders say Delhi govt should have consulted before announcing night curfew||As the clock struck eight, Amrit Kishore quickly packed the last set of cotton t-shirts that were put on display outside his 30-square-feet shop in Sarojini Nagar before he could pull down the shutter and travel nearly 35 kms on his scooter to reach his residence at Jharoda in the southwest Delhi.“It would be better if the government had given us some more time. Traders would be more prepared,” said Kishore, referring to the government announcing a night curfew in the city on Tuesday in the light of a severe spike in the Covid-19 cases in the Capital. On Tuesday, Delhi recorded 5,100 new cases and 17 more deaths.Market associations, traders and business owners across the city said they were not prepared for a curfew with some of them saying that to ensure that they reach home by 10pm, they will have to shut their shops early. Several of them also criticised the government’s move questioning the efficacy of night curfews in arresting the rapid spread of Covid-19.During the seven-hour curfew period, from 10 pm to 5 am, movement of only government officials, healthcare workers, those working for essential services or arriving at airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) and those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination or any medical treatment will be allowed“We hardly got time to initiate an awareness drive. People learnt about the night curfew after they arrived in the market today. We still managed to ensure that all shops are closed by 8.30pm. On usual days, they wrap up by 10 pm. Several traders come from faraway places such as Ghaziabad and Gurugram. The night curfew will pose additional challenges for them,,” said Ashok Randhawa, president of Sarojini Nagar mini market welfare association.Devraj Baweja, general secretary of confederation of Sadar Bazar traders’ association, said it was a difficult task today to ensure that the market closed exceptionally early on Tuesday. “Also, the news of the night curfew spread panic among traders and workers. The government should have done this in a more systematic manner and given more time to the traders,” Baweja said.The night curfew meant restaurants, bars and pubs in the city had to wrap up quickly for Tuesday and make plans for the days ahead.Manpreet Singh, treasurer of the National Restaurants Association of India, said the government should have held discussions with hotels and restaurant groups before taking the decision. “I personally do not see a solution in night curfews, especially when the central government has also said that such a curb is not much efficient. It will adversely affect hotels and restaurants which are already in poor shape because of the pandemic and lockdown.”The night curfew also means several hotels now have to make special arrangements for clients who had already booked halls for weddings and private functions this month.Rohit Arora, area general manager of The Park hotel in Connaught Place said, “We adopted flexible timings for weddings and other events. We have rescheduled the events to a couple of hours earlier, which allows both the guests to enjoy their event and us to be a law-abiding entity. We are sensitive about guest security and place utmost importance on safety and hygiene, hence in case of weddings, we are requesting guests to stay back in our hotel rooms for the night. As far as dining is concerned, our in-house guests are welcome to eat till midnight. We stand both by the law and order and our patrons to operate smoothly.”Several banquet hall and hotel owners in the city said that they started calling up their clients after the news of the night curfew broke out on Tuesday, telling them that they will have to wrap up the celebrations by 10 pm now.“Several clients were already agitated after the government limited the number of guests in marriage functions. Now the night curfew order means they will have to wrap up their limited celebrations too by 10 pm. It is getting difficult for us to convince them. But it is a government order and has to be followed,” said Purushottam Kalra, president of Shamiyana Dealer Vyapar Sudhar Samiti – an association of banquet halls in the city.Last month, the government imposed a cap of maximum 200 guests for marriage functions hosted outdoors, 100 for indoors and 50 for funerals.Sandeep Khandelwal of Delhi hotels and restaurants owners’ association said: “The government should have talked to hotel, restaurant and banquet hall owners before taking this call. Compliance was difficult on Tuesday because the order was issued on such short notice. But the coming days will pose financial challenges. The hospitality industry is already in poor shape.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/traders-say-govt-should-have-consulted-before-announcing-curfew-101617735021364.html

Kejriwal also visited a redesigned road stretch, which is being redeveloped on a pilot basis, near Sriniwaspuri in south Delhi to review the project.The instructions were issued by the CM on Tuesday, during a meeting to review the status of the ongoing road redesigning and streetscaping project.“The process of designing the roads should be done in a swift manner and the project should be completed within the stipulated deadline, i.e., by 2023. The PWD should ensure the removal of all obstacles, the project needs to be completed in two years. The tender process and other formalities should be completed as soon as possible for rapid completion of the project,” Kejriwal said in a statement issued by the government. PWD officials assured the chief minister that the tender process would be completed in the one to two months and work would begin by the middle of this year, a statement issued by the government said. The government further said that considerable progress has been made on a 35km stretch under the pilot project. The deadline to complete the pilot projects is October 2021. “Redevelopment of about 5.5 km-long road from Ring Road (AIIMS) to Ashram has been completed. Redevelopment of about 6 km of road from Wazirpur Depot Crossing to Rithala Metro Station is ongoing. Work is also underway on a road of about 5.2 km from Britannia Chowk to Outer Ring Road in Pitampura’s West Enclave area. Similarly, the work of beautification of a 3.1-km-long road from Shivdaspuri Marg to Patel Road, Moti Nagar T-Point to Pusa Road and Laxmi Nagar to Karkari Mor on Vikas Marg is underway,” the statement said. It added that the work will be completed by the end of this year. The government further said that redesigning of roads will eliminate bottlenecks and improve aesthetics of the road stretch. “Currently, a road turns from four lanes to three lanes or from six lanes to four lanes. This suddenly increases the pressure of vehicles at a place on the road and creates a bottleneck. After redesigning of roads, this problem will be eradicated by improving the geometry of roads. The space alongside the roads will be optimised. Sidewalks will be created and a separate segment for non-motorised vehicles will also be made,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cm-orders-speeding-up-redesigning-of-major-arterial-roads-101617735020755.html
07-04-2021||Delhi||Only those involved in essential services to be allowed on Metro, DTC buses||New Delhi: Only those identified as essential service providers will be allowed to take public transport such as the Metro and DTC buses between 10pm and 5am during which a curfew will remain in effect to curb the rising Covid-19 cases in the city, an order by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) says.Officials of the Delhi Transport Corporation (DTC) and the Delhi Integrated Multi-Modal Transit System (DIMTS) Limited that run the 6,600-odd state-run buses in the city, and the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said their operations will continue as usual, but entry of passengers will be strictly regulated on the basis of ID cards and e-passes after 10pm.The DMRC advised commuters to plan their travel according to the restrictions and reach their destinations by 10pm.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communications, DMRC, said, “In view of the imposition of night curfew in Delhi starting tonight, entry in Metro from 10pm to 5am will be allowed only to those passengers who fall in essential category as per govt order, after verification of their valid IDs by DMRC or CISF personnel.”Metro users commuting between Delhi and NCR will have to plan travel as it takes over an hour to complete end-to-end journey on Yellow line (Samaypur Badli to HUDA city centre) and Blue line (Noida City centre to Dwarka sector 21). There are no restrictions on public movement in Noida, Ghaziabad and Gurugram.After the DMRC tweeted a travel advisory after the DDMA order, commuters posted several queries regarding the restrictions. “What if someone boards a train at 9:30 and has an hour long journey, Would you throw him out at 10PM?” tweeted KD Singh in response to DMRC’s travel advisory.In DTC buses, officials said, marshals and conductors will enforce the night curfew. A DTC spokesperson said, “The corporation will follow the DDMA order in letter and spirit. Our major bus operations happen during the morning hours, while during the night, the frequency and the number of buses on the road is comparatively less. Bus marshals and conductors will be responsible for checking the IDs and e-passes of passengers,” said the spokesperson.A senior transport department official said cluster buses will be available only for passengers involved in essential services and those falling in the exempted category carrying valid ID cards or e-passes. Delhi has around 2,900 cluster buses which operate between 4.30am and 11.30pm. “This timings will remain the same,” the official said.The official said the same rule will apply to cabs and auto-rickshaws. “In general, there will be fewer cabs and autos available because demand will reduce as most people will stay indoors post 10 pm. The Delhi police and enforcement officers from the district magistrate’s offices will do random checks on the roads. So, it is better to avoid venturing out during the night, unless it’s a health emergency,” the official said.Uber and Ola did not comment on the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-those-involved-in-essential-services-to-be-allowed-on-metro-dtcbuses-101617734962285.html

As part of the much-delayed Chandni Chowk redevelopment project, a 1.3km stretch of the main road between Red Fort and Fatehpuri mosque has been completely pedestrianised. The stretch is likely to be inaugurated on slated for inauguration on April 17, after which entry of all motorised vehicles will be banned on it between 9am and 9pm. While reviewing the ongoing work on Tuesday, Jain said that vehicles such as ambulances, fogging vehicles, police vans, bank cash and security vans, and those providing essential services will be allowed on to the revamped area. He also directed officials to create standard operating procedures (SOPs) for essential and emergency services in the area. “Chandni Chowk is a historical site. It has been made beautiful to promote tourism and it is the responsibility of all of us to maintain its beauty. It is the responsibility of Delhi Police to ensure that rules are followed. It will be the responsibility of the local police to ban the entry of motor vehicles in the restricted area,” said Jain in a statement, shared by the government on Tuesday. He added that only authorised manual rickshaws, color-coded in a particular style, will be allowed to enter the revamped stretch. Shopkeepers in the area too will be allowed to move their wares only on these rickshaws. While the redevelopment project was proposed in 2006, work on the project finally started in December 2018 following the directions and under monitoring of the Delhi high court. In December 2018, Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia laid the foundation stone for the project. During the first phase of the project, utilities such as electric cables have been shifted underground, with facilities such as toilets and benches for sitting being provided. CCTV and streetlights in the area are yet to be completely installed. On Tuesday, Jain also instructed officials to install powerful LEDs in the area since the current lights on the stretch were feeble in terms of security considerations. Nitin Panigrahi, deputy general manager, Shahjahanabad Redevelopment Corporation (SRDC), which is the nodal agency for the redevelopment project, said that finishing touches were being given ahead of the inauguration of the 1.3-km stretch on April 17. “The inauguration is scheduled for April 17 and whatever work remains will be completed by then,” said Panigrahi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/emergency-vehicles-to-be-allowed-in-revamped-chandni-chowk-stretch-jain-101617734961224.html
07-04-2021||Delhi||Admission process for EWS, disabled students in entry-level classes begins today||The online registration process for admission to entry-level classes for seats reserved under the reserved economically weaker section (EWS), disadvantaged groups (DG), and children with disabilities categories for the academic session 2021-22 in the city’s private schools will begin from Wednesday, the Delhi government said.Under the Right to Education (RTE) Act of 2009, at least 25% of seats in entry-level classes — nursery, kindergarten, and Class 1— have to be reserved for EWS/DG (22%) and children with disabilities (3%). HT had on Sunday reported that while the new academic session had started in schools across the national capital last week, the admission process for these 25% reserved seats was delayed, causing anxiety among parents seeking to enrol their children in private schools.Officials at the DoE had cited the Covid-19 pandemic as the reason behind the delay in starting admissions for the reserved seats. This year, the application process for 75% general category seats too had been delayed by over two months due to the pandemic.According to a notification released by the Directorate of Education (DoE) on Tuesday, the forms for reserved categories will be available on the official website (edudel.nic.in) from Wednesday, and the last date of submission of the same will be April 26. The first list of selected candidates will be released on April 30. Applicants have been asked to file only one application. “Multiple applications filed by any individual applicant shall lead to cancellation of candidature of the applicant, even after succeeding in the draw of lots,” the notification said.All private schools affiliated by the three municipal corporations — north, south, and east — as well as the New Delhi Municipal Council (NDMC) will also be in the computerised admission system.The DoE has fixed an upper age limit of 5, 6, and 7 years as of March 31, 2021, for admission in nursery, kindergarten, and Class 1, respectively. The minimum age for admission in these classes is 3, 4, and 5 years as of March 31, 2021, respectively. However, the upper age limit for children with disabilities is 9 years for admission to these classes.Families having less than an annual income of ₹1 lakh can apply for admission under the EWS category. “Any person residing in Delhi, having the residence proof of Delhi and requisite Income Certificate (less than one lakh rupees annually) issued by the Revenue Department of GNCT of Delhi, BPL/AAY( ration card/ food security cardholder) are eligible for applying in these private unaided recognized schools for admission of their ward under EWS category,” the notification read.Under the disadvantaged groups category, Schedule Caste, Schedule Tribe, Other Backward Class (non-creamy layer), orphans, transgender, and all children living with or affected by HIV, can apply, according to the DoE notification. Applicants under the children with disabilities category must have to submit a disability certificate issued from a government hospital as per the guidelines issued under the Right of Persons With Disabilities Act, 2016.“Income certificate is also not required for applicant sunder Children with Disabilities Category,” the notification added.Meanwhile, some experts raised concerns over the short period for the application process this year. Ekramul Haque of Mission Taleem, an organization working with EWS children in Delhi, said, “It will be very difficult for poor children to fill forms at such short notice. It has to be opened for at least a month. Poor children should not be made to pay for the lack of planning and foresight of the education department.”Anil Kumar, a labourer at Molarband extension in Badarpur who is seeking admission for his sons, aged 5 and 6, said he was relieved that the government initiated the admission process for reserved category.“I was really worried due to the delay in the commencement of admission process. I just hope that my sons get seats in a good private school under the EWS category,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/admission-process-for-ews-disabled-students-in-entry-level-classes-begins-today-101617734960721.html

The couple was out for an evening stroll when the accident took place at around 6.30 pm. The accident was captured in a CCTV camera installed at a mosque across the road.The driver, identified as Deepakshi Choudhary, was arrested and booked for rash driving or riding in a public way and causing death by negligence, a case regarding which was registered under Indian Penal Code’s Sections 304A and 279 at Dwarka South police station. Choudhary, who works in a multinational company, was later released on bail from the police station itself. Her grey Baleno car involved in the accident was impounded by the police.The dead couple was identified as Shanti Swaroop Arora and his wife Anjana Arora. They lived in Appu Enclave in Sector-11, Dwarka and their children are settled in the US. Choudhary lives in the same society, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said.There were claims that Chaudhary was learning how to drive when the accident took place. However, the information could not be verified independently. Quoting Chaudhary’s statement on how the accident took place, DCP Meena said she told the police that she was thinking about something and lost focus because of which she lost control over the vehicle.Police said Chaudhary did not flee the mishap spot and accompanied the injured couple to the hospital. She was at the hospital when the police team reached there after receiving a call about the accident.In the 6.09 minutes video footage, the couple is seen walking on Masjid Wali Road and two more men are seen there. After crossing the building on which the CCTV is installed, the couple takes a U-turn and go to the left side of the road when suddenly, a grey car moving at a slow speed in the middle of the road starts moving towards them and hit them. The couple falls on the road and the car runs over them. While the elderly man is trapped under the car, his wife is struck under in the back portion of the vehicle, the video shows.The footage shows two people rushing towards the car as the driver comes out and go where the woman’s body is seen trapped under the vehicle. Chaudhary can then be seen taking out her cellphone from the car and calling someone frantically.More people rushed to the accident site and pushed the car to rescue the woman trapped underneath. After she was taken aside, some people tried to lift the front portion of the car to take out the injured man. However, when they failed, the went towards the driver side and again tried to lift the vehicle a bit to pull the man from under the vehicle.Sheikh Abdullah, who was involved in the rescue operation, said he had come to the mosque to perform evening prayers when he heard a commotion outside and rushed to see what happened.“It was horrible. The elderly man was injured but conscious while I rushed him to a nearby hospital in my car. On the way, he was talking to me and saying he had suffered fractures in his left hand. He also enquired about his wife and asked me to stop my car so that he could see if his wife was also being taken to the hospital. She was unconscious and taken to the hospital in the same car that ran over her,” said Abdullah, who runs a diagnostic centre in Palam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/elderly-couple-run-over-by-car-in-dwarka-succumb-to-injuries-101617734842295.html

07-04-2021||Delhi||One killed as girder falls on parked trucks||A 50-year-old watchman was killed after a concrete and iron girder of an under-construction railway bridge fell on four trucks in west Delhi’s Dayabasti near Punjabi Bagh on Tuesday morning, police said.Police identified the victim as Ram Bahadur, who worked as a watchman for trucks parked underneath the bridge. “He was sleeping in one of the trucks on which the beam fell. He was crushed to death,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (west) Prashant Priya Gautam.While a statement issued by the northern railway claimed the girder fell “during construction of a grade separator at Dayabasti”, police said that no construction work was going on at the site for the past one and a half years or so.Police said Bahadur, who hailed from Fatehpur in Uttar Pradesh, was living in Ashoka Park near Mata Mandir in Punjabi Bagh. While a few locals reached the spot after the collapse “around 10 pm”, a police officer, who did not want to be named, said that the locals didn’t reach out to them as it was dark and they did not notice anyone trapped under the girder.In the morning, when Bahadur did not return home, his family members went to the spot along with some locals and found him trapped in one of the damaged trucks. His nephew called the police and informed about the incident, the officer said.In the statement, the railways said that the grade separator at Dayabasti is being constructed by one of the agencies of northern railway and the work is in progress. Around 10 pm on Monday, one of the girders launched for the viaduct of the grade separator fell down, damaging some of the unauthorised vehicles parked below it, the statement said.“Further investigation by the police is going on to find out any casualty/trapped person below the fallen girder. Reasons for the incidence is being examined,” the statement read.Delhi Fire Services (DFS) chief Atul Garg said that two fire tenders along with the rescue teams were also sent to the spot. Apart from the local Punjabi Bagh police, teams of disaster management and CATS ambulance also reached the mishap spot. The girder was removed using a hydraulic crane, following which Bahadur’s body was taken out and shifted to a government hospital mortuary. Police said a case was registered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-killed-as-girder-falls-on-parked-trucks-101617734783084.html
07-04-2021||Delhi||RWAs promise all help to authorities as Covid night curfew begins||Resident Welfare Associations of the city said they will ensure that all colony gates are closed early, as well as extend all possible cooperation to the police and district administration officials to ensure that no Covid-19 protocols are violated during the night curfew, which comes into effect from Tuesday.Several RWAs, on Tuesday, started sharing messages about the night curfew on their WhatsApp groups, along with copies of the government order, while appealing to the residents to adhere to rules, they said.The Delhi government on Tuesday imposed a night curfew — that will be in place every day from 10pm to 5am — in order to arrest the rapid spread of Covid-19 in the city. Delhi on Tuesday added 5,100 fresh cases, at the back of 103,453 tests, returning a positivity rate of 4.93%The night curfew will be in place at least till April 30. During the seven-hour curfew period, movement of only government officials, health care workers, those working for essential services or arriving at airports, railway stations or interstate bus terminals (ISBTs) and those travelling for Covid-19 vaccination or any medical treatment will be allowed, said the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) in its order.“We will ensure that the colony and park gates are closed early and limit entry-exit points after 10pm. Food delivery service providers will be asked to call clients on reaching the colony gates so that even if they get access, they do not have to walk into buildings looking out for addresses floor by floor. Residents can step out and pick up their food orders if needed,” said Rajiv Kakria, member of the residents’ welfare group in Greater Kailash-1.Saurabh Gandhi, general secretary of United Residents of Delhi, which is a collective of around 1,800 RWAs in the city, said: “For residential areas which have proper gates, adhering to a night curfew is not that difficult. The problem is with those which do not have gates and those close to market areas. In these areas, the RWAs have to invest a lot of effort to ensure compliance.”“In such areas, the RWAs have to work closely with the police and district administration. They help decide where temporary barricades are to be installed, which access routes should be kept open and what mechanisms should be in place for emergencies. The WhatsApp groups play an important role. In these groups, the RWAs also share with their residents, updates on Covid-19 in their area, which gives them a fair idea of the situation and helps in ensuring adherence to regulations,” said BS Vohra, president of the East Delhi RWA front – another collective of resident groups.Amit Agarwal of United Residents Joint Action, a collective of around 2,700 RWAs in the city, said: “RWAs in the city are always there to help the government implement regulations that are aimed at controlling Covid-19. But the government should consider consulting them before regulations, such as the night curfew, are drafted.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/rwas-promise-all-help-to-authorities-as-covid-night-curfew-begins-101617734782368.html
07-04-2021||Delhi||As new cases rise, police step up watch on Covid violators||New Delhi:As Covid-19 cases are steadily increasing across the city, prompting the state government to impose night curfew starting Tuesday, prosecution data related to violation of Covid-19 guidelines shows police have caught at least 1,800-2,000 persons every day over the past few days.Until last month, police were issuing fines to only around 130-160 persons every day for violating Covid measures, such as the use of mask and social distancing, which have been set in place to reduce the spread of the infection. With night curfew already in place to tackle the fourth wave, Delhi police officers said that they have increased enforcement across the city.Data on police prosecution, seen by HT, shows that in February, when the positivity rate had reached a low of 0.17% (February 16) and cases had declined, only 40 persons were fined on an average each day for not wearing masks. The Covid-19 cases started increasing since mid-February and in March, at least 501 persons were fined every day. The average figure has now increased to at least 1,718 every day ( between April 1 and 6).To be clear, the daily prosecution number is close to what it was during the third wave of the infection in October-November. Delhi was recording a daily average of 3,451 new cases in October and 6,122 in November.Police data shows that in the past five days, cases have been registered against a wide spectrum of people, ranging from the owner of a small eatery in Gole Market to the management of a posh resto bar in Connaught Place. Apart from this, at least three persons were fined inside a city five-star hotel for not wearing masks and a night club owner in west Delhi was also fined for not adhering to the guidelines.While the first offence only attracts a fine, police said they would register an FIR if the person continues to violate the guidelines.“For those not following Covid-appropriate behaviour, we are registering cases under the Indian Penal Code and the Epidemic Disease Act. This includes owners of shops, restaurants and the places where they were not adhering to social distancing norms. Separately, we are issuing fines of ₹2,000 to those who are not wearing masks,” said deputy commissioner of police and Delhi police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.The DCP said that separate teams have been formed in every police station to ensure that residents are following social distancing norms, especially in the evening when restaurants and markets see a high footfall. “The number of teams to check on Covid enforcement at each police station has also increased. Our aim is not to fine citizens but to ensure that they follow Covid-appropriate behaviour, so that the infection is under control,” he said.During the weekend, police had registered at least 17 FIRs during a special drive on checking for violations. In west Delhi alone, especially in restaurants at Rajouri Garden, Raja Garden and Tilak Nagar, police conducted inspections and fined owners/management of 14 establishments for violating the guidelines. The enforcement, police said, would be inside the establishments as well as on the road.With people arguing and refusing to pay ₹2,000 fines, police have also started taking videos of violators. “We are recording the videos as evidence in cases, where people contest and refuse to accept that they were not wearing masks or violating social distancing. We are inspecting banquet halls, restaurant, and night clubs where the footfall is very high in the evening hours,” a police officer, who did not wish to be named said.During the first three waves of the infection, the fine was only ₹500. The fine was increased to ₹2,000 on November 19, last year, when government and police agencies realised that citizens were not willing to follow the mask rule during the third wave.The Delhi government had on Friday said that the city was witnessing the fourth wave of the infection. For the last 10 days, the city has recorded 2,923 cases on an average each day. Police said the enforcement on roads will increase until the fourth wave of the infection recedes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/as-new-cases-rise-police-step-up-watch-on-covid-violators-101617734781768.html
07-04-2021||Other||HC seeks clarity on plan to demolish Lal Masjid||New Delhi: The Delhi high court on Tuesday sought to know from the Centre and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) by Wednesday if they had plans to demolish the Lal Masjid, an ancient mosque situated on a disputed land near Lodhi Road in the national capital.Justice Sanjeev Sachdeva, while hearing a plea by the Delhi Waqf Board challenging the demolition order of the ancient mosque alongside the Link Road in Aliganj village, adjourned the matter to Wednesday after the counsel for the Centre sought time to take instructions.The judge said that he is ready to give as much time as possible but the status should not change.“I will give you as much time as you want, but don’t change the status. We will have it tomorrow, but you should not come tomorrow and say, ‘Sorry, we have demolished the building’. I will then haul up your officials for contempt,” the court remarked during the hearing.The plea filed through advocate Wajeeh Shafiq, for the Waqf Board, has said that the authorities have asked them to vacate the mosque for its demolition even though the land dispute is pending in the Waqf Tribunal.The petition has also said that the land in question has been occupied for the graveyard and Lal Masjid “since time immemorial”. However, in 2017, the land of the graveyard was taken by the authorities, a dispute which is pending adjudication in the Waqf Tribunal.On Tuesday, appearing for the board, senior advocate Sanjoy Ghose, told the court that the land dispute has been pending since 2017 and has still not been decided because of various problems with the Waqf Tribunal, including the Tribunal stopping work twice due to problems in its constitution.Senior advocate Ghose also said that even though the Tribunal was made functional and appointments were made after court orders, it again stopped operations since December 2020, due to problems in its constitution and a vacancy of two members.He said that the authorities are taking advantage of this situation and on March 31, the SHO of Basti Nizamuddin police station visited the mosque and allegedly said that it will be demolished to use the area for the CRPF canteen, barracks for men and parking of CRPF vehicles, among others. He also allegedly asked the Imam to vacate the mosque.Ghose sought that the Tribunal be constituted and the matter be decided before taking any untoward step.The Delhi government, represented by advocate Jawahar Raja, told the court that the appointment of the members in the Waqf Tribunal will be completed within four weeks. The court took the statement on record and posted the matter for further hearing on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-seeks-clarity-on-plan-to-demolish-lal-masjid-101617734781204.html

The railway crossing, DDA officials said, is a major traffic choke point.Puri tweeted, “In this era where completion of projects on time is the new norm, I was delighted that the Road Overbridge at Narela for which foundation stone was laid on 29 Dec 2017, was inaugurated today.”The six-lane elevated corridor has been constructed on Urban Extension Road-1, around 2.5 km away from NH-4. This will connect NH-44 (GT Karnal Road) and Bawana-Auchandi Road. Nearly 80,000 vehicles pass through the railway crossing daily.The project, DDA officials said, is crucial for the development of Narela where the land-owning agency has close to 30,000 flats under various stages of construction. DDA is planning to develop Narela as the next sustainable sub-city and is a priority area.“Funds have been allocated for transport infrastructure projects... [like] the DMRC’s Rithala-Narela corridor with Alipur in Narela. We have also allocated funds for the construction of UER –II stretch in Delhi that is being executed by the NHAI,” said a DDA official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/flyover-inaugurated-in-narela-101617734723011.html
07-04-2021||Delhi||‘New curriculum till Class 8 in some east Delhi schools’||The Delhi government is planning to introduce its new curriculum on a pilot basis for students up to Class 8 in its east district’s zone number two schools in July, officials familiar with the development said on Tuesday.The east district’s zone number two has over 60 schools spread across areas such as Mayur Vihar, Trilokpuri, Mandawali, Ashok Nagar, Patparganj, and IP extension, among others.The Delhi government had in last July formed a committee — Delhi Curriculum Reform Committee — for the creation of a new curriculum for children up to the age of 14 years in line with the globally renowned best practices and educational reforms. The committee was mandated to re-imagine the current curriculum, pedagogical practices and provide a roadmap for an innovative, student-friendly module for pre-primary, primary, and upper primary classes in Delhi schools.A senior official of the government’s education department, who wished not to be named, said, “The government has contemplated on piloting the curriculum it is creating from the public schools of a particular zone in east Delhi . The idea behind implementing the curriculum in a pilot way is to figure out what challenges can come and how they can be ironed out.”A member of the curriculum reform committee, also requesting anonymity, said that the project will be implemented on a pilot basis from July onwards in the east Delhi district’s zone-2. “The curriculum is only for students of nursery to Class 8, and therefore it won’t be very challenging to implement. The curriculum is very transformative. It will bring out a very new learning system among the children of Delhi. The committee is meeting on April 8 to discuss further details of its implementation, including training of teachers,” the committee member said.Seema Singh Rathi, principal of Sarvodya Kanya Vidyalaya in Mayur Vihar said, “We have heard that our zone is likely to be the first to implement the Delhi government’s new curriculum. However, we have not received any official communication yet. If implemented, it will be a great opportunity for our teachers and students.”The Delhi government has also announced the implementation of its own education board — known as Delhi Board of School Education (DBSE) — in 20-25 schools from this academic session onwards. “The government is yet to finalise the names of the 20-25 schools. However, the new education board will be implemented in schools situated in different districts,” the education department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-may-introduce-new-curriculum-on-pilot-basis-in-some-east-delhi-schools-from-july-101617734721684.html
07-04-2021||Delhi||Affluent pockets have high caseload, more hot spots||New Delhi: South Delhi district has the highest number of active Covid-19 cases and micro-containment zones as on April 4, a weekly summary of the cases of the viral infection and the hot spots in the national capital prepared by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) shows.Of the 12,050 total Covid-19 active cases as on April 4 evening, 1,916 were in south Delhi, followed by 1,570 in south-west Delhi and 1,559 each in south-east and north-west districts in the city. The lowest number of cases are in neighbouring districts of northeast Delhi (220) and Shahdara (539), the DDMA report showed.Also, as on April 4 evening, the report showed, of the 3,090 containment zones in the city, 749 were in south Delhi – the highest among the 11 revenue districts.According to Delhi government’s daily bulletin, the total active cases in the capital on Tuesday stood at 17,332. The city reported 5,100 fresh cases on Tuesday -- the highest this year -- which came on the back of 103,453 tests -- the maximum ever.As the Capital faces what experts call a fourth wave of Covid infections, the total number of active cases rose to 17,332 and total number of containment zones to 3,291 on Tuesday, the government’s daily health bulletin said. On Tuesday, the city recorded 5,100 new cases -- the highest daily spike in cases this year.Senior officials in the revenue and health departments said that at this particular juncture, several affluent colonies in the city have a disproportionately high caseload, which also reflects in the high number of micro-containment zones created in these areasDistricts such as south Delhi, south-east Delhi, south-west Delhi and north-west Delhi – which top the list in terms of caseload – have relatively high number of planned colonies, gated communities and high-income localities, compared to districts such as north-east Delhi and Shahdara, which mostly have densely populated low-income group colonies and unplanned neighbourhoods.Some of the localities that have been identified by the DDMA as high caseload areas include Vasant Kunj, Pitampura, Greater Kailash I & II, Dwarka, Rohini, Paschim Vihar, Vasant Vihar, Mukherjee Nagar, RK Puram and Lajpat Nagar, senior officials said, adding that each of these areas have 30 to 70 containment zones.Delhi’s health minister Satyendar Jain said the government has scaled up testing and micro-containment efforts in these areas. “Experts have told us that in the previous waves of Covid-19 in the city, the densely populated areas witnessed extremely high caseload. So, the antibody prevalence is likely to be higher in those areas. That is one reason why in this particular wave so far, affluent colonies are witnessing high number of cases.”Rajiv Kakria, member of the residents’ welfare group in Greater Kailash-1, said they were helping the government in efforts to curb the spread of the infection.“In colonies with a high number of cases, resident groups are helping with organising test camps, ensuring delivery of essential goods to doorsteps of home isolated patients, making separate arrangements for garbage collection from residences of patients and conducting awareness camps to boost the vaccination drive.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said, “The government’s assessment makes sense in this regard. In the previous surge in cases recorded in last November, which was the worst so far, we have seen the virus rage through densely populated neighbourhoods, with disproportionately higher cases emerging in slums, unauthorised colonies and low-income localities. So, at this point of time, the antibody prevalence is likely to be high in such areas. That means, affluent colonies are likely to witness relatively high cases.”More than 56% of the 28,000 people sampled during Delhi’s fifth serological survey in late-January this year were found to have developed antibodies against the Sars-CoV-2 virus.In 2020, Delhi witnessed three distinct phases of severe spikes in Covid-19 cases – in June, September and November. At its worst, the Capital recorded 8,593 new cases in a day on November 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/affluent-pockets-have-high-caseload-more-hot-spots-101617734722305.html
07-04-2021||Other||Surge continues, city records 5100 fresh Covid cases||New DelhiThe Covid graph in the city continued its steep upward climb on Tuesday, with the number of daily cases breaching 5,000-mark — first time since November-end . The city on Tuesday recorded 5,100 cases and 17 deaths due to the viral infection, as reported in Delhi’s daily health bulletin. The increase in cases has been sharper during the “fourth wave” – as the Delhi government refers to the current surge, with the numbers rising from under 1,000 to over 5,000 in just 15 days. . Experts, however, say this is the second spike that the city is witnessing.Despite the high number of cases, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among total tested – remained below 5% due to the high number of tests conducted. The city reported a positivity rate of 4.93% on Tuesday, with 103,453 test having been conducted the previous day, as per the health bulletin. Tuesday was the first time the city has seen over 100,000 tests in a day. “The number of cases has definitely gone up faster this time around. This is because many people who are positive are moving around and restaurants and gyms are open. Normally, there is a surge in cases within 60 to 100 days of easing of restrictions. This is the natural behaviour of the virus. And, this is likely to continue till April or maybe May,” said Dr SK Sarin, director of Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences. He headed Delhi government’s first committee on control and management of Covid-19 cases. He added that the number of cases this time might cross the numbers seen during the peak of November. Delhi had reported 8,593 cases on November 11, the highest till date for the city. In addition to the night curfew, Sarin feels that the restaurants should only open outdoor seating or give takeaways. “Restaurants and bars lead to the spread of the infection; you have to remove your mask if you have to eat or drink. An interesting study from the Columbia district in Washington DC showed that when restaurants were opened up after following strict masking norms, the number of cases increased ten-folds and number of deaths five-fold in 100 days,” he said. The experts said that asymptomatic transmission was a major cause of concern during the current surge. “It has now been established that nearly 60% of the transmission can happen from asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases. Targeting only those with symptoms, such as fever, is not good enough. We need to trace more contacts and quarantine them,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonary medicine at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He is currently the chairman PSRI Institute of Pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine. He added, “The pool of people transmitting silently will only increase as more and more people get vaccinated. This is because those who receive even one shot get some amount of immunity and are likely to have milder symptoms. They are also likely to not get tested and hence transmit it on to others.” Dr Sarin agreed, adding, “The antibodies which form after an infection or immunisation are almost same. And, over 50% of Delhi’s population is seropositive. They are moving around and if they get the infection, and they can, they will have mild symptoms and may pass on the infection to others.” Both said there is a need to increase vaccination. With the Centre opening up vaccination for everyone over the age of 45 years, Delhi’s drive has picked up pace. A record 87,678 doses were administered on Monday, of which 73% were given at government facilities, said Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain. As per provisional reports, 74,642 doses were administered on Tuesday. This comes a day after the government announced that at least one-third of the vaccination centres in 33 Delhi government hospitals will run 24*7 Tuesday onwards. “95% of the total slots in government centres were utilised as compared to 67% in private hospitals. The trend was the opposite initially when the vaccination drive had begun. However, people are now happy with the facilities in government centres and are coming there,” said Jain. So far, 1.38 million persons in Delhi have been administered at least one shot of the vaccine. As the cases increase, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences has stopped walk-in registrations at its out-patient clinics which had been restarted in December. “To optimise diversion of available manpower and material resources for the care and treatment of … Covid-19 disease, it has been decided to temporarily close down routine walk-in OPD … registrations,” read an order from the medical superintendent of the hospital. The clinics will continue to follow up with their existing patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/surge-continues-city-records-5100-fresh-covid-cases-101617734721122.html

The repairs of roads all over Goa is (now) being undertaken on a war footing,” transport minister Mauvin Godinho said. The Motor Vehicles Act , which became law back in 2019 after it was passed by Parliament, involves steeper fines running into thousands of rupees. It was not adopted by the state government after a backlash by the public over demand for ‘decent’ roads. “We are going to adopt the new Motor Vehicle Act which was long overdue. The new MV Act will be implemented from May 1 and we are going to use this intervening period to bring about an awareness about its implementation,” Godinho added. The state government has notified the new law which would now mean that road users will have to pay steeper fines ranging from ₹1,000 for failing to wear seat belts, to ₹10,000 for not allowing emergency vehicles to pass with an even higher fee for a second subsequent offence. “All ADTs (assistant directors of transport) are going to hold programmes in their respective jurisdictions to educate people on traffic rules. The simple narrative is going to be, ‘if you don’t break the rules, there is no question of paying fine’,” Godinho said. Goa’s vehicle density is among the highest in the country with the vehicle to population ratio nearly at 1:1 with more than 14-lakh vehicles on the roads for a population that is a little over 15-lakh.The Opposition has, however, alleged that the conditions of the roads are not satisfactory for the implementation of the Act.“Bankrupt @BJP4Goa Government which has failed to provide proper motorable roads now increases fines for traffic violations further pushing common man into financial disaster. Will @goacm take responsibility of casualties & fatal accidents due to bad infrastructure?” Leader of Opposition, Digambar Kamat tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-to-belatedly-implement-new-motor-vehicle-act-from-may-1-101617723140745.html
07-04-2021||Pune||2.8 lakh lockdown violators booked, ₹13.57 crore recovered in fines||The Pune police have taken action against nearly 2.80 lakh people in the city and fines around ₹13.57 crore have been recovered from them. Taking into account the rising Covid-19 cases in the city, the PMC had ordered to shut all types of establishments, except essential services. Besides, the police have taken action against 984 persons in the city for walking on the streets without masks on and fines have been collected from them. The mini lockdown being implemented by the district administration in Pune is seeing harsher measures like road closures through barricading by Pune police to prevent citizens from travelling from one area to another. The road closure strategy for nakabandi will put severe restrictions on travel within the city and help in breaking the chain. DCP (traffic) Rahul Srirame said that barricading is being done at important junctions as part of nakabandi operations to bring unnecessary commuting to a halt to break the chain of Covid-19. On weekdays, night curfew will be enforced from 6 pm to 7 am. From Friday onwards, there will be a complete lockdown between 6 pm and 7 am until Monday morning. No one will be allowed to leave their home without a valid reason or permission. Medical and other essential services will be excluded from this restriction. Ravindra Shisve, joint commissioner of police informed that the police had been trying to create awareness of the lockdown orders during the last two days. “Punekars have responded positively to the order. All the establishments were being closed by 6 pm and no one was stopped and questioned by the police while going home from work,” he said. Police have taken a public awareness drive while enforcing the night curfew in the last two days and police vans patrolling the roads could be seen informing the public about the restrictions imposed by the civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/28-lakh-lockdown-violators-booked-rs-13-57-crore-recovered-in-fines-101617722359857.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Covid-19 forces business owner to move from mandaps to mobile mandaps||With restrictions on travel and weddings curtailing any kind of celebration during Covid, Dayanand Darekar, an old hand in the business of mandaps has come up with an unique idea- mobile multifunction hall unit, which can travel to wherever one wishes to get married or even hold a family function. “I am in the business of weddings and giving mandap equipment for weddings, or any auspicious function, but lately due to Covid-19, and the latest lockdown has been bad for business with the weddings getting smaller and people not eager to spend a lot. Hence, I thought of giving a portable moving wedding hall which will be equipped with all the necessary amenities required to accommodate around 150 people,” said Darekar. Darekar has made a movable foldable multipurpose hall which is affixed on a trailer and can be moved across the state. “It is built on a trailer of the size 30 x 40 feet, it is air-conditioned, has a good sound system built in, generators, lights, and a stage too. We also provide with decorations and the catering too, all in ₹50,000 only,” said Darekar, who is in the business of mandaps for 20 years. For the past week, Darekar is flooded with bookings from across the state for his mobile wedding hall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid19-forces-business-owner-to-move-from-mandaps-to-mobile-mandaps-101617721039601.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Autorickshaws hit despite PMPML shutdown||With no public buses plying on the road, many autorickshaw drivers are feeling the pinch of losing out on daily earnings. Despite the PMPML shutdown, scores of autorickshaws are standing vacant in the city awaiting passengers. “Enforcing the lockdown and shutting down PMPML buses have been a bad idea. We used to get many of our passengers who would alight from the buses and then prefer us to take them to the city’s peth areas. But with almost every shop closed, there are hardly any passengers,” said Ravindra Poredi who has been a licensed auto rickshaw driver for past 23 years in the city. Poredi along with other driver friends stand at the Shri Sadguru Jungli Maharaj rickshaw stand daily. “We have been waiting since morning and there have been no trips at all. We are here to help people get them to their destination, but no one seems to be out,” said Sanjay Saswade. Although there are none of the regular travellers, these rickshaw owners are not afraid of the Covid-19 virus and are in fact willing to help any passenger reach the nearest Covid testing centre. “I dropped a senior citizen to Ruby Hall clinic, she had trouble breathing, but I was glad to be of help,” said Rahim Habib Sheikh, who has been plying an auto rickshaw in city for 20 years. “We are not afraid of ferrying passengers or even Covid positive patients, we are well equipped with sanitizers, and a thick plastic screen,” said Sunil Kadam who comes daily from Wagholi to ply his rickshaw in the city. The rickshaws outside KEM hospital are now often used to ferry discharged patients home. “We are called out by the security guard of the hospital and then also informed by the hospital staff accompanying the patient that we should sanitize the rickshaw after we drop them to their destination,” said Laxman Suryavanshi, who has ferried several patients home. “The biggest worry that most autorickshaw drivers face is of not earning enough. When everything was normal, we would make around ₹400 to ₹500 but now, it is difficult to get a trip above ₹100. This way, we won’t be able to look after our family nor pay instalments for the rickshaws,” said Rakesh Pardeshi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/autorickshaws-hit-despite-pmpml-shutdown-101617720979606.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Swimming pools pile-up losses in Pune, professional swimmers hit||Swimming pools were yet to recover from the losses of the 2020 lockdown and a fresh set of restrictions until April 30 have been put them in a state of limbo. In the last 12 months since March 2020, pools were allowed for all for only two months in February and March 2021. In the month of November, only sportspersons were allowed to train. “The four months of February, March, April and May are important months for the business and in the rest of the eight months, financial management is done by the profit earned in four months,” said Narendra Acharekar, coach, Harmony Aquatic Club, Kothrud. In Pune, there are around 60 swimming pools where professionals and non- professionals practice swimming. Maintenance along with the payment of staff and electric bills costs around ₹45,000 which is spent on pools every month. “Even if the pool is not functional, you cannot skip maintenance. Every month the chemicals which are used to keep the water clean and swimming friendly costs around ₹25,000 need to be changed. We have somehow managed all this expenses for one year but if another long lockdown happens then it will put us in a big trouble because we cannot stop the payment of staff in lockdown as well,” said Acharekar. Along with non-professional swimmers, professionals who have upcoming tournaments in the coming months will miss the pool practice due to lockdown. “There are nationals in June and July and only physical exercise will not help swimmers from Pune so at least the government should allow competitive swimmers to train. It will help them a lot and some activity at pool will be also continued,” said Vinay Marathe, proprietor, Champion Aquatic Club, at Bal Gandharva. Sadhvi Dhuri who won five gold medals and one silver at the Khelo India University Games in February 2020 said, “Not all the swimmers can go out of the city to train so professional swimmers’ practice should be allowed. Last one year was tough and staying away from the pool for so many days affected the performance.” Lifeguards find it difficult to survive Rakesh Bhagat who has worked as a lifeguard at Harmony Aquatic Club since 2009 fears a repeat of the 2020 lockdown. “It was worse, I got married in February 2020 and the state was under lockdown from March. I thank Acharekar sir for taking care of my house rent and providing me with groceries. My livelihood can only come on track when pools will remain active. The current situation of helplessness invites suicidal thoughts to minds,” said Bhagat who is unable to find other jobs due to the Covid crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/swimming-pools-pile-up-losses-in-pune-professional-swimmers-hit-101617720019579.html
07-04-2021||Pune||Confusion, fear, anger on day 1 of new restrictions for Pune’s traders, shop owners||PUNE It was total confusion for traders, shop owners and other businesspersons across the city on Tuesday, the first day of the new restrictions imposed in the state. Thousands of small shop owners opened up in various parts of Pune in the morning, most unaware about the new orders – only stores offering essential services were allowed to be open; and others who knew the orders, but decided not to follow it. Local district, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) authorities and the police department went on the rounds of the city, appealing to shop owners and traders to shut their shops as per the new restrictions.“I opened up my shop as per my daily routine at 9 am and started cleaning, when suddenly a friend of mine came told me about the restrictions. If we are told to be shut till April 30 then it is very difficult to survive financially. I have rented this shop for ₹15,000 and am already going in a loss for the last one year,” said Ramesh Rathod, a cloth shop owner in Katraj. Umesh Chavan, owner of a stationary shop in Shivajinagar, said, “Government offices and their work is going on, and we are told to close down. To break the chain of Covid infection, closing shops is not the solution. I was aware that shops are to be closed, but I opened up today.”At Laxmi road and other major markets in the city, many traders and shop owners are opposed to this decision. “There is lot of anger amongst shop owners against this closing down of shops ahead of the festival and wedding seasons. Soon, Gudhipadwa, Ramnavmi and wedding seasons is to come. Last year we accepted it as Covid was new for every one of us, but now we cannot afford to keep the shops closed for a single day,” said Nitesh Chopada, secretary, Laxmi road Ganpati chowk traders association. Even the public is unhappy with the decision taken by the state government.Rasika Mehta, a working professional said, “Post lockdown of last year, slowly the entire ecosystem of markets, offices and industries is coming on track. And suddenly it is stopped by these new restrictions. We need to take safety precautions, but at the same we cannot put a break on the running economy of the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/confusion-fear-anger-on-day-1-of-new-restrictions-for-city-s-traders-shopowners-101617716839392.html
