05-04-2021||World||Pakistan issues global tender for import of 50,000 tonnes of sugar||Pakistan's state-owned trading firm TCP on Monday issued a global tender for import of 50,000 tonnes of white sugar but not from 'banned' countries like India, a move described by the Indian sugar industry as "bad luck" for the neighbouring country.This is the third tender Trading Corporation of Pakistan (TCP) has floated for import of sugar. Earlier, two tenders for 50,000 tonnes each had to be scrapped mainly due to high quotes.    Faced with production shortages, Pakistan is trying to import sugar in order to boost domestic availability and check retail prices which have shot up to PKR 100 per kg.   Last week, there was sudden hope of trade reopening between the two nations in sugar and cotton after Pakistan's Economic Coordination Committee allowed import of these two commodities from India. However, Pakistan's federal cabinet back-tracked on the decision.   Issuing a fresh international tender for import of 50,000 tonnes of white sugar, TCP made it clear to global suppliers that "the cargo (white sugar) should not be originated from Israel or any other banned country."   Global suppliers should submit bids by April 14 and deliver the commodity at any port in Karachi, it said.Commenting on the development, All India Sugar Trade Association (AISTA) Chairman Praful Vithalani said, "Bad luck for Pakistan. Will you get sugar at prices, quality and speed with lowest freight parity of Indian sugar?"For Pakistan, importing white sugar from India would have been much cheaper and faster via land route compared from other countries, he told PTI.   "Through land route via Punjab, white sugar would cost about USD 398 per tonne (which includes freight charges and delivery at godown)," he added.   According to AISTA, TCP had scrapped earlier two tenders for import of sugar because of high quotes. The lowest bid it received was around USD 540 per tonne by Al Khaleez, Dubai.   Pakistan, which is expecting sugar production of 5.6 million tonnes in the ongoing 2020-21 marketing year (October-September), is facing a shortage of 5,00,000 tonnes, according to Pakistani traders  Whereas India, the world's second largest sugar producing nation after Brazil, is sitting on a surplus stock and targeting to export 6 million tonnes in the ongoing 2020-21 marketing year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-issues-global-tender-for-import-of-50-000-tonnes-of-sugar-101617645067728.html

Health officials have said the country's vaccination effort could limit deaths even with rising cases.For a sixth week, vaccinations set a record, with an average of 3.1 million shots given per day last week. As of Sunday, 32% of the US population has received at least one dose and 19% was fully vaccinated, according to the CDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hospitalizations-cases-continue-to-rise-in-us-for-third-straight-week-101617644346042.html

He also asked people to get tested even in the lack of Covid-19 symptoms."We can't be complacent. We can see the waves of sickness affecting other countries and we have seen how this story goes. We still don't know how strong the vaccine shield will be when cases begin to rise as I am afraid that they will and that's why we are saying please get your vaccine or second dose when your turn comes, and please use the free NHS tests even if you don't feel ill," he said.According to the latest update by Johns Hopkins University, the UK has recorded 4,376,560 total infections and 1,27,104 deaths.More than 31.4 million people have been given the first jab of the coronavirus vaccine, according to the official figures reported by Xinhua.On February 22, Johnson had announced his roadmap for exiting the lockdown, the third of its kind since the start of the pandemic. The four-step plan is expected to see all legal restrictions in England being removed by mid-June.Experts have warned Britain is "still not out of the woods" amid concerns over new variants and the third wave of the pandemic in the European continent, Xinhua reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-move-to-phase-two-of-roadmap-to-exit-covid-19-lockdown-101617644108484.html

Trump, a Republican, left office in January, replaced by Democratic President Joe Biden.With Trump no longer president, the justices declined to hear arguments and resolve the case on the merits, tossing out the 2nd Circuit decision.Throughout his presidency, Trump had regularly used Twitter to promote his agenda and attack detractors. Twitter banned Trump from its service days after a mob of his supporters attacked the US Capitol in a deadly riot on January 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-brings-end-to-donald-trump-s-moot-twitter-fight-101617632092409.html

Earlier, demonstrators with placards of Suu Kyi and signs calling for international intervention marched through the second-biggest city Mandalay, images posted on social media showed.Brunei, chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), threw its support on Monday behind a regional leaders' meeting to discuss Myanmar.After talks between Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin and Brunei Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah, Brunei said both countries had asked their ministers and officials to make the "necessary preparations for the meeting that will be held at the ASEAN Secretariat in Jakarta, Indonesia."No date was given.ASEAN operates by consensus, but the divergent views of its members on how to respond to the Myanmar army's crackdown on civilians and the group's policy of non-interference has limited its ability to act.Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Singapore have all expressed alarm over the killings of demonstrators and support an urgent high-level meeting on Myanmar. Besides Brunei, the other ASEAN members are Myanmar itself, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam and Cambodia.The United States and other Western countries have denounced the coup and called for the release of Suu Kyi, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her campaign against military rule. She has been charged with violating an official secrets act that is punishable by up to 14 years in prison.Junta rebuts UN envoyThe junta said on Monday that comments last week by UN Special Envoy Christine Schraner Burgener about an impending "bloodbath" in Myanmar were inaccurate and misleading."Ms. Burgener's remarks contravene the basic principles of sovereignty, and the fact that the United Nations is meant to work towards peace and stability of the world's nations," it said in a notice in the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper.Schraner Burgener told the 15-member U.N. Security Council on March 31 that it must consider "potentially significant action" to reverse the course of events as "a bloodbath is imminent," according to comments published by U.N. News.The junta said the remarks were a "a far cry from reality and could delay and destabilise the efforts by the State Administration Council to establish a genuine and disciplined multiparty democracy".The coup and subsequent crackdown has led to Western sanctions on the military and its lucrative businesses.Fitch Solutions said on Monday that a conservative forecast for Myanmar's economy would be for a 20% contraction in the fiscal year that began in October, instead of the 2% seen before the coup.External pressure is growing on the military to stop the violence, with some countries calling for it to cede power and free all detainees, and others urging dialogue and new elections soon.A total of 2,667 people have been detained under the junta, the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group said on Monday.The junta at the weekend announced arrest warrants for about 60 celebrities, social media influencers, models and musicians on charges of incitement.The military, which ruled with an iron first for half a century until 2011, has also seen fighting with armed ethnic minorities reignite on at least two fronts, raising fears of growing conflict and chaos in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-clap-to-denounce-junta-as-region-focuses-on-crisis-101617627219093.html

He has described himself as the victim of a politically motivated witch-hunt.Meanwhile, Israeli President Reuven Rivlin began consulting with party heads on who might form the next coalition government - a toss-up after the March 23 election, the fourth in two years, gave neither Netanyahu nor his rivals a clear mandate.Rivlin told delegates from Netanyahu's conservative Likud party that ethical considerations could factor in his decision, apparently alluding to Netanyahu's trial."I do not see a way in which a government can be established," Rivlin told representatives of centrist Yesh Atid, the largest opposition party, which hopes to unseat Netanyahu."The people of Israel should be very concerned that we may be dragged into a fifth election."At Jerusalem District Court, prosecuters sought to establish that Netanyahu granted regulatory favors to Israel's leading telecommunications company, Bezeq Telecom Israel BEZQ.TA, in return for more positive coverage of him and his wife Sara on a company news website known as Walla.Former Walla CEO Ilan Yeshua testified that he had been "barraged" by emailed and text message demands, from both the Walla owners and Netanyahu confidants, to improve reporting on the prime minister while playing down or attacking his political rivals."How much can you lie?" Iris Elovitch, wife of Walla's owner at the time and a co-defendant in Case 4000, shouted at Yeshua.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netanyahus-favours-were-currency-prosecutor-says-as-corruption-trial-starts-101617619396869.html

The total number of new Covid-19 infections, including imported infections originating from overseas, stood at 32, marking the highest total since Jan. 31.Genetic analysis of the cases discovered in Ruili suggest the new local infections stem from viruses imported from Myanmar, state media reported. Of the new patients reported in the city, 11 of them were identified as Myanmar citizens.Ruili is a key transit point for Yunnan province, which has struggled to monitor its rugged 4,000 km (2,500-mile) border with Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam for illegal immigration amid a wave of unauthorised crossings last year by people seeking a haven from the pandemic.On Monday evening, city authorities announced three high risk and six medium risk areas in Ruili as of 7pm local time (1100 GMT), reported state broadcaster CCTV.CCTV also reported that Ruili would conduct a second testing drive round from April 6 onwards, and that residents who had visited Jiegaoyu City, a jade market in one of the high risk areas, between March 15 and 29 would need to be quarantined at home.Local authorities have also began a vaccination drive in Ruili in a bid to contain Covid-19 and build up herd immunity in the city.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, stood at 18, matching the total from a day earlier.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 90,305, while the death toll remains unchanged at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-biggest-daily-covid-19-case-jump-in-over-2-months-101617625685767.html

Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin asked police to look into the claims.The prosecutor's office said Monday that the investigation is continuing despite reports that the man featured in the documentary had retracted his claim.French restaurants have been closed since October to slow the spread of the coronavirus virus. France just entered a new partial lockdown in response to intensive care units again filling with Covid-19 patients.Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on LCI television Sunday night that authorities have been investigating reports of clandestine parties and restaurants for months, and 200 suspects have been identified and face “heavy punishment.”Government ministers “have a duty to be totally irreproachable and exemplary.” Attal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-amid-covid-19-restrictions-ministers-accused-of-dining-at-secret-restaurants-101617622656140.html

But as friction has grown this year over the arrest and jailing of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny, it has signalled a tougher line.Russia has since March impeded the speed of Twitter for not removing content it deems illegal, and threatened to block it entirely. Photos and videos take longer to load for some users.However, in a statement on Monday, state communications watchdog Roskomnadzor said Twitter had held talks with Russian authorities on April 1, resulting in an agreement to give it more time and a recognition that banned content was being deleted quicker.On average, Twitter was removing illegal content within 81 hours of receiving a request, the watchdog said in statement. That is still much longer than the 24 hours demanded in law.Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Russian authorities have accused Twitter and others this year of failing to delete posts that Moscow said illegally urged children to take part in anti-Kremlin protests.Roskomnadzor says it wants Twitter to delete content that contains child pornography, drug abuse information and calls for minors to commit suicide.Twitter denies allowing its platform to be used to promote illegal behaviour, says its has a zero-tolerance policy for child sexual exploitation and prohibits the promotion of suicide or self-harm.After Russia announced the move to slow down its traffic, Twitter said it was worried about the impact on free speech.As well as Russia, major social media companies have been embroiled in an increasing number of disputes around the globe as governments seek to curb their power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-extends-punitive-twitter-slowdown-until-midmay-101617617388604.html

It comes as the government announced plans for twice weekly free coronavirus tests for everyone in England to be rolled out from the end of this week."One of the things we don't want to see – and just as the vaccination programme is working so well – is getting new variants or risking new variants getting imported into this country," UK health minister Edward Argar told the BBC, in reference to the "very cautious" next phase of lifting lockdown restrictions.As part of the announcements, Johnson is expected to lay out details of trial events in the coming months that will explore how ventilation and testing before and after events could help audiences back into arenas and auditoriums – over a year after being shut down to control the spread of the deadly virus.The pilot schemes involving what is being dubbed as "Covid-status certification" will include the football FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium in London and are expected to involve a smartphone app or a paper certificate.The trials will last until mid-May, when the next phase of lockdown easing is scheduled before a complete easing of restrictions by June 21 under Johnson's roadmap.According to the BBC, the first pilot event will be a comedy night in Liverpool on April 16, where audience members will be tested for COVID before and after the show.However, critics of these plans, including more than 40 parliamentarians from Johnson’s Conservative Party and privacy campaigners, have suggested that such COVID passports could prove counter-productive.Downing Street has also indicated that ministers are finalising plans to allow overseas travel through a traffic light system approach, with countries designated as red, amber and green based on their COVID risk levels.Non-essential international travel remains banned under current lockdown rules and the government advice continues to go against booking any overseas trips for summer holidays at this stage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-passports-travel-traffic-lights-in-boris-johnson-s-unlock-plan-for-uk-101617617425537.html

Some claimed the disease had not killed anyone in their camps, raising concerns about a lack of awareness of the virus among the refugee population, Arab News reported.At least 1.4 million Afghan refugees live in 54 camps across the country, mostly in the northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan provinces, both of which border Afghanistan. Refugee settlements are also located in large urban centres like Karachi and Islamabad.Islamabad bars them from purchasing property, vehicles, and even SIM cards. They cannot attend public schools or universities. Hospitals often refuse to admit expectant Afghan mothers because they cannot issue birth certificates to the newborns. The refugees live each day with the looming threat of being deported to a country they have never set foot in.By most estimates, around a million more immigrants live there without proper documentation. Islamabad bars them from purchasing property, vehicles, and even SIM cards.They cannot attend public schools or universities. Hospitals often refuse to admit expectant Afghan mothers because they cannot issue birth certificates to the newborns. The refugees live each day with the looming threat of being deported to a country they have never set foot in.In 2017, the Human Rights Watch issued a report claiming that Pakistan has turned on the Afghan community. In response to several deadly security incidents and deteriorating political relations between Pakistan and Afghanistan, Pakistani authorities have mounted a concerted campaign to drive Afghans out of the country, the report noted."No one has contacted us for vaccinations," Zahir Pashtun, a youth activist at the New Saranan refugee camp in southwestern Balochistan province, told Arab News."I do not think that even one per cent (of refugees) will get the jab," he said, adding: "Some are even convinced they will die if they get immunised."Zahir said the virus had not killed anyone in his refugee camp but had severely damaged the financial conditions of the most daily wage labourers in his community, as the virus had wreaked havoc on the economy since last March.In Pashtun's camp, a worker said the government should give refugees money instead of vaccinations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-need-covid-19-vaccines-give-us-money-afghan-refugees-to-pak-govt-101617617381843.html
05-04-2021||World||Covid mutants multiply as scientists race to decode variations||When Bette Korber, a biologist at Los Alamos National Laboratory, spotted the first significant mutation in the Covid-19 virus last spring, some scientists were skeptical. They didn’t believe it would make the virus more contagious and said its rapid rise might just be coincidence.Now, 11 months later, the D614G mutation she helped discover is ubiquitous worldwide, featured in the genomes of fast-spreading variants from the U.K., South Africa and Brazil. Meanwhile, new mutations are popping up in increasingly complicated patterns, spurring a drive by top biologists to devise new ways to track a fire hose of incoming genomic data.The goal: Quickly detect variants that can lessen the effectiveness of vaccines for a pathogen that’s unlikely to be eradicated any time soon. The SARS-CoV-2 virus could settle down and become a mere nuisance like the common cold. Or much like influenza, it could retain its ability to cause severe disease in some segments of the population, a scenario that could require regular booster shots.“By watching it carefully, we can stay ahead of the virus and that is what everyone is scrambling to do right now,” said Korber, who is working to create new mathematical tools for spotting medically significant variants.The flood of new genome data is so great that the Los Alamos lab had to upgrade its servers to deal with the incoming data. Meanwhile, Korber is on four Zoom calls a week with experts worldwide to devise criteria for deciding when mutations are concerning enough to merit detailed laboratory follow-up on how they may impact vaccines.A key mystery plumbed early-on by top scientists has been what type of virus the coronavirus will prove to be. So far, it looks more similar to influenza, which shape-shifts all the time and requires annual revaccination, than it does measles, a virus so intolerant of mutation that one vaccine regimen lasts a lifetime.“Does it mean we need to make a new vaccine every year?” said Paul Duprex, who heads the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Vaccine Research. ”We don’t know.”For one thing, mRNA vaccines for Covid-19 have efficacy rates above 90%, much higher than the 60% rate for flu shots in a good year. But vaccine makers Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc., along with its partner BioNTech SE, aren’t taking any chances. Just in case, they’re already starting trials of booster shots aimed at B.1.351, the antibody-evading strain first spotted in South Africa.When viruses replicate and copy their genomes, errors can erupt the long string of RNA or DNA “letters” that determine how viral proteins are developed. Many of the errors have no effect, or they can even make the virus less fit. But a tiny percentage of these changes can give the virus an advantage, making it more infectious or giving it the ability to evade the immune system.The HIV virus is notorious for its rapid mutation rate. In comparison, SARS-CoV-2 mutates at a much slower rate, partly due to a proof-reading enzyme that limits changes. But with more than 125 million infections worldwide, some errors are bound to slip through.At the same time, the virus has found devious ways that may avoid its proof-reading mechanism, University of Pittsburgh researchers have found. Rather than making changes in individual RNA letters, it deletes groups of several letters at a time, apparently undercutting the ability of the virus’s natural spell-check systems to see the change.74-Day BoutSome of the first deletions were seen in an immunocompromised cancer patient treated at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center who died after a 74-day bout with Covid-19. In that time, multiple immune-escaping deletions developed, according to the University of Pittsburgh’s Duprex, who reported on the cancer patient’s deletions in November.“If the damn thing is gone you are not going to be able to fix it,” Duprex said.What makes SARS-CoV-2’s future so hard to predict is that viral evolution is like a three dimensional chess game. It’s not just the individual mutations that matter, but also the order and combinations in which they occur. A single mutation may alter the virus in subtle ways that change the impact of others down the line, according to Mark Zeller, a scientist at the Scripps Research Institute in San Diego.Shared MutationsBoth the B.1.351 strain common in South Africa and the P.1 strain that’s battering Brazil share several mutations in the spike protein that the virus uses to gain entry into cells. This includes the D614G mutation discovered by Korber, which makes the spike more stable, and the E484K mutation, which is thought to reduce the ability of some antibodies to bind to the spike.Yet so far, for reasons not fully understood, it’s the B.1.351 that’s appears to have more impact on Pfizer’s and Moderna’s vaccines, at least in laboratory tests.Overall, the track record for eliminating viruses has been poor, with smallpox being the main example. Even pockets of polio are still around in some countries, despite efforts to eliminate it. That doesn’t bode well for the current virus, according to Jesse Bloom, a researcher at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center who studies viral evolution.“Vaccination is going to take the edge off this pandemic in a very substantial way,” Bloom said. “But I don’t think we are going to eradicate SARS-CoV-2.”Bloom predicts it will take “a number of years” for the virus to acquire enough mutations to fully escape existing vaccines. Of the roughly 100,000 possible single letter mutations for the virus, fewer than 1% are likely to help the virus evade antibodies, he said.A Hopeful ScenarioWhile the virus continues to evolve in the short term, one of the most hopeful scenarios is that it may run out of big moves it can make to evade antibodies that make the current vaccines work. Under this scenario, there may be a practical limit to how much the virus can mutate and remain fit to invade our cells.The spike protein must retain a shape that allows it to efficiently latch to its human receptor, according to Shane Crotty, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology.“There is not an infinite number of possibilities,” he said. “It is like putting your foot in a shoe. It still has to be basically the right shape and size and it still has to be recognizable as a shoe.”Still, evidence from other common cold coronaviruses indicates they can mutate to evade the immune system over time.In a recent study, Bloom and his colleagues compared the 1984 version of a common cold coronavirus called 229E to a version of the same strain that circulated in 2016, three decades later. Fully 17% of RNA letters in a key part of the spike protein that binds the virus to cells had been swapped out due to mutations.To test what this meant for human immunity, they obtained patient blood samples from the 1980s that could neutralize the 1984 viral strain. These people likely had been exposed to the 1984 virus and developed protective antibodies against it.Faded ProtectionsWhen the researchers tested the samples against strains of the 229E virus that appeared in the 1990s or later, the protection had faded: Only 2 of 8 blood samples were able to neutralize the 2016 strain, and those two showed vastly reduced activity against the most recent virus.That provides some hints for how much could change in the future, given enough time. “It’s pretty clear that human coronaviruses undergo substantial antigenic evolution,” Bloom said in an interview.However, it remains unknown whether the virus can retain its ability to cause severe disease as it mutates and more people gain immunity through infections or vaccines.In research published in January in the journal Science, disease modelers at Emory University found that a key factor will be whether protection against severe illness lasts significantly longer than protection against mild or asymptomatic reinfections, something that’s typical of coronaviruses that cause common colds.While the study was done before the current variants emerged, its basic conclusions hold up, according to Jennie S. Lavine, a postdoctoral researcher at Emory University.“What we see with Covid-19 on a molecular and cellular level is not inconsistent with what we see with endemic coronaviruses,” said Lavine, who was the paper’s lead author. “Immunity wanes, but not all of it wanes fast.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-mutants-multiply-as-scientists-race-to-decode-variations-101617614473774.html
05-04-2021||World||China warns US not to take 'superior' position on global affairs||Amid rising tensions between the US and China over a slew of issues, Beijing has warned Washington not to take a superior position and presume it has a final say on global affairs.Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi said China would not accept a list from Washington of unilateral demands for negotiations with Beijing. "The door for dialogue with China is open. But the dialogue should be done on an equal basis and with mutual respect," he said."China will not accept that there is any nation in the world that [can] put itself superior to the others, and that any nation will have a final say on world affairs. If the US continues to confront, China will take it calmly without fear."Wang said, while China-US cooperation was possible, both sides should respect each other's core concerns, and China would not accept unilateral demands and conditions from Washington, South China Morning Post reported."We resolutely resist gross interference in China's internal affairs, and even more resolutely oppose unlawful unilateral sanctions imposed on the basis of lies and false information," he said.Diplomatic observers said Beijing was looking to improve ties with the US that had been badly damaged under former US President Donald Trump, but was facing a dilemma overdrawing a line between cooperation and resisting US pressure.Following the Alaska summit, the relations between China and the US have deteriorated and tensions have escalated.Washington slapped additional sanctions on Chinese officials and entities over alleged human rights violations in Xinjiang, following a similar move by the European Union. Both countries have also stepped up their military presence in the disputed East and South China Seas.Wang said China and the US should hold more dialogues on regional affairs and cooperate on the pandemic but added that the rise of China could not be overturned."It is inevitable for China to continue development and becoming strong. This is in line with the long-term interest and common aspiration of regional countries, and this trend cannot be resisted," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-us-not-to-take-superior-position-on-global-affairs-101617612758953.html
05-04-2021||World||Japan fears Covid-19 variants are behind possible fourth wave||Japanese health authorities are concerned that variants of the coronavirus are driving a nascent fourth wave in the pandemic with just 109 days remaining until the Tokyo Olympics.The variants appear to be more infectious and may be resistant to vaccines, which are still not widely available in Japan. The situation is worst in Osaka, where infections hit fresh records last week, prompting the regional government to start targeted lockdown measures for one month from Monday.A mutant Covid-19 variant first discovered in Britain has taken hold in the Osaka region, spreading faster and filling up hospital beds with more serious cases than the original virus, according to Koji Wada, a government adviser on the pandemic."The fourth wave is going to be larger," said Wada, a professor at Tokyo's International University of Health and Welfare. "We need to start to discuss how we could utilize these targeted measures for the Tokyo area."Japan has twice declared a state of emergency that covered most of the country in the past year, most recently just after New Year as the pandemic's third and most deadly wave struck. Officials are now opting for more targeted measures that allow local governments to shorten business hours and impose fines for noncompliance.Osaka cancelled Olympic Torch relay events there, but Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has insisted Japan will carry out the Games as scheduled. Suga said on Sunday that measures employed in Osaka could be expanded to Tokyo and elsewhere if needed.There were 249 new infections in Tokyo on Monday, still well below the peak of over 2,500 in January. In Osaka, a record 666 cases were reported on Saturday.The true extent of the mutant cases is unknown, as only a small fraction of positive Covid-19 cases undergo the genomic study necessary to find the variants.A health ministry report last week showed 678 cases of mutant variants from Britain, South Africa, and Brazil had been discovered nationwide and at airports, with the biggest clusters in Osaka and nearby Hyogo prefecture.But another strain, known as E484K, may be more widespread. Around 70% of coronavirus patients tested at a Tokyo hospital last month carried the mutation that was different from the British and South African varieties, Japanese public broadcaster NHK said on Sunday.The rebound in cases came within weeks of the government lifting state of emergency measures, and the priority measures being rolled out now are intended to halt an unexpected rise in mutant cases, said Makoto Shimoaraiso, a Cabinet Secretariat official for Japan's Covid-19 response."We take the criticism when people say that we have not been able to detect any variants," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-fears-covid-19-variants-are-behind-possible-fourth-wave-101617612238493.html
05-04-2021||World||New coronavirus variant 'Eek' found in Japan, lowers vaccine protection||As the coronavirus continues to mutate, a new variant, nicknamed 'Eek' by scientists, has now emerged in Japan, news agency Reuters reported on Sunday. Citing Japan's public broadcaster NHK, the agency reported that the new E484K mutation, known for reducing vaccine protection, was detected in around 70% of the coronavirus disease patients at a Tokyo hospital last month.According to the NHK report, reviewed by Reuters, the E484K mutation was found in as many as 10 out of 14 Covid-19 patients at the Tokyo Medical and Dental University Hospital, back in March. For two months, 12 of 36 Covid-19 patients carried the mutation, but none of them had recently travelled abroad or reported contact with people who had, the report said.Variants of the coronavirus have cropped up around the world since last year. Japan is presently grappling with a fresh wave of coronavirus infections, a worrying trend ahead of the summer Tokyo Olympics planned for July. On Sunday, 355 new infections were reported in Tokyo, although that is still well below the peak of over 2,500 in January. A total of 594 new coronavirus disease cases were reported in Osaka prefecture on Sunday, a day after a record 666 were confirmed.Also Read: Covid-19: Japan to expand emergency measures as needed amid fears of new strainsAlthough large-scale vaccinations of the general population have not yet begun, health experts are particularly worried about the spread of mutant strains, Reuters reported, adding that hospital officials were not immediately available for comment.Japan's prime minister Yoshihide Suga said on Sunday that he would expand emergency measures as needed to contain the new wave of coronavirus infections, amid fears over the spread of virus mutations. Asked on a Fuji TV programme whether Tokyo might be added to a list of areas set to come under lockdown, Suga simply said, "All possibilities are being considered. It doesn't matter specifically where, we will act without hesitation if needed."(With inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-coronavirus-variant-eek-found-in-japan-lowers-vaccine-protection-101617601060352.html

05-04-2021||World||Thailand households struggle with record debt, Covid-19 increases burden||Thai farmer Jamras Kongchai is struggling to pay off 500,000 baht ($16,082) in debt as money from the sale of her crops is not enough to make payments.Adding to the strain, the coronavirus outbreak has shut a small construction firm where she worked for $10 a day for much needed extra income."I'm so heavily indebted and don't know what to do," said the 51-year-old, single mother of two, who travelled from the northern province of Kamphaeng Phet to join a demonstration of indebted rice growers in Bangkok late last month, asking the government to help reduce their debt burden.Jamras has only repaid some of the interest since 2013, and hasn't put a dent in the principle. This year, she has to pay 40,000 baht in interest, but she has no money. "I hope to get some help".Such protests have put further pressure on the Thai government, which is already grappling with mounting pro-democracy demonstrations and struggling to revive the pandemic-hit economy.Thai households are among the biggest borrowers in Asia, racking up a debt mountain of 14 trillion baht, or 89.3% of gross domestic product (GDP) by the end of December, a sharp rise from 78.1% in 2017. And, they are finding it increasingly difficult to keep up with payments.The level of household debt is the highest since the central bank began keeping records in 2003.High debt also poses a risk to financial stability and restrains consumer spending in Southeast Asia’s second-largest economy, impeding a recovery from the coronavirus crisis. The economy suffered its deepest slump in over two decades last year as exports shrank and the vital tourism sector reeled from the absence of foreign visitors.New COVID-19 outbreaks have added to the pressure on some businesses and households, the central bank said last month, when it cut its 2021 gross domestic product (GDP) growth outlook to 3% from 3.2%, noting the economy would not return to pre-pandemic levels until mid-2022.While the latest flareup in infections has been largely contained, it has reinforced fears that an economic rebound will be slow and patchy, prolonging the pain."Even before COVID, our debt to GDP was already the highest among emerging markets," said Yunyong Thaicharoen, chief economist at Siam Commercial bank."It's above a level that has quite an impact on GDP and household spending," he said, adding the debt ratio could peak at 90-91% of GDP in the first quarter.The government has promised 1 trillion baht in relief to ease the impact of the outbreak, but some say relief is not being rolled out fast enough for many Thais. Last year, a woman took rat poison outside the finance ministry to protest the slow response. She survived and was promised her payment days later.DEBT MOUNTAINThe growing debt burden is likely to curb private consumption, which accounts for half of Thailand's $502 billion GDP, and will hurt lenders' earnings if more loans turn sour.To be sure, the pandemic slowed down loan demand last year, but the slumping economy also made it more difficult for people to repay their loans.Consumer loans rose 4.6% last year, slowing from a 7.5% rise in 2019 as the outbreak cut household purchasing power, according to the central bank.But loans with a significant increase in credit risk jumped, with autos loans hitting 9.5% of lending, the highest in at least three years.Still, lender Muangthai Capital, remains upbeat, targeting annual loan growth of 20-25% over the next four years."The industry still has ample room to grow", said deputy managing director Parithad Petampai, noting the firm’s lending increased 10-fold to 70 billion baht last year from 2014.For years, easy credit for consumers and businesses has prompted many warnings about the dangers of rising household debt in Thailand, and now the pandemic has left millions of people out of work.About 4.7 million workers are at risk of being affected by the outbreak, of which 1.2 million workers might become unemployed or underemployed, the central bank said in January.Even after the economy has recovered and more jobs are available, the debt overhang will take a long time to tackle."We may earn more but that will go to debt servicing, not much left to spend," said Aree Onkloi, 22, worker from the northern province of Phitsanulok, whose family owes nearly a million baht."We will have to keep borrowing and never get out of it".($1 = 31.09 baht)(Reporting by Orathai Sriring, Satawasin Staporncharnchai and additional reporting by Kitiphong Thaichareon,; Editing by Kay Johnson and Kim Coghill)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-households-struggle-with-record-debt-covid-19-increases-burden-101617580471882.html
05-04-2021||World||Colombia to extend Covid-19 restrictions as cases rise||Colombia will extend coronavirus restrictions based on intensive care unit occupancy rates, President Ivan Duque said on Sunday, amid rising case numbers.The Andean country, which has recorded more than 2.4 million coronavirus cases and nearly 64,000 deaths, has so far administered nearly 2.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines.The government has repeatedly warned people not lower their guard during the Easter holidays - traditionally a popular travel period - and put in place weekend curfews."It's clear that ... some municipalities have shown increases in recent weeks and there also exists the risk of a new national increase in the coming weeks," Duque said in remarks broadcast on social media. "We must act, prevent and take appropriate decisions."Capital Bogotá and the cities of Manizales, Armenia, Tunja, Barranquilla, Monteria, Leticia and Pereira are under observation for increasing cases and deaths, Duque said, while Medellin, Cali, Santa Marta and Barranquilla are also being watched for decreasing intensive care unit capacity.Curfews based on ICU capacity will be in place from Monday and continue through April 19, he said.Cities with an ICU occupancy of above 85% will have a curfew from 6 p.m. through 5 a.m., while those with between 80% and 85% capacity will have curfews beginning at 8 p.m.Curfews will start at 10 p.m. for cities with between 70% and 79% occupancy, while those with between 50% and 69% will be restricted from midnight until 5 a.m.Bogota, the country's largest city, had ICU occupancy rates of 65.5% as of Saturday evening. Coastal cities including Caribbean port Barranquilla had rates hovering around 90%.Shopping and other activities will be regulated by ID numbers, Duque added.Those who travelled over the holiday to areas with high contagion should self-isolate for at least seven days upon returning home, Duque added.Colombia held a gradually loosened five-month national lockdown between March and September of last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/colombia-to-extend-covid-19-restrictions-as-cases-rise-101617579786973.html

People have been asked not to move out from their homes from 6 pm to 6 am, the report said.The decision was taken in light of the current situation in the country where the rate of infections and deaths have increased in recent weeks. The government has said that they are increasing the number of Covid-19-designated hospitals and ICU beds to deal with the rising number of patients, it said.Bangladesh has registered 7,087 fresh Covid-19 cases, taking the tally to 637,364, in the last 24 hours until Sunday which is the highest number of infections since the start of the pandemic, the United News of Bangladesh reported.Besides, the deaths due to coronavirus rose to 9,266 with 53 news fatalities during this period. The mortality rate fell to 1.45 on Sunday from Saturday's 1.46 per cent.All public transport services (roads, river, railway and domestic flights) were suspended and only emergency services remained operational.However, all government/non-government/autonomous offices, courts and private offices will be able to facilitate the commute of their employees to work using their own transport on a limited scale.Thousands of people left Dhaka on Sunday fearing getting trapped during the lockdown. Most of the people who left were unemployed or in poverty.Many shop owners and employees have, however, taken to the streets protesting the government's decision to shut down all shopping malls and markets during the weeklong lockdown, the Dhaka Tribune reported.Several hundred traders staged their demonstrations in Dhaka's New Market area blocking the road.This the second time lockdown has been imposed in Bangladesh. The country earlier imposed a 66-day lockdown from March 26 to May 30 last year when a nationwide holiday was also enforced.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina urged people to help curb the spread of the virus in a speech in Parliament.“I know everyone will face difficulties. Despite this, I say lives should be given preference over everything,” Hasina said Sunday.Hasina has sought everyone's cooperation to combat the ongoing second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in Bangladesh.Speaking on the new strain of coronavirus in the country, the premier said: “The damage done by the new virus variant is hard to detect right away.

The ferry sank just after it departed from the industrial Narayanganj district about 20 kms (12 mies) from Dhaka, to Munshiganj, said Mustain Billah, Narayanganj district administrator."Most of the bodies were found inside the sunken boat after it was dragged to the bank," he said, adding a few still could be missing.Police and officials said some of the passengers managed to swim ashore.Relatives gathered at the river bank to search for their loved ones. Rescuers, including divers from the fire brigade, were searching for survivors on Monday while salvage operations were hampered by a storm last night.The boat was packed with people rushing to leave the city after the government announced a week-long nationwide lockdown from Monday to tackle a spike in Covid-19 cases.Bangladesh reported a record daily jump of 7,087 coronavirus infections on Sunday, taking its total number of cases to 637,364 with 9,266 deaths.Hundreds of people die each year in ferry accidents in Bangladesh, a low-lying country that has extensive inland waterways but lax safety standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-ferry-accident-kills-at-least-26-101617610246899.html

He said he was speaking over satellite Internet, but expected that service to be cut as well. The BBC says it received the statement from Hamzah's lawyer.In the statement, Hamzah said he had been informed he was being punished for taking in part in meetings in which the king had been criticized, though he himself was not accused of being a direct critic.He said he told the army chief: “I am not the person responsible for the breakdown in governance, for the corruption and for the incompetence that has been prevalent in our governing structure for the last 15 to 20 years and has been getting worse by the year. I am not responsible for the lack of faith that people have in their institutions. They are responsible.”The country's top general had earlier denied that Hamzah — a former crown prince stripped of the title in 2004 — was arrested or under house arrest, even as authorities announced the arrests of former senior officials close to the ruling monarchy.Hamzah was asked to “stop some movements and activities that are being used to target Jordan's security and stability,” said Gen. Yousef Huneiti, the army chief of staff.He said an investigation was ongoing and its results would be made public “in a transparent and clear form.”“No one is above the law and Jordan’s security and stability are above all,” he told the official Petra news agency.Petra had earlier reported that two senior officials who formerly worked for the palace, along with other suspects, had been arrested for “security reasons,” without providing further details.The Petra report said Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, a member of the royal family, and Bassem Ibrahim Awadallah, a former head of the royal court, were detained. Awadallah, also previously served as planning minister and finance minister and has private business interests throughout the Gulf region.The agency did not provide further details or name the others who were arrested.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jordans-prince-hamzah-says-he-won-t-obey-orders-audio-recording-101617609208682.html
05-04-2021||World||Israel PM Netanyahu's trial resumes as parties weigh in on his fate||Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's corruption trial is to resume Monday as the country's political parties weigh in on whether he should form the next government after a closely divided election or step down to focus on his legal woes.Netanyahu is Israel's longest-serving prime minister and has clung to power through four hard-fought elections in less than two years, even as he has faced allegations of bribery, fraud and breach of trust. The March 23 election was largely a referendum on his leadership but produced no clear verdict.Israel's political parties will begin meeting with President Reuven Rivlin later on Monday to recommend which candidate should be tasked with forming the next government.Neither Netanyahu's allies nor his foes secured a governing majority in the Knesset, Israel's parliament. So his fate could come down to Naftali Bennett, a right-wing former ally with whom he has strained ties, and Mansour Abbas, the leader of a small Arab Islamist party who also has yet to commit to either the pro- or anti-Netanyahu blocs.Netanyahu will meanwhile appear in Jerusalem District Court for the start of the evidentiary stage of his trial.Netanyahu is charged with accepting bribes, fraud and breach of trust in three cases. The first involves Netanyahu allegedly receiving gifts worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from wealthy friends, including Hollywood film producer Arnon Milchan and Australian billionaire James Packer. In the second case, Netanyahu is accused of trying to orchestrate positive coverage in a major Israeli paper in exchange for curbing distribution of a free pro-Netanyahu tabloid.The third, dubbed Case 4000, which will be the focus of Monday’s first witness testimony, alleges that Netanyahu backed legislation worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the owner of Israeli telecom giant Bezeq in return for positive coverage on its news site Walla.Netanyahu has denied any wrongdoing, dismissing the charges against him as part of a media and law enforcement “witch hunt” to unseat him. His trial began last year and could last for another two years.In January, prosecutors alleged 315 instances of Walla being requested to amend its coverage so it was more favorable to Netanyahu and his family. They said 150 of them involved Netanyahu himself.According to the charges, Shaul Elovitch, CEO of Bezeq, “exerted heavy and continuous pressure” on Ilan Yeshua, the former chief editor of Walla, to change articles on the website to meet the demands of Netanyahu and his family. Yeshua is expected to take the stand on Monday.Israeli law does not require prime ministers to resign while under indictment, and Netanyahu has refused to do so. That has left the country deeply divided. A emergency unity government formed last year to address the coronavirus crisis was mired in political bickering and fell apart in less than a year over its inability to approve a budget.Netanyahu passed Israel’s founding father David Ben Gurion in 2019 as the country’s longest-serving prime minister, having held office continuously since 2009 and for several years in the 1990s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-pm-s-trial-resumes-as-parties-weigh-in-on-his-fate-101617602567723.html

There was no official toll of casualties on Sunday.The Seroja cyclone hit the Savu sea southwest of Timor island in the early hours of Monday, Indonesia's weather agency said, warning that it could bring yet more rain, waves and winds.Extreme weather in the Nusa Tenggara area has obstructed the distribution of oil fuel there, state energy firm Pertamina said, with filling stations, a kerosene shop and four tank cars flooded.Pertamina has alerted fuel terminals in nearby islands to support the supply of fuel to the impacted region, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-death-toll-from-floods-landslides-rises-to-55-at-least-40-missing-101617599949468.html

05-04-2021||World||More than 75 dead in Indonesia, East Timor floods, dozens missing||More than 75 people have died and dozens are still missing after flash floods and landslides hit Indonesia and neighbouring East Timor, officials said Monday.Floods sparked by torrential rain have wreaked havoc and destruction on islands stretching from Flores in Indonesia to East Timor, sending thousands fleeing into shelters.The deluge and subsequent landslides caused dams to overflow, submerging thousands of houses and leaving rescue workers struggling to reach trapped survivors."There are 55 dead, but this number is very dynamic and will definitely change, while some 42 people are still missing," Indonesia disaster management agency spokesman Raditya Djati told broadcaster MetroTV.At least 21 people had also died in East Timor, said an official in the tiny half-island nation that lies between Indonesia and Australia.Many of the deaths were in Timor's inundated capital Dili.Mud covered homes, bridges and roads in Indonesia's East Flores municipality, where rescuers struggled to reach a remote and badly-hit area because of rains and strong waves."The mud and the extreme weather have become a serious challenge and the debris piling up has hampered the search and rescue team," Djati said.- 'Medicine, food, blankets' -Scared residents flocked to temporary shelters across the remote region or took refuge in what was left of their homes."The evacuees are spread out. There are hundreds in each sub district but many others are staying at home," said Alfons Hada Bethan, head of the East Flores disaster agency."They need medicine, food, blankets."Pounding rains challenged efforts to find any survivors."We suspect many people are buried but it's not clear how many are missing," Bethan said.In Lembata, an island halfway between Flores and Timor, parts of some villages were swept down a mountainside by torrents of mud, ending up down on the shore of the ocean.Earlier, road access had been cut off and local officials were forced to deploy heavy equipment to reopen the roads.Images from Lembata showed barefoot locals wading through mud and past collapsed houses to evacuate victims on makeshift stretchers and surrounded by collapsed houses.Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Southeast Asian archipelago during the rainy season.January saw flash floods hit the Indonesian town of Sumedang in West Java, killing 40 people.And last September, at least 11 people were killed in landslides on Borneo.The country's disaster agency has estimated that 125 million Indonesians -- nearly half of the country's population -- live in areas at risk of landslides.The disasters are often caused by deforestation, according to environmentalists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-75-dead-in-indonesia-east-timor-floods-dozens-missing-101617596254692.html
05-04-2021||World||UK to announce new international travel rules||Britain will on Monday set out plans to restart international travel, using a "traffic-light" system as the country cautiously emerges from lockdown.The announcement comes as the UK has set a tentative date of May 17 to relaunch international travel.Travel destinations will be ranked green, amber or red according to virus risk, Downing Street said in a statement late Saturday, with the government to provide more details on Monday.International travel is currently banned except for a handful of permitted reasons. This has created massive pent-up demand for summer holidays abroad."We are doing everything we can to enable the reopening of our country... as safely as possible," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said.The government said the new system "will help ensure the UK's vaccine progress isn't jeopardised and provide clear guidance for travellers".People heading to low-risk "green" countries will simply take a virus test before and after they travel, the government said.But those going to amber or red countries will have to self-isolate or quarantine afterwards.Currently people arriving in the UK from abroad are required to self-isolate for 10 days.British nationals who arrive from a banned "red list" of high-risk countries face costly quarantine in government-approved hotels.The government urged people not to book summer holidays, saying it was "too early to predict" which would be the green-lighted countries.The government has announced it will allow a number of people to attend public events such as football matches from this month in trials of a virus certification system.But it has not made clear whether it will issue "virus passports" for international travel, an idea backed by many tourism-dependent countries and airlines but opposed by more than 70 UK MPs.The UK has already given out more than 31 million first vaccine doses and over 5 million second doses.The rollout has far outstripped popular holiday destinations such as France.This has boosted the public mood after more than 126,000 people died from the virus in the United Kingdom, the highest toll in Europe.From Thursday, those living in England will be able to access two free rapid virus tests per week, a measure aimed at curbing symptom-free virus spread.This will make such tests far more accessible than currently. "More cases will be detected, breaking chains of transmission and saving lives," the government said Monday.Health Secretary Matt Hancock urged people to take up the offer, saying "getting back to normal hinges on us all getting tested regularly".The lateral flow tests will be available at workplaces, community sites, schools and colleges. People will also be able to order delivery of the tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-announce-new-international-travel-rules-101617596361827.html
05-04-2021||World||Malaysia's ex-PM Najib starts appeal against 1MDB-linked conviction||Malaysia's Court of Appeal on Monday will begin hearing a bid by former prime minister Najib Razak to set aside his conviction on corruption charges in a case linked to a multibillion-dollar scandal at state fund 1MDB.Najib, who was voted out in a historic 2018 election, faces several trials over allegations that $4.5 billion was stolen from 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), a state fund he co-founded in 2009. He has plead not guilty to all charges.Last year, Najib was sentenced to 12 years in jail and a $50 million fine after being found guilty of criminal breach of trust, abuse of power and money laundering for illegally receiving about $10 million from SRC International, a former 1MDB unit.The sentences were stayed pending an appeal.Defence lawyers are set to argue on Monday that the trial judge had erred in dismissing evidence showing that Najib was misled by Malaysian financier Jho Low and other 1MDB officials into believing that the funds in his account were a donation from the Saudi royal family, according to documents submitted to the court ahead of the hearing. Low, whose whereabouts is unknown, has denied wrongdoing."(Najib) had no knowledge of the 42 million ringgit transactions into his account or knowledge that the same were from the account of SRC," the documents seen by Reuters said.Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee, a lawyer for Najib, confirmed that the documents were filed last month.The court has fixed 12 days between April 5 and 22 to hear the appeal.Prosecutors have said more than $1 billion of 1MDB funds made its way into Najib’s personal accounts, over which he faces a total of 42 criminal charges.At least six countries have opened investigations into 1MDB, in a globe-spanning scandal that has implicated high-level officials and major financial institutions.In recent months, Malaysia has recovered more than $3 billion from U.S. bank Goldman Sachs, audit firm Deloitte, and Malaysian banking group AmBank in separate deals to settle claims linked to 1MDB probes.($1 = 4.1440 ringgit)(Reporting by Rozanna Latiff; Editing by Martin Petty)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysias-ex-pm-najib-starts-appeal-against-1mdb-linked-conviction-101617587006197.html
05-04-2021||World||Minorities in Myanmar borderlands face fresh fear since coup||Before each rainy season Lu Lu Aung and other farmers living in a camp for internally displaced people in Myanmar's far northern Kachin state would return to the village they fled and plant crops that would help keep them fed for the coming year.But this year in the wake of February's military coup, with the rains not far off, the farmers rarely step out of their makeshift homes and don't dare leave their camp. They say it is simply too dangerous to risk running into soldiers from Myanmar's army or their aligned militias.“We can’t go anywhere and can’t do anything since the coup,” Lu Lu Aung said. “Every night, we hear the sounds of jet fighters flying so close above our camp.”The military's lethal crackdown on protesters in large central cities such as Yangon and Mandalay has received much of the attention since the coup that toppled Aung San Suu Kyi's elected government. But far away in Myanmar's borderlands, Lu Lu Aung and millions of others who hail from Myanmar's minority ethnic groups are facing increasing uncertainty and waning security as longstanding conflicts between the military and minority guerrilla armies flare anew.It's a situation that was thrust to the forefront over the past week as the military launched deadly airstrikes against ethnic Karen guerrillas in their homeland on the eastern border, displacing thousands and sending civilians fleeing into neighboring Thailand.Several of the rebel armies have threatened to join forces if the killing of civilians doesn't stop, while a group made up of members of the deposed government has floated the idea of creating a new army that includes rebel groups. The U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, meanwhile, has warned the country faces the possibility of civil war.Ethnic minorities make up about 40% of Myanmar’s 52 million people, but the central government and the military leadership have long been dominated by the country's Burman ethnic majority. Since independence from Britain in 1948, more than a dozen ethnic groups have been seeking greater autonomy, with some maintaining their own independent armies.That has put them at odds with Myanmar's ultranationalist generals, who have long seen any ceding of territory — especially those in border areas that are often rich in natural resources — as tantamount to treason and have ruthlessly fought against the rebel armies with only occasional periods of ceasefire.The violence has led to accusations of abuses against all sides, such as arbitrary taxes on civilians and forced recruitment, and according to the United Nations has displaced some 239,000 people since 2011 alone. That doesn't include the more than 800,000 minority Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh to escape a military campaign the U.N. has called ethnic cleansing.Since February anti-coup protests have taken place in every border state, and security forces have responded much as they have elsewhere with tear gas, rubber bullets and live ammunition. But residents and observers say the post-coup situation in geographically isolated borderlands has been made worse by increased skirmishes between the military and armed ethnic organizations jockeying for power and territory.Lu Lu Aung, who hails from the Kachin ethnic group, said she participated in protests, but stopped as it was now too dangerous. She said Myanmar security forces and aligned militias recently occupied their old village where they planted crops and no one left the camp because they feared they would be forced into work for the army.“Our students can no longer continue the schooling and for the adults it’s so much difficult to find a job and make money,” she said.Humanitarian aid for civilians in the borderlands — already strained by the pandemic as well as the inherent difficulty outside groups face operating in many areas — has been hard it since the coup as well.Communications have been crippled, banks have closed and security has become increasingly uncertain, said the director of a Myanmar-based organization supporting displaced persons who spoke on condition of anonymity for security reasons.“There is no more humanitarian help and support,” she said.In eastern Karen State, where the airstrikes have displaced thousands, there are concerns that the arrival of rainy season could exacerbate a humanitarian situation already made difficult by reports that Thailand has sent back many of the civilians who fled. Thailand has said those who went back to Myanmar did so voluntarily.Yet there are parts of the country’s borderlands that have hardly been impacted by the coup.In Wa State, a region bordering China and Thailand that has its own government, army and ceasefire agreements with the Myanmar military, videos being shared online show life going on as usual, including the rollout of a coronavirus vaccination campaign.Near Bangladesh in coastal Rakhine State, where the Rohingya were driven from and where violent clashes with the Arakan Army group have been ongoing for years, the junta last month removed the group from its list of terrorist groups, raising hopes a lowering of hostilities. The Arakan Army, unlike a number of other armed groups, had not criticized the coup.The group, however, since released a statement that declared its right to defend its territory and civilians against military attacks, leading some to fear a fresh escalation in fighting.Other armed groups have issued similar statements. Some such as the Karen National Union have provided protection for civilians marching in anti-coup protests.Such actions have contributed to the calls for a “federal army” bringing together armed ethnic groups from across the country. But analysts says such a vision would be hard to achieve due to logistical challenges and political disagreements among the groups.“These groups are not in a position where they can provide the support against the Myanmar military needed in urban centers with large populations, or really too far outside their own regions,” said Ronan Lee, a visiting scholar at Queen Mary University of London’s International State Crime Initiative.Despite the uncertainty of what's to come, some minority activists say they have been heartened since the coup by the increased focus on the role ethnic groups can take in Myanmar's future. They also say there appears to be greater understanding — at least among anti-coup protesters — of the struggle minorities have faced for so long.“If there’s any silver lining in all of this, that’s it," said one activist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of fears for their safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minorities-in-myanmar-borderlands-face-fresh-fear-since-coup-101617589362329.html
05-04-2021||World||Island of Phuket ahead of the rest of Thailand in mass vaccination drive||In Thailand, it's the all-important tourism sector that has jumped to the head of the Covid-19 vaccination line, with the country's most popular resort island embarking on a mass inoculation programme two months ahead of the rest of the country.The island of Phuket aims to deliver shots to at least 460,000 people - most of its population - as it gears up for July 1, when vaccinated overseas visitors will no longer be required to quarantine.Phuket also has its own international airport and tourists would be able to roam the island freely without posing any coronavirus risk to the rest of Thailand's population."If we can build immunity for 70-80% of the population on the island, we can receive foreign tourists who have been vaccinated without the need for quarantine," Phuket's Vice Governor Piyapong Choowong told Reuters.While medical workers, members of the cabinet and the elderly were the first to be vaccinated, Thailand's decision to prioritise Phuket over other parts of the country underscores the central role of tourism to the economy.Spending by foreign tourists accounted for 11-12% of GDP pre-pandemic and the sector has been devastated by the virus with 1.45 million jobs lost since last year.Just 6.7 million foreign tourists visited Thailand in 2020, spending some $11 billion. That compares with nearly 40 million in 2019, when they spent $61 billion.The government wants to see at least 100,000 tourists come to Phuket in the third quarter. It also hopes that as vaccinations worldwide progress it will see a spike in demand in the fourth quarter and that nationwide some 6.5 million visitors will have spent 350 billion baht ($11 billion) by the end of the year."It's a challenge. But that will contribute to GDP to some extent," said Tourism Authority of Thailand Governor Yuthasak Supasorn."We don't expect tourists will come in like a broken dam but we hope to have quality visitors with high spending."Visitors from Europe, the United Arab Emirates and the United States are expected to return first, Yuthasak said.Strict 14-day quarantine requirements for overseas visitors have helped Thailand limit coronavirus infections to around 29,100 cases and 95 deaths but have proven to be too great a hurdle for most tourists.Programmes to attract long-term tourists who test negative for the coronavirus have largely flopped, even with creative measures such as quarantine at golf resorts.Songklod Wongchai, an analyst at Finansia Syrus, believes Thailand could see a quick rebound in tourism, citing the example of the Maldives which has seen hotel occupancy rates bounce back to 70-80% despite cases of the virus."Pent-up demand may come back faster than expected. I think the Land of Smiles will start smiling again," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/island-of-phuket-ahead-of-the-rest-of-thailand-in-mass-vaccination-drive-101617587315141.html

The total number of new Covid-19 infections, including imported infections originating from overseas, stood at 32, marking the highest total since Jan. 31.Genetic analysis of the cases discovered in Ruili suggest the new local infections stem from viruses imported from Myanmar, state media reported. Of the new patients reported in the city, 11 of them were identified as Myanmar citizens.Ruili is a key transit point for Yunnan province, which has struggled to monitor its rugged 4,000 km (2,500-mile) border with Laos, Myanmar and Vietnam for illegal immigration amid a wave of unauthorised crossings last year by people seeking a haven from the pandemic.Local authorities have also begun a vaccination drive in Ruili in a bid to contain Covid-19 and build up herd immunity in the city.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, stood at 18, matching the total from a day earlier.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 90,305, while the death toll remains unchanged at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-reports-biggest-jump-in-daily-cases-in-over-2-months-101617587508974.html
05-04-2021||World||Britain's PM Johnson pushes for Covid tests for all to help reopen economy||Everyone in England will be urged to take a coronavirus test twice a week as a new system of Covid passports is assessed for wide-scale use, under Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s plan to reopen the economy after lockdown.Free test kits will be made available through local pharmacies, community centers and home delivery services, when the new regime goes live on April 9.With most of the adult population now having received a vaccine, the government believes rapid testing of the whole population and a system of Covid status certification will help keep control over the pandemic as restrictions are eased.Johnson is due to set out the details later on Monday, ahead of the next step in lifting curbs for businesses and citizens due on April 12.“Massive efforts have been made by the British public to stop the spread of the virus,” Johnson said in a statement released by his office. “As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine program and with our road-map to cautiously easing restrictions underway, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted.”The U.K. has suffered the highest death toll in Europe from the pandemic and is still reeling from the country’s deepest recession in 300 years.A vaccination program that has rapidly outpaced the rest of Europe has seen 31.5 million people given at least one shot so far, and puts the U.K. in a good position to reopen even as nearby countries such as France are locking down again.Under Johnson’s plans:Many of the measures contained in Johnson’s plan will need to pass votes in Parliament. Johnson is likely to face battling demands from some of his own Conservative Party colleagues to lift the lockdown faster, while more than 70 members of Parliament have launched a campaign to oppose vaccine passports, citing concerns over the erosion of liberties.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britains-pm-johnson-pushes-for-covid-tests-for-all-to-help-reopen-economy-101617579531985.html

The Financial Times said Johnson was not expected to set out a specific timeframe.The gradual relaxation of rules will also be aided by an increase in testing availability, with everyone in England entitled to take a rapid COVID-19 test twice a week to prevent outbreaks and find those people not displaying symptoms."As we continue to make good progress on our vaccine programme and with our roadmap to cautiously easing restrictions underway, regular rapid testing is even more important to make sure those efforts are not wasted," Johnson said in a statement.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are following their own, similar paths out of a strict lockdown that was imposed at the beginning of this year.Britain is able to pursue a recovery after it gave AstraZeneca and Pfizer shots to more than half the adult population. A reopening of schools in March has also not yet led to a spike in cases, despite a ramp-up in more testing.But the United Kingdom has been badly hit by the pandemic. With almost 127,000 deaths, it has the fifth highest toll in the world behind the United States, Brazil, Russia and India.In 2020 its gross domestic product fell by 9.8%, the most in more than three centuries and one of the deepest contractions in the world. Households have saved however, and sterling has gained against the euro ahead of the reopening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-to-update-covid-19-roadmap-to-announce-plans-to-reopen-economy-101617582058383.html

The carrier said Wednesday it would resume selling middle seats on May 1, ending the coronavirus-related social-distancing policy after more than a year. With rivals American Airlines Group Inc. and United Airlines Holdings Inc. saying their planes are now flying as much as 80% full, Delta will become the last major U.S. carrier to resume selling all of its seats.As the pandemic stymied U.S. air travel for much of 2020, Delta cut personnel expenses, contributing to flight cancellations. About 17,000 of its workers left voluntarily and another 40,000 took unpaid leave. The Atlanta-based company posted a loss of $12.4 billion last year.The rebound in air travel with the acceleration of coronavirus vaccines has put pressure on airlines that downsized. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week that vaccinated individuals don’t need a Covid test and don’t need to quarantine when traveling domestically.More than a million customers have flown Delta over the past few days, reaching levels the company hasn’t seen since before the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/delta-cancels-100-flights-due-to-staff-shortage-to-open-booking-of-middle-seats-101617581582383.html

Most in the queue were young Pakistanis still not eligible for government's free vaccination."I am very happy to get it, since now it is required for travelling," Saad Ahmed, 34, told Reuters on Sunday after he got his shot at an upscale private sector hospital in Karachi.While the private sale of vaccines has begun, the government and importers are still locked in a pricing dispute.Pakistan initially agreed to exempt imported vaccines from price caps, but later rescinded the exemption and said it would set maximum prices.One pharmaceutical company, which had already imported 50,000 doses of Sputnik V, took the government to court, where it won an interim order allowing it to sell it until pricing is decided.As soon as vaccination was opened for walk-in customers, there were long lines of people, Dr Nashwa Ahmed, who runs vaccination at Karachi's South City Hospital, told Reuters.Pictures of queues outside the hospital late into the night were shared on social media.The hospital procured 5,000 doses of Sputnik V and in just over two days all its stock had been administered or pre-booked, said a hospital official who asked not to be identified.Companies, including one of Pakistan's largest banks, have also purchased large quantities to have staff inoculated, the official said.The private sales start as the country deals with a fresh wave of Covid-19 infections and healthcare facilities are fast filling to capacity.The number of patients now in critical care has reached 3,568, the highest since the pandemic started, a cabinet minister, Asad Umar, said on Twitter. Pakistan has thus far reported 687,908 infections and 14,778 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/young-pakistanis-rush-to-purchase-russian-vaccine-as-private-sales-open-101617576639054.html
05-04-2021||World||Capitol attack raises questions of security vs public access||Lawmakers are trying to balance openness with safety after Friday's attack within steps of the Capitol, a challenge for Congress, nearly three months after a mob stormed the seat of American democracy, to “make it as secure as it needs to be but as free as we could possibly make it,” as one senator said Sunday.The sprawling complex has been ringed by security fencing and National Guard troops since the deadly January 6 riot, when supporters of then-President Donald Trump breached the Capitol as members of Congress were certifying Joe Biden's election victory.Friday's attack, now believed to be an isolated incident by a disturbed man, came just weeks after the outermost layer of fencing was removed and the military's footprint was reduced at the Capitol. The man rammed a car into two officers at a barricade outside the Capitol, killing one of them before he was shot to death by police.It quickly underscored the persistence and the range of threats to Congress and the officers charged with protecting the legislative branch.“I think the Capitol has always been a target. ... We need to be aware of that,” said Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the top Republican on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, which oversees that chamber's side of the Capitol.He told ABC's “This Week” that the Capitol is "an important element of who we are. It's an important symbol of who we are. And we need to keep that in mind with every decision we make.”Retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who was tapped by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., to undertake a security review of the Capitol following the insurrection in January, said it was clear the building had become a greater target.His task force recommended steps to Congress to bolster the complex's physical security, including hiring hundreds more police officers, hardening entrances, enhancing its surveillance system and developing plans for quickly deployable fencing. But he indicated on Sunday that large-scale permanent fencing was unlikely.“From inside the Capitol, talking to many members of Congress on both the Senate and the House side, both parties, they all left us with the impression their number one mission is to secure the Capitol, but make sure it has 100 per cent public access,” Honoré said on ABC.He said that after the September 11, 2001 attacks, 250 National Guard “stayed at the Capitol for two years. And we may look forward to seeing that happen again.”Blunt said the permanent fencing should come down. “I don't think it does the job. In fact, the fencing was right there when the car drove through,” he said. “I think it would be a mistake for fencing to be a permanent part of the Capitol.”Police identified the slain officer as William “Billy” Evans, an 18-year veteran who was a member of the department's first responders unit. That was the same unit to which officer Brian Sicknick, who died from injuries suffered during the January 6 insurrection, belonged. Dozens of officers were injured in the riot, many seriously, and another officer died by suicide later.Federal prosecutors, in court documents, have argued that the riot was planned in advance, with Trump supporters, militia groups and others plotting in advance to disrupt the counting of Electoral College votes. Chatter of a follow-on attack in March kept thousands of guard troops in Washington for months.Friday's attacker, identified by police as 25-year-old Noah Green, rammed a vehicle into Evans and another officer at a barricade just 100 yards from the Capitol building. He exited the car with a knife before he was shot to death by police, officials said. He had been suffering from delusions, paranoia and suicidal thoughts, a U.S. official told The Associated Press.Investigators are increasingly focused on Green's mental health as they work to identify any motive for the attack, said the official, who was not authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation. The official said investigators had talked to Green's family, who spoke of his increasingly delusional thoughts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-attack-raises-questions-of-security-vs-public-access-101617576030708.html
05-04-2021||World||Florida works to avoid 'catastrophic' pond collapse||Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said Sunday that crews are working to prevent the collapse of a large wastewater pond in the Tampa Bay area while evacuating the area to avoid a “catastrophic flood.”Manatee County officials say the latest models show that a breach at the old phosphate plant reservoir has the potential to gush out 340 million gallons of water in a matter of minutes, risking a 20-foot-high (about 6.1-meter-high) wall of water.“What we are looking at now is trying to prevent and respond to, if need be, a real catastrophic flood situation,” DeSantis said at a press conference after flying over the old Piney Point phosphate mine.Authorities have closed off portions of the U.S. Highway 41 and ordered evacuations of 316 homes. Some families were placed in local hotels.A local jail 1 mile (1.6 kilometers) away from the 77-acre pond is not being evacuated, but officials are moving people and staff to the second story and putting sandbags on the ground floor. Manatee County Administrator Scott Hopes said the models show the area could be covered with between one foot (30 centimeters) to 5 feet (1.5 meters) of water, and the second floor is 10 feet above ground.County officials say well water remains unaffected and there is no threat to Lake Manatee, the area’s primary source of drinking water.The Florida Department of Environmental Protection says the water in the pond is primarily salt water mixed with wastewater and storm water. It has elevated levels of phosphorous and nitrogen and is acidic, but not expected to be toxic, the agency says.Crews have been discharging water since the pond began leaking in March. On Friday, a significant leak that was detected escalated the response and prompted the first evacuations and a declaration of a state of emergency on Saturday. A portion of the containment wall in the reservoir shifted, leading officials to think a collapse could occur at any time.Hopes, the county administrator, said Sunday that with new state resources, crews will be nearly doubling the amount of water being pumped out of the pond and taken to Port Manatee. Currently about 22,000 gallons of water are being discharged per minute, and Hopes said he expects the risk of collapse to decrease by Tuesday.Early Sunday, officials saw an increase of water leaking out, but Hopes says it seems to have plateaued. The water running out on its own is going to Piney Point creek and into Cockroach Bay, an aquatic preserve in the Tampa Bay north of the facility.“Looking at the water that has been removed and the somewhat stability of the current breach, I think the team is much more comfortable today than we were yesterday," he said. “We are not out of the critical area yet.”Hopes said he could not rule out that a full breach could destabilize the walls of the other ponds at the Piney Point site.The Florida DEP Secretary Noah Valenstein said another pond has higher levels of metals.“The radiologicals are still below surface water discharge standards. So, again this is not water we want to see leaving the site,” he said.Officials said the federal Environmental Protection Agency is sending a representative to be at the command center in Manatee County. The agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Calls to the owner of the site, HRK Holdings, for comments went unanswered Saturday and Sunday.The ponds sit in stacks of phosphogypsum, a solid radioactive byproduct from manufacturing fertilizer. State authorities say the water in the breached pond is not radioactive.But the EPA says too much nitrogen in the wastewater causes algae to grow faster, leading to fish kills. Some algal blooms can also harm humans who come into contact with polluted waters, or eat tainted fish.Environmental groups urged the federal government this weekend to step in to halt sending more wastewater to the existing so-called gypsum stacks and halting the creation of more phosphogypsum, which is left behind when phosphate rock is mined to produce fertilizer.“We hope the contamination is not as bad as we fear, but are preparing for significant damage to Tampa Bay and the communities that rely on this precious resource,” Justin Bloom, founder of the Sarasota-based nonprofit organization Suncoast Waterkeeper, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-works-to-avoid-catastrophic-pond-collapse-101617575828790.html
05-04-2021||World||China pushes vaccine on bankers, colleges to catch up with US||China is ramping up its Covid-19 vaccination push, aiming to be twice as fast as the US by pressuring Communist Party members, bank workers and college staff to get shots, as the lagging rollout threatens to undermine the advantage it secured by effectively wiping out the virus.The inoculation effort has been stepped up markedly in recent weeks, with China now administering an average of 5 million doses a day from less than a million at the start of the year. While a significant increase, that translates to 5 doses for every 100 people, compared to 25 in the US and 56 in Israel, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker.Like other countries in the Asia Pacific region that have quashed the coronavirus, China is facing significant hurdles in its vaccination drive, as people don’t see the same urgent need to get inoculated as those in places still battling Covid-19. However, the prospect of other countries -- particularly geopolitical rivals like the US-- achieving herd immunity and re-opening their economies and borders sooner is hardening the resolve to speed up vaccinations in China.“It will challenge the success of China’s Covid response if developed countries are reopening to each other and China still tries to contain the virus from coming in,” said Yanzhong Huang, director of the Center for Global Health Studies at New Jersey’s Seton Hall University.The Chinese Center for Disease Prevention and Control upped its vaccination target earlier this month, and now aims to get as many as 560 million people, or 40% of its vast population, injected by the end of June. That means China will need to give out some 460 million doses in the next three months -- more than two times as much as the goal stated by US President Joe Biden for roughly the same timespan.‘From Commanding Heights to Troughs’Just as some in the US are eligible for donuts after vaccination, part of China’s approach to get people to vaccinate involves dishing out freebies.One poster in downtown Beijing, for example, says that residents over 60 are eligible for a basket of eggs after getting vaccinated. The city’s Daxing district, home to major technology companies, is luring residents by offering shopping coupons. On one such voucher, slogans encourage people to heed the call to get vaccinated in order to secure the ultimate Covid victory.Accompanying the accelerated rollout is also a hardening propaganda campaign that increasingly links vaccination to maintaining national pride and China’s place on the world stage.“Injecting the Covid vaccine is not simply an option, it is the responsibility and duty of every Chinese citizen,” according to a news anchor on a program broadcast on state broadcaster CCTV last week. “If we do not rely on vaccinations to consolidate our hard-earned strengths in fighting the virus, we could suddenly slide from commanding heights to troughs.” The news clip has been distributed widely by community workers on chat groups to convince people to get vaccinated.To achieve its goals, China is calling on its 92 million Communist Party members, plus tens of millions of people employed at state-owned companies.Some party members have been summoned to meetings where they’ve been told to get shots as soon as possible in order to set an example, according to people familiar with the matter. At one such meeting in Beijing, cadres were told they had to get vaccinated, unless they got a medical exemption.Employees of at least three state-owned banks and at least one major university who would not speak on the record said that staff have been repeatedly urged to get vaccinated, and had to provide an official reason if they declined.The information office of China’s State Council didn’t respond to requests for comment. The State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, or SASAC, which oversees China’s government-run companies, didn’t immediately respond to a fax seeking comment.“We’ve seen populations of entire cities queue up and be tested within a few days, and the same kind of infrastructure could be used for mass vaccination,” said Benjamin Cowling, head of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of Hong Kong.Indeed, China has experience in getting vaccination on such a large scale accomplished in the past. In 2010, the government launched a measles inoculation blitz, giving out 100 million doses to children around the country in 10 days to quell a resurgence in the disease.Punitive MeasuresThe question is whether the current approach, comprising of small incentives and societal and peer pressure, can get China’s vaccination numbers sufficiently high enough in the face of widespread vaccine hesitancy.Observers expect officials may need to escalate incentives, for example using punitive measure like restricting the movement of people who haven’t been inoculated.Cowling said that the government could further link vaccination status with the existing health code system, which allows vaccinated people to travel more easily and perhaps be exempt from some quarantine policies.Some local officials are already escalating measures: a city in Hainan province put out posters warning that if people didn’t get vaccinated they would be blacklisted, and barred from public transport, receiving government subsidies and other benefits. The city government later apologized for the harshness of the notice and rescinded the rules.Lin Liwei, a 35-year-old migrant worker in Beijing, is waiting to receive her second dose of the vaccine. Lin fears that she wouldn’t be allowed to board a train to return home to Inner Mongolia if she isn’t inoculated.“If you’re not vaccinated, you’re out,” said Lin.For the time being, the government is still waiting to see how far the existing approach can get them in the vaccination drive, said Seton Hall’s Huang. It could ultimately move to make vaccines compulsory, as some other countries like Indonesia have done.“I don’t think China would mind eventually making vaccination mandatory considering they have implemented far more draconian measures,” said Huang. “As long as you have the vaccine supply and the ability to widely administer shots, it won’t be a problem to make vaccination an obligation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-pushes-vaccine-on-bankers-colleges-to-catch-up-with-us-101617573890654.html

Tokyo considers its US alliance to be the cornerstone of its diplomatic and security policies.Taiwan is expected to be on the agenda as the leaders seek ways to deal with China’s growing security threat in the region.Chinese warplanes are increasingly entering Taiwanese airspace, and China has protested an agreement to bolster cooperation between the US and Taiwanese coast guards that followed Washington’s new sales of arms equipment to Taipei.“It is important for Japan and the United States to cooperate and use deterrence to create an environment where Taiwan and China can find a peaceful solution,” Suga said on a television talk show on Sunday.Philippines, China war of words escalate over SCSManilaThe Philippines defence minister has accused Beijing of planning to occupy more “features” in the South China Sea (SCS), in an escalating war of words over Chinese vessels in the waters.A fleet of more than 200 Chinese ships that sparked a diplomatic row last month after parking at Whitsun Reef off the Philippines is now scattered across the contested Spratly Islands.Manila has called on Beijing to withdraw the “maritime militia” vessels from the area.China has refused, insisting they are fishing boats and are allowed to operate there. But defence secretary Delfin Lorenzana said the vessels were there for other reasons. “The continued presence of Chinese maritime militias in the area reveals their intent to further occupy features in the West Philippine Sea,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwans-peace-stability-key-to-region-says-japan-s-yoshihide-suga-101617569886377.html
05-04-2021||World||UK vaccine passport trials to begin in coming months||Britain’s government is planning to trial a coronavirus status certification plan over the coming months to allow the safe return of mass gatherings at places like sports grounds and nightclubs.Officials are expected to consider passports that show whether a person has received a vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has immunity due to having tested positive in the previous six months.The trial events will include soccer’s FA Cup semi-final and final, the World Snooker Championships, and a comedy club show. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details on Monday.Pope urges jabs for poorRome: Millions of Christians around the world celebrated a second Easter under coronavirus restrictions on Sunday with Pope Francis calling for vaccines to be shared among the poorest nations as Covid-19 surges.Despite vaccine rollouts gathering pace in many richer countries, dramatic spikes in cases have seen deeply unpopular restrictions enforced from Canada to Europe and South America. Vaccination was “an essential tool” in the fight against the virus, the pope said in his Easter Sunday address, with Italy under a strict lockdown over the weekend.“I urge the entire international community... to commit to overcoming delays in the distribution of vaccines and to facilitate their distribution, especially in the poorest countries,” he said to a congregation of only around 100 people inside the vast St Peter’s Basilica.Stricter curbs have come into effect in Belgium as well as in France, where authorities are scrambling to deal with a serious spike in cases.Across the Atlantic, Canada marked a grim milestone of one million Covid-19 cases. According to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, the number of cases was at 1,001,651 on Saturday, becoming the 23rd nation to cross the million mark. The increase in caseload has resulted in several provinces enforcing restrictive measures again.And celebrations have been dampened in South America too, where Brazil is in the grip of a devastating outbreak. The worrying situation led Peru to go into an Easter lockdown, Bolivia to seal the frontier with Brazil, and Chile to close all borders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-vaccine-passport-trials-to-begin-in-coming-months-101617569636996.html
05-04-2021||World||107 arrested in London as protesters clash with police||A total 107 people have been arrested after clashes between officers and demonstrators at a "Kill the Bill" protest in central London on Saturday, the Metropolitan Police has said.Projectiles were thrown around as Met Police officers pushed protesters away in an effort to disperse crowds. Earlier, the police said that around 10 of its officers had received injuries during the operation.In an update on Sunday, the Met Police said the arrests were made for a variety of offences including breach of the peace; violent disorder; assault on police and breaches of Covid legislation.In one instance, a woman was arrested on suspicion of possession of an offensive weapon after a knife was recovered.“While our advice to people remains not to attend large gatherings, the vast majority of people who attended central London yesterday [Saturday], adhered to social distancing, and engaged and listened to my officers. However, as the afternoon wore on it became clear that a small number of people were intent on remaining to cause disruption to law-abiding Londoners,” Commander Ade Adelekan, who led the policing operation in Parliament Square in London, said on Sunday.“Despite repeated instructions from officers to leave, they did not and, amid increasing levels of disorder, arrests were made. We should not allow the behaviour of a few individuals who attend these events with the purpose of committing criminal acts to taint the good behaviour of the majority who attended yesterday,” he said.“We remain in the middle of a global pandemic and we have made great progress in controlling the spread of the virus; we will not allow the selfish actions of a small number of people to put Londoners progress in jeopardy,” he added.The so-called “Kill the Bill” demonstrations also took place in Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Bristol, Newcastle, Brighton, Bournemouth, Weymouth and Luton to protest against the Police and Crime Bill – which propose to give police in England and Wales more power to impose conditions on non-violent protests, including those which are deemed too noisy or a nuisance.Anyone refusing to follow police directions about a protest could be fined up to 2,500 pounds under the law.Former Labour Party Leader Jeremy Corbyn was among those who addressed the protest in London and said the bill would prevent protest without police approval."Stand up for the right to protest, stand up for the right to have your voice heard," he told the crowds.Protesters also carried anti-sexism placards and chanted "women scared everywhere, police and government do not care" as they marched past Downing Street.In Bristol, more than 1,000 people gathered for a peaceful protest, after demonstrations on 23 March and 26 March ended in clashes with police, and in Manchester, people were seen sitting on tram tracks before police moved in.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/107-arrested-in-london-as-protesters-clash-with-police-101617561713634.html
05-04-2021||World||Europe ramps up vaccinations as coronavirus haunts Easter holidays||The French city of Lyon's main stadium opened as a mass vaccination centre during Easter weekend, and thousands spent the holiday lining up for injections at hippodromes, velodromes or other sites as France tried to speed up shots amid a new rush of coronavirus cases.But as Europe celebrated its second Easter in a row under the cloud of the pandemic, some cities put vaccinations on hold over during the long holiday weekend - defying French President Emmanuel Macron's insistence that “there are no weekends or days off during vaccination.”Medical workers need “a little rest at last,” said an official with the French city of Strasbourg, which shut down vaccination facilities from Good Friday through Easter Monday, a public holiday. To ensure that residents still had access to potentially life-saving vaccines, Strasbourg expanded vaccination hours and administered all of its weekly supply of doses between last Monday and Thursday, the official said.Spain, Italy and Germany faced a similar holiday vaccination challenge.Spaniards lined up for shots on Easter Sunday in Barcelona and other points around the country, but Madrid halted vaccinations at local health centers to give staff a break. The Spanish capital continued to give shots at a soccer stadium and a new hospital built to help handle pandemic cases.With Spain fearing yet another surge of infections like the one now overwhelming French intensive care wards, Spanish Health Minister Carolina Darias had urged regional authorities to keep up vaccinations throughout Easter Week.The French city of Sarcelles, north of Paris, was among those whose vaccination center stayed open Easter Sunday, amid mushrooming infections and demand. The center's organizers planned to inject 2,000 doses Sunday - twice their daily average.Those waiting to get inside felt lucky and relieved. The surrounding Val d'Oise region now has the highest coronavirus infection rate in France, and the situation in Sarcelles symbolizes how the pandemic has worsened existing inequalities.“The problem is with people who do not qualify yet and are in a hurry, which I understand as they want to get back to a normal life," said Dr. Majida El Mokhtari. "Unfortunately we are not able to vaccinate everybody with the doses that are distributed to us.”The city's working class residents have higher exposure to the virus because many can't work remotely. In the area's housing projects, many families have multiple generations living in close quarters. Language barriers make sorting out vaccination arrangements a challenge for many immigrants.In Lyon, French first division soccer club Olympique Lyon opened its stadium and provided volunteer employees to help medical workers and firefighters with a mass vaccination drive that started Saturday. Authorities plan to administer 3,000 doses per day during the first three days.Club President Jean Michel Aulas expressed hope that the effort would help create “social cohesion” at a time of strain and uncertainty, as France entered a third partial lockdown starting Sunday.Meanwhile, the French military announced that it would open seven vaccination centers starting Tuesday to help inject civilians.In Italy, those fortunate to get a vaccine in Milan on Sunday received an extra reward: an Easter cake in the shape of a dove and packages of pasta. Only one hospital in the city administered vaccines on Easter, according to Italian media. Among those administering the injections at Milan's Niguarda Hospital were retired hospital doctors volunteering their time.“We're just making our contribution to this important battle” against COVID-19, Dr. Vincenzo Rapisarda told SkyTG24 TV.German vaccination centers appeared to mostly stay open over the holiday, but numbers of injections are typically slower on weekends.The accelerated Easter actions in some European Union countries stood in contrast to the slow beginning of Europe's vaccine rollout over Christmas and New Year's.While France remains far behind Britain and the United States in terms of vaccinating its population, the pace is starting to pick up. France has administered 12 million vaccine doses overall, including nearly 1 million in the last three days.Spanish authorities are speeding up vaccination efforts with the arrival of 2 million doses over the past week, its biggest lot yet. Spain had administered 8.5 million doses as of Friday.Across the Channel, authorities in Britain were planning to test a series of measures including “coronavirus status certifications” over the coming weeks to see if they can allow people to safely return to mass gatherings at sports arenas, nightclubs and concerts.People attending a range of events, including conferences and soccer's FA Cup, will need to be tested both before and after. The trials will also gather evidence on how ventilation and different approaches to social distancing could enable large events to go ahead.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details about the coronavirus passports on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-ramps-up-vaccinations-as-coronavirus-haunts-easter-holidays-101617561271164.html
