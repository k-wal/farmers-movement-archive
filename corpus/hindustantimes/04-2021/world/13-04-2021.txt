The senior official said the size of this residual presence will be decided in consultation with coalition partners.US-led forces were supposed to have left Afghanistan by May 1, according to the terms of an agreement that the Trump administration had signed with the Taliban.President Joe Biden, who is expected to announce the new timeline on Wednesday, had expressed the inability to comply with the May 1 deadline. “We are not staying for a long time. We will leave,” Biden had said. “The question is when we leave.” The US currently has 2,500-3,500 troops in Afghanistan, with around 8,500 soldiers of coalition partners.As a candidate for the White House, Biden had indicated he supported leaving behind a residual force for counterinsurgency and training Afghan forces. But now the troops to be left behind will be meant only for the security of diplomats, which, the US official said, was the topmost priority.The official also said the drawdown will not be condition-based, which would end up keeping US forces in the country longer. The US will continue to monitor al-Qaeda and other terrorist forces in the country from its military presence in the region.The official said the Taliban will be on notice to not attack the US and international forces in the intervening months to the September 11 exit.The drawdown will start before May 1 and will be over before September 11, which is the outer limit, the official said, adding that US forces could leave much earlier than that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usled-troops-to-leave-afghanistan-by-september-11-101618336605283.html

What we know so far||The US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday recommended a “pause” in the use of the Johnson and Johnson (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine “out of an abundance of caution” to probe reports of potentially dangerous blood clots. Six cases of blood clots have been reported among people vaccinated with Johnson and Johnson (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine in the US, reports said.Today FDA and @CDCgov issued a statement regarding the Johnson & Johnson #COVID19 vaccine. We are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution.What we know about the vaccine so far:FDA and the CDC will review the data of the development of a rare and severe type of blood clot in six individuals after they received the vaccine. The adverse effects cases reported in the US appear to be extremely rare and the treatment of this specific type of blood clot is different from the treatment that might typically be administered, said the FDA.The six individuals who reported the adverse effects from the vaccine are women aged between 18 to 48 years. The regulators on the treatment of the effects said, reported CNBC, heparin, which is usually used to treat such symptoms will be dangerous in this case.Johnson and Johnson denied any relation of the symptoms with its vaccine. The company in a statement said, “No clear causal relationship” has been identified between the blood clots and the shot. It is working closely with the regulators to review the data, CNBC quoted J&J as saying.More than 6.8 million individuals have been administered the vaccine, as of Monday, the FDA informed.Also Read | US President Joe Biden to pull troops from Afghanistan by September 11: ReportThe regulators have recommended the pause till the process of investigation is not completed. “CDC will convene a meeting of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) on Wednesday to further review these cases and assess their potential significance. FDA will review that analysis as it also investigates these cases,” it said.Prior to the reports of blood clots in individuals receiving the J&J vaccine, the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine, which is not in use in the US, reported cases of similar symptoms. The European Medical Agency concluded that unusual blood clots with low platelet count be listed as "very rare side effects" of the AstraZeneca vaccine.FDA issued emergency use authorization for single-dose Covid-19 vaccine, developed by the Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson, to prevent the disease in individuals aged 18 and above in February. The administration of the vaccine in a single dose makes it unique from others.“The J&J vaccine went into Phase III trials as a one-dose vaccine because earlier phase trials had shown strong immune responses after just one dose,” said UC San Francisco infectious disease expert Monica Gandhi in March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-recommends-pause-on-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-what-we-know-so-far-101618333452588.html
13-04-2021||World||US President Joe Biden to pull troops from Afghanistan by September 11: Report||President Joe Biden has decided to withdraw US troops from Afghanistan by Sept. 11, 2021, 20 years to the day after al Qaeda's attacks triggered America's longest war, three sources familiar with the decision told Reuters.However, the withdrawal would be based on certain security and human rights guarantees, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity ahead of the formalization of the decision. The sources did not provide further details.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin are expected to brief the decision to NATO allies in Brussels on Wednesday. Biden may also publicly announce his decision, the sources said.Biden's decision, should it be confirmed, would miss a May 1 deadline for withdrawal agreed with Taliban insurgents by his predecessor Donald Trump's administration. In a statement last month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops in Afghanistan if they did not meet the May 1 deadline.But it would still set a near-term date with withdrawal, potentially allaying Taliban concerns that Biden would drag out the process.The May 1 deadline had already started to appear less and less likely in recent weeks, given the lack of preparations on the ground to ensure it could be done in a safe and responsible way. US officials have also blamed the Taliban for failing to live up to commitments to reduce violence and some have warned about persistent Taliban links to al Qaeda.It was those ties that triggered US military intervention in 2001 following al Qaeda's Sept. 11 attacks on New York and Washington because the Taliban had harbored al Qaeda leaders.Thousands of American and allied troops have died in fighting in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-to-pull-troops-from-afghanistan-by-september-11-report-101618329146126.html
13-04-2021||World||Iran to enrich uranium to highest level ever: Official||Iran will begin enriching uranium to 60purity, higher than the programme ever has before, after an attack on its Natanz nuclear facility, an Iranian nuclear negotiator said Tuesday.Abbas Araghchi's comment, quoted by the state-run IRNA news agency, came after Iran's foreign minister warned that the weekend assault could hurt ongoing negotiations over its tattered atomic deal with world powers.Those talks are aimed at finding a way for the United States to re-enter the agreement, the goal of which is to limit Iran's enrichment of uranium in exchange relief on sanctions.Iran had been enriching up to 20 per cent. That is a short technical step to weapons-grade levels.The International Atomic Energy Agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Press TV, the Iranian state television's English-language arm, separately said that the IAEA had been informed of the move. It said the enrichment would begin as of Wednesday.The broadcaster also quoted the negotiator as saying Iran would introduce another 1,000 centrifuges at Natanz, without elaborating.Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had threatened to go to 60 per cent enrichment in February if the country needed.“We are determined to develop our nuclear capabilities in line with the needs of the country,” Khamenei said then, according to a transcript of his speech published by his website. “For this reason, Iran's enrichment will not be limited to 20 per cent, and we will take whatever action is necessary for the country.”Iran previously had said it could use uranium enriched up to 60 per cent for nuclear-powered ships. The Islamic Republic currently has no such ships in its navy.Details remained scarce about the weekend attack at Natanz. The event was initially described only as a blackout in the electrical grid feeding above-ground workshops and underground enrichment halls — but later Iranian officials began referring to it as an attack.The U.S. has insisted it had nothing to do with Sunday's sabotage. Instead, Israel is widely believed to have carried out the assault that damaged centrifuges, though it has not claimed it.But earlier Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif still issued a warning to Washington.“Americans should know that neither sanctions nor sabotage actions would provide them with an instrument for talks," Zarif said in Tehran alongside visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. “They should know that these actions would only make the situation difficult for them.”Zarif separately renewed his earlier warning to Israel over the sabotage, saying that if Iran determines its archenemy was behind it, "then Israel will get its response and will see what a stupid thing it has done.”Kayhan, the hard-line Tehran newspaper, urged Iran to "walk out of the Vienna talks, suspend all nuclear commitments, retaliate against Israel and identify and dismantle the domestic infiltration network behind the sabotage.”“Despite evidence that shows the role of the U.S. as main instigator of nuclear sabotage against Iran, unfortunately some statesmen, by purging the US of responsibility, (aid) Washington's crimes against the people of Iran,” the paper said in Tuesday's editions.While Kayhan is a small-circulation newspaper, its editor-in-chief, Hossein Shariatmadari, was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and has been described as an adviser to him in the past.Such a walkout remains unlikely as the administration of President Hassan Rouhani, whose main diplomatic achievement was the 2015 accord, hopes to get the U.S. to rejoin it and provide desperately needed sanctions relief. However, pressure does appear to be growing within Iran's theocracy over how to respond to the attack.The talks in Vienna — among Iran, world powers still in the deal and the U.S. — are aimed at reviving America's role in the agreement that former President Donald Trump abandoned and lifting the sanctions he imposed.Iran, in turn, would return to the limits set by the deal and dilute its growing stockpile of uranium — some of which has been enriched up to a short step away from weapons-grade levels.Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, though the West and the International Atomic Energy Agency say Tehran had an organized military nuclear program up until the end of 2003. However, the deal prevents it from having enough of a uranium stockpile to be able to pursue a nuclear weapon.Rouhani met later Tuesday with Lavrov and stressed the importance of all parties returning to the deal. Russia is a member of the nuclear deal."We are neither ready to accept less than that, nor are we after achieving more than that,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-to-enrich-uranium-to-highest-level-ever-official-101618322741412.html

The leak of large amounts of radioactive materials has had far-reaching implications on the marine environment, food safety and human health," it said.It said a review report by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) expert team points out that "if the wastewater containing tritium from the Fukushima nuclear plant is discharged into the sea, it will affect the marine environment and people's health of neighbouring countries and that the treated wastewater needs to be further purified to remove other radionuclides”.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also quoted a report by the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) which believes that the impact of the wastewater on the marine ecological environment requires continued monitoring.The Japanese government "should re-evaluate the issue and refrain from wantonly discharging the wastewater before reaching consensus with all stakeholders and the IAEA through full consultations”, the statement said."China will continue to watch closely the developments of the matter together with the international community and reserves the right to make further reactions," it said.China’s state-run CGTN TV reported that South Korea too expressed 'strong regret' after Suga's announcement.Koo Yoon-cheol, head of South Korea's Office for Government Policy Coordination, said that the government will take every necessary measure in line with the principle of keeping its people safe from the contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant.South Korea on Tuesday summoned Japanese Ambassador Koichi Aiboshi over Tokyo's decision to release contaminated water from the Fukushima nuclear plant, the YTN broadcaster reported.However, the US has defended the Japanese government’s decision, saying the release of treated water is an 'acceptable approach'.Japanese government has taken the decision "in close coordination" with the IAEA "including radiation monitoring, remediation, waste management, and decommissioning," said a statement by the US."The US is aware that the GOJ (Government of Japan) examined several options related to the management of the treated water currently being stored onsite at the Fukushima Daiichi site."In this unique and challenging situation, Japan has weighed the options and effects, has been transparent about its decision, and appears to have adopted an approach in accordance with globally accepted nuclear safety standards," it said."We look forward to the GOJ’s continued coordination and communication as it monitors the effectiveness of this approach," it added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-of-actions-against-japan-s-move-to-release-radioactive-water-from-fukushima-nuclear-power-plant-into-sea-101618318223572.html
13-04-2021||World||‘Don’t play with fire’: China tells US after Chinese jets swarm Taiwan border||China on Tuesday warned the US “not to play with fire” on the issue of Taiwan just days after Washington issued new guidelines that will continue to enable US officials to freely meet Taiwanese counterparts, angering Beijing.The warning from China came on a day when self-ruled Taiwan, viewed by China as a renegade region, said a record number of fighter jets from the mainland flew into its air defence zone on Monday.The Taiwanese defence ministry was quoted as saying that at least 25 Chinese military aircraft including nuclear-capable bombers flew inside its air defence identification zone (ADIZ). The island’s defence ministry said it scrambled its own jets to warn and monitor the mainland aircraft.China considers Taiwan as a “core” territorial issue and has been aggressively using the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) to show off military strength around the island of about 23 million people.Beijing has over the years warned countries including India against establishing official ties with Taipei - and instead support the “one China policy” - and has never ruled out reuniting Taiwan using military power.The Chinese foreign ministry on Tuesday continued its aggressive posturing against the US on Taiwan, one of the primary friction points between the two countries.Spokesperson Zhao Lijian told reporters that China has lodged “stern representations” with the US over the guidelines. China, Zhao said, urges the US “not to play with fire on the Taiwan issue, immediately stop any form of US-Taiwan official contacts, cautiously and appropriately handle the matter, and not send wrong signals to Taiwan independence forces so as not to subversively influence and damage Sino-US relations and peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”.China’s latest warning comes after US secretary of state Antony Blinken said Washington is concerned by Beijing’s “increasingly aggressive actions” directed at Taiwan and remains committed to ensuring peace and stability in the western Pacific region.“What we’ve seen, and what is of real concern to us, is increasingly aggressive actions by the government in Beijing directed at Taiwan,” Blinken said during an interview to NBC.The Joe Biden administration is committed to ensuring that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself, Blinken added. “It would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change the existing status quo by force,” he said.Only 15 countries officially recognise Taiwan, and do not have diplomatic ties with Beijing.President Tsai Ing-wen has maintained that Taiwan is an independent country called the Republic of China - which is its formal name - and that she will defend its freedom and security.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-play-with-fire-china-tells-us-after-chinese-jets-swarm-taiwan-border-101618318721851.html

The agencies have drawn up a new guidance aimed "to reduce the risk of transmission of Covid-19 and other zoonoses in traditional food markets". It warned that 'wet markets', such as the one in Wuhan which is linked to the raging coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, pose significant problems when they allow the sale and slaughter of live wild animals in areas open to the public.The agencies that have joined WHO in drawing up the fresh documentation are the World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). "WHO, OIE and UNEP call on all national competent authorities to suspend the trade in live caught wild animals of mammalian species for food or breeding and close sections of food markets selling live caught wild animals of mammalian species as an emergency measure unless demonstrable effective regulations and adequate risk assessment are in place," the document reads.It recalled that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, responsible for the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, had links to a wholesale traditional food market in the Chinese city of Wuhan, with many of the initial patients stall owners, market employees, or regular visitors to the market. Not just the present pandemic, some of the earliest known cases of epidemic outbreaks within the coronavirus family -- the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) in 2012 -- also had links to zoonotic viruses.Most emerging infectious diseases, such as the Lassa fever, Marburg haemorraghic fever, Nipah viral infections and other viral diseases also have viral diseases also have wildlife origins, the agencies said. Research indicates that there is "strong association" between the marketing and sale of live wild animals and the emergence of novel zoonotic pathogens, the document notes, adding, "Animals, particularly wild animals, are reported to be the source of more than 70% of all emerging infectious diseases in humans, many of which are caused by novel viruses."The agencies called for improved hygiene standards in traditional food markets and tougher regulations to control the farming and sale of wild animals heading to markets for human consumption. This was a necessary to reduce the risk of transmitting diseases from animals, and between people, the documentation notes.Click here for the complete interim guidance issued by WHO, the OIE, and the UN environment programme for reducing reducing public health risks associated with the sale of live wild animals of mammalian species in traditional food markets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/over-70-of-emerging-diseases-may-come-from-wild-animals-warns-who-101618310911314.html
13-04-2021||World||US recommends 'pause' for J&J Covid-19 vaccine over blood clotting reports||The US is recommending a “pause” in administration of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccine to investigate reports of potentially dangerous blood clots.In a joint statement Tuesday, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration said it was investigating clots in six women in the days after vaccination, in combination with reduced platelet counts. More than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been administered in the U.S.U.S. federal distribution channels, including mass vaccination sites, will pause the use of the J&J shot, and states and other providers are expected to follow.CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices will meet Wednesday to discuss the cases and the FDA has also launched an investigation of the cases.“Until that process is complete, we are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,” Dr. Anne Schuchat, Principal Deputy Director of the CDC and Dr. Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research said in a joint statement.

13-04-2021||World||Myanmar protesters cancel new year festivities; UN urges end to 'slaughter'||Opponents of military rule in Myanmar cancelled traditional new year festivities on Tuesday and instead showed their anger with the generals who seized power through low-key displays of defiance and small protests across the country.The United Nations human rights office said it feared that the military clampdown on protests since the Feb. 1 coup risked escalating into a civil conflict like that seen in Syria and appealed for a halt to the "slaughter".A Myanmar activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, says the security forces have killed 710 protesters since the ouster of an elected government led by Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi.Protesters were out again on the first day of the five-day New Year holiday, known as Thingyan, which is usually celebrated with prayers, ritual cleaning of Buddha images in temples and high-spirited water-dousing on the streets."We do not celebrate Myanmar Thingyan this year since over 700 of our innocent brave souls have been killed," said one Twitter user named Shwe Ei.Women wearing fine clothes for the most important holiday of the year protested in several towns holding traditional pots containing seven flowers and sprigs that are displayed at this time, media pictures showed.Many people painted the protesters' three-finger salute on their Thingyan pots."People's power, our power," women marching on a street in the main city of Yangon chanted as passersby clapped, video posted by the Myanmar Now media group showed.In some places, people set out dozens of Thingyan pots daubed with messages such as "Save Myanmar" in silent shows of opposition to the military.There were no immediate reports of violence at any of the protests but information has become scarce because of the junta's curbs on broadband internet and mobile data services.Soldiers shot and killed a man and a woman delivering milk on a motorbike in the northwestern town of Tamu, on the border with India, three media outlets reported.Several small blasts went off in different places, including two in Yangon, but there were no reports of casualties or claims of responsibility.A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.'Deadly mistakes'The coup has plunged Myanmar into crisis after 10 years of tentative steps toward democracy with daily protests and workers in many sectors on strike, bringing the economy to a standstill.UN high commissioner Michelle Bachelet said in a statement 3,080 had been detained and there are reports that 23 people have been sentenced to death following secret trials."I fear the situation in Myanmar is heading towards a full-blown conflict. States must not allow the deadly mistakes of the past in Syria and elsewhere to be repeated," Bachelet said.Bachelet referred to the reported killing of 82 people in the central town of Bago last week and she said targeted sanctions, as imposed by some Western countries, were not enough.She called for "immediate, decisive and impactful measures to push Myanmar’s military leadership into halting its campaign of repression and slaughter".Activists keen to maintain the momentum of their campaign against the military have called for protests throughout the holiday, which runs until Saturday.This was the second year in a row the new year festivities were called off. Last year, it was because of the novel coronavirus."We cannot enjoy this year. We will celebrate once we get democracy," said another Twitter user, Su Su Soe.The military says it had to overthrow Suu Kyi's government because a November election again won by her National League for Democracy was rigged. The election commission dismissed the accusation.Suu Kyi, 75, who has led Myanmar's struggle against military rule for decades and who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, has been detained since the coup and charged with various offences. These include violating a colonial-era official secrets act that alone could see her jailed for 14 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-cancel-new-year-festivities-un-urges-end-to-slaughter-101618311094462.html
13-04-2021||World||Novavax says supply shortages delaying full-speed production of its Covid-19 vaccine||Novavax Inc has pushed back the timeline for hitting its production target of 150 million Covid-19 vaccine doses per month until the third quarter due to supply shortages including bags used to grow cells, a company spokeswoman told Reuters.Novavax executives had previously said full-scale vaccine production could be achieved by mid-year. The company told Reuters in January it expected to reach full production capacity by May or June."We said during our earnings call that we expect all capacity being online by around mid-year. We’re continuing to refine that timing as we get closer, which now leads us to think we’re online/at full capacity by Q3," Novavax communications director Amy Speak said by email on Monday."There are some supply shortages that come and go that have contributed to the revision in timing," she added. "These have included things like the bioreactor bags and filters."Novavax could receive UK regulatory authorization for its vaccine as early as this month after releasing impressive UK trial data. It anticipates clearance in the United States could come as early as May after soon-to-be released data from its US vaccine trial are reviewed by regulators.The Maryland-based company is one of several Covid-19 vaccine makers that have had to push back production timelines due to industrywide shortages of raw materials and difficulties getting plants up and running.Reuters reported last month that Novavax had delayed a planned deal to ship at least 100 million doses of its two-shot vaccine to the European Union, in part because of supply challenges.In a Saturday interview with the Guardian, Novavax Chief Executive Stan Erck said the company has faced difficulties sourcing key production materials including single-use bags used to grow vaccine cells."Single-use bags are facing critical shortages and delays," said Mark Womack, chief business officer of AGC Biologics, a contract manufacturer that is producing materials used in Novavax's vaccine.Data released in March from the UK trial showed the vaccine to be highly effective against the original strain of the novel coronavirus as well as the more contagious and deadly variant first discovered in Britain and now rampant in Europe and the United States. The data also suggests the shot provides some protection against a highly concerning variant that emerged in South Africa, which some drugmakers have said may require a booster shot to address.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novavax-says-supply-shortages-delaying-full-speed-production-of-its-covid-19-vaccine-101618310427482.html
13-04-2021||World||Australia rules out adding Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine to inoculation plan||The Australian government said Tuesday it had decided against buying the single-dose Johnson & Johnson coronavirus vaccine and identified a second case of a rare blood clot likely linked to the AstraZeneca shot.The government had been in talks with the New Jersey-based pharmaceutical giant, which had asked the Australian regulator, Therapeutic Goods Administration, for provisional registration.But Health Minister Greg Hunt ruled out a J&J contract because its vaccine was similar to the AstraZeneca product, which Australia had already contracted for 53.8 million doses.Hunt said the government was following the advice of Australia's scientific and technical advisory group.“J&J is another viral vector vaccine and we have no advice recommending, at this point, that the government purchase any additional viral vector vaccine,” Hunt told reporters. "That's not a reflection, that's simply an observation.”Australia has been relatively successful in containing the spread of the virus, but criticism is mounting over the pace of its vaccination rollout.Australia had planned to rely on Australian-manufactured AstraZeneca to reach a target of delivering at least one dose of vaccine to all eligible adults among a population of 26 million by October.But the government abandoned that target after it advised last week that Pfizer was now the preferred option for people under 50 years because of a potential risk of rare blood clots linked to AstraZeneca.A man in Victoria state who received an AstraZeneca injection on March 22 had to be hospitalized with blood clots. A second case was reported Tuesday of a woman who was inoculated in Western Australia state and hospitalized in Darwin, regulator said in a statement.With 700,000 AstraZeneca doses injected in Australia since early March, the two cases equate to a clotting frequency of 1-in-350,000, the regulator said. British authorities say the risk of such blood clots is 1-in-250,000 in that country.The government has doubled its Pfizer order to 40 million doses and Hunt said delivery of the additional 20 million doses was expected in the last three months of 2021.“That would mean a significant sprint for those that hadn't been vaccinated by then,” Hunt said, referring to the government's hope to have the population inoculated this year.Australia had hoped to administer 4 million doses of the two vaccines by the end March, but had only injected 1.2 million doses by Monday.An 80-year-old Australian man on Monday became the first Covid-19 fatality in Australia this year and the 910th since the pandemic began.The man had been living in the Philippines where he became infected. He tested positive in hotel quarantine as a returned traveller and died in a Brisbane hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-rules-out-adding-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-to-inoculation-plan-101618309611633.html
13-04-2021||World||Climate lies are Facebook’s new target in the misinformation war||In the midst of the heated US presidential race last summer, with hypercharged scrutiny of partisan propaganda on social media, Facebook Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg received a letter from a group of US senators led by Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren that had nothing to do with elections. They were angry about a year-old piece of climate news.A Washington Examiner article shared on Facebook in 2019 had denounced climate models, which are widely used by scientists around the world to measure and predict the impacts of warmer temperatures. Science Feedback, an outside organization Facebook works with on fact-checking, had labeled the story false. A review by five scientists found the story “highly misleading” because of “false factual assertions” and accused the authors of “cherry-picking datasets.” The conclusion meant Facebook posts linking to the story would now be saddled with a label saying it had been disputed. But then Facebook said because the article was designated as an op-ed, it was exempt from fact checks under the company’s policies. The “false” label was removed. Warren’s letter called the op-ed policy a “massive loophole.” Facebook’s policies on climate lies “represents another unfortunate example of Facebook’s refusal to fully combat the deliberate spread of misinformation,” she added.Climate change has emerged as a key priority in Facebook’s quest to stomp out misinformation, a complicated effort that involves policing user posts while simultaneously defending free speech. In the past few months the company has started fighting climate misinformation with some of the same strategies used to battle Covid‑19 myths and election falsehoods—a sign of the topic’s growing importance internally. But Facebook’s misinformation policies have also left climate activists frustrated.Zuckerberg got another letter last month, this time from 13 environmental groups including the Union of Concerned Scientists and Greenpeace, asking the company to commit to monitoring climate disinformation and releasing reports, among other things. “Climate change disinformation is spreading rapidly across Facebook’s social media platform, threatening the ability of citizens and policymakers to fight the climate crisis,” the groups wrote.Unlike elections, which have shorter timelines, climate change is a long-term problem with no definitive ending. That means Facebook doesn’t consider lies about the climate an “imminent” threat of real-world harm, which is the threshold the company uses to determine whether a post containing misinformation should be removed from the service entirely. “It is an immediate threat, and the fact that they don’t see that makes me mad,” says Naomi Oreskes, a professor of the history of science at Harvard and the co-author of Merchants of Doubt, a book about climate science being deliberately obscured. “We have enormous evidence now that many storms, floods, hurricanes, cyclones have been made worse by climate change.”At a congressional hearing last month, Zuckerberg admitted that climate misinformation is “a big issue.” A Facebook spokesman says climate change misinformation accounts for a very low percentage of total misinformation on the service but declined to share figures. Experts who follow climate misinformation have had a tough time quantifying its presence on Facebook given a lack of access to private groups and messages, but they’ve seen how small lies can spread quickly.When millions of Texans lost power in February, Facebook failed to label a number of posts falsely claiming that “wind turbine failures were a leading cause of blackouts,” according to Avaaz, a nonprofit group that studied the issue. The top 10 posts promoting those claims, none of which received fact check labels, garnered an estimated 15.8 million views, Avaaz found.“Even if it seems like it’s a small number of actors sometimes, the scale of Facebook’s algorithm and its reach as the world’s information highway right now means that millions of people will be impacted by what they see on that platform,” says Fadi Quran, a campaign director at Avaaz.An outside climate watchdog called InfluenceMap found in October 2020 that dozens of climate denial ads slipped through the social network’s filters and garnered 8 million views. The ads were targeted to older users in more rural, Republican-leaning states, making them more impactful, says Dylan Tanner, executive director of InfluenceMap. “The power of that targeting makes that 8 million even more powerful,” he says. A Facebook search in March by Bloomberg Green found a handful of groups, with thousands of members, with names such as “Man Made Global Warming is a HOAX” and “Climate Crisis? There is NO Climate Crisis!”A Facebook spokesman says “we take action against pages, groups, and accounts that repeatedly share false claims.” When fact-checkers rate content as false, he says, “we add a warning label and reduce its distribution.” Groups that repeatedly share misinformation aren’t removed, but are no longer recommended by Facebook’s algorithm, he adds.Climate misinformation has been around for decades, with lobbying efforts and marketing by Big Oil as far back as the 1980s, but Oreskes says social media may be making it worse. A regular public speaker on climate issues, she’s noticed in recent years that attendees’ questions often mirror online memes. “When it spreads to social media it’s even more pernicious,” Oreskes says, “because now you’re hearing it from a friend or relative.”Just as Facebook can exacerbate a false narrative, it also has the ability to change it entirely. With almost 2.8 billion users globally, the social network has an opportunity with climate change that it hasn’t had with other topics—a chance to educate millions of people without the pressure of a looming election or public health crisis.Facebook’s efforts to fight climate-related misinformation picked up last year when it called a handful of experts to ask for help. That led the company to create the Climate Science Information Center, a dedicated space on the service with scientist-approved information. The center appears as the top search result when users query climate-related terms, like “global warming” or “greenhouse gases.” Users can see charts mapping the average annual temperature of their state, or click to read facts about declining polar bear populations or excess carbon dioxide.The data are meant to counter common misconceptions that people share on Facebook, including claims that the concept of climate change is widely disputed among scientists (not true), or that climbing temperatures are not the result of human activity (also false). Facebook is already adding links to the center on user posts about climate change for some in the UK, and could soon expand those labels to other countries.Widespread labeling posts is the same approach Facebook used for the 2020 US election and for Covid‑19 vaccine information. It’s a strategy that aligns with one of Zuckerberg’s key beliefs: The best way to fight misinformation is with more information.“There has long been this kind of purity default that we should treat all of this as ‘we are just a platform for the free expression of ideas,’” says Anthony Leiserowitz, the founder and director of the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication, who advised Facebook on its climate hub and was not paid by the company. “Maybe through force, maybe through argument inside, they are increasingly recognizing that’s just not an adequate answer to the challenges they are facing.”Experts say the info center is a good effort but only a start. Oreskes still thinks Facebook should remove climate misinformation entirely. Quran wants Facebook to retroactively notify people if they’ve previously seen misinformation by putting alerts in their feed. “If the goal is addressing misinformation, just providing facts is not an adequate solution,” says John Cook, a research fellow at the Climate Change Communication Research Hub at Monash University in Melbourne.  He also consulted on Facebook’s effort without pay. “But I think they recognize that themselves.”There’s reason to suspect Facebook’s recent efforts may signal more changes to come. Climate change is an issue of great importance to the company’s employees, according to internal surveys, and top executives agree. Zuckerberg once said stopping climate change was “one of the most important challenges of our generation,” and Donald Trump’s decision to pull out of the Paris Agreement marked one of the few times Zuckerberg publicly criticized the former president.Chris Cox, the social network’s longtime head of product and one of its most powerful executives, is also a climate advocate. He advised and invested in multiple climate-related startups during a brief year away from Facebook. Cox’s return in May 2020 added “a huge amount of momentum” to some of the company’s climate-related products, says Edward Palmieri, Facebook’s director of sustainability. “The Climate Science Information Center is something that we had been thinking about, but Chris was able to help us move even faster and get even more resources.”If the company manages to effectively combat climate misinformation, it could be a major step toward educating millions of people. A failure to stop the lies from spreading, on the other hand, could be devastating. “[It’s] not just an important opportunity, but responsibility to give their users access to quality information,” Leiserowitz says. “To go to an old saying: You never get a second chance to make a first impression.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/climate-lies-are-facebook-s-new-target-in-the-misinformation-war-101618308403761.html
13-04-2021||World||Russia blames US, other NATO nations for turning Ukraine into 'powder keg'||Moscow on Tuesday accused the United States and other NATO countries of turning Ukraine into a "powder keg," after the West sounded the alarm over Russian soldiers massing on the border."The United States and other NATO countries are deliberately turning Ukraine into a powder keg," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies, adding that countries were increasing their arms supplies to Ukraine.Clashes between Ukrainian forces and Moscow-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine have escalated in recent weeks, upending a ceasefire brokered last year.Following an uptick in violence, Russia has built up troops along the border, raising fears of a major escalation in the long-running conflict in Ukraine's mainly Russian-speaking east."If there is any aggravation, we of course will do everything to ensure our security and the safety of our citizens, wherever they are," Ryabkov said."But Kiev and its allies in the West will be entirely responsible for the consequences of a hypothetical exacerbation," he added.On Tuesday morning, a Ukrainian soldier was killed and two more injured near the village of Mayorske some 35 kilometres (21 miles) north of the separatist stronghold Donetsk when a drone dropped grenades on the positions of Kiev's troops, the military said.The latest casualty brought the number of Ukrainian troops killed since the start of the year to 29, compared to 50 in all of 2020.Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba was in Brussels on Tuesday, where he met with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg.Kuleba was also set to meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken in Brussels later Tuesday.Ahead of the visit he said he wanted to discuss Western support for Ukraine."Already now we need to talk about practical support that Ukraine can get in case of a large-scale armed escalation," Kuleba said in televised remarks late Monday.The Kremlin, which has not denied the troop movements along the border, has said it is not planning to go to war with Ukraine, but also added that it "will not remain indifferent" to the fate of Russian speakers in the east||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-blames-us-other-nato-nations-for-turning-ukraine-into-powder-keg-101618308366520.html
13-04-2021||World||Hong Kong activist Joshua Wong jailed for 4 months for 2019 protest||Joshua Wong, one of Hong Kong’s most prominent democracy activists and among 47 people charged under a national security law, was sentenced to four months in jail on Tuesday for unauthorized assembly and violating an anti-mask law.Wong, 24, had pleaded guilty to both charges, including taking part in and using a facial covering at an unauthorized assembly in October 2019 during the height of anti-government protests, the court heard.He had faced a maximum possible sentence of three years in jail. The sentence will extend a 13-and-a-half-month sentence he is already serving for organising an illegal assembly.Wong, whom magistrate Daniel Tang called an "iconic figure", thanked his supporters, some of who chanted, "I miss you" and "Hang in there."In October 2019, Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam invoked colonial-era emergency powers for the first time in more than 50 years to enact a regulation banning face masks, which many pro-democracy protesters used to hide their identities from authorities.Under the law, it was illegal to wear a mask at both lawful and unlawful assemblies. Offenders faced a maximum one year in jail and a HK$25,000 fine.People who needed to wear masks for health, religious or job-related reasons were exempt, although critics said the ban was confusing.Wong was among 47 democrats charged with conspiracy to commit subversion in late February under the city’s national security law for running in an unofficial primary election in July last year, the largest single crackdown on the opposition since the law was implemented.He is currently serving a 13-and-a-half-month sentence for organising and inciting an unlawful assembly near the city’s police headquarters in June 2019.The former British colony of Hong Kong returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with the promise of wide-ranging autonomy and freedoms that pro-democracy activists, who brought parts of the city to frequent halts in sometimes violent protests in 2019, say are being whittled away by Communist Party rulers in Beijing.China denies interference.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-activist-joshua-wong-jailed-for-4-months-for-2019-protest-101618307253247.html

This wasn't a burnout, he added, but doctors advised him to take a break.“In the most serious health crisis for decades, the republic needs a health minister who is 100% fit,” Anschober said. “I am not at the moment, and I won't be in the coming weeks if I don't pull the emergency brake.”“This pandemic takes no breaks and so a health minister can't take a break either,” he added.Austria was one of the first countries in western Europe to mandate the use of masks last year and was able to ease its first lockdown quickly.Like several other European countries, it has struggled to find a consistent line in the pandemic since last fall. Austria bet heavily on opening up some sectors for people with negative tests, but hasn't been able to break a succession of lockdowns and currently has an infection rate significantly higher than neighboring Germany's.“On the whole, I think we have done good work,” Anschober said. “In a pandemic, no one is free of mistakes. Everyone makes mistakes. ... We were in uncharted territory.”“My impression is that it isn't 15 months, more like 15 years,” he said of his time in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/overworked-austria-s-health-minister-quits-cites-personal-health-problems-101618304747104.html
13-04-2021||World||Iran warns sabotage affects Vienna talks over nuclear deal||Iran's foreign minister warned Tuesday that an attack on its main nuclear enrichment site at Natanz affects ongoing negotiations in Vienna over its tattered atomic deal with world powers.Mohammad Javad Zarif's remarks, alongside visiting Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, come as the U.S. has insisted it had nothing to do with the sabotage Sunday at the Natanz nuclear facility. While not claiming the attack, Israel is widely believed to have carried out the still-unexplained assault that damaged centrifuges there.“Americans should know that neither sanctions nor sabotage actions would provide them with an instrument for talks," Zarif said in Tehran. “They should know that these actions would only make the situation difficult for them.”Kayhan, the hard-line Tehran newspaper, urged Iran to "walk out of the Vienna talks, suspend all nuclear commitments, retaliate against Israel and identify and dismantle the domestic infiltration network behind the sabotage.”“Despite evidence that shows the role of the U.S. as main instigator of nuclear sabotage against Iran, unfortunately some statesmen, by purging the U.S. of responsibility, (aid) Washington’s crimes against the people of Iran,” the paper said in Tuesday's editions.While Kayhan is a small-circulation newspaper, its editor-in-chief, Hossein Shariatmadari ,was appointed by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and has been described as an adviser to him in the past.Such a walkout remains unlikely as the administration of President Hassan Rouhani, whose main diplomatic achievement was the 2015 accord, hopes to get the U.S. to rejoin it and provide desperately needed sanctions relief. However, pressure does appear to be growing within Iran's theocracy over how to respond to the attack.Details remained scarce about what happened early Sunday at Natanz. The event was initially described only as a blackout in the electrical grid feeding above-ground workshops and underground enrichment halls — but later Iranian officials began referring to it as an attack. Israeli media, which has close ties with the military and intelligence services of that country, have described the sabotage as a cyberattack, without offering evidence or sourcing to support that.The extent of the damage at Natanz also remains unclear, though Iran's Foreign Ministry has described it as damaging Iran's first-generation IR-1 centrifuges, the workhorse of its nuclear program. A former Iranian Revolutionary Guard chief said Tuesday that the assault set off a fire while a civilian nuclear program spokesman mentioned a “possible minor explosion.”In remarks aired late Monday by state television. the former head of the country's civilian nuclear arm offered his own description of the attack, calling its design “very beautiful.” The attack appeared to target both the power grid at Natanz, as well as the facility's emergency backup power fed by separate batteries, Fereydoun Abbasi said.Abbasi said a similar attack targeted Iran's underground Fordo facility in 2012 with two explosions: one 30 kilometers (18.5 miles) away at a power station and the other at Fordo's emergency battery system.“We had predicted that and we were using a separate power grid,” Abbasi said. "They hit but nothing happened for our machines.”It remains unclear on which power source Natanz in central Iran relies. Satellite photographs appear to show an electrical substation at the facility's northwest corner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-warns-sabotage-affects-vienna-talks-over-nuclear-deal-101618305607683.html

But rapid vaccination, and a nationwide lockdown have sharply decreased infections and deaths.Lockdown restrictions are now being lifted, with nonessential shops, hairdressers, gyms and pub and restaurant patios reopening in England on Monday.Health authorities are also concerned about new variants that are more resistant to the vaccines. They are calling for everyone living in two boroughs in south London to get tested after 44 cases of a strain first identified in South Africa were confirmed there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-meets-target-on-jabs-for-over50s-101618304157532.html

In one of the most potent signs of Wall Street’s growing acceptance of cryptocurrencies, Coinbase will list on the Nasdaq on April 14 at a valuation of about $100 billion.“It’s the evolution of an industry that used to sit on the periphery,” said Nick Jones, CEO and co-founder at cryptocurrency wallet Zumo. “It really blurs the lines between crypto and more traditional financial institutions.”Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley have announced plans to offer their clients access to crypto investments. Tesla Inc. earlier this year disclosed a $1.5 billion investment in Bitcoin and more recently started accepting it as payment for electric cars.Still, some skeptics argue that digital coins have been inflated by stimulus that’s also sent stocks to records. Regulators around the world are stepping up oversight and casting doubt on its usefulness as a currency.Coinbase’s public debut this week is also boosting the digital coins of other cryptocurrency exchanges, such as Binance Coin, which has jumped to become the third-most valuable cryptocurrency behind Bitcoin and Ether.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-rallies-to-all-time-high-as-traders-eye-coinbase-listing-101618303730163.html

Even though it is festival time right now, we cannot have fun. We will not be happy until this dictator is overthrown and we will revolt until then," a university student in Mandalay told AFP, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the danger of arrest.Another protester named Ray in Yangon said the pots were a way to welcome the new year and "honour fallen heroes"."There will be a whole itinerary of things to do in the coming five days to show that we are against this dictatorship happening in Myanmar and that we will keep fighting for democracy," he told AFP.In Mandalay -- Myanmar's cultural hub -- people placed the pots and flowers on a golden stupa, with signs showing the three-fingered salute that has become a symbol of the resistance movement.Young people in Mawlamyine, the fourth largest city, took to the streets early Tuesday while people marched with pots and flowers in the city of Dawei and small towns in Shan and Kachin states.Meanwhile, security forces found and defused a bomb beneath the Myaynigone bridge in Yangon on Tuesday morning, a police source said.Hiding in the jungleEthnic armed rebel groups have stepped up attacks on the military and police in recent weeks, raising fears of Myanmar spiralling into broader civil conflict.The military has retaliated with air strikes which the Free Burma Rangers, a Christian aid group working in the area, said had displaced more than 24,000 civilians in Karen state by Saturday.The Rangers, who run a health clinic in the state, said air strikes had killed at least 20 people and wounded more than 40.The area is remote and communications are difficult, and AFP has not been able to independently verify the deaths.The group said a 60-year-old man was killed and an 11 year-old girl wounded in mortar bomb attacks last week.Villagers in some areas were unable to prepare their rice crops because of fears the military would shell them in their fields, the aid group said."They are afraid they will have no rice harvest next fall," Free Burma Rangers said in a statement.In Yangon, authorities are hunting those responsible for an underground newsletter titled "Molotov" that is circulating both online and in printed form across the country.The publication was started by a group of young activists to fight ongoing internet outages and information suppression."The Molotov journal is illegally published," the state Global New Light of Myanmar said, adding that legal action would be taken against those involved and anyone offering assistance to the publication.Overnight, the junta announced a further 20 people were added to an arrest warrant list of 200 celebrities, including actors and singers, who are accused of spreading dissent against the military.If convicted they could face three years' jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anticoup-protesters-rally-on-myanmar-new-year-holiday-101618303408807.html
13-04-2021||World||China warns 34 tech firms to curb excess in antitrust review||China ordered 34 internet corporations Tuesday to rectify their anti-competitive practices within the next month, signaling that Beijing’s scrutiny of its most powerful firms hasn’t ended with the conclusion of a probe into Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Shares in Tencent Holdings Ltd. and Meituan extended losses after the State Administration for Market Regulation issued a stern statement emphasizing it will continue to eradicate abuses of information and market dominance among other violations. Also summoned to an ad-hoc meeting with the watchdog on Tuesday were industry leaders including TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd., search giant Baidu Inc. and JD.com Inc.Regulators warned internet companies to “heed Alibaba’s example,” reaffirming their intent to abolish forced exclusivity among other practices. The meeting -- organized jointly with the cyberspace and tax regulators -- came days after Beijing wrapped up a four-month probe into Alibaba by slapping a record $2.8 billion fine on the e-commerce giant for abuse of market dominance.The penalty was less severe than many feared and lifted a cloud of uncertainty hanging over founder Jack Ma’s internet empire. It also came after the Chinese central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech titan.Alibaba’s shares have gained 7% since the start of the week, but its fellow Chinese internet giants have gyrated while investors digest the rapid-fire announcements and concerns grow that Beijing’s scrutiny will extend beyond Alibaba. On Tuesday, Tencent gave up early gains to finish down slightly while Meituan, video service Kuaishou Technology and JD all slid more than 3% in Hong Kong.“The base line of policies cannot the crossed, the red line of laws cannot be touched,” the market watchdog said in the statement on Tuesday.The investigation into Alibaba was one of the opening salvos in a campaign seemingly designed to curb the power of China’s internet leaders, which kicked off after Ma infamously rebuked “pawn shop” lenders, regulators who don’t get the internet, and the “old men” of the global banking community. Those comments set in motion an unprecedented regulatory offensive, including scuttling Ant’s $35 billion initial public offering.The 34 firms summoned Tuesday must now undergo complete rectification after conducting internal checks and inspections over the next month, and make a pledge to society to obey rules and laws, the antitrust watchdog said in its statement. Regulators will organize follow-up inspections and companies that continue to engage in abuses like forced exclusivity -- a practice that “flagrantly trampled and destroyed” market order -- will be dealt with severely.The regulator also highlighted abuses like acquisitions that squeeze out smaller rivals and burning through cash to grab market share in community group buying, currently the hottest e-commerce arena in China. Firms also need to address issues like counterfeiting, data leaks and tax evasion, according to the statement.“This is positive because the SAMR is giving the platforms one month to review their practices, rather than dish out fines and penalties without warning,” Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Vey-Sern Ling said. “They are using Alibaba as an example to deter misbehavior from the rest of the industry players. If these companies toe the line, industry competition can become healthier. ”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-warns-34-tech-firms-to-curb-excess-in-antitrust-review-101618303200345.html

Wild mammals, in particular, pose a risk for the emergence of new diseases," it said."Traditional markets, where live animals are held, slaughtered and dressed, pose a particular risk for pathogen transmission to workers and customers alike," said the guidance.It also called on governments to close sections of food markets selling live wild mammals unless adequate risk assessments were in place.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-who-seeks-ban-on-sale-of-live-wild-mammals-in-food-markets-101618299676073.html

But Politico has reported that the Canadian government, which is a major sponsor of HFX, could rethink the partnership because it doesn’t want to overtly upset the Chinese government by backing a forum that intends to award Tsai, a prominent critic of Beijing.Relations between Canada and China have been rocky since 2018, but at the same time, Ottawa reportedly doesn’t want to aggravate the ties further by staying associated with the Canadian security forum that seeks to honour the Taiwanese president.Beijing recognises Taiwan as part of its territory, while President Tsai deems Taiwan as a territory independent of mainland China’s firm control.Canada’s defence minister Harjit Sajjan, when asked to comment on the development, refused to be drawn into committing himself into a decisive position as of now.Appearing before the House of Commons committee on Canada-China relations, Sajjan was asked if Ottawa would cut off funding to HFX as a result of its decision to award the Taiwanese president. “When the funding request comes to me, as it does every year, I have stated I will take a look at it,” Sajjan was quoted as saying in response, according to CBC News. “The Halifax International Security Forum is an independent organisation and they make their own choices with regards to the awards.”The defence minister traditionally inaugurates HFX’s conference and delivers a keynote speech.The Politico report has already led to criticism of the Canadian government from observers including the late Senator John McCain’s daughter, Meghan McCain. “Absolutely pathetic - Canadian government is a bunch of cowards condoning Chinese genocide,” she tweeted.Her mother Cindy is on the Halifax board of directors and is widely expected to soon be appointed an ambassador by the US government.HFX has yet to formally announce the awardee this year. Politico quoted its vice-president Robin Shepherd as saying, “President Tsai of Taiwan is a well respected international leader, the first female president of Taiwan, and a strong global advocate for democracy. She would certainly be an ideal fit for this award.” A spokesperson for Taiwan’s foreign affairs ministry, Joanne Ou, told the news outlet Focus Taiwan that if Tsai wins the prize, “it would be an affirmation and honour for both President Tsai and the people of Taiwan in their anti-pandemic efforts and democratic achievements”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/halifaxs-plans-to-award-beijing-critic-tsai-upsets-canadian-govt-report-101618299341306.html

13-04-2021||World||No nation is more important than India as US seeks to counter China: Think tank||A leading think tank for science and technology policy has said as Washington seeks to counter a rising China, no nation is more important than India with its abundance of highly skilled technical professionals and strong political and cultural ties with the United States.It however cautioned that "overreliance" on India as an IT services provider could become a strategic problem if major disagreements emerge between the two nations on issues such as intellectual property, data governance, tariffs, taxation, local content requirements or individual privacy.The Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (ITIF) think-tank in a report released on Monday describes the worst and best-case scenarios.In one, tensions between India and China are reduced and the many business synergies between these two neighbouring nations come to the fore. In this case, the heart of the global economy would shift to the east, and there would be little the United States could do about it, the report stated.In the second scenario, the interests of India and the United States become increasingly aligned, as the economic, military, and international relations challenges from China grow. In such a case, democratic norms could prevail across most of the developed world, as developing nations start looking to a 'Delhi model' instead of a 'Beijing model', it stated."As America seeks to counter a rising China, no nation is more important than India, with its vast size, an abundance of highly skilled technical professionals, and strong political and cultural ties with the United States."But the parallels between America's dependency on China for manufacturing and its dependency on India for IT services are striking," said the think-tank.According to David Moschella, a non-resident senior fellow at ITIF and co-author of the report, the same forces that increasingly divide the United States and China are now pushing the US and India closer together."The interplay between the United States, India, and China will shape global competition and digital innovation for years to come. While there is a wide range of possible scenarios, two things are clear: India should be an essential part of US efforts to compete with and reduce its dependence on China, and this will inevitably expand America's global dependencies from manufacturing to services,” he said."America's technology dependencies on India in the 2020s seem certain to rise. Yet it is important to know whether the United States will be dependent on a strategic partner with strong mutual interests, or on an increasingly neutral rival," said ITIF president Robert D. Atkinson, who co-authored the report with Moschella.Much will depend on the strategic choices that the Joe Biden administration and Indian government make in the next several years. One thing is clear that economic and geopolitical stakes could not be higher, he said.The report describes how India is making important progress in research and development, innovation centres, machine learning, analytics, product design and testing, and other areas, especially in IT and life sciences.While leading US tech companies are well-positioned in India's booming Internet and e-commerce marketplaces, strong local competitors are now emerging. Outside the technology sector, US companies operating in India face stiff competition from Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Indian, and other firms.Although doing business in India is still often difficult, most large US companies have expanded significantly to having IT service providers, large operations, or their own India-based capability centres, the report stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-nation-is-more-important-than-india-as-us-seeks-to-counter-china-think-tank-101618291338223.html
13-04-2021||World||Minneapolis under curfew after officer shoots Black motorist dead||Fresh protests broke out Tuesday night in Minneapolis despite a curfew implemented after a police officer fatally shot a young Black man when she appeared to confuse her handgun with her taser, fueling tensions in a US city already on edge because of the George Floyd murder trial.Shortly before 9:00 pm local time (0200GMT Tuesday), nearly two hours after the curfew went into effect, dozens of protesters continued to wave signs and chant slogans in front of the police station in Brooklyn Center, where Sunday's killing occurred.Demonstrators taunted police through newly-erected wire fencing around the station, and carried signs saying "Jail all racist killer cops," "Am I next?" and "No justice, no peace."Police fired tear gas at the protesters several times and ordered them to disperse.This was the second consecutive night of protests after 20-year-old Daunte Wright was shot dead by police while driving with his girlfriend.In police body camera video released earlier Monday in Brooklyn Center, an officer shouts "Taser! Taser! Taser!" but then instead fires a gun at the victim."The officer drew their handgun instead of their taser," said Brooklyn Center police chief Tim Gannon.Gannon said it was his belief that the officer, now on leave pending an investigation, "had the intention to deploy their taser but instead shot Mr Wright with a single bullet.""This was an accidental discharge that resulted in the tragic death of Mr Wright," Gannon said. "There is nothing I can say to lessen the pain of Mr Wright's family."Wright's killing sparked protests overnight in Brooklyn Center and the looting of a shopping mall, and authorities in Minneapolis and surrounding suburbs including Brooklyn Center announced a curfew from 7:00 pm (0000 GMT) Monday until 6:00 am Tuesday.In the body cam footage, police officers are seen pulling Wright out of his car after stopping him for a traffic violation and discovering he had an outstanding warrant.When officers attempt to handcuff Wright, he scuffles with them and gets back in the car. A female police officer shouts, "I'll tase you" and then "Taser! Taser! Taser!" -- standard police procedure before an officer fires one of the stun guns."Holy shit, I shot him," the officer says as Wright, fatally wounded, drives off. He crashed his car a few blocks away.How the officer mistook her gun for a taser was unclear.Gannon said police are trained to place handguns "on our dominant side, and our taser on our weak side."Minnesota's Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) identified the officer late Monday as Kim Potter, a 26-year veteran of the police force.President Joe Biden called the killing "tragic," but warned against any potential violent unrest."I think we have to wait and see what the investigation shows," Biden said."In the meantime, I want to make it clear again: there is absolutely no justification, none, for looting," he added. "Peaceful protests -- understandable."The protests overnight prompted the defense attorney for former officer Derek Chauvin, who is facing murder and manslaughter charges for George Floyd's death, to ask the judge presiding over the high-profile case to sequester the jury.Judge Peter Cahill refused, stating "this is a totally different case."'Tragic events'Chauvin is facing murder and manslaughter charges for his role in Floyd's death on May 25, 2020, which occurred during his arrest for allegedly passing a fake $20 bill.The 45-year-old Chauvin, who is white, was seen in a video taken by a bystander kneeling on Floyd's neck for more than nine minutes as the handcuffed 46-year-old Black man complained repeatedly that he could not breathe.The video touched off protests against racial injustice and police brutality in the United States and around the world.Brooklyn Center, where Wright was shot, is a northwest suburb of Minneapolis located not far from the heavily guarded Hennepin County Government Center where Chauvin is on trial.Officers fired tear gas and flash bangs to disperse a crowd of hundreds who gathered outside a police station in Brooklyn Center after Wright was shot. National Guard troops were deployed."We are in pain right now, and we recognize that this couldn't have happened at a worse time," Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said.The Minnesota Twins announced they were postponing their Monday baseball game against the Boston Red Sox "out of respect for the tragic events that occurred yesterday in Brooklyn Center."The US professional basketball and hockey leagues also postponed Monday games involving Minnesota teams.Prosecutors are seeking to prove Floyd's death was due to asphyxiation by the officers conducting the arrest and have called several medical experts to bolster their case.Chauvin's attorney claims Floyd's death was due to his consumption of the illegal drugs fentanyl and methamphetamine and underlying health conditions.Prominent cardiologist Jonathan Rich testified Monday that Floyd's death was caused by "low oxygen levels" that were "induced by the prone restraint and positional asphyxiation that he was subjected to.""I see no evidence at all that a fentanyl overdose caused Mr Floyd's death," Rich said.Ex-police officer and law professor Seth Stoughton also testified that he found the force used against Floyd to be "excessive" and "unreasonable."Floyd's brother, Philonise Floyd, 39, also took the witness stand and emotionally recounted stories from their childhood.Judge Cahill told jurors he expected Chauvin's defense to begin its presentation Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-under-curfew-after-officer-shoots-black-motorist-dead-101618288493407.html
13-04-2021||World||Natanz nuclear plant attack complicates US, Iran nuke talks||The attack on Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility is casting a major shadow over the resumption of indirect talks between the U.S. and Iran over resurrection of the international accord limiting Iran's nuclear program.Neither Iran nor the U.S. say the incident will crater the negotiations. But the attack and the destruction of a significant amount of Iran’s uranium enrichment capability add uncertainty to the discussions set for Tuesday in Vienna.The attack gives both sides reason to harden their positions, yet each has incentives to keep the talks on track.Iran wants Washington to lift sanctions that have contributed to damaging its economy, including measures not related to its nuclear program. It insists that the sanctions be lifted before it returns to compliance with the 2015 nuclear agreement that then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. out of in 2018.For the Biden administration, the talks are a high-stakes gamble that it can salvage what the Obama administration considered one of its prime foreign policy achievements and slow Iran's programs, even as critics claim the accord had given Iran a pathway to a nuclear weapon instead of closing it off.Iran has blamed Israel for the destruction at an important underground facility, and Israeli media has been filled with claims from unnamed officials claiming responsibility.The Biden administration, meanwhile, has taken a hand’s-off approach, neither praising nor condemning the attack. The White House said the U.S. “had no involvement” and had “nothing to add to speculation about the causes.”The attack adds a fresh complication to discussions in Vienna and also to President Joe Biden's efforts to smooth ties with Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu enjoyed a close relationship with Trump, who abandoned the Iran agreement and began a campaign of “maximum pressure” on Iran by imposing harsh sanctions.The U.S. has said it is prepared to lift or ease sanctions that are “inconsistent” with the nuclear deal along with sanctions that are “inconsistent with the benefits” that Iran expected to get from agreeing to the accord. The deal had removed nuclear sanctions on Iran in exchange for curbs on its atomic program, although critics noted that many of those restrictions are time-limited and will expire before 2030.Those same critics, including many in Congress, have expressed concerns that non-nuclear sanctions — such as those imposed for terrorism, ballistic missile activity and human rights abuses — may be on the table in the negotiations. The administration has not specifically commented on that but has said it will not offer Iran sweeteners unrelated to the agreement.Israeli officials have raised concerns, too, about what they fear would be a precipitous U.S. return to the deal, and news of the attack broke as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was visiting Israel. Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken will be in Brussels later this week for talks with European and NATO allies likely to touch on Iran.As Austin and Blinken prepared to meet their counterparts in Brussels, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas expressed concern that the attack could affect the talks. “All of what we are hearing from Tehran is not a positive contribution to this,” Maas told reporters.The destruction of advanced centrifuges at Natanz came at a critical time in the Vienna talks that are intended to resurrect the nuclear deal. Trump's withdrawal and his reintroduction of sanctions, along with Iran's decisions to break its own commitments to the agreement, have left it in significant jeopardy.The weekend attack on Natanz, one of Iran's main nuclear facilities, came amid a break in the Vienna talks.Key to the deal were restrictions on Iran's uranium enrichment. Activities at the heavily fortified Natanz facility, which is built into a mountain, were among those most constrained.Natanz has been targeted by sabotage in the past. The Stuxnet computer virus, discovered in 2010 and widely believed to be a joint U.S.-Israeli creation, once disrupted and destroyed Iranian centrifuges there during an earlier period of Western fears about Tehran’s program.Last July, Natanz suffered a mysterious explosion at its advanced centrifuge assembly plant that authorities later described as sabotage. Iran now is rebuilding that facility deep inside a nearby mountain. Iran also blamed Israel for that, as well as the November killing of a scientist who began the country’s military nuclear program decades ago.Israel also has launched a series of airstrikes in neighboring Syria targeting Iranian forces and their equipment. And Israel is suspected in an attack last week on an Iranian cargo ship that is said to serve as a floating base for Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard forces off the coast of Yemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/natanz-nuclear-plant-attack-complicates-us-iran-nuke-talks-101618288476491.html

Gagarin's spacecraft was launched on April 12, 1961 and it reached back on earth on May 3, 1961.The 108-minute-long journey set a major milestone in the Space race between the USA and the Soviet Union. Gagarin was 27 years old when he achieved the feat. Two days before blastoff, he even wrote a farewell letter to his wife, sharing his pride in being chosen to ride in Vostok 1 but also trying to console her in the event of his death, news agency AP reported.“I fully trust the equipment, it mustn’t let me down. But if something happens, I ask you Valyusha not to become broken by grief,” he wrote.Six decades after the landmark achievement, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday said the country should remain a great power in space. "In the 21st century, Russia must retain its status as a nuclear and space power," Putin said in televised remarks.The day of Gagarin's flight is celebrated every year in Russia as Cosmonautics Day.(with agency inputs)﻿||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/60-years-since-first-human-spaceflight-101618280577785.html

Officials said that the building had violated safety requirements by housing too many people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/massive-fire-at-ruusia-s-historic-saint-petersburg-factory-still-burning-101618280495884.html

The researchers found no difference in risks of severe disease, death, or other clinical outcomes in patients with B.1.1.7 and other variants."Our data, within the context and limitations of a real-world study, provide initial reassurance that severity in hospitalised patients with B.1.1.7 is not markedly different from severity in those without," the researchers said in the study.A separate study published in The Lancet Public Health medical journal found that vaccines were likely to be effective against the British variant since there was no apparent increase in reinfection rate when compared to non-UK variants.According to British scientists, the British variant was about 40%-70% more transmissible than previously dominant variants.The studies also confirmed the previous findings that B.1.1.7 was more transmissible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-variant-of-covid-19-not-as-severe-as-feared-study-101618279922909.html
13-04-2021||World||Washington state proposal targets Boeing plant’s pollution||Boeing will spend millions of dollars and decades cleaning up pollutants that have seeped into the soil and groundwater beneath one of their plants in Washington state, a state-mandated draft proposal said.TCE, or Trichloroethylene, is one of many pollutants that have been found in groundwater near Boeing's Everett, Washington, plant, the Daily Herald reported Sunday.TCE is a solvent that is used to degrease metal parts and is a carcinogen to humans. The US Environmental Protection Agency said in 2016 that TCE can also affect fetus development, irritate the respiratory system and cause light-headedness, drowsiness and headaches.The National Cancer Institute considers TCE a “cancer-causing substance.”Last year, the solvent was detected in groundwater near the plant at a concentration more than 1,000 times the state limit.“Boeing is in the final stages of environmental cleanup at our Everett site, under a draft set of studies, plans and orders and other documents available for public comment from the Washington Department of Ecology,” the company said in a written statement. “We are committed to a comprehensive cleanup of the Powder Mill Gulch area of Everett and have made considerable progress in reducing groundwater contamination through a variety of interim action cleanup activities."The full cost of the cleanup is not publicly known. Boeing declined to say what the cleanup is expected to cost.Several other contaminants have been discovered at the roughly 1,000-acre (405 hectares) Boeing site. The contaminants include fuels such as oil, gasoline, lead, hydraulic jet fluid, polychlorinated biphenyls and carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.The chemicals came from a range of manufacturing operations, according to the cleanup documents.Boeing “no longer uses TCE as a widespread cleaning solvent as it did in the past,” the department said. Small quantities of the chemical are still used in one of its labs, according to the Washington State Department of Ecology.The most expensive and time-consuming part of the Everett cleanup plan involves a process known as bioremediation, in which Boeing will inject nutrients into the soil to help natural bacteria break down TCE. Boeing would invest heavily in improvements to an existing system that pumps out contaminated groundwater, treats it then releases it, according to the proposal.The state-mandated draft proposal is 163 pages and will open for public comment on April 19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-state-proposal-targets-boeing-plant-s-pollution-101618278956990.html
13-04-2021||World||Ireland to limit AstraZeneca jab to over-60s||Ireland will limit the AstraZeneca coronavirus jab to those aged over 60, the country's chief medical officer said Monday, following European reviews of evidence linking it to rare blood clotting cases.The decision follows similar moves by several other European nations that have halted use of the vaccine among younger people following the EU medicines regulator's ruling this month that it could be linked to the rare clots.Ireland's National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) said the AstraZeneca product "is not recommended for those aged under 60 years".The updated recommendations would be incorporated into the vaccination programme and vaccine re-allocated, chief medical officer Ronan Glynn said.Ireland, which has a population of around five million, has so far given nearly 750,000 people a first Covid-19 vaccine dose, according to the latest available statistics.Along with other EU countries, it has struggled to match the speed of neighbouring Britain's successful rollout, which has relied heavily on the AstraZeneca jab.UK regulators have only limited its use in the under-30s.NIAC chair Karina Butler noted that the shot, which was developed in partnership with Britain's Oxford University, was "highly effective and substantially reduces the risk of severe Covid-19 disease across all age groups".But the committee had opted to change its advice in light of the reviews."NIAC realises the need to balance the significant benefits of a national vaccination programme with the very rare risk of these reported events," she said in a statement."While this is an extremely rare condition, consideration must be given to the fact that it has a very high risk of death or severe outcome."As the risk/benefits of Vaxzevria Covid-19 AstraZeneca vaccine may vary by age, and as alternative Covid-19 vaccines are available, NIAC has revised the recommendations for use of this vaccine," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ireland-to-limit-astrazeneca-jab-to-over60s-101618279717816.html

That means more than 32 million people have been given the precious protection vaccines provide against Covid-19.""I want to thank everyone involved in the vaccine rollout which has already saved many thousands of lives. We will now move forward with completing essential second doses and making progress towards our target of offering all adults a vaccine by the end of July," he added.According to the UK Government, all adults over 50, the clinically vulnerable and health and social care workers have now been offered coronavirus vaccine shots."The target was reached ahead of schedule, with the government having pledged to offer a first dose to priority cohorts 1-9 by 15 April," Downing Street said, adding that "nearly 40 million vaccines have now been given in total, with adults under 50 expected to begin to be invited in the coming days."Those in their late 40s are expected to be next in line to be invited for coronavirus vaccine shots as the UK moves into the next phase of its mass vaccination campaign, according to Sputnik."Over 7 million second doses have now been given - with a record 475,230 given on Saturday - and we remain on track to offer a first vaccine to all adults by 31 July," Downing Street said.The mass vaccination campaign started in the UK in December of last year.The UK has now confirmed a total of over 4.3 million coronavirus cases and the country's Covid-19 death toll stands at more than 127,000, according to Johns Hopkins University, as reported by Sputnik.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-completes-covid-19-vaccination-target-of-people-over-50-ahead-of-schedule-101618275547105.html

Going against the medical consensus around Covid, Bolsonaro has downplayed the severity of the virus, opposed lockdowns and only recently embraced vaccines as a solution.Last week, a Supreme Court justice cleared the way for the Senate inquiry, which the Senate president had sought to delay despite it having garnered support from the necessary number of senators.The Supreme Court is expected to uphold the ruling when the full court hears the case later this week, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters on Monday, although it may grant the chamber leeway to decide when to install the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-records-1-480-more-deaths-due-to-covid-as-probe-pressures-prez-bolsonaro-101618272044793.html
13-04-2021||World||CDC chief urges Michigan to 'close things down' amid spike in Covid cases||The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Monday that Michigan should “close things down” to help address the country's worst coronavirus outbreak, days after Gov. Gretchen Whitmer instead urged people to voluntarily restrict certain activities.Dr. Rochelle Walensky made the statement after being asked about some public health experts' calls to send additional doses of Covid-19 vaccine to the state, for which the governor has been advocating. The administration of President Joe Biden has stuck with allocating to states proportionally by population.“So when you have an acute situation, extraordinary number of cases like we have in Michigan, the answer is not necessarily to give vaccine,” Walensky said, explaining that it takes two to six weeks to see the effect of vaccinations. “The answer to that is to really close things down, to go back to our basics, to back to where we were last spring, last summer and to shut things down, to flatten the curve, to decrease contact with one another, to test ... to contact trace.”Michigan hospitals on Monday reported treating about 3,900 adults with confirmed Covid-19 cases, which surpassed a previous peak from Dec. 1 and was close to the state's record high from last April of roughly 4,000. The seven-day average of daily new cases was 7,359 as of Saturday, up from 4,661 two weeks prior, according to Johns Hopkins University. The seven-day average of daily deaths, 43, more than doubled from 20 in the same period.Earlier Monday, Whitmer again said Michigan's third surge is different because of vaccines and, unlike a year ago, it is known that masks are effective and the state has adequate testing and personal protective equipment. She has urged — but not required — a two-week suspension of in-person high school instruction, youth sports and indoor dining.“We each have enough information to do our part,” she said after touring a vaccination clinic at Eastern Michigan University. “That's what we're calling on people to do — to do your part."About 40% of Michigan residents ages 16 and up had received at least one shot as of last week.The Democratic governor last spring issued a monthslong stay-at-home order to curb the virus, later lifting it. Republican lawmakers successfully challenged the law that underpinned her restrictions. In the fall, amid a second wave of cases, the state health department took steps such as closing high schools, prohibiting contact sports, and banning indoor service at restaurants and bars. The restrictions were gradually loosened as metrics improved.Whitmer spokesman Bobby Leddy said Michigan has implemented CDC standards and still has some of the strongest restrictions in the Midwest, including a mask mandate and capacity limits on indoor dining, indoor gatherings and entertainment venues.“As our nation’s top health experts have said, this is not a failure of policy, but rather a compliance, variant and mobility issue, which is why it’s important for us to ramp up vaccinations as quickly as possible,” he said.In Michigan, one in every 194 people was diagnosed with Covid-19 in the past week — the highest rate in the US. The state's case rates have been rising since mid-February and hospitalizations have been increasing since early March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cdc-chief-urges-michigan-to-close-things-down-amid-spike-in-covid-cases-101618271541039.html
13-04-2021||World||US police officer fired for pepper-spraying Black soldier||A US police officer has been fired after footage emerged of a Black army officer being detained at gunpoint and pepper-sprayed in the face in Virginia, prompting the state's governor Sunday to promise a full investigation.Lieutenant Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino, repeatedly asked what he had done wrong and said, "This is really messed up," as two police officers holding guns demanded he get out of his car.Wearing his military uniform, Nazario was driving a newly bought SUV in the small Virginia town of Windsor last December when the officers ordered him to pull over because he did not have permanent license plates, news reports said.The police accused him of not cooperating before blasting him with pepper-spray and forcing him to the ground.Virginia governor Ralph Northam said in a statement he had instructed police to conduct an "independent investigation" into the incident, which he said was "disturbing and angered me."A separate statement from Windsor authorities on Sunday said that one of the officers involved had been fired after an internal investigation showed that police procedure was "not followed" during the incident.The Washington Post said that Nazario, a health administration officer with the Virginia National Guard, was driving home on December 5 when he was pulled over.Footage from the officers' bodycams and Nazario's phone spread rapidly over the weekend after Nazario filed a lawsuit on April 2 seeking $1 million in damages.He was released without charge after the incident.The lawsuit reportedly claims police threatened to end his military career if he spoke out about the officers' conduct."We must keep working to ensure Virginians are safe during interactions with police, the enforcement of laws is fair and equitable, and people are held accountable," Northam said.Police in the United States have been hit with multiple allegations of racism and misconduct, including over the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year in a case that attracted international outrage.A police officer is currently on trial over the 46-year-old Black man's death, facing charges of manslaughter and murder.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-police-officer-fired-for-pepper-spraying-black-soldier-101618271456685.html

No, no, this is a voting rights question.”The ADL argued in a reply sent Monday to Murdoch that Carlson used white-supremacist language even if he claimed he didn't.“Mr. Carlson’s attempt to at first dismiss this theory, while in the very next breath endorsing it under cover of ‘a voting rights question,’ does not give him free license to invoke a white supremacist trope,” wrote ADL CEO Jonathan Greenblatt.The replacement conspiracy theory holds that people of color are replacing white people in the West, enabled by Jews and progressive politicians.During a guest appearance Thursday on “Fox News Primetime," Carlson “embraced a foundational theory of white supremacy," the ADL said.During the show, Carlson said “the left and all the little gatekeepers on Twitter become literally hysterical if you use the term ‘replacement,’ if you suggest that the Democratic Party is trying to replace the current electorate of voters now casting ballots with new people, more obedient voters from the Third World." He added that he had “less political power because they are importing a brand new electorate.”The ADL also listed numerous instances Carlson has used anti-immigrant language in the past, including blaming immigration for making the U.S. “poorer, and dirtier, and more divided," and questioned whether white supremacy was real.Murdoch noted in his letter that the ADL had once honored his father, Rupert Murdoch, with a leadership award. The ADL's Greenblatt replied that the award was granted “over a decade ago, but let me be clear that we would not do so today, and it does not absolve you, him, the network, or its board from the moral failure of not taking action against Mr. Carlson.”A Fox spokesperson declined to comment on the ADL's Monday letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fox-stands-behind-tucker-carlson-after-adl-urges-his-firing-101618265964493.html

Mexico said on March 22 that it had close to 9,000 troops from the defense ministry, Navy and National Guard on its northern and southern borders.A Mexican National Guard member deployed to the area said the force's daily arrest rate had doubled in recent weeks.In January, just before U.S. President Joe Biden took office, Guatemala deployed security forces to halt a U.S.-bound caravan of migrants, and Guatemalan government officials have vowed to keep up the pressure. Honduras also deployed forces in response to a small U.S.-bound migrant caravan over Easter.Earlier, White House aide Tyler Moran said the Biden administration secured agreements with Mexico, Honduras and Guatemala to put more troops on their own borders.Moran appeared to have been referring to the March deployments.Mexico's government said in a statement that it would maintain current troop numbers at its borders.The Guatemalan presidency said security efforts at the border were implemented last year. When asked about Guatemala reaching an agreement with Washington on troop deployment, a spokesperson said, "there is no deal signed in this sense."Honduran defense minister Fredy Santiago Diaz said his government was weighing its options on border troop numbers.Deploying more troops was not discussed by a recent delegation to Washington, but Honduras would take U.S. requests to curb migration into account if it did, he told local radio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-doubles-migrant-detentions-with-troop-surge-white-house-says-101618266003421.html
13-04-2021||World||Harvey Weinstein, facing California charges, asks delay in travel||Harvey Weinstein’s next courtroom battle is getting closer.A lawyer for the former Hollywood mogul told a judge Monday that Weinstein was indicted in Los Angeles, where he faces charges of forcible rape and other crimes stemming from alleged assaults of five women. He’s now serving a 23-year term in New York after being convicted of sexual assault by a Manhattan jury last year.Weinstein was first charged by Los Angeles prosecutors in 2020, and now the indictment by a state grand jury there marks the technical start of that case and means Weinstein may soon extradited to mount his defense. Appearing at a virtual hearing from Wende Correctional Facility in upstate New York, defense lawyer Norman Effman told a judge that his client would seek to delay that case so he can first get medical treatment for diabetes and other conditions.Weinstein appeared slimmer than he was at his Manhattan trial and smiled frequently during the hearing. He told his Los Angeles attorney, Mark Werksman, that he liked his comment dismissing the California case as “stale” in a weekend news story. The indictment remains under seal.“I really, really appreciated that statement,” Weinstein told Werksman just before the hearing began. “That was awesome.”Weinstein’s next extradition hearing is set for April 30. A spokesman for the Los Angeles County District Attorney’s Office declined to comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harvey-weinstein-facing-california-charges-asks-delay-in-travel-101618261890273.html
13-04-2021||World||US budget deficit jumps to record $1.7 trillion this year||The US government's budget deficit surged to an all-time high of $1.7 trillion for the first six months of this budget year, nearly double the previous record, as another round of economic-support checks added billions of dollars to spending last month.In its monthly budget report, the Treasury Department said Monday that the deficit for the first half of the budget year — from October through March — was up from a shortfall of $743.5 billion in the same period a year ago.The deficit has been driven higher by trillions of dollars in support Congress has passed in successive economic rescue packages since the pandemic struck in early March 2020. The latest round came in a $1.9 trillion measure that President Joe Biden pushed through Congress last month.Biden's package included individual support payments of up to $1,400 and the administration rushed to make those payments as soon as the president signed the measure into law. The Treasury Department statement showed that the payments in March totaled $339 billion.The budget report showed that the deficit for just March totaled $659.6 billion, the third-highest monthly deficit. For the six-month period, the $1.7 trillion deficit total surpassed the previous record of an $829 billion deficit run up for the six months ending in March 2011. That was a period when the government was spending to deal with the economic damage from the recession caused by the 2008 financial crisis.Last year's deficit, for the budget year that ended Sept. 30, totaled a record $3.1 trillion. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in February that this fiscal year's deficit would total $2.3 trillion. But that estimate did not include the cost of Biden's $1.9 trillion rescue plan that Congress passed in March or the impact of the administration's “Build Back Better” infrastructure proposal that Congress is considering now.Nancy Vanden Houten, senior economist at Oxford Economics, said she expects the deficit for this budget year will total $3.3 trillion, an all-time high but up just 6.5% from last year's record shortfall of $3.1 trillion.Analysts said the deficit's surge in the first six months of the fiscal year reflected that the first half of the 2020 budget year was mostly unaffected by the pandemic. The loss of revenue from millions of job lost and the big spending measures Congress passed to deal with the pandemic-triggered recession occurred in the second half of the 2020 budget year.Vanden Houten said that, while she expects Congress will pass some version of Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure bill, the budget impact will not occur until the start of the next fiscal year.For the first six months of the current budget year, Treasury said revenues totaled $1.7 trillion, a drop of 5.5% from the same period last year. Spending was $3.4 trillion, up 45.3%.Biden's rescue program passed without Republican support, unlike the previous packages passed during the Trump administration, which were backed by both Republican and Democratic lawmakers.Republicans contend that new spending is not needed in light of rising deficits and increased signs that the economy is starting to rebound.The Treasury report Monday showed that through the first six months of the current budget year, interest payments on the debt total $229 billion, $41 billion below the same period a year ago. That reflects lower interest rates on the rising level of debt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-budget-deficit-jumps-to-record-1-7-trillion-this-year-101618261927288.html
13-04-2021||World||Regeneron to seek US approval for Covid-19 cocktail to be used for prevention||Regeneron is pursuing U.S. approval for its Covid-19 monoclonal antibody cocktail as a preventative treatment after it helped cut the risk of symptomatic infections in households where someone else is ill, the U.S. drugmaker said on Monday.REGEN-COV, a combination of casirivimab and imdevimab, protected household contacts from exposure to SARS-CoV-2, with 72% protection against symptomatic infections in the first week, and 93% after that, according to trial data released by the company.In a separate trial, Regeneron also said the treatment reduced overall risk of progressing to symptomatic Covid-19 by 31%, and by 76% after the third day.Regeneron has enlisted Switzerland's Roche and its massive biotech facility in South San Francisco to make around 2 million doses annually. The cocktail already has emergency U.S. approval for mild to moderate Covid-19 patients, and the companies are hoping the latest trials convince regulators to expand deployment."These data suggest that REGEN-COV can complement widespread vaccination strategies, particularly for those at high risk of infection," said Myron Cohen, who leads monoclonal antibody efforts for the U.S. National Institutes of Health-sponsored Covid Prevention Network.A challenge in breaking infection chains, he said, is that some 10% of unvaccinated people in the study who didn't get the Roche-Regeneron drug while living in a household with an infected individual developed symptomatic infection even with efforts to reduce transmission.'HIGH-RISK SETTINGS'"REGEN-COV could help control outbreaks in high-risk settings" where people haven't been vaccinated, Cohen said.In the separate trial, Regeneron said the cocktail also cut symptomatic infection risk and helped nearly halve the total weeks that patients experienced symptoms, with the viral burden -- the amount of virus present -- cut by more than 90%."These data pave the way for REGEN-COV to be used before patients become symptomatic," Katharine Bar, co-principal investigator and a professor at the University of Pennsylvania hospital, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/regeneron-to-seek-us-approval-for-covid-19-cocktail-to-be-used-for-prevention-101618257437058.html
13-04-2021||World||1 killed, police officer injured in school shooting at Knoxville, Tennessee||One person was killed at a Knoxville, Tennessee, high school on Monday and a police officer was wounded when police confronted an armed suspect.The incident, which unfolded at about 3:15 p.m. local time at Austin-East Magnet School on the east side of Knoxville, marked the latest in a rash of shootings across the United States since mid-March.Knoxville police said the officer struck by gunfire was expected to survive."He is conscious and in good spirits. ... He's going to be OK. I thanked him for putting his life on the line to protect students and staff at the school. He said he'd rather be hurt than anybody else," Mayor Indya Kincannon told CBS News.Investigators did not identify the suspect or slain victim except to say they were both male. It was not yet clear if either was a student at Austin-East Magnet School."Knoxville Police Department officers responded to Austin-East Magnet High School on the report of a male subject who was possibly armed in the school," department officials said on Facebook."Upon approach of the subject, shots were fired. A KPD officer was struck at least one time and transported to the (University of Tennessee) Medical Center with injuries that are not expected to be life-threatening. One male was pronounced deceased at the scene, while another was detained for further investigation."Police had initially reported "multiple gunshot victims" in the attack.PARENTS RUSH TO SCENE"The school building has been secured and students who were not involved in the incident have been released to their families," Knoxville schools superintendent Bob Thomas said on Twitter.Agents from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives would assist other law enforcement agencies, the bureau's Nashville office said on Twitter.Police established a reunification site for families of the students at the baseball field behind the school.A mother who had been separated from her daughter was waiting near the school and was relieved to receive a text message from the girl that she was safe.The Knoxville high school community has been ravaged by gun violence in the last few months, with at least three students at Austin-East having been killed this year.The school, which had opened its classrooms after pandemic lockdowns, switched to remote learning for a few days in February so that students could grieve the deaths of two 15 year olds and one 16 year old, WBIR-TV News reported.In other shootings across the United States since mid-March, a man last week opened fire at the Texas cabinet-making plant where he worked, killing one person and wounding six others before he was arrested.Eight people were slain at Atlanta-area spas, 10 people at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, and four people, including a 9-year-old boy, at a real estate office in the Southern California city of Orange.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-report-multiple-victims-in-tennessee-school-shooting-101618259251843.html
13-04-2021||World||Covid-19: The future is here||The future is already here, it is just not very evenly distributed. These memorable words, by William Gibson, come to mind as I think about the course of the pandemic and consider what lies ahead. A variety of scenarios has unfolded around the world, the differences attributable to a combination of agency, constraints, and sometimes luck. However, the patterns have been predictable for a while.In any susceptible population that is not making strong efforts to reduce transmission, SARS-CoV2 will rapidly transmit with exponential growth until a combination of recovered people with immunity and heightened precautions slow the spread. This sequence of rapid rise, peak, and fall happens over about six to eight weeks in a city, during which health care systems get stressed and preventable deaths mount.The wave is broader for a large state or a country, being composed of smaller narrower waves occurring after each other, but is again predictable. This is what was seen all over the world during the first wave. India had the privilege of seeing this course of events in other nations and prepare, which limited our losses.It was equally clear from the rest of the world, especially the United Kingdom (UK) and Brazil, that the first wave was not the last. Immunity declines, the virus mutates to escape the immune pressure, and precautions melt away — setting the stage for new waves of explosive growth in freshly susceptible populations that are making only token efforts to reduce transmission. Recovered people show 20-30% decline in their virus neutralising immunity by six months, based on data from the CSIR serosurvey, now published in eLife.Also Read | Why is India seeing Covid-19 second wave? AIIMS chief Randeep Guleria explainsMutations of the virus make it able to evade what little immunity remains. The INSACOG sequencing consortium data clearly shows that not only have we seen explosive growth of imported variants, such as the B.1.1.7 UK variant, in Punjab, but have also had emergence of local variants such as B.1.617 in Maharashtra. The latter, with 15 lineage defining mutations, and two immune escape mutations — E484Q and L452R amino acid changes in the spike protein at sites important for antibody neutralisation and virus entry into cell — is worrisome.At a molecular level, these mutations make the virus more transmissible and able to evade immunity, potentially causing larger outbreaks and reinfections. Unlike B.1.1.7, where there is adequate vaccine data from UK to be confident that vaccination will prevent severe disease, we are yet to fully learn about the properties of B.1.617. Due to INSACOG efforts, I expect these answers to be available soon.Meanwhile, it does not seem that there is any significant increase in severity, although we have seen many more young infections this time. This may simply be because the outbreaks were in schools and colleges, unlike the first wave. The necessary public health measures remain exactly the same and the mask as vaccine concept stays important. This needs to be implemented more seriously and in a sensible manner. To be fined for not wearing a mask alone in one’s car, while masks are absent in crowded markets, makes little sense.Finally, we need to overcome vaccine hesitancy, with a clear understanding that infections will occur even after vaccination. They will just be fewer, milder and transmit less. The total lives lost to Covid-19 will drop drastically, if we combine basic precautions with vaccination.From a scientific standpoint, I see the glass as half-full. The identification of the indigenous variant has occurred in a timely manner, based on molecular filters, with correlation between the increase in variant and the rise in cases. There remains much room to improve the ecosystem, such that genomic findings are better integrated with clinical actionability. My institute’s direct experience working with the Kerala government suggests that this is very much possible when all stakeholders come together.Also Read | Sanjay Raut blames Centre for rising cases in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, PunjabOne question that I get asked often is whether India is sequencing enough. My half-answer is that it depends on what we plan to do with the data. At a basic level, we sequence to stay abreast of the changes to the virus, so as to predict implications on vaccine efficacy and the expected trajectory of the pandemic. Some mutations, such as the E484K in South Africa (B.1.351) and Brazil (P1) variants, make the virus capable of escaping vaccine induced antibodies. In Bangladesh, B.1.351 has reached 80% of samples tested.As of March 2021, we have also seen a progressive increase of immune escape variants in Indian samples, including indigenous E484K mutants, but at a lower fraction. This is akin to seeing the future through events unfolding in our geographical vicinity, in a population similar to ours. Similarly, the outbreaks and rise of B.1.1.7 in Punjab, will surely be paralleled in neighbouring states in the natural course of events. The same story is currently being repeated in multiple parts of the globe. Our ongoing sequencing efforts have thus already provided warning signals for urgent public health preparedness and mobilisation.I now look forward to the next stage of this effort with faster and more comprehensive sequencing, combined with better clinical correlation, viral research, and timely public health action. The hope is not to just see the future, but to shape it.Anurag Agrawal is director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (Council of Scientific and Industrial Research)The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-the-future-is-here-101618229197360.html
