India had the honour of receiving him and HM The Queen on four memorable occasions,” the Indian High Commission in London said in a statement.During his 1961 visit to India, he was pictured with the Queen and the Maharaja and Maharani of Jaipur with a dead eight-foot tiger he had shot while on a hunt. It happened to be the same year he became president of the World Wildlife Fund UK.He also shot a crocodile and mountain sheep on that trip but it was the photograph of the tiger that caused ripples around the world.Later in life, he went on to reinvent himself as an environmentalist and “champion of the natural world” as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson referred to him in his tribute on Friday.During Prince Philip's last visit to India to mark the 50th anniversary of independence in 1997, he joined the Queen on a visit to Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar where the royals laid a commemorative wreath at the site associated with General Dyer’s orders to open fire on a large Baisakhi gathering in April 1919.As someone known for his gaffes, among his many infamous ones includes his query of the death toll at the Jallianwala Bagh massacre."Two thousand? It wasn't, was it," he questioned, as he passed by a plaque at the memorial, which read “This place is saturated with the blood of about two thousand Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims who were martyred in a non-violent struggle"."That's wrong. I was in the Navy with Dyer's son. That's a bit exaggerated… it must include the wounded," he is reported to have said.Among his other gaffes included a quip at Indian-origin entrepreneur Atul Patel during a Buckingham Palace reception for hundreds of successful British Indians in 2009: “There’s a lot of your family in tonight.”Ten years earlier, while inspecting a factory in Edinburgh and coming across an old-fashioned fuse box, he said: “It looks as if it was put in by an Indian.”It had become common practice for the UK media to regularly compile a list of the Duke’s many gaffes, many of which were believed to have been made in a light-hearted vein.Philip was born on June 10, 1921, on the Greek island of Corfu, the youngest child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. That heritage made him a Prince of Greece and Denmark, but the following year the family was expelled from Greece after a coup and a British warship carried them to safety in Italy with baby Philip.His childhood was turbulent and in 1930, when he was eight years old, his mother was committed to a secure psychiatric centre after suffering a nervous breakdown, a story most recently covered in the Netflix series ‘The Crown’.When Philip left school in Scotland, Britain was on the verge of war with Germany and he joined the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, the UK's naval academy. He went on to serve with distinction in World War II, seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean.When King George VI paid an official visit to the naval academy in July 1939, Philip was charged with entertaining his young daughters, Princesses Elizabeth – later to be Queen – and Margaret. He made an impression on the then 13-year-old Elizabeth and the couple were to later get married after a courtship through letters.The erstwhile Prince of Greece and Denmark became a naturalised British subject, formally joined the Church of England and gave up his foreign titles. On his wedding day, November 20, 1947, he was made Duke of Edinburgh, aged 26.The couple's marriage was to last 73 years, during which the Queen described him as her “strength and stay”, and they had four children – the eldest and heir to the throne Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, and Prince Edward. He is also survived by eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.As the Queen's consort, his primary function was to support his wife and he accompanied her extensively alongside his own royal charities and patronages until his retirement from royal duties in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-s-4-royal-visits-to-india-and-a-tiger-controversy-101617991603677.html

Inoculating children and young people is considered a critical step toward reaching "herd immunity" and taming the pandemic, according to experts.The companies plan to request similar rulings by other regulatory authorities globally in the coming days.The Pfizer/BioNTech two-shot vaccine is already authorized for use in people as young as 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-seek-us-emergency-nod-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-adolescents-101617990105479.html

In February this year, the Egyptian Health and Population Ministry issued a list of potential side-effects from the Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine-pain, redness, stiffness and itching at the area of the vaccination, increase in body temperature and more.Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, which produces Sinopharm, has been accused of supplying 400,520 substandard doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough vaccines for infants in 2018 and also of having forged data related to the production of 113,000 rabies vaccines by the Chinese drug controller, reported Newshub.lk.The World Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation said recently that the vaccine "lacked data in older age groups and in persons with co-morbidities".To make matters worse, one of the volunteers in Peru died after being injected with the Sinopharm vaccine, while one of the volunteers developed severe neurological side-effects associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome that causes nerve damage and often paralysis, during a clinical trial. All trials of the vaccine have been halted since then.Furthermore, Sri Lankan health authorities are also deeply hesitant to use Chinese-made vaccines for immunising its citizens. although the country has received 600,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, it has decided to use them only on Chinese nationals.According to a survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong, about 61 percent of people do not want to take vaccines made by China, reported Newshub.lk.Several countries have been affected due to shortcomings of China's big promises on its vaccine diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/criticism-over-use-of-china-made-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccines-continues-to-grow-101617989700980.html
09-04-2021||World||China, Bhutan hold discussions to resolve border dispute||Senior officials of China and Bhutan have discussed a roadmap to expedite their boundary talks and agreed to continue to maintain peace and tranquillity along their border pending final settlement of their dispute, the foreign ministries of the two countries said on Friday.The two countries do not have diplomatic relations but maintain contacts through periodic visits by officials.China, which is yet to finalise border agreements with India and Bhutan, has resolved the boundary line with 12 other neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the two countries have held 22 rounds of Special Representatives-level talks so far to resolve the boundary dispute. The meeting took place in the backdrop of the military standoff between China and India in eastern Ladakh since May last year.Bhutan shares over 400-km-long border with China and the two countries have held 24 rounds of boundary talks in a bid to resolve the dispute.According to a joint statement issued by China and Bhutan on Friday, the 10th Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on Bhutan-China Boundary was held in the country’s southwest Kunming city from April 6-9.The EGM was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere, and held in-depth and fruitful discussions on the boundary issue in keeping with the close ties of friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and China, said the statement issued by the two foreign ministries after the talks.“The EGM discussed a roadmap to expedite the Bhutan-China Boundary Talks. The two sides agreed to continue to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas pending a final settlement of the boundary issue,” the statement posted on the Bhutan Foreign Ministry website said.The two countries have agreed to hold the 25th Round of Bhutan-China Boundary Talks and the 11th EGM as soon as possible at mutually convenient dates, it said.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also posted the joint statement on its website.In a show of goodwill and friendship, and to support Bhutan’s fight against COVID-19, the Chinese government donated Personal Protective Equipment and medical supplies, it said.The Bhutanese delegation was led by Letho Tobdhen Tangbi, Secretary of the International Boundaries, while the Chinese delegation was led by Hong Liang, Director General of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China.The Boundary Talks between Bhutan and China began in 1984 and both the countries have signed the Guiding Principles on the Settlement of the Boundary Issues in 1988 and the Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the border areas in 1998.These two agreements form the basis of the boundary negotiation between Bhutan and China, the statement said.In July last year, China made a surprising claim on Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhutan at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council by opposing funding to the project.Bhutan lodged a demarche to the Chinese Embassy in India over China’s claim over the sanctuary.The GEF Council has reportedly cleared the funding for the Sakteng sanctuary after Aparna Subramani, the World Bank official representing Bhutan as well as India, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Sri Lanka said Bhutan totally rejected the claim made by China.China sought to defend its claims on Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary, saying the boundary between the two countries is yet to be demarcated and it has proposed a package solution to resolve the border dispute.“China’s position remains consistent and clear. The boundary between China and Bhutan has not been delimited and there has been disputes in the middle, eastern and western sections,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin had told a media briefing here.“So, China advocates a package solution to resolve the dispute,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bhutan-hold-discussions-to-resolve-border-dispute-101617987274048.html
09-04-2021||World||Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali raises delay in vaccine delivery with Jaishankar||Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali on Friday raised the delay in delivery of a million doses of made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. Kathmandu was expecting the million doses of Covishield vaccine contracted from the Serum Institute of India (SII) last month, and the delay in delivery has affected the rollout of the second phase of the neighbouring country’s inoculation drive, Nepali officials have said. In a separate development, Iran too raised the need to expedite the delivery of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin doses that it has already paid for. The issue figured in a set of tweets from the Iranian embassy. India’s decision to calibrate vaccine exports to cope with a surge in domestic infections and the expansion of its national inoculation programme has affected several countries, including Nepal, the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Nepal signed an agreement with SII for two million doses, half of which were supplied and used for the first phase of the national inoculation drive. The delay in delivering the second million doses has left people waiting for more than six weeks for a second jab, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. According to a readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry, Gyawali requested Jaishankar “for necessary facilitation for the supply of vaccines for Nepal to continue administering the second dose of vaccination for people at highest risk”. Gyawali also expressed sincere thanks to the Indian government for supporting Nepal in its fight against the pandemic, including through the gift of one million doses of Covishield. Jaishankar assured Gyawali of “continued support to Nepal in its fight against the pandemic, including through the supply of vaccines”, the readout said. There was no official word on the conversation from the Indian side. The people cited above said the second consignment of one million doses is needed to provide the second jab to frontline workers and senior citizens above the age of 65. The Nepalese side had earlier taken up the matter with SII and the external affairs ministry and sought speedy delivery. Nepal has already made 80% of the payment for the doses and the remaining amount will be paid when the consignment moves out of SII’s facilities in Pune, the people said. The Iranian embassy said in a tweet on purchase of vaccines from India that Tehran had conveyed its needs to the Indian government and Bharat Biotech. Following this, Iran had received the first consignment of 125,000 doses. “Given the cordial relations with #India and understanding the rise of new wave of #coronavirus in both countries, we are doing the necessary talks with Indian authorities to kindly expedite sending rest of the consignment which has already been paid for,” the embassy said in another tweet. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday that there was no ban on vaccine exports. “We have always said supply of made-in-India vaccines abroad would continue, taking into account our domestic requirements,” he told a news briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-foreign-minister-pradeep-gyawali-raises-delay-in-vaccine-delivery-with-jaishankar-101617989054812.html
09-04-2021||World||Biden's budget boosts US spending on climate action, health | 7 takeaways||Here are seven takeaways from U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed federal budget, released on Friday:* HEADLINE NUMBERS. Federal discretionary spending is up by 8.4% compared to 2021 levels, excluding emergency funding, to $1.52 trillion, with a focus on health, education and climate. About two-thirds of the massive budget is "mandatory" spending for benefits like Social Security and Medicare.* MILITARY AND DEFENSE SPENDING. Making up about half of the U.S. discretionary budget, this would increase by 1.7% to $753 billion. The increase will likely upset progressives, who pushed for cuts to the never-audited Defense Department to fuel other policy priorities. Because it is lower than former President Donald Trump's 2022 projections, it may also anger Republican defense hawks pushing for more spending.* HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH. The budget includes $8.7 billion in funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, representing what the White House says is the largest increase in two decades. The CDC has suffered from a decade of declining funding, and the agency's muddled response to the coronavirus pandemic may have contributed to the spread of the disease, Reuters reported. The budget also allocates $6.5 billion for a new research agency to direct federal funding to diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer research, and $10.7 billion to research and prevent opioid addiction, representing a nearly $4 billion increase from last year.* IMMIGRATION. The budget includes $52 billion for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, with about $1.2 billion going to investments in modern border security technology. It lays out spending to rebuild the refugee program, which was slashed dramatically under Trump, and boosts funding to reduce backlogs in the immigration court system and in the processing of asylum and citizenship cases.* CLIMATE. The proposal includes budget boosts of about 20% for the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Science Foundation over last year's enacted levels. A total $14 billion boost on climate spending is expected to go a long way toward reversing Trump's slashing of regulations on fossil fuel producers such as rules on methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and provides $1.2 billion for the international Green Climate Fund as part of Biden's re-entry into the Paris Agreement on climate change.* IMPOVERISHED SCHOOLS. Biden’s budget would distribute a record $36.5 billion to America's neediest school districts through the Title I federal aid program, up $20 billion from the 2021 enacted level. This comes on the heels of the American Rescue Plan Act, which invested more than $122 million in K-12 public schools and allocated funds based on poverty concentration. The budget includes $1 billion for school nurses and mental health programs to address effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.* TRANSIT. The administration is proposing $600 million to buy electric vehicles for government agencies and charging stations, including for the U.S. Postal Service and $8 billion for the Energy Department to invest in clean energy technologies, up 27% over the prior year's funding. It would also boost U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak funding by 35%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-budget-boosts-us-spending-on-climate-action-health-7-takeaways-101617987842014.html
09-04-2021||World||Biden's first budget fuels health, education spending in sharp change from Trump||U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress to sharply increase spending to combat climate change and gun violence and to support education in a budget that marks a sharp departure from his predecessor, Donald Trump.The $1.5 trillion budget, reflecting an 8% increase in base funding from the current year, would invest billions more in public transportation and environmental clean-ups, slash funding for a border wall, expand funding for background checks on gun sales, and direct a record amount to poor public schools, each goal clashing with the prior administration.Nearly three months into a job consumed by the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the document offered a long-awaited glimpse into Biden's agenda and kick-starts a potentially grueling negotiation with Congress over what will ultimately be funded.The budget "makes things fairer," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday. "It injects capital into communities where capital is usually hard to come by."Biden would increase spending by $14 billion across agencies to deal with the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, a shift from the Trump administration's dismissal of climate science.The president would spend millions on dealing with rising numbers of unaccompanied children showing up at the country's southern border from Central America, including $861 million to invest in that region to stop asylum-seekers from coming to the United States.But his budget would provide no funding for the construction of a border wall, the administration said, a signature Trump priority, and would increase funding for investigation of immigration agents accused of "white supremacy."Among the biggest proposed increases in funding is $36.5 billion for a federal aid program for public schools in poorer neighborhoods, more than double the 2021 enacted level, and for researching deadly diseases other than the COVID-19 pandemic that has dominated his term in office so far."This moment of crisis is also a moment of possibility," Biden's acting budget director, Shalanda Young, wrote in a letter to the Senate.Biden would spend $6.5 billion to launch a group leading targeted research into diseases from cancer to diabetes and Alzheimer's, a program that reflects Biden's long desire to use government spending to create breakthroughs in medical research.Biden requested some $715 billion for the Department of Defense, roughly even in inflation-adjusted terms with this year, and a compromise between liberals trying to impose cuts and hawks who want military spending to increase.The money earmarked for the Pentagon aims to deter China, support modernizing the nuclear missile inventory and building "climate resiliency" at military facilities.Known as a "skinny" budget, Biden's proposal on Friday provided only cursory figures on "discretionary" programs and departments where Congress has flexibility to decide what it wants to spend for the fiscal year starting in October.The White House had been delayed in producing the document, blaming resistance from political officials during the handover from Trump and denying that competing interests over issues like military funding played a role.The proposal does not include Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure proposal or changes in taxation, one administration official said. Those changes would be included in a full budget proposal to be submitted in late spring.It does include a 10% increase in funding for the Internal Revenue Service, however, part of push to crack down on individuals and corporations who don't pay their fair share of taxes.Discretionary spending accounted for $1.6 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year, about a quarter of total federal spending. The rest is for areas deemed mandatory including old-age, disability, unemployment and medical benefits.Each of the proposals is just the first step in a budgeting process that will ultimately be decided in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, where Democrats hold bare majorities.Biden withdrew his initial pick, Neera Tanden, to lead the Office of Management and Budget after she faced difficulty winning Senate approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-first-budget-fuels-health-education-spending-in-sharp-change-from-trump-101617987593131.html
09-04-2021||World||Pak provincial govt releases ₹3.48 cr for reconstruction of Hindu temple||Pakistan's Khyber Pakthunkhwa Provincial Government has released over ₹3.48 crore for the reconstruction of a revered Hindu shrine damaged by a mob led by some local clerics and members of radical Islamist party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam in December last year.The provincial government will give ₹3,48,29,000 to Auqaf Department for the reconstruction of the Samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj destroyed on December 30 last year in Terri village of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Karak district.The attack on a century-old temple and the adjoining 'samadhi' had drawn strong condemnation from human rights activists and the minority Hindu community leaders, prompting the Supreme Court to order its reconstruction. The court directed the provincial government to ensure early completion of the temple.The Khyber Pakthunkhwa government managed the funds for the same from the Stunt Prevention and Rehabilitation integrated Nutrition gain scheme of the Planning and Development Department.The P&D department in a letter to the Finance Department informed that the construction of the shrine would be completed without making the scheme part of the annual development programme of the province.Last month, the Hindu community in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa decided to pardon the mob that vandalised and burned down a century-old temple in the province after local clerics and members of the minority community held a meeting to resolve the dispute.As per the dialogue, informally called 'jigra', the accused have tendered an apology over the attack and a similar incident in 1997. The Muslim clerics have assured full protection to the Hindus and their rights as per the country's Constitution.Following the incident, India had lodged a strong protest with Pakistan. The Ministry of External Affairs had conveyed its serious concerns to the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi over the repeated instances of similar incidents and atrocities against the members of the minority community.India had also called out the Pakistan government at the United Nations, saying the country's enforcement agencies stood as "mute spectators" when a historic Hindu temple was attacked.The Samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj is considered sacred by the Hindu community. It was built where he died in 1919 in Teri village of Karak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-provincial-govt-releases-rs-3-48-cr-for-reconstruction-of-hindu-temple-101617985206837.html
09-04-2021||World||Hong Kong: Customs officials raid shop founded by pro-democracy activist||Hong Kong authorities said on Friday they had seized nearly 9,000 Thai cleaning products suspected to have wrong labelling from a shop founded by a pro-democracy activist facing charges under the city's contentious national security law.Customs officers on Thursday raided 25 shops belonging to the chain, AbouThai, and arrested a 33-year-old male director of the group, the government said in a statement.The suspect had been released on bail and further arrests had not been ruled out, it added."The product information marked on the packages of the products involved failed to bear Chinese and English bilingual warnings or cautions," it said, adding the estimated market value of the 8,805 products seized was about HK$400,000 ($51,400).Under Hong Kong's Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance, warnings or cautions on products must be in both English and Chinese and are required to be "legibly and conspicuously shown on the goods".Customs chiefs said the raids were carried out in connection with missing safety warnings on cleaning products, with some only having warnings or cautions in Thai, while others bore warnings or cautions in Thai and English.The company's founder, Mike Lam, is among 47 democrats charged under the city's national security law on a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion and is currently on bail.Crowds queued outside branches of the shop across the city on Friday to show support for Lam, with some saying they believed the raid was politically motivated."I find it unreasonable that the Customs targeted AbouThai. That's why I come here to support. I am quite touched that many people come," said Chris, who declined to give his full name due to the sensitivity of the national security law.The legislation punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secessionism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.Local broadcaster RTHK quoted Vincent Chan, from the customs consumer protection bureau, as saying the department condemned any "false accusation" that the raid was an "act of repression".Hong Kong anti-government protesters have queued outside businesses that openly support the democracy movement since anti-government protests flared in 2019.The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a promise of safeguards for its wide-ranging autonomy. Democracy activists say authorities are chipping away at those freedoms, accusations which officials in Beijing and Hong Kong reject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-customs-officials-raid-shop-founded-by-pro-democracy-activist-101617985387856.html
09-04-2021||World||Distrust of China brought India, Japan, Australia and US together: Report||Distrust of China’s role in the Indo-Pacific region has “consolidated” the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) between Australia, Japan, India and the US for now, as questions remain about its future because of India’s “inconsistent enthusiasm”, the autonomous US Congressional Research Service (CRS) has said in a new paper.The four-nation body - known as the Quad - held its first summit-level meeting in March, virtually, and announced plans to distribute up to 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region countries and set up working groups for cooperation on climate change and emerging technology.“Questions remain about the durability of the arrangement if leadership shifts in member countries, whether other countries will be brought into the Quad’s initiatives, and particularly about India’s inconsistent enthusiasm for the grouping,” the report said, adding, “For now, however, distrust of Beijing’s role in the region has consolidated the Quad.”The CRS feeds US congress with the latest and detailed analysis on an entire range of issues from domestic to international and though it does not speak for the legislative body or its members it tends to reflect the current thinking there, which it also shapes and informs through its reports.This CRS report looks at US-Japan relations primarily and deals with the Quad only in a section, as part of Japan’s foreign policy. Tokyo has been at the forefront of establishing the group, with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (who governed from 2012 to 2020) as a leading advocate of it.“Japan’s eagerness to pursue the Quad appears driven above all by its concern over China’s increasing power, influence, and assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. In theory, engaging India eastward could compel Beijing to divert some of its resources and attention to the Indian Ocean,” the report said.The Quad was born in the aftermath of 2004 Tsunami as the four nations joined hands for relief and rehabilitation efforts in the region. But, it kind of petered out as Australia pulled out. The grouping was formally relaunched in 2017 and after a series of official and ministerial meetings, it held its first summit this year.Prime Ministers Narendra Modi, Scott Morrison of Australia and Yoshihide Suga of Japan joined the US President Joe Biden in a virtual summit on March 12, for their first and historic summit. They are expected to hold their first in-person summit later in the year, possibly on the sidelines of the G-7 meeting, which the UK is hosting in June.The Quad summit, which was called by President Biden as his first major foreign policy initiative, “elevated the group’s profile and expanded its scope of operations,” the CRS report said and added the vaccine plans and other outcomes announced at the summit “could usher in a new chapter in cooperation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/distrust-of-china-brought-india-japan-australia-and-us-together-report-101617984433820.html
09-04-2021||World||Biden creates commission to study potential Supreme Court expansion||U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday ordered the creation of a bipartisan commission to study potential reforms to the Supreme Court, including whether to expand the number of justices, a key goal of progressive Democrats.In an executive order, Biden said the commission would tackle the "merits and legality" of specific high court reform proposals. Along with the contentious idea of expanding the court, reform advocates have recently pushed for term limits for the justices.A White House official stressed that the commission's members represent the full political spectrum and "is intended to study the arguments both in favor of and against the reforms proposed in these areas."Biden promised to establish the commission after coming under heavy pressure during his presidential campaign to act on reforming the Supreme Court. In part, that stemmed from former President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans moving quickly to fill liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat after her death less than two months before the election. Republicans previously refused to give former President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland a hearing in 2016 when they still controlled the Senate.In his single term, Trump named three justices to the high court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority.While Republicans have fiercely opposed increasing the size of the Supreme Court, many Democrats and progressive activists say all options must be considered to counter an entrenched conservative majority that could threaten access to healthcare, abortion, and civil rights.Biden, who previously voiced opposition to "court packing," repeatedly refused to articulate a stance on the issue during the waning days of the presidential campaign, saying that people would learn how he felt about the issue only after the election.The commission will be made up of a group of liberal and conservative legal scholars, former federal judges and lawyers who have appeared before the court. It will hold public meetings and have 180 days to report its findings.The number of justices on the high court has remained at nine since 1869, but Congress has the power to change the size of the bench and did so several times before that.Activist groups and Democrats have also broached the idea of imposing term limits for justices. This would likely require a constitutional amendment, though some scholars have proposed ways to accomplish term limits by statute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-creates-commission-to-study-potential-supreme-court-expansion-101617983033460.html
09-04-2021||World||US authorities probing tragic death of Indian couple in New Jersey||Authorities in the US are investigating the tragic death of an Indian couple, who was found dead in their New Jersey home due to an apparent stabbing.Balaji Bharat Rudrawar, a 32-year-old IT professional and his wife Arati Balaji Rudrawar (30) were found dead at their apartment in the Riverview Gardens complex of North Arlington borough in New Jersey.Officials in the Indian Consulate in New York termed the incident as very tragic and said they were in touch with the family of the deceased.Bergen County Prosecutor Mark Musella said in a statement that the North Arlington Police Department and the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office Major Crimes Unit were investigating the deaths of the two individuals found inside an apartment located at 21 Garden Terrace, North Arlington.Musella said that on April 7, North Arlington Police responded to the apartment at 5:40 p.m. after receiving a 9-1-1 call from a concerned neighbour asking for a welfare check on the residents.“Officers forced entry into the apartment and found a deceased male and female,” the statement said.An investigation is being conducted by the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office Major Crimes Unit under the direction of Chief Robert Anzilotti and the North Arlington Police Department under the direction of Chief Scott Hedenberg.Family sources said in India that neighbours saw the couple’s four-year-old daughter crying alone in the balcony of their house after which they informed the police.US media outlets said the couple died of an apparent stabbing in their North Arlington apartment. The husband apparently stabbed and sliced his wife in the abdomen as she unsuccessfully tried to fight him off in their living room, a US media report said.“The bodies were found on Wednesday after neighbours saw my granddaughter crying in the balcony and informed the local police who then entered the house," Balaji's father Bharat Rudrawar told PTI in Mumbai."The local police there informed me of the tragedy on Thursday. There is no clarity yet on the cause of the death. The US police said they will share findings of the autopsy report," Rudrawar said.He added that his daughter-in-law was seven months pregnant.“We had been to their house and were planning another trip to the US to be with them again," he said."I am not aware of any possible motive. They were a happy family and had lovely neighbours," he said when asked if he suspected foul play.Rudrawar said his granddaughter is now with a friend of his son, who had several friends in the local Indian community.Balaji Rudrawar, an IT professional from Ambajogai in Maharashtra's Beed district had moved with his wife to the US in August 2015 after they got married in December 2014, said his father, a businessman from the temple town, around 500 km from Mumbai.While Balaji was working there for a prominent Indian infotech company, his wife was a homemaker, Rudrawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-authorities-probing-tragic-death-of-indian-couple-in-new-jersey-101617981940885.html

The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union had less than half as many.With Amazon already well ahead in the tally on Thursday, the union pledged to appeal the result.“Our system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that, and we will be calling on the labor board to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behavior during the campaign,” said Stuart Appelbaum, RWDSU president. “But make no mistake about it; this still represents an important moment for working people and their voices will be heard.”Citing documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request, the RWDSU accused the company of “corrupting the election” by pressuring the U.S. Postal Service to install a mailbox on Amazon property in an effort to make employees to cast their ballots there rather than someplace more free of company surveillance. Employees have also said that Amazon used mandatory group meetings and one-on-one discussions to predict harmful consequences if they unionized.Amazon has said that it hosted “information sessions” so employees could “understand the facts” about unionization, and told the Washington Post that the mailbox was a “simple, secure, and completely optional” way to make voting easier. The company declined to comment on Appelbaum’s accusations.The National Labor Relations Board is tallying the ballots from its office in nearby Birmingham and beaming the process live to the media via Zoom. Approximately 5,800 workers were eligible to vote, and turnout was roughly 55%.The election officially ended on March 29, but Amazon and the union spent several days reviewing sealed individual ballots for such irregularities as problematic signatures, ripped envelopes and ineligibility to vote. Contested ballots -- which numbered about 500 and were disputed at a 4-1 ratio by Amazon, according to the union -- were to be reviewed later only if there were enough to swing the outcome. (Reuters earlier reported the 500 total.)The fiercely fought mail-in election lasted seven weeks and attracted national attention. The last unionization vote among Amazon employees failed in 2014, when a group of fewer than 30 machinists in Delaware declined to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.A RWDSU victory in Bessemer could eventually force Amazon into contract talks with the union, which is focused on improving working conditions for warehouse employees. The company notes that its $15 an hour starting wage is more than double the federal minimum and that it pays health benefits.Amazon’s sales and profit soared during the pandemic when millions of shoppers stampeded online. The outbreak put a spotlight on the safety and working conditions of essential workers at supermarkets, big-box stores and online fulfillment centers.In Bessemer, employees overwhelmed by the working pace and afraid of catching Covid-19 contacted the union, setting in motion a vote that’s already seen as a watershed for Amazon and organized labor. If the RWDSU prevails, the unionizing drive could spread to other Amazon facilities, some of which are already seeing stirrings of labor activism. A loss for the union would be a setback for the U.S. labor movement, which has been in decline for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-clinches-win-as-historic-vote-to-unionize-at-alabama-warehouse-fails-101617980788033.html
09-04-2021||World||La Soufriere volcano erupts on Caribbean’s Saint Vincent, evacuation underway||An explosive eruption rocked La Soufriere volcano on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent on Friday following mandatory evacuation orders from the local government.Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies Seismic Center, said the ash column is estimated to have risen as high as 10 kilometers (6 miles).“There is heavy ashfall in the near vicinity,” she said. “More explosions could occur.”Joseph said it was impossible to predict whether any potential upcoming explosions would be bigger or smaller than the first one.The volcano last erupted in 1979, and a previous eruption in 1902 killed some 1,600 people.The new eruption followed mandatory evacuation orders issued Thursday for people who live near the volcano. Officials planned to place them aboard cruise ships, send them to nearby islands or take them to shelters elsewhere in St. Vincent that are outside the danger zone.Roughly 16,000 people live in the red zone and will need to be evacuated, Joseph, said.The pandemic could hamper evacuation efforts.Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a press conference that people have to be vaccinated if they go aboard a cruise ship or are granted temporary refuge in another island. He said two Royal Caribbean cruise ships are expected to arrive by Friday and a third one in the coming days, as well as two Carnival cruise ships by Friday. Islands that have said they would accept evacuees include St. Lucia, Grenada, Barbados and Antigua.“Not everything is going to go perfect, but if we all cooperate ... we will come through this stronger than ever,” Gonsalves said.He noted that he was talking to Caribbean governments to accept people’s ID cards if they don’t have a passport.“This is an emergency situation, and everybody understands that,” he said.Gonsalves added that he highly recommends those who opt to go to a shelter in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, an island chain of more than 100,000 people, be vaccinated.Emergency management teams have been going out to communities in the red zone and providing transportation to safer locations, including prearranged shelters, according to Joseph.“They know who doesn't have transportation because all of this has been canvassed before,” she said, adding that those who board the cruise ship would not be taken elsewhere but would remain there for an unspecified period of time.By late Thursday evening, shelters were filling up as a string of car lights making their way to safer ground twinkled through the darkened mountains.John Renton, a school principal who was in charge of one shelter, said in a phone interview that they had plenty of masks and other personal protective equipment but needed more cots. While talking, he was interrupted by a phone call from a government official asking about the state of things. “We're over capacity,” he responded, noting that the shelter could hold 75 people and was already filled up.Government officials tweeted that the dome of the volcano located on the island’s northern region could be seen glowing by nightfall. The alert issued Wednesday follows days of seismic activity around La Soufriere.Gonsalves urged people to remain calm and orderly.“I don’t want you panicked,” he said. “That is the worst thing to do.”Scientists alerted the government about a possible eruption after noting a type of seismic activity at 3 a.m. on Thursday that indicated “magma was on the move close to the surface," Joseph said.“Things are escalating pretty quickly,” she said of the volcanic activity, adding that it was impossible to provide an exact forecast of what might happen in the next hours or days.A team from the seismic center arrived in St. Vincent in late December after the volcano had an effusive eruption. They have been analyzing the formation of a new volcanic dome, changes to its crater lake, seismic activity and gas emissions, among other things.The eastern Caribbean is home to other active volcanoes. Seventeen of the region's 19 live volcanoes are located on 11 islands, with the remaining two underwater near the island of Grenada, including one called Kick ’Em Jenny that has been active in recent years.The region's most active volcano in recent years has been Soufriere Hills in Montserrat, which has erupted continuously since 1995, destroying the capital of Plymouth and killing at least 19 people in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/la-soufriere-volcano-erupts-on-caribbean-s-saint-vincent-evacuation-underway-101617980268064.html

The World Health Organization says it's too early to know whether to recommend such vaccine mixing, however, and the European Medicines Agency hasn't advised putting any age restrictions on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.French authorities said the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company's vaccine remains central to its vaccination plan strategy, and they urged older populations to keep taking it as France's hospitals battle another surge in Covid-19 patients.“It’s an effective vaccine,” Dominique Le Guludec, president of France’s High Authority for Health, told reporters. “If we want to win the battle against the virus, we must use all weapons at our disposition.”Several European countries decided in recent weeks to limit their use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people because of strengthening evidence the vaccine may be linked to rare blood clots in younger populations.Since March 19, France has only offered the vaccine to people over 55. More than half a million French people under that age — including Health Minister Olivier Veran — received a first dose before then.France’s High Authority for Health said Friday that it is maintaining the age limit for now and recommending that younger people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine for their first dose should get booster shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines instead.“It’s a precautionary measure,” Veran said Friday on RTL radio.The health authority also called for more research on the effects of vaccine mixing.Germany on March 30 recommended restricting the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people over 60, in most cases. The country’s independent vaccine expert panel last week recommended giving a second shot of the BioNTech or Moderna vaccines to people under 60 who had received a first shot of AstraZeneca's product.Health ministers from Germany’s 16 states are expected to sign off on the recommendation next week.Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, said Friday that an advisory group on immunization made recommendations about the AstraZeneca vaccine in February, but didn’t have enough information at the time to determine whether it could be used in conjunction with other vaccines.“There is not adequate data to be able to say whether this is something that could be done,” Harris told a UN press briefing in Geneva.France, which has reported one of the world’s highest virus death tolls, has closed schools and nonessential businesses for a month and imposed nationwide travel restrictions to stem the spread of new virus variants.It's also trying to speed up vaccinations. President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged Friday that the United States “won the bet” on coronavirus vaccines by investing massively and moving fast with experimental treatments.Macron visited a French factory that started bottling and packaging Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines this week, and urged his compatriots to join a “national war effort” to administer and make vaccines. He promised that France would produce 250 million vaccine doses this year for domestic and global use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-asks-people-under-55-who-got-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-for-first-dose-to-take-different-second-dose-101617977919872.html
09-04-2021||World||WHO chief laments 'shocking imbalance' in Covid-19 shot distribution||There is a "shocking imbalance" in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines worldwide and most countries do not have anywhere near enough shots to cover health workers and others at high-risk, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday.More than 700 million jabs have been administered worldwide against the disease, but 87% have gone to high income or upper middle-income countries, with low income countries receiving just 0.2%, he said."On average in high-income countries, almost one in four people has received a Covid-19 vaccine. In low-income countries, it’s one in more than 500," Tedros told a briefing.The COVAX facility has delivered nearly 38.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 102 countries across six continents, six weeks after it began to roll out supplies, the GAVI vaccine alliance and WHO said on Thursday. It aims to deliver more than 2 billion doses this year but has faced delays."We hope to be able to catch up during April and May. The problem is not getting vaccines out of COVAX, the problem is getting them in," Tedros said, decrying the scarcity of supply.The AstraZeneca shot - the mainstay of the COVAX programme so far - has been hit by safety concerns after reports of blood clots in some recipients.Australia said on Friday it had ordered more alternatives for the AstraZeneca vaccine, setting back its vaccination rollout, and Hong Kong delayed deliveries of the shot amid concern about a possible very small risk of rare blood clots.GAVI CEO Seth Berkley, asked whether COVAX was negotiating for more doses of the vaccine being shunned by some countries, said that the Anglo-Swedish company's supply chain had "picked up".He hoped that the supply of AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India - whose doses are now being kept domestically for use against an accelerating epidemic - would improve over time."As countries decide they are going to prioritise one vaccine or another that may free up doses, and in doing we will try to make sure those doses are made available without delay, if countries are willing to make that happen," Berkely said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-laments-shocking-imbalance-in-covid-19-shot-distribution-101617978404063.html
09-04-2021||World||Derek Chauvin trial: What is fentanyl that defence blaming for George Floyd’s death?||A critical care doctor called as a prosecution witness in Derek Chauvin’s murder trial on Thursday said that fentanyl did not cause George Floyd's death. Dr Martin Tobin, a Chicago-area pulmonologist who specialises in the science of breathing, contradicted defence claims that Floyd’s health condition and small amounts of fentanyl in his system caused loss of oxygen.Floyd, a Black man from Minneapolis, died last year after Chauvin, a white police officer, kneeled on his neck. A transcript of the minutes leading to Floyd’s death had revealed that he uttered “I can’t breathe” more than 20 times and was told by Chauvin to stop “yelling”. “Then stop talking, stop yelling, it takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to talk,” said Chauvin after Floyd told him he can’t breathe, according to the transcripts of Minneapolis police body camera footage.Tobin said that the pressure of Chauvin’s knees cut off oxygen in Floyd’s body and led to brain damage within minutes, causing an arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop. “They're pushing the handcuffs into his back and pushing them high, then on the other side, you have the street. The street is playing the crucial part," Tobin said. "It's like the left side is in a vice," he added.Tobin’s testimony undermined the claims made by the defence team which has been hinging on the toxicology report released in June 2020 that said traces of fentanyl and methamphetamine was found in Floyd’s system.Also Read | 'It’s a classic story': George Floyd's girlfriend recounts the couple's drug useWhat is fentanyl?Fentanyl is an opioid administered to treat severe, chronic pain in cancer patients, according to the US National Library of Medicine. In the United States, fentanyl has been classified as a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act, suggesting it has a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. Cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose and death in the US are linked to illegally made fentanyl which is often mixed with heroin or cocaine without the users knowing that.MedlinePlus, an online information service by the US National Library of Medicine, has warned that fentanyl may be habit-forming, especially with prolonged use. “Fentanyl may cause serious harm or death if used accidentally by a child or by an adult who has not been prescribed the medication. Even partially used fentanyl may contain enough medication to cause serious harm or death to children or other adults,” says MedlinePlus on its website.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has classified fentanyl as narcotics (opioids) drug. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), its street names are Apace, China Girl, China Town, China White, Dance Fever, Goodfellas, Great Bear, He-Man, and Poison and Tango & Cash, as per NCBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/derek-chauvin-trial-what-is-fentanyl-that-defence-blaming-for-floyd-s-death-101617976343017.html

The plane has continued to face careful scrutiny since it resumed flights.Southwest Airlines removed 30 MAX airplanes from its schedule Friday, while American Airlines removed 17 of its 41 MAX airplanes and United Airlines removed 16 of its 30 MAX airplanes.Boeing said in a statement that it wants 16 MAX operators to check and verify that "a sufficient ground path exists for a component of the electrical power system".American Airlines Chief Operating Officer David Seymour said in a memo to employees seen by Reuters that Boeing "has traced the issue to a production change made in the installation process that occurred after our last aircraft was delivered before the fleet grounding in March 2019."Airlines said they did not have an immediate timetable for when the planes could return to service. American said the issue impacts 17 of its most recently delivered airplanes.A Boeing spokeswoman said the issue was not related to a key safety system tied to both fatal crashes called MCAS, which had led to the wider safety grounding."We are also informing our customers of specific tail numbers affected, and we will provide direction on appropriate corrective actions," Boeing said in a statement.Southwest Airlines said 30 of its 58 737 MAX 8 aircraft were affected by Boeing's notification, but that it is currently only flying up to 15 MAX airplanes per day.Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said it was not clear how big an impact the issue will have."If it’s a glitch that’s either just a false alarm or something easily checked in a day or so, it will be forgotten quickly," he said in an email."But since it’s just a batch of planes, and not all MAXs, it’s probably not related to the design.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-production-issue-prompts-airlines-to-pull-some-737-max-jets-from-service-101617976870951.html
09-04-2021||World||US: Florida woman, who coughed on cancer patient, gets 30 days in jail||A Florida woman whose image went viral when she coughed on a customer at a Pier 1 store last year in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic has been sentenced to 30 days in jail.A judge in Jacksonville on Thursday also ordered Debra Hunter to pay a USD 500 fine, serve six months probation and participate in a mental health evaluation along with anger management, David Chapman, communications director for the state attorney's office in Jacksonville, said in an email. She was also ordered to cover the costs of the victim's COVID-19 test.Hunter received credit for one day already served in jail. She was arrested last June after she was recorded deliberately coughing on the other customer during an argument with employees inside the store.According to investigators, the victim, Heather Sprague, had begun recording Hunter's heated encounter with the employees. Hunter saw her and made a rude gesture before walking up and saying she would cough on her. And then she coughed on her, an arrest affidavit said.Sprague, who is being treated for a brain tumor, told the judge she spent days anxiously searching for a place where she and her family could be tested for the coronavirus. The tests ended up being negative, she said.Hunter's husband told the judge they had faced numerous hardships leading up to the incident, including losing everything they had in a house fire, FirstCoast News reported.“It was like air being inflated into a balloon, and it finally got to the point where she couldn't handle any more air,” Hunter's husband said in court. “And then she finally rubbed up against something and just popped.“Hunter told the judge her family has paid the price for her mistakes, adding that her children continue to lose friends, and that they don't go out in their community anymore.“I watch as my kids lower their heads and turn the opposite direction, so they won't be recognized or approached,” she told the judge. “And I know exactly what they're feeling because I do the same thing.“Before ordering jail time, Duval County Court Judge James Ruth said she was struck by the fact that Hunter's testimony focused less on how she may have harmed the victim and more on how her actions affected her own family.“Her children didn't create this problem and her husband didn't, and she talked about how it changed her world and she was getting nastygrams on Facebook and things of that nature and they can't go to their country club or wherever,” Ruth said.“But I have yet to see any expression, or a significant expression on her regret about the impact it had on the victim in this case!”Sprague said the encounter left her stunned and fearful.“I worried for the health and safety of my children, and wondered how in the world I could possibly isolate to protect them — in a household of 12 — if I had been intentionally infected,” she said.She told the judge she believes there should be accountability for Hunter's actions, which is why she chose to report the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-florida-woman-who-coughed-on-cancer-patient-gets-30-days-in-jail-101617976424258.html
09-04-2021||World||Angela Merkel to take control from German states, impose restrictions on regions reporting high Covid-19 cases||German Chancellor Angela Merkel plans to take control from federal states to impose restrictions on regions with high numbers of new coronavirus infections, a government spokeswoman said, in a battle to curb a third wave of the pandemic.The federal government plans to introduce draft legislation next week, she said.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said this will include compulsory measures in regions with 100 or more new coronavirus cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Above an incidence of 200, distance learning was planned for schools again, he added.The incidence figure reached a high near 200 in late December, soon after Germany went from a "lockdown lite" that started in early November, during which schools and stores were open, to a full shutdown.It last stood at 110.4, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.However, containment measures in Germany vary from region to region due to the country's decentralised federal system. In some regions, consumers can go shopping as long as they have a negative Covid-19 test, while stores are closed in others.Some, like Berlin, have introduced nighttime bans on gatherings, while others, like Saarland, have allowed restaurants and beer gardens to open outdoor seating."It makes good sense to regulate this uniformly for the whole of Germany, because then there will be clarity and transparency," Scholz told reporters."In this regard, it is a necessary, real step forward if we expand the infection (protection) law to include a regulation for exactly these cases."Short, sharp lockdownMerkel and several regional leaders have called for a short, sharp nationwide lockdown while Germany - Europe's biggest economy and most populous country - tries to vaccinate more people."Rules on social distancing, mask mandates, curfews and social distancing should be regulated at a national level," said Armin Laschet, chairman of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).The number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 25,464 in a day, which was 3,576 more than a week earlier, data from the RKI showed on Friday.But the institute cautioned that the figures may be skewed following the long Easter holiday weekend, adding it expected reliable case numbers from around the middle of next week.A meeting of Merkel and the leaders of Germany's 16 states scheduled for Monday, at which they were to discuss an extension to Covid restrictions, has been cancelled, the government spokeswoman said.German health minister Jens Spahn warned that nationwide measures were necessary to break the current wave of coronavirus infections as quickly as possible.He told journalists that there were currently nearly 4,500 coronavirus patients in intensive care in Germany, adding: "If this continues, it will be too much for our health system."Germany's top public health official said a lockdown lasting two-four weeks was necessary to break the third wave."Every day in which we don't act, we lose lives," Lothar Wieler, president of the RKI, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-to-take-control-from-german-states-impose-restrictions-on-regions-reporting-high-covid-19-cases-101617972537914.html

The finding strengthens the argument that Facebook's algorithms may be in violation of U.S. anti-discrimination laws, it added.Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne said the company accounts for "many signals to try and serve people ads they will be most interested in, but we understand the concerns raised in the report."Amid lawsuits and regulatory probes on discrimination through ad targeting, Facebook has tightened controls to prevent clients from excluding some groups from seeing job, housing and other ads.But researchers remain concerned about bias in artificial intelligence (AI) software choosing which users see an ad. Facebook and LinkedIn both said they study their AI for what the tech industry calls "fairness."LinkedIn engineering vice president Ashvin Kannan said the study's results "align with our own internal review of our job ads ecosystem."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-disproportionate-gender-bias-behind-facebook-s-job-ads-101617970212224.html
09-04-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip: The strength behind the crown||He often grabbed headlines for his gaffes, but Prince Philip was portrayed by royalists as the silent stalwart, who shelved his personal ambitions to support Queen Elizabeth II over seven decades.Born into the Greek royal family -- although he preferred to be thought of as a Danish prince -- the Duke of Edinburgh never wore a crown himself.Yet he was a permanent public presence at the queen's side, who called him her "strength and stay".Like her, his life was ruled by duty and tradition, putting his considerable energy behind numerous charities and carrying out 22,219 solo public engagements since Elizabeth rose to the throne in 1952.But Philip regularly got into hot water for what were politely referred to as "politically incorrect" off-the-cuff remarks -- quips that from anyone else would be seen as downright racist.Also Read: Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, has died, says Buckingham Palace"You managed not to get eaten, then?" he remarked to a British student who had trekked in Papua New Guinea in 1998.And on a historic state visit to China in 1986, the self-described "cantankerous old sod" warned a group of British students: "If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed."There was also his reputation as a womaniser, something that worried the royal family even before he and queen married.They reportedly found the young naval officer "rough, ill-mannered and uneducated" and worried he "would probably not be faithful".The man the queen's formidable mother privately referred to as "The Hun" because of his German Battenberg blood, was quickly suspected of a string of affairs, which would later be resurrected in the hit Netflix series "The Crown".But Philip laughed off talk of philandering -- with Sarah, the Duchess of York's mother often cited as one of his former lovers."For the last 40 years I have never moved anywhere without a policeman accompanying me. So how the hell could I get away with anything like that?" he said.At home, the duke had a reputation for being cold towards his four children, Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward.But many observers considered Philip to be the glue that held together the royal family.And in a rarely seen softer side, it emerged the late princess Diana addressed him as "Dearest Pa" in letters in which he offered solace over her deteriorating marriage to his eldest son Charles.'Trial and error' Philip, the world's longest serving consort, was blessed with robust health for much of his long life, and conducted his final official appearance in August 2017 at the age of 96.But he was admitted to hospital with various complaints as he advanced into his 90s, most recently for a heart procedure.In January 2019, at the age of 97 and still driving, he was involved in a car accident near the royal estate of Sandringham in eastern England.His Land Rover Freelander overturned and two other motorists were injured.Prosecutors decided not to press charges after the prince, who walked away unscathed, voluntarily surrendered his driving licence.The accident saw him withdraw from public life and he spent much of 2020 in isolation with the queen at their Windsor Castle home west of London, shielding from the coronavirus pandemic.But he made several appearances, including at the wedding ceremony of his granddaughter Princess Beatrice in July, four months before celebrating his own 73rd wedding anniversary.He also attended a military ceremony at Windsor in July when he handed over his ceremonial military role as Colonel-in-Chief of The Rifles regiment to his daughter-in-law Camilla, wife of Prince Charles.Never one to talk about his own feelings, the prince admitted in a rare 2011 interview that he had carved out his own role in the royal family by "trial and error".Asked if he had been successful, he told the BBC in his typical forthright manner: "I couldn't care less. Who cares what I think about it? I mean it's ridiculous."But the queen has been more forthcoming about his worth."He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years," she said in a speech to mark their golden wedding anniversary in 1997.Exile from Greece Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark was born on a kitchen table on Corfu on June 10, 1921, the only son of prince Andrew of Greece -- the younger brother of Greece's king Constantine -- and princess Alice of Battenberg.Aged just 18 months, he and his family were evacuated in a British Royal Navy ship from politically unstable Greece, with the toddler reputedly carried in a cot made from an orange box.The family settled in Paris with young Philip heading to the austere Gordonstoun public school in Aberdeenshire, northeast Scotland, where he became head boy.He pursued his love of sailing and at the outbreak of World War II in 1939 became an outstanding Royal Navy cadet before serving on battleships in the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean.As the war progressed, Philip was mentioned in despatches and promoted through the ranks.By 1945, he was a first lieutenant and witnessed the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay with the British Pacific Fleet.Philip had been formally introduced to princess Elizabeth, the future queen, in July 1939.The pair shared a great-great grandmother -- Queen Victoria -- making them distant cousins, and they kept in touch during the war, meeting on a number of occasions.But it was not until July 1947 that their engagement was announced and they tied the knot that year on November 20 at Westminster Abbey in London.'Duty to serve her' The royal couple made their first major tour together -- to Canada and the United States -- in 1951.By now a commander, Philip's naval career was cut short by the death of Elizabeth's father, king George VI, in 1952, which brought her to the throne."Prince Philip was a highly talented seaman," said his contemporary Terence Lewin. "If he hadn't become what he did, he would have been First Sea Lord (chief of naval staff) and not me."Philip once admitted the curtailment of his career was "disappointing" but said, "being married to the queen, it seemed to me that my first duty was to serve her in the best way I could".Yet he remained closely involved with the armed services and the queen marked his 90th birthday in 2011 by appointing him Lord High Admiral -- the titular head of the British Royal Navy and an office until then held by her.He was a keen flyer, clocking well over 5,000 hours of pilot time, and turned his love of horses to competition, first as a polo player and later representing Britain at carriage-driving.He also maintained an interest in science, technology and the environment and for years drove a liquid petroleum gas taxi around London.His greatest legacy may lie in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme, which was set up in 1956 to develop the confidence and skills of young people aged 15 to 25 in Britain and the Commonwealth.His youngest son, Edward, said its importance was likely to be greater due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on formal education."I think the role of the non-formal in this present climate is going to be even more important than ever before because it's those skills and experiences which are going to be looked for," he told Sky News televisionPhilip was also patron of a number of organisations, including the World Wide Fund for Nature, and chancellor of the universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-s-husband-prince-philip-the-strength-behind-the-crown-101617967007358.html
09-04-2021||World||Explosives found near Kabul airport, plane with Pak speaker turned away||A plane carrying Pakistan's Parliament Speaker and a delegation of lawmakers was not allowed to land in Kabul and was turned back due to security reasons after explosives, apparently years old, were found buried near the airport.National Assembly Speaker Asad Qaiser was heading a nine-member parliamentary delegation to Kabul for a three-day visit on the special invitation of Speaker of Afghan Wolesi Jirga Mir Rehman Rehmani.A spokesperson for the speaker said that Qaiser along with the delegation had departed for Kabul from the Islamabad International Airport as per schedule but when their aircraft was still in the air, the delegation members were informed that Kabul airport had been closed due to some “security reasons”, the Dawn News reported.The plane was about to descend when the control tower informed of the closure of the airport.Riaz Arian, the commander of Hamid Karzai International Airport (HKIR), told Afghanistan's Tolo News that Qaisar’s flight was diverted because of the relocation of unexploded explosives from under a building near the airport.An official from NATO’s Resolute Support Mission said a digging crew uncovered explosives that appeared to have been buried "for quite some time" in the area, the news portal reported.“During construction at HKIA international airport, a digging crew uncovered unexploded ordnance that appears to have been buried for quite some time. The explosives were uncovered in an unoccupied area far from any active runway. Turkish military explosives experts conducted a controlled detonation to render the device safe. Flight operations resumed shortly thereafter,” said the official.Qaiser later received telephone calls from his Afghan counterpart as well as chairman of Afghanistan’s Senate Fazal Hadi.During their telephone conversation, the two Afghan leaders said the Pakistani plane was not allowed to land at Kabul airport due to security concerns. They expressed the hope that the Pakistani delegation would soon visit Afghanistan, the Dawn News reported.Qaiser vowed to visit Afghanistan as soon as the security situation improved. He also remarked that Pakistan would continue to play its role for peace in Afghanistan.It was to be the first official visit of the Speaker to Afghanistan on the special invitation of his Afghan counterpart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosives-found-near-kabul-airport-plane-with-pak-speaker-turned-away-101617967434924.html
09-04-2021||World||US envoy John Kerry discusses climate challenges in Bangladesh||John Kerry, the special US envoy on climate, said Friday that President Joe Biden was keen to work with Bangladesh in dealing with climate change impacts after the United States' return to the Paris accord.Kerry arrived in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, to hear what the South Asia delta nation has done to cope with weather extremes and rising sea levels ahead of a virtual summit on climate change that Biden is hosting this month.“No one country can solve the problems of climate crisis,” he told reporters, after visiting other vulnerable countries including the United Arab Emirates and India. He said that Biden had returned the US to the Paris agreement on climate change after Donald Trump pulled out in 2017.Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen, who appeared with Kerry, took the opportunity to ask for US help in repatriating about 1.1 million Myanmar Rohingya refugees from crowded camps in the border district of Cox's Bazar, saying they were destroying vast areas of forests and ecology.“We hope that (the) US's proactive initiative can help them for a safe and dignified return, back to their country for a decent living,” he said.The refugees are victims of persecution in Myanmar, which is now military ruled since the Feb. 1 coup toppled the civilian government, and most say it's unsafe to return.Momen said earlier that Bangladesh believes that adaptation to climate change is not enough and it needs support as promised by others. “It should be Kerry's special target,” he was quoted as saying by the United News of Bangladesh news agency.He said the countries that are mostly responsible for contributing greenhouse gases should also share responsibility of rehabilitating and protecting the people vulnerable to climate change impacts.In the UAE, the government says the impact of warmer weather, less rain, droughts, higher seas and more storms is taking its toll on infrastructure, human health and natural habitat. Kerry heard of similar challenges in talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Thursday, the State Department said.Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million people, shares the same predicament.Some expert warn that rising sea levels could devour much of its vast coastal region, and cyclones and tidal surge destroy agriculture and livelihood for millions. The world's largest mangrove forest, Sundarbans, which straddles the border of Bangladesh and India, is especially vulnerable and its famous Bengal tigers at risk.The State Department said that Kerry and Modi focused on mobilizing finance to support clean energy deployment, cooperation on innovation and scaling up emerging technologies such as for energy storage, green hydrogen, clean industrial processes and sustainable urbanization and agriculture.Biden has invited 40 world leaders for the April 22-23 summit, including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-john-kerry-discusses-climate-challenges-in-bangladesh-101617966096900.html
09-04-2021||World||Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, has died, says Buckingham Palace||Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, husband and confidant of the U.K.’s Queen Elizabeth II since 1947, has died. He was 99.The prince “passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle,” according to an emailed statement Friday from the Queen’s officials.Philip’s death comes at a moment of profound change for the U.K. Five years after the vote to leave the European Union, Britain is trying to heal the wounds from the Brexit process, while recovering from the pandemic that pushed the economy into its deepest recession for 300 years.Watch | Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband, dies aged 99: PM Modi, UK PM reactThe royal family itself has been buffeted by a succession of controversies, most recently over Prince Harry’s departure from royal duties. Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle, said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March that an unnamed senior royal had asked “how dark” her unborn son’s skin color would be. That prompted a rare public response from the Queen.As he led the tributes to the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Philip had “helped to steer the royal family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life.”Hard-workingThe duke was one of the hardest-working royals. He powered through various health scares over the years, retiring from public life only toward the end of his life.A former Royal Navy officer and World War II veteran, Philip was required by protocol to walk two paces behind his wife in public. But he successfully carved out a role for himself, tirelessly touring coal mines and hospitals, tiddlywinks championships and sheep shows. He accompanied his wife on more than 250 official overseas visits, meeting heads of state around the world.He also guarded his independence and drove himself as much as possible until he turned over his Land Rover on a country road in January 2019, leaving a woman with a broken wrist. He was persuaded to give up his driver’s license but was spotted later in the year driving a horse-drawn carriage on a road near the Queen’s Norfolk country estate.Personal legacyThe duke never attended university, having joined the Royal Navy straight from school, but was passionately committed to education. His legacy includes the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award project, a personal-development program for young people, and he was made chancellor for life of the University of Cambridge.He was perhaps most famous for speaking his mind in public. His politically incorrect gaffes amused, and sometimes appalled, the nation. While the queen managed never to offend anyone in public, her husband was followed wherever he went by tabloid journalists on “gaffe watch.”He was able to laugh at his own mistakes, once joking about “dontopedalogy” or “the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it.” He said he’d been “practicing it for years.”The duke’s supporters contended that his comments were usually bad attempts at humor, as when he asked a blind woman with a guide dog: “Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?”The duke’s forthright manner sometimes led to strained relations with members of his family, particularly Charles, his eldest son and the heir to the throne. In 1994, Charles told his authorized biographer that his father had bullied him into marrying Lady Diana Spencer.The couple divorced in 1996, after 15 years of marriage. Diana died in a car crash in Paris the following year. Many in the U.K. felt the royal family, and the duke in particular, had treated Diana poorly.In November 2002, Philip issued a public statement following media reports that he had written insulting letters to Diana at the time of her breakup with Prince Charles. The reports were a “gross misrepresentation” of his relationship with the princess, he said.The duke had a close relationship with the next generation. Prince William described him as a “legend” and his grand daughter Eugenie said Philip held the family together. “He really is strong and consistent,” she told a TV documentary. “He’s the rock, you know, for all of us.”Turbulent childhoodThe man who went on to marry the longest-reigning British monarch had a turbulent childhood. He was born Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark on June 10, 1921, on a kitchen table at Villa Mon Repos, a summer house on the Greek island of Corfu.At Philip’s birth, Greece was experiencing political upheaval. In September 1922, his uncle, Greece’s King Constantine, was forced to abdicate by republicans who resented his pro-German leanings and his dismissal of a popular prime minister.A revolutionary court sentenced Philip’s father to death, though the punishment wasn’t carried out, and the British sent a Royal Navy ship to evacuate the Greek royals. The family fled with the 18-month-old Philip in a cot made from an orange box. Greece was declared a republic two years later.Philip spent his early childhood in Paris, where he became fluent in French. His mother had a nervous breakdown in 1930 and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. She was confined to mental institutions for most of the next decade, and during World War II returned to Greece, where she became a nun. His father moved to Monte Carlo and his four sisters went to stay with German relatives.War serviceAs war with Germany loomed in 1939, Philip enrolled as a cadet at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, southwest England.Two years later, while serving on the battleship HMS Valiant, he won praise from superiors for bravery after a nighttime sea battle off Cape Matapan in southern Greece. Philip was in control of searchlights that illuminated enemy Italian ships.In July 1943, he was second in command of the destroyer HMS Wallace and took part in the Allied landings on Sicily. The prince was on board the destroyer HMS Whelp just off Japan when the Japanese officially surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945.During his time at sea, Philip corresponded with the young Princess Elizabeth, whom he called by the pet name Lilibet.They had first met in July 1939 when she visited Dartmouth with her family. She was a shy 13-year-old, he an 18-year-old Royal Navy cadet. They were distantly related, both great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.The future queen’s governess, Marion Crawford, later wrote that Philip was “rather like a Viking with a sharp face and piercing blue eyes. He was good looking, though rather off-hand in his manner. Lilibet never took her eyes off him the whole time.”In July 1947, the couple announced their engagement amid concern among some courtiers about Philip’s foreign roots. In an effort to fit in, he changed his family name from Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg to the more English-sounding Mountbatten, an anglicized version of his mother’s surname, Battenberg.He renounced his own royal title as a prince of Greece and Denmark in order to become a naturalized British subject and converted from the Greek Orthodox religion to Anglicanism.Britain’s King George VI bestowed on his new son-in-law the titles His Royal Highness Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich. The wedding took place on Nov. 20, 1947, in London’s Westminster Abbey.The bridegroom’s German relatives weren’t invited. Three of his sisters had married German aristocrats in the 1930s. One was photographed sitting opposite Hitler at the wedding of Nazi Reich Marshal Hermann Goering, the commander of Germany’s Luftwaffe.Churchill’s adviceThere was also debate over the issue of what name the royal family should use. The queen, on advice from wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, decided she would not take her husband’s name, Mountbatten, and would remain Windsor. It was an important issue for the duke, who later said he felt like he had been “turned into an amoeba.”The married duke continued to serve in the Royal Navy and became a commander with his own ship, while also performing royal duties with his wife. In 1952, the couple were in Kenya when George VI died. It was the duke who broke the news to his wife that she was now Queen Elizabeth II.He also ended his naval career, deciding he could not fully support his wife while spending long periods away at sea. At a banquet celebrating their golden wedding anniversary in 1997, the monarch publicly thanked her husband.“He has quite simply been my strength and stay all these years,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-husband-of-queen-elizabeth-ii-dead-buckingham-palace-101617966369177.html
09-04-2021||World||Japan imposes new Covid-19 related measures in Tokyo ahead of Olympics||Japan announced Friday that it will raise the coronavirus alert level in Tokyo to allow tougher measures to curb the rapid spread of a more contagious variant ahead of the Summer Olympics.Japan's national vaccination drive has lagged and most people in the capital still have not been inoculated as infections have surged.The raised status announced by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will allow Tokyo's governor to mandate shorter opening hours for bars and restaurants, along with punishments for violators and compensation for those who comply. The measures are to begin Monday and continue through May 11.Many of Tokyo's cases have been linked to nightlife and dining, though they have recently spread to offices, elderly care facilities and schools, experts say.Suga also raised the alert level for Kyoto in western Japan and the southern island prefecture of Okinawa, where cases have surged in recent weeks. The new status there is to continue through May 5, the end of Japan's “Golden Week” holidays, to discourage traveling.The alert status was raised on Monday for three other areas — Osaka, neighboring Hyogo and Miyagi in the north. They have had sharp increases in daily cases since early March, soon after Japan scaled down a partial and non-binding state of emergency that began in January.The steps come less than three weeks after the emergency was lifted for Tokyo, underscoring the difficulty of balancing anti-virus measures and the economy. Suga's government has been criticized for being too slow in enacting anti-virus measures out of a reluctance to further damage the pandemic-hit economy.Osaka has declared a medical emergency after its hospitals became overwhelmed with new cases and has moved next week's Olympic torch relay there off public roads.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, who on Thursday asked Suga's government to boost the capital's alert level, said she is alarmed by the recent rise in virus cases and the possible impact of new variants. She urged residents to avoid nonessential trips and practice social distancing. Koike is expected to issue an order for bars and restaurants to close at 8 p.m.Just over 1 million people in Japan, or less than 1% of the population, have received the first of two vaccine doses, and the surge in cases may cause further cancellations of Olympic-related events.Inoculations started in mid-February for medical workers. Elderly people are scheduled to get their shots starting next week through late June. The rest of the population is likely to have to wait until about July, making it almost impossible for Japan to reach so-called herd immunity before the Tokyo Olympics begin on July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-imposes-new-covid-19-related-measures-in-tokyo-ahead-of-olympics-101617964423758.html
09-04-2021||World||No data yet on changing Covid vaccines between doses: WHO||The WHO reiterated Friday there was "no adequate data" on switching Covid-19 vaccines between doses, after France said under-55s who received an AstraZeneca first jab should get their second from a different vaccine.The World Health Organization has called for studies on so-called mixing and matching between vaccines, but said there was no comprehensive data so far on which it could make any recommendations.The UN health agency therefore recommends that the same product should be used for both doses.In February, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) issued its recommendations on how the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine should be used, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters."There is not adequate data to be able to say whether this is something that could be done," she said."So they were recommending that at this stage, interchangeability of vaccines was not something that we could give a recommendation on."But they did make a research recommendation that this be studied, so that we could understand whether or not it was a strategy that could be used."- French switch -Several clinical trials are looking at the efficacy of combining two types of vaccine.Europe's medicines regulator said this week that the AstraZeneca vaccine could cause very rare blood clots among some recipients, prompting several countries to scale up restrictions on the jab.France on Friday said under-55s who received a first injection of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine should be given a jab from a different producer for their second dose, in a ruling affecting 533,000 people.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first Covid-19 jab to receive WHO's green light, on December 31 last year.The AstraZeneca-Oxford University was the second, on February 15, with SAGE having issued usage recommendations five days before.That February 10 document said on switching between Covid-19 vaccines: "No data are available on the interchangeability of doses of this vaccine with other Covid-19 vaccines."It is currently recommended that the same product should be used for both doses. Recommendations may be updated as further information becomes available on interchangeability."Going forward, the SAGE document also recommended "interchangeability and 'mix and match' studies within and across Covid-19 vaccine platforms".On Wednesday, the WHO's vaccine experts said a link between AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jabs and blood clots was plausible but unconfirmed, stressing that reported occurrences were "very rare"."Based on current information, a causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of blood clots with low platelets is considered plausible but is not confirmed," the experts said.A WHO spokesman added: "We believe the benefit-risk balance is very much in favour of the vaccine."Nothing has changed in our advice -- which is to keep vaccinating."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-data-yet-on-changing-covid-vaccines-between-doses-who-101617965752257.html

Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews," a Facebook representative said.The CMA began a crackdown on false reviews from 2019 when it first asked Facebook and e-commerce platform eBay Inc to check their websites after it found evidence of a growing marketplace for misleading customer reviews on the platforms.Facebook has also been under scrutiny by the CMA for antitrust concerns over the technology company's acquisition of GIF website Giphy. It has been under pressure the world over for its data sharing practices as well as fake news and hate speech."The pandemic has meant that more and more people are buying online, and millions of us read reviews to enable us to make informed choices when we shop around. That's why fake and misleading reviews are so damaging," said CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli.CMA's crackdown on Facebook coincides with Britain's efforts to set up a dedicated digital markets unit within the regulatory authority to specifically look at governing digital platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-bans-16k-accounts-for-trading-fake-reviews-101617963859433.html

In the meantime, he'll carry on keeping a close eye on the mud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-etna-erupts-and-lights-up-the-sky-mud-pools-to-indicate-its-next-move-101617964319696.html

Right now many countries are vaccinating healthy young people, often at the expense of risk groups and frontline workers (mainly from global south, as usual...)"She was referring to Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Pacific islands and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East.Thunberg shot to fame in 2018 when she began a solitary protest against global warming outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm, skipping her Friday school classes to demand her government take action on climate change.Within months, more than two million students in 135 countries had set up their own picket lines, joining Thunberg's "School strike for the climate" campaign.Speaking to the BBC for a documentary series, Thunberg said the Glasgow conference, due to run Nov. 1-12, should be postponed.The gathering, formally known as the U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties, has already been pushed back by a year due to the global pandemic."This needs to happen in the right way. Of course, the best thing to do would be to get everyone vaccinated as soon as possible so that everyone could take part (in the conference) on the same terms," Thunberg said.A delay, however, should not put off urgent action on climate, she said. "We don't have to wait for conferences nor anyone or anything else to dramatically start reducing our (greenhouse gas) emissions. Solidarity and action can start today."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/activist-greta-thunberg-to-skip-un-climate-conference-in-scotland-101617964503973.html

09-04-2021||World||Armed clashes break out in Myanmar between troops and anti-junta protesters||At least 11 demonstrators were killed in clashes with security forces in a town in northwest Myanmar after truckloads of troops arrived to quell a protest against the ruling military junta, domestic media reported on Thursday.Protesters armed with homemade guns, knives and firebombs fought back against the troops in the town of Taze and more soldiers were brought in, the Myanmar Now and Irrawaddy news outlets said.Fighting carried on into Thursday morning and at least 11 protesters were killed and about 20 wounded, they said. There was no word of any casualties among the soldiers.It took the toll of civilians killed by security forces to more than 600 since the junta seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.Taze is near the town of Kale, where at least 12 people were killed in a similar clash between troops and protesters on Wednesday, according to news media and witnesses.The incidents could signal a new phase in a struggle in which the opposition has largely used peaceful means of protest despite the lethal actions of the security forces."People will try to defend their own lives and their rights," said a former government minister who belongs to the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a group of lawmakers representing the ousted civilian government."People will not wait for CRPH to act," the minister told Reuters. "The CRPH cannot stop the possible armed resistance by the people, from the people."The junta could not be reached for comment.SECURITY COUNCILA member of the CRPH, which is attempting to restore the civilian government, will on Friday address an informal, virtual gathering of the 15 U.N. Security Council members in New York, diplomats said.It will be the first public discussion of Myanmar by the Council's members since the coup on Feb. 1.The Security Council has condemned the violence against protesters, but has not defined the military takeover as a coup or threatened any action, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.The United States, which has imposed sanctions on the junta's economic interests, on Thursday added a state-owned gem enterprise to its list of targets.The junta has not baulked at taking on celebrities, and on Thursday arrested Paing Takhon, a popular 24-year-old model and actor who had spoken out against the coup and pledged support for Aung San Suu Kyi, his sister Thi Thi Lwin said.She said eight trucks and about 50 soldiers had come to pick him up at their parents' home in Yangon, where he had been staying as he was unwell from malaria and a heart condition. She did not know where he had been taken.AAPP has said over 2,800 people are in detention for opposing the junta.Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Myanmar's leading champion of democracy over three decades, has been held at an undisclosed location since the coup and charged with crimes that could see her jailed and banned from politics.Her National League for Democracy won an election in November but the military - which has ruled Burma for most of its post-independence history - alleged that it had been marred by fraud.The junta's vice-chairman, Soe Win, was shown on state-run television meeting with military officers in Shan state to detail what he said were more cases of fraud. Many Western governments have dismissed the assertions as nonsense.BLACKLISTED GEMSThe United States, the European Union and others have already imposed sanctions on generals involved in the coup and some of their family members, as well as two conglomerates controlled by the military.The latest U.S. sanctions blacklisted Myanma Gems Enterprise, part of the mining ministry.The move blocks Americans from doing business with the entity, which issues permits and licences to mine precious stones and collects revenues from the sale of gems and jade. The U.S. Treasury Department said it would curb the junta's ability to generate revenues.Myanmar is the world's main source of jade, and a major source of rubies and other rare gems.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States would "keep increasing pressure on the regime’s revenue streams until it ceases its violence, releases all those unjustly detained, lifts martial law and the nationwide state of emergency, removes telecommunications restrictions, and restores Burma to the path of democracy".An adviser to the CRPH told Reuters that at least six lawmakers from the National League for Democracy were now sheltering in India.An Indian police official said they were among about 1,800 people who had entered from Myanmar since late February."MPs are in great danger at the moment in Myanmar. They are being searched, they are being followed by the soldiers," the adviser said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-clashes-break-out-in-myanmar-between-troops-and-anti-junta-protesters-101617959503468.html

09-04-2021||World||Nepal battles worst forest fires in years as air quality drops||Nepal is battling its worst forest fires in years, officials said on Friday, with smoke wafting across its mountains and souring the air as it settles into the bowl that holds capital city Kathmandu.Five people have died so far trying to put out the fires that have been raging since January, said Sundar Sharma, a senior official of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority.Wild fires were burning in at least 60 places across 22 of Nepal's 77 administrative districts, he said, adding to the growing levels of pollution across the country that lies nestled between India and the Tibet region of China.Details on losses from the fires are still being collected, Sharma said. This has been the worst fire season by number since 2012, when the government started keeping records."Forest fires are the main reason for the rising air pollution in Kathmandu and many other places," Sharma told Reuters."Wild fires could hit the peak later this month if the ongoing dry spell continued," he said.Nepal ordered schools to close for four days at the end of March after air pollution climbed to hazardous levels, forcing millions of students to stay home.Forest fires often erupt in Nepal during the January-May dry season, when villagers burn dry leaves in the woodlands to prompt fresh grass growth for their cattle.Sharma said the number of fires this year were 15 times more than those occurring in 2020. He didn't immediately have a reason for the increase.In Makwanpur, 50 km (32 miles) south of Kathmandu, 46-year-old Tara Pakhrin watched the fires on a hill next to her home."The smoke blinded me and I could not see who started the fire," she said.The air quality index (AQI) in Kathmandu was at an unhealthy level of 174 on Friday, according to data published on iqair.com, a site that monitors air quality. An AQI level below 50 is considered good."The pollution levels have come down in many places but this is not adequate enough for healthy breathing," said Indu Bikram Joshi, a spokesman for the Department of Environment.Just over the border in India's Uttarakhand state, forest fires have been burning since October, killing four people, the state government said.In April alone, there have been 657 incidents of forest fires in Uttarakhand, a bulk of them in the state's Garhwal region near to Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-battles-worst-forest-fires-in-years-as-air-quality-drops-101617955658290.html
09-04-2021||World||Bhutan, China hold expert group meeting on boundary dispute||Bhutan and China have agreed to hold the much-delayed 25th round of bilateral boundary talks, almost five years after the last meeting was held and in the wake of a fresh claim by Beijing in the eastern sector that borders India’s Arunachal Pradesh state. The agreement was reached at the 10th expert group meeting (EGM) on the Bhutan-China boundary issue that was held in Kunming during April 6-9, according to a joint statement issued by the two countries on Friday. The meeting was held against the backdrop of the dragging standoff between India and China in the Ladakh sector, which began almost a year ago. At the height of the standoff, China claimed for the first time in July last year that it has a boundary dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, a region that borders Arunachal Pradesh, which is also claimed by Beijing. Also Read | PM Modi, Xi Jinping on Joe Biden’s 40 leaders’ guest list for climate summitThe joint statement issued by Bhutan and China said: “The two sides agreed to hold the 25th round of Bhutan-China boundary talks and the 11th EGM as soon as possible at mutually convenient dates.” The EGM discussed a roadmap to expedite the Bhutan-China boundary talks, the joint statement said without giving details. Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks between 1984 and 2016 to settle their border issue and, according to discussions in the Bhutanese parliament and other public records of these meetings, the discussions have only centred on disputes in the western and central sections of the boundary. It couldn’t immediately be ascertained if China’s claim in the eastern sector with Bhutan – which was first raised in a statement issued to Hindustan Times by the foreign ministry in Beijing in July last year – had figured in the talks held in Kunming. China had objected to a grant request for Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district at a virtual meeting of the Washington-based Global Environment Facility (GEF) in June last year. The sanctuary, located in the easternmost part of Bhutan, covers 650 sq km. “The two sides agreed to continue to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas pending a final settlement of the boundary issue,” the joint statement said. The EGM was held in a “warm and friendly atmosphere” and it had “in-depth and fruitful discussions on the boundary issue in keeping with the close ties of friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and China”, the joint statement said. Boundary talks between Bhutan and China began in 1984, and the two sides signed the “Guiding Principles on the Settlement of the Boundary Issues” in 1988 and the “Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity” along border areas in 1998. “These two agreements form the basis of the boundary negotiation between Bhutan and China,” the joint statement said. The Bhutanese delegation at the EGM was led by Letho Tobdhen Tangbi, secretary of international boundaries, and the Chinese side was led by Hong Liang, director general of the department of boundary and ocean affairs of China’s foreign ministry. Hong has also led the Chinese delegations that participated in several recent meetings of the India-China Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. As a goodwill and friendship, the Chinese government donated personal protective equipment and medical supplies to support Bhutan’s fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-china-hold-expert-group-meeting-on-boundary-dispute-101617960475727.html

09-04-2021||World||Italy set to ease lockdown restrictions in most parts of the country||Italy is set to ease lockdown restrictions, lifting some curbs that have been weighing on the economy in the region surrounding Milan and across the country as the latest virus resurgence slows, officials said.Health Minister Roberto Speranza will likely sign a decree on Friday evening to shift many regions classified as high-risk “red” areas to medium-risk “orange” status, said the officials, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential issue.The development would mean that from early next week more retail businesses could open and people would be given more freedom to move around within their municipalities. Bars and restaurants would remain open only for takeout orders while travel to other regions would still be mostly banned.Prime Minister Mario Draghi is banking on accelerating a vaccination campaign to allow for an easing of lockdown rules. The premier on Thursday confirmed the government’s latest target of half a million daily Covid-19 vaccinations by the end of the month, even with new restrictions on the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine.Lombardy RegionRegions set to benefit from the easing of restrictions include Lombardy, which surrounds the country’s financial capital Milan; Piedmont, around the northern city of Turin; and the central region of Tuscany, the officials said.As many as four regions are likely to be kept on high-risk status: Campania and Puglia in the depressed south, Val d’Aosta in the north, and the island of Sardinia.Italy posted 17,221 new daily coronavirus cases on Thursday, as government experts say the pace of contagion is slowing. The country has recorded more than 3.7 million cases since the start of the pandemic.Draghi also said Thursday that his administration’s next decree for further stimulus measures, involving a request to widen the budget deficit, will probably be greater than the previous amount. The prime minister has already secured approval for a 32 billion-euro ($38 billion) package originally requested by his predecessor Giuseppe Conte.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-set-to-ease-lockdown-restrictions-in-most-parts-of-the-country-101617956782441.html

The nine-percentage point difference is the largest since the fourth quarter of 2012 and in recent years, the Democratic advantages have been between four and six percentage points, according to the poll.While the rise in the Democratic Party affiliation after the victory of the party candidate in the presidential election is not unprecedented, the GOP is facing its smallest share of identifiers since 2018 and its largest deficit to Democrats on party identification and leaning in nearly nine years, Gallup said.The poll figures come as President Joe Biden was inaugurated after facing violent resistance on January 6 when the rioters attempted to disrupt ‘the certification of his victory in the 2020 election'. The first quarter also witnessed a steady decline in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, deaths, expansion of vaccination program and the $1.9 trillion relief package.Also Read | Indian techie, pregnant wife found dead in US after 4-yr-old girl seen cryingGallup routinely measures party identification of the US adults and the political leanings of the independents. “In the first quarter, 30% of Americans identified as Democrats and 19% were Democratic-leaning independents, while 25% were Republican identifiers and 15% Republican-leaning independents. The vast majority of the remaining 11% were independents with no partisan leanings,” as per the poll.The poll also said the level of independent identification is among the highest against any quarter since 1988. However, increased independent identification mostly comes at the cost of the Republican party.The report noted that the GOP enjoyed advantages for incumbent Republican presidents George H.W. Bush following the 1991 US victory in the Gulf War, and George W. Bush in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.“The GOP's hopes of regaining control of the House and Senate it lost in the past two federal election cycles may also depend on how well the party appeals to independent voters, the largest bloc in the US., something the Republican Party struggled to do during the Trump administration,” the Gallup report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-party-affiliations-highest-since-2012-gop-facing-smallest-share-since-2018-poll-101617958344344.html

There is no clarity yet on the cause of the death. The US police said they will share findings of the autopsy report," Rudrawar said."My daughter-in-law was seven months pregnant," he said. "We had been to their house and were planning another trip to the US to be with them again," he said."I am not aware of any possible motive. They were a happy family and had lovely neighbours," he said when asked if he suspected foul play."I was informed by the US authorities that it will take at least 8 to 10 days for the bodies to reach India after necessary formalities," he said."My granddaughter is now with a friend of my son. He had several friends in the local Indian community, which has a 60 per cent population in New Jersey," he said.Balaji Rudrawar, an IT professional from Ambajogai in Maharashtra's Beed district had moved with his wife to the US in August 2015 after they got married in December 2014, said his father, a businessman from the temple town, around 500 km from Mumbai.While Balaji was working there for a prominent Indian infotech company, his wife was a homemaker, Rudrawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-techie-pregnant-wife-found-dead-in-us-after-4-yr-old-girl-seen-crying-101617957275895.html

A vote to leave the European Union, the British government said, would trigger an immediate recession, a painful fall in house prices, and a steep drop in exports.It’s almost 100 days since Britain completed its split from the EU -- almost five years after the referendum vote –- and a clearer picture of the consequences of the decision to leave is starting to emerge.The divorce has already had a negative impact on the U.K. economy, the data show, even if it has been largely overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic.Many of the effects of Brexit will take more time to play out: with Britain outside the EU’s single market and customs union, trade with the bloc has been hampered -- but the full extent of the damage won’t be clear until businesses fully re-open after lockdown.Some of the claims made by the Remain side, “Project Fear” as the British press dubbed it, have proved to be overblown, though. Here’s an early look at how Brexit is shaping up compared with the predictions.The Short-Term HitIn a report published before the 2016 referendum, the Treasury predicted that a vote to leave, followed by the immediate triggering of the Article 50 withdrawal process, would see national income decline by as much as 3.6% within two years, 520,000 more people unemployed, and house prices fall by 10%.It didn’t turn out that way -- not least because the government didn’t invoke Article 50 until March 2017. By June 2018, gross domestic product had risen by more than 3%, unemployment had fallen by 280,000, and the average house price had gained more than 7%.Then came Covid. GDP shrank almost 10% last year, the deepest slump since the Great Frost of 1709. The economy has only partially recovered from the huge losses incurred during the first lockdown last spring, leaving Britain further below pre-pandemic levels of output than any other Group of Seven nation.Higher Cost of LivingIn April 2016, the government sent a leaflet to all U.K. households, urging them to vote in favor of staying in the EU. It warned that leaving would increase the cost of living, because a falling pound would make imports more expensive. (About half of all U.K. imports come from the EU.)That prediction turned out to be prescient. The pound fell by as much as 18% against the euro within two years of the referendum, and remains 12% below its level on the day of the Brexit vote.Consumer-price inflation reached a 5 1/2-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, squeezing living standards. It remained above the Bank of England’s 2% target for almost all of the following two years. But inflation has since slumped because of the coronavirus pandemic.The Treasury predicted that if the U.K. left the EU and managed to reach a trade deal with the bloc, the country’s economy would be between 4.6% and 7.8% smaller in 15 years’ time than if it would have been had it stayed in the EU.Though Britain has only been formally out of the EU’s single market for less than 100 days, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that Brexit has already lowered GDP by 1.4% since the referendum. It now expects GDP will be 4% lower in the long-run than had Britain remained in the EU.Dan Hanson of Bloomberg Economics puts the hit at 3%, or as much as 5% if the impact of the government’s restrictions on immigration is factored in.Export PainsThe government said leaving the EU would make it more difficult for firms to export goods to the bloc, and that businesses would face higher costs.This warning turned out to be correct. U.K. companies have had to grapple with additional red tape such as export health certificates to shift goods into the EU. In January, exports to the continent shrank by 41% from the previous month.David Frost, who negotiated the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU and is now minister responsible for Britain’s relations with the bloc, has blamed stockpiling in December and the coronavirus lockdown for the reduction in trade. He says trade recovered to its normal level at the start of February. The data that will confirm or disprove that won’t be published until Tuesday.Finance FleeingBefore the referendum, many in the City of London warned a vote to leave would trigger a wave of job losses. Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted that as many as 100,000 jobs in financial services would go.In fact, far fewer jobs have relocated to the EU: 7,600 roles had moved as of March, according to EY, a consultancy. PwC didn’t respond to a request for comment.Still, more jobs could go if Britain and the EU can’t reach a deal giving U.K. financial firms broad access to the single market, something they lost as a consequence of Brexit.In the meantime, the City has lost business. Almost all trading of EU shares on U.K. exchanges -- more than 6 billion euros ($7 billion) in daily transactions -- shifted to the bloc in January. And banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have moved hundreds of billions of euros to their new or expanded hubs across the bloc.What about the NHS?The Leave campaign made less concrete and specific forecasts about the economic benefits of Brexit -- though one particular pledge stands out: a commitment to re-direct the 350 million pounds a week the U.K. sent to the EU to the National Health Service.That figure was too large given the U.K.’s net weekly contribution to the EU only totaled 250 million pounds once the rebate Britain received from the bloc is included. A significant chunk of that payment also came back to the U.K. in the form of EU public sector spending.In 2018, the U.K. announced plans to boost spending on the NHS by 394 million pounds a week in real terms from 2023, an increase the then Prime Minister Theresa May said would be partly funded by funds that would otherwise have gone to the EU.But the U.K. will still have to send approximately 20 billion pounds to the EU over the next seven years as part of its divorce settlement. And Brexit’s negative impact on GDP and tax receipts is expected to outweigh any cost savings from no longer making contributions to the bloc, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Long Term?The full cost of Britain’s decision to sever ties with its biggest and nearest commercial partner is likely to only become clear once the coronavirus restrictions ease and businesses return to normal. The debate is still far from settled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/100-days-of-brexit-was-it-as-bad-as-project-fear-warned-101617944598879.html

09-04-2021||World||China report accuses US of causing humanitarian disasters||China accused the US of causing humanitarian disasters through foreign military interventions in a report Friday that was the latest broadside by Beijing amid increasingly contentious relations with the Biden administration.The report from the government-backed China Society for Human Rights Studies said foreign wars launched “under the banner of 'humanitarian intervention'” have caused “mass casualties, damage to facilities, production stagnation, refugee waves, social unrest, ecological crisis, psychological traumas and other complex social problems,“ according to the official Xinhua News Agency.“The humanitarian crisis caused by military actions stems from the hegemonic mentality of the United States," Xinhua quoted the report as saying. It added the disasters could be avoided only by the US abandoning “hegemonic thinking motivated by self-interest."Despite hopes for a change in tone, relations between Washington and Beijing have remained as fractious under Biden as they were under his predecessor, who riled China with a trade war, support for Taiwan and sanctions over Chinese polices including in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and US calls for more candour from Beijing about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic have further roiled ties.While the new administration has taken no major actions in those areas, it has neither shown any sign of reversing the hardline taken under former president Donald Trump. Congress, meanwhile, is preparing to take up new legislation that would underscore the competition with Beijing in foreign affairs, trade and other fields.Asked Thursday about that pending legislation, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the administration has been “heartened that there is a good deal of bipartisan agreement when it comes to how we should and could approach the government in Beijing".China has struck back with heated rhetoric and visa bans against US officials and others it deems to have damaged its interests through their criticism of Beijing's human rights record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-report-accuses-us-of-causing-humanitarian-disasters-101617951528646.html
09-04-2021||World||Pakistan’s steadily diminishing equity with the US may have hit rock bottom||The United States (US) state department spokesperson Ned Price could not have chosen a better word to reflect the Joe Biden administration’s weariness with Pakistan. Asked about Islamabad’s flip-flop on sugar and cotton imports from India, Price said the US “continues” to encourage the two countries to resolve their concerns through direct dialogue. Actually, he could have simply shrugged.Pakistan’s steadily diminishing equity with the US may have hit rock bottom with the Biden administration. “For the first time in over two decades, Pakistan is not a foreign-policy priority for a new US administration,” two former Obama administration officials acknowledged in recent, and sympathetic article, advocating a reset of ties with Pakistan. And this might be good thing to keep in the rearview as New Delhi responds to Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s call to “bury the past and move forward”.Also Read | The long, rocky and uncertain story of India-Pakistan peacemakingFormer President Donald Trump wanted to mediate and made it known several times, to New Delhi’s irritation. But Biden is not interested apparently, and his administration has played no role in the newest stab at peace on the subcontinent, according to several people familiar with these developments.Biden has shown no interest in engaging Pakistan. He has not spoken to Prime Minister Imran Khan yet, more than two months after taking office. And that’s despite a direct request from Islamabad. The US President has also not invited Khan to his virtual summit on climate later this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina are among the 40 world leaders who will attend. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi, but the conversation was most unlike how first-calls tend to be. It was an uncomfortable call about the release of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a man convicted of kidnapping and killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl. Some in Islamabad wonder if Sheikh’s release ordered by the Supreme Court just a week after Biden’s inauguration in January is behind the current chill. US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin spoke with General Bajwa on phone during his travels in the region, but he did not stop by for a visit. He went to India and then skipped over Pakistan for an unannounced visit to Afghanistan.Pakistan’s allies in Washington have been trying, in the meanwhile, to catch the Biden administration’s attention and get it interested in resetting ties with the one-time ally. One of them called for a “rightsized” US-Pakistan relationship focused on economic and cultural interests. Another one called also for economic ties as the new focus but sought a “light government touch”, in other words, US government help.There is no indication the Biden administration — the national security council is driving the South Asia engagement for now in the absence of senate-confirmed assistant secretaries to head the relevant bureaus at the state and defence departments — is interested in a reset. Bajwa’s peace offer, as one American observer said, could be a move to “impress” Biden, win a reprieve and get something that looks like a reset. And no more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-steadily-diminishing-equity-with-the-us-may-have-hit-rock-bottom-101617951654375.html

09-04-2021||World||The world’s wealthiest countries are getting vaccinated 25 times faster||Enough vaccines have now been administered to fully vaccinate about 5% of the global population — but the distribution has been lopsided. Most vaccines are going to the wealthiest countries. As of Thursday, 40% of the Covid-19 vaccines administered globally have gone to people in 27 wealthy nations that represent 11% of the global population. Countries making up the least-wealthy 11% have gotten just 1.6% of Covid-19 vaccines administered so far, according to an analysis of data collected by the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.In other words, countries with the highest incomes are vaccinating 25 times faster than those with the lowest.Bloomberg’s database of Covid-19 vaccinations has tracked more than 726 million doses administered in 154 countries. As part of our effort to assess vaccine access around the world, the tracker has a new interactive tool measuring countries by wealth, population and access to vaccines. The U.S., for example, has 24% of the world’s vaccinations but just 4.3% of the population, while Pakistan has 0.1% of the vaccine coverage for 2.7% of the global population. The pattern is repeated across the globe and follows efforts by wealthy countries to pre-purchase billions of doses of vaccines, enough to cover their populations several times over, according to a separate analysis of vaccine deals. The U.S. is on track to cover 75% of its residents in the next three months. Meanwhile, nearly half of countries still haven’t reached 1% of their populations. The disparity calculations don’t include more than 40 countries, mostly among the world’s poorest, that don’t yet have public vaccination data. Those uncharted countries represent almost 8% of the global population.In the U.S., the federal government determines where vaccines are sent. So far, each state has been allocated vaccines based on its population size. While there are differences in access from neighborhood to neighborhood, each state has a fair share roughly proportional to its number of residents. A World of DifferenceThere’s no mechanism to ensure equitable distribution worldwide. If all of the world’s vaccines were distributed based on population, the U.S. would have administered nearly six times its fair share. The U.K. would have used up 7 times its population-weighted allotment (outpacing the EU’s double-share). Topping the list are the UAE and Israel, with nine and 12 times their population-based share, respectively.China has vaccinated its people at a rate that’s roughly in line with the global average — administering 20% of the world’s vaccinations for 18% of the global population. It has also exported vaccines to less wealthy countries, sometimes at no cost.The world’s least wealthy continent, Africa, is also the least vaccinated. Of its 54 countries, only three have have inoculated more than 1% of their populations. More than 20 countries aren’t even on the board yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-world-s-wealthiest-countries-are-getting-vaccinated-25-times-faster-101617942167302.html

The current 10 p.m. dining curfew and ban on gatherings of more than four people will be maintained, he said."Signs of a fourth wave of epidemics that we had so striven to head off are drawing nearer and becoming stronger," Chung told a daily meeting on the pandemic. "We will maintain the current distancing level, but actively reinforce various specific measures depending on the situation."The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 671 new cases for Thursday, a day after the daily tally hit the highest level since early January, with clusters developing from churches, bars and gyms, mostly in the greater Seoul area.Total infections rose to 108,269, with 1,764 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-orders-closure-of-nightclubs-karaoke-bars-fears-4th-covid-19-wave-101617937859614.html
09-04-2021||World||Australian PM holds national cabinet meeting amid vaccine upheaval||Australia is holding a national cabinet meeting on Friday to devise a new COVID-19 vaccination programme after abruptly changing policy and recommending people under 50 take the Pfizer vaccine not AstraZeneca due to the risks of blood clots.The move sees Australia joining countries around the world which have put restrictions on one of the most widely accessible vaccines against the coronavirus over concern about links to very rare blood clots. Australia will now seek tens of millions more doses of Pfizer's product.Plans to vaccinate Australia's 25 million population by the end of October would be pushed back, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday in announcing the change."Today we need to work through what the implications are for that changed circumstance," Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly told cable television station Sky News."Nothing's off the table. We're continuing to talk with multiple vaccine (manfacturers) around the world, particularly those that have completed their trials," added Kelly.Australian authorities switched their recommendation after European regulators reiterated the possibility of links between AstraZeneca's shot and blood clots. More than a dozen countries have at one time suspended use of the vaccine, but most have resumed, with some, including France, the Netherlands and Germany, recommending a minimum age.Australia had ordered 20 million imported doses of the Pfizer vaccine, enough for 10 million people, but had banked on the AstraZeneca product for the majority of shots with biopharma CSL Ltd contracted to make 50 million doses domestically.Pfizer remained committed to delivering all 20 million doses by the end of 2021 and the Australians were already talking to the company about upping its order, Kelly noted.AstraZeneca said in a statement that it respected the Australian decision and was working with regulators around the world "to understand the individual cases, epidemiology and possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events".CSL said it remained committed to meeting its contracted arrangements with Australia and AstraZeneca to make the vaccine "which remains critical for the protection of our most vulnerable populations".As well as the AstraZeneca and Pfizer contracts, Australia ordered 51 million doses of a vaccine being trialled by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Novavax Inc, but local authorities say they do not expect to approve the product until late 2021.Australia also embarked on a home-grown option - as opposed to local manufacture of AstraZeneca's offshore-developed product - with University of Queensland undertaking a trial of its own vaccine. That trial was aborted in December when the product was linked to false positives in HIV tests.After saying Australia had 150 million vaccine doses on order, enough for several times the population, the government said in January that it planned to have four million vaccinated by the end of March, only to have 600,000 by that time."Australians won't forget who is responsible for failing to deliver on what are his own promises and his own commitments," opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese told reporters on Friday."They should have listened to the expert advice that was given to the government, and indeed to all governments, about not placing all our eggs in one basket".Health Minister Greg Hunt told Sky News the government had intentionally spread its exposure to several vaccines under development because of the unusual nature of the coronavirus."Nobody knew which vaccines would be successful," he said.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who agreed this week to allow quarantine-free visits by travellers from neighbouring Australia, said the country was still assessing the AstraZeneca vaccine, without specifying whether the Australian decision would affect it.The Pfizer vaccine is the only inoculation approved by New Zealand, which says it has ordered enough for its five million population.Australia began vaccinations later than some other countries because of its low number of infections, which stand at just under 29,400, with 909 deaths, since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-holds-national-cabinet-meeting-amid-vaccine-upheaval-101617932874428.html

The second phase of six months will target the elderly, people with comorbidities, and workers in essential services, with the rest of the population following in the third phase."If we didn't have this debacle with the AstraZeneca vaccines, we would have been able to move faster, as we have indicated to the public," Mkhize said as he expressed hope that South Africa would achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 within a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/serum-institute-of-india-refunds-south-africa-for-undelivered-covid-19-vaccines-101617940436571.html
09-04-2021||World||'None': President Biden counts reasons why one may need assault weapons||After declaring gun violence as an epidemic in the country on Thursday, US President Joe Biden reiterated the need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in the country. The President said there is no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine.“We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country. There’s no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine. None,” Biden tweeted through the official account of the POTUS (President of the United States).We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country. There’s no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine. None.Biden has repeatedly called for gun control actions and removing liability protection for the gun manufacturers is at the top of his legislative priorities. "The only industry in America, a billion-dollar industry, that can't be sued,” the news agency ANI quoted Biden as saying.“I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one. But even here, there’s much more common ground than some would have us believe,” POTUS on Friday tweeted with a video.In the video, the President ensured the people that every proposal is in line with the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment, one of the ten amendments of the US constitution comprising the Bill of Rights speaks about the right of people to keep and bear Arms.“Everything that is being proposed today is totally consistent with the Second Amendment. I know that when overwhelming majorities of Americans want to see something change, that will affect their lives, and it still doesn’t change, it can be demoralizing to our fellow citizens. It can feel like our entire political process is broken,” Biden said in the video.Also Read | US advised not to rush Afghanistan peace settlementAssuring the Americans of their safety, he said the government will fulfil its first responsibility, which is to protect the people. Citing the example of the Brady Bill, he assured that the government will get the gun control laws passed. “It took five years to get the Brady bill passed and it took even more years to work to pass the assault weapons ban and it saved lives. No matter how long it takes we are going to get these passed,” he said.The Brady Bill, which was signed into law in 1993 requires the gun buyers to wait for five business days while the authorities perform a background check. The law mandates federal background checks on prospective firearms buyers.In March, the House passed two legislations, one that would require background checks on all gun buyers and extend the time for the FBI to vet those flagged by the national instant check system. The other measure will mandate firearms buyers purchasing from private sellers online or from shows to get their background checked before receiving the weapon, reported New York Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/none-president-biden-counts-reasons-why-one-may-need-assault-weapons-101617938984467.html

Kyaw Zwar Minn said he was barred from entering the embassy on Wednesday evening by diplomats loyal to the military regime.Last month, the ambassador had called for the release of Myanmar’s democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained when the military seized power on February 1.A statement read on Kyaw Zwar Minn’s behalf outside the embassy in London on Thursday said the embassy building had been “seized by the military attache yesterday evening. The ambassador has been locked out since then”.British foreign secretary Dominic Raab condemned the “bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime”, and praised the ambassador’s “courage”.Daily protests demanding a return of democracy have rocked the country and brought a brutal response from the armed forces, with almost 600 civilians reportedly killed.US blacklists state-run gems enterpriseThe US treasury department on Thursday imposed sanctions on a Myanmar state-owned gems enterprise in a bid to curtail the military junta’s ability to generate revenues. The move is the latest from the Biden administration targeting the generals.Myanma Gems Enterprise, part of the country’s vital mining ministry, has been placed on the treasury department’s special designated nationals list, the statement said.Also, the Myanmar military arrested leading actor, model and heartthrob Paing Takhon in a dawn raid at his mother’s home in Yangon. The 24-year-old star had been active in the protest movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outcry-as-myanmar-s-uk-envoy-is-shown-the-door-101617936038799.html
09-04-2021||World||US advised not to rush Afghanistan peace settlement||As the Afghanistan government prepares for peace talks, it is hoping the US will adopt a “conditions-based” approach instead of a time-bound framework for its dealings with the Taliban, people familiar with developments have said.Afghan government representatives and the Taliban are expected to hold talks in Istanbul on April 16 as part of the US administration’s fresh push to put in place a ceasefire and create conditions for a transition in Kabul. The talks are part of a four-point plan outlined in a letter sent by US secretary of state Antony Blinken to President Ashraf Ghani in February.“The US should adopt a conditions-based approach with the Taliban and not a time-bound approach. The agreement signed by the Trump administration imposed conditions with huge consequences on the Afghan side, which wasn’t even party to the agreement signed last year,” one of the people cited above said. “More time is needed to address the security situation and anyway, the Afghan forces are now in the lead in the operations being conducted on the ground.”The Afghan side believes there has been no change in the attitude of the Taliban, which is behind assassinations and bombings that have claimed scores of lives. “The Taliban have also not cut their links with al-Qaeda or other foreign groups operating in Afghanistan as they were required to do under the agreement with the US,” said the second person.“The removal of sanctions and other restrictions on the Taliban has also reduced the leverage that can be used against them,” the first person added. The US also plans to ask the UN to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of India, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and US to forge a unified approach for a settlement in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-advised-not-to-rush-afghanistan-peace-settlement-101617936077144.html

Brazil's outbreak is spiraling out of control, with vaccines in short supply and Bolsonaro fighting lockdowns.The public healthcare system has shown growing signs of buckling under the caseload, and a survey by the National Association of Private Hospitals (ANAHP) this week suggests even the richest hospitals are running short on critical medicine.Three out of four private hospitals said they have a week or less of supplies for treating Covid-19, including oxygen, anesthesia and essential drugs for intubation, according to the ANAHP survey of 88 member hospitals across Brazil.Bolsonaro's government has minimized the risk of hospitals running out of medicine, as the right-wing leader tries to allay fears of the virus, while railing against state and local efforts to restrict movement."Let's not cry over spilled milk. We're still going through a pandemic that, in part, is being used politically - not to defeat the virus but to bring down the president," Bolsonaro said in a public address on Wednesday. "In what country on earth do people not die? Unfortunately, people die everywhere."Brazil's Senate plans to set up a special committee next week to investigate the government's response to the pandemic, Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco said.A Supreme Court judge ruled on Thursday that the Senate must proceed with installing the committee, which Pacheco had sought to delay despite already having been approved by a sufficient number of senators.While stating he would comply with the court order, Pacheco said it was too early to investigate while Brazil was still dealing with the crisis and that the committee would put members' health at risk as its meetings are held in-person.More than 345,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Brazil, making it the second-deadliest outbreak after the United States, whose population is about 50% greater at about 330 million.Brazil's Supreme Court also ruled on Thursday that state and municipal bans on religious gatherings were legal, in a blow to Bolsonaro, who has called them an attack on religious freedom.As Brazil suffers the worst of the pandemic, the country has become a testing ground for new vaccines.Health regulator Anvisa on Thursday approved the fifth late-stage trial for a coronavirus vaccine, greenlighting a study by Canada's Medicago R&D Inc and GlaxoSmithKline PLC .Anvisa said the companies were authorized to conduct phase 3 trials in Brazil. The companies are recruiting around 3,500 Brazilian volunteers for the study, which will include some 30,000 people, in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-sets-record-daily-covid-19-deaths-bolsonaro-s-government-to-face-probe-101617933008613.html
09-04-2021||World||South Korea says its ship, captain detained in Iran have been released||Iran on Friday released a South Korean-flagged tanker it seized amid a dispute over billions in frozen oil funds, and the vessel's captain, the foreign ministry in Seoul said.The Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps seized the Hankuk Chemi and its multinational crew of 20 sailors in January, but South Korea's foreign ministry said in a statement that its detention had been lifted and "the ship departed safely today".At the time of the seizure Tehran accused the vessel of "repeated infringement of maritime environmental laws".The move came after Tehran had urged Seoul to release billions of dollars of Iranian assets frozen in South Korea under US sanctions over its nuclear programme.Tehran said in February that all the crew except the captain would be allowed to leave the country as a humanitarian gesture, but most of them remained on board to maintain the ship.Iran was a key oil supplier to resource-poor South Korea until Washington's rules blocked the purchases, and Tehran says it has a total of $7 billion of funds blocked in Seoul.South Korea had said in February it agreed on a way forward to release billions of dollars frozen from Iran's oil sales -- but was awaiting Washington's approval.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month signalled Washington would be opposed to releasing the money unless the Islamic republic returned to full compliance with the nuclear accord that the United States withdrew from under president Donald Trump.South Korea's foreign ministry made no mention of the funds in its statement Friday.But multiple South Korean media reports say Prime Minister Chung Sye-kyun will visit Tehran soon, without giving a date for the trip.Tehran has repeatedly denied that the seizure of the vessel was linked to the funds issue.The Hankuk Chemi incident was the first seizure of a major vessel by Iran's naval forces in more than a year.In July 2019, the Guards seized the British-flagged oil tanker Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz for allegedly ramming a fishing boat. They released it two months later.At the time it was widely seen as a tit-for-tat move after authorities in the British overseas territory of Gibraltar detained an Iranian tanker and later released it, despite US objections.Tehran denied the two cases were related.The Guards seized at least six other ships in 2019 over alleged fuel smuggling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-says-its-ship-captain-detained-in-iran-have-been-released-101617934180862.html

A total of 31.8 million people across the United Kingdom have had at least one dose, while 6.1 million people have had two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-rollout-in-england-prevented-10-400-deaths-by-march-end-study-101617933025463.html
09-04-2021||World||Britain reassures on AstraZeneca after advising under-30s take other vaccines||British officials and ministers sought to shore up confidence in AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine on Thursday, saying advice that most people under 30 should be offered alternative shots was not unusual and would not impact the pace of rollout.A pharmacist whose brother died from a brain blood clot linked to the AstraZeneca shot was among those calling for people to keep getting it, saying the doses would save lives.Officials said the suggestion that under-30s should be offered an alternative did not reflect any serious safety concerns, just a "vanishingly" rare possible side effect.Anthony Harnden, Deputy Chairman of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) which issued the new advice, said such suggestions were not unusual, pointing out that people of different ages already got different flu shots in Britain."This isn't unusual. So this is not undermining what the regulators are saying. The regulators are saying this vaccine is suitable for all age groups but it's up to the individual countries to decide how best to deploy those vaccines," he told Reuters in an interview.While Britain's MHRA medicine regulator did not place age restrictions on the use of the AstraZeneca shot, some saw the JCVI's advice about under-30s, made in the same briefing, as mixed messaging.Conservative lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith said the announcement was "ridiculous" and that there was "the dangerous potential" that people would refuse to have AstraZeneca's shot.Health minister Matt Hancock defended the move, saying the transparency over possible side effects, even very rare ones, should bolster confidence in the system.Britain has continued to use its homegrown AstraZeneca vaccine since it became the first country to start rolling it out at the start of January. Some countries in Europe, including France, restricted its use in older people initially, citing a lack of data, and are now limiting its use in older people.Harnden said Wednesday's announcement had not been taken lightly and it had been right to keep using the shot, even if the advice was now changing."Stopping and starting and changing vaccination programmes is not an easy thing to do, and if you do it, it runs the danger of losing confidence in that programme," he said.Still on trackBritain is leaning on AstraZeneca for a large portion of its vaccine supply, with 100 million doses ordered.But it has also has been rolling out vaccines made by Pfizer, since December, and Moderna since Wednesday. Shots made by Johnson & Johnson and Novavax are also pending regulatory approval in the coming months.Hancock said that with 40 million Pfizer and 17 million Moderna vaccines ordered, there was more than enough shots to cover the 8.5 million people under-30s who needed to be vaccinated. Healthy under-30s are in the last priority cohort to be vaccinated, with most not eligible until the summer."We feel that we've got enough vaccine supply to be able to offer (an) alternative vaccine, without delaying the progress of our immunisations," JCVI's Harnden said, adding Britain was on track to give a first shot of vaccine to all adults by the end of July."It may slip by a week or two, but no more than that," he said.The advice did not change for under-30s who have underlying conditions and are eligible for shots now, meaning only very few people who are due to have a shot in the coming days will be affected by the advice change.Alison Astles, a pharmacist whose 59-year-old brother died of a blood clot on the brain on Sunday, encouraged people to still get their AstraZeneca shots even though it was "very strongly suggested" his death was due to the shot."The sister in me still feels absolutely furious and very angry that this has happened to my brother... But despite what has happened to Neil, and the impact on our family, I still strongly believe that people should go ahead and have the vaccine," she said."Overall, we will save more lives by people having the vaccine than not."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-reassures-on-astrazeneca-after-advising-under-30s-take-other-vaccines-101617929115528.html
09-04-2021||World||Iran says talks switch to lifting US sanctions in one step||Iran’s chief negotiator at nuclear talks in Vienna said the sides were focusing on removing US sanctions in a single step, in a statement of progress that didn’t specify what Tehran was offering in return.“We are negotiating the removal of sanctions all at once, specifying which sanctions and how, their details. All of these have to be precisely clarified,” Abbas Araghchi, who’s leading Iran’s team of negotiators, said on Thursday.The U.S. has so far ruled out unilaterally removing sanctions in order to get Iran to return to enrichment parameters set by the 2015 agreement. The Islamic Republic says Washington must move first as it was the party that abrogated the deal.In Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price declined to respond directly to the Iranian claim but said the Biden administration’s position remains that the U.S. will remove sanctions only after Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear deal. He said the response “would include lifting sanctions that are inconsistent” with the nuclear accord but declined to say whether that would encompass removing sanctions tied to what the U.S. considers Iran’s support of terrorism.At the same time, Price said the discussions had made progress.“These talks have been constructive,” he said. “Maximalist demands probably are not going to get us very far.”After former President Donald Trump broke away from the landmark nuclear deal and imposed a tough sanctions regime on Iran’s economy in 2018, the Islamic Republic started to gradually increase its activity beyond the limits defined in the agreement.Iran, the European Union, China, Russia and the U.S. have gathered in the Austrian capital to try to end a crisis over the deal’s future, and are scheduled to reconvene on Friday. Iran and the U.S. have said they will not have any direct discussions or contact during the negotiations.“In our view, America has to take its actions in one step, then we’ll verify, and then Iran will follow with its own actions,” Araghchi said. “How verification will happen is another point of our discussion.”This week, India expressed interest in resuming oil imports from Iran once sanctions are eased, with refiners starting to prepare for that possibility, according to a senior oil ministry representative. China, meanwhile, has boosted its purchases from the nation to about 1 million barrels a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-talks-switch-to-lifting-us-sanctions-in-one-step-101617928440398.html

The shooting happened in the bays in a plant where employees make cabinets.Buske said a motive in the shooting was not clear.The shooter was gone by the time officers arrived, Buske said.Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell said a male suspect in the shooting was arrested in the tiny town of Iola, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away from the cabinet plant.The state trooper who was shot while pursuing the suspect was is in serious but stable condition, the Texas Department of Public Safety said on Twitter.Kent Moore Cabinets employees were being interviewed, Bryan Police Lt. Jason James said earlier, and witnesses had identified a suspect. Police were looking for the suspected shooter, James said, but he could not describe that person.“At this site, when law enforcement showed up it was already over with,” James said.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has sent agents and dogs to the scene of the shooting, said spokesman Deon Washington.Police asked people to stay away from the business during the investigation.Bryan is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Houston that sits on the doorstep of Texas A&M University. The city of more than 86,000 residents is a market, industrial and medical center for the middle Brazos River valley with a economy centered on the university in adjacent College Station and its related agribusiness; computers, research and development. It also is the seat of Brazos County.Kent Moore Cabinets is headquartered in Bryan and employs more than 600 people across the state, according to the company’s website. The company makes custom cabinets and has design centers in neighboring College Station and nearly a dozen Texas cities.A person who answered the phone Thursday at Kent Moore Cabinets’ headquarters said she could not provide any information on the shooting.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott offered prayers for shooting victims and their families.“I have been working closely with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers as they assist local law enforcement on a swift response to this criminal act.

Once the doses are produced, it is up to each member state to administer the vaccines, Breton said, adding that he was in contact with all EU countries who are "doing the right things" to make sure people will get vaccinated.He said that he had confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it is a "good vaccine," adding, it's "extremely important that all of our fellow citizens understand that we are extremely cautious...and when we give it (a vaccine) the green light, we can go."On the subject of whether the bloc would use Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, he said the approval was in the hands of European medical regulators. But he said even if it was approved, it wouldn't change the situation in Europe immediately."Our citizens believed maybe at the beginning that you order and you get, the following day, the vaccine. No, it doesn't happen like that, you need at least 10 to 12 months to transform the facility to adapt to the vaccine. When it will be approved, you will need maybe another 10 months," he explained.According to the World Health Organization's dashboard, as many as 46,694,768 Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-on-track-for-herd-immunity-from-covid-19-by-mid-july-says-vaccine-chief-101617925168423.html

09-04-2021||World||‘It’s an epidemic’: US President Joe Biden announces gun control rules||US President Joe Biden on Thursday announced limited gun control reforms through six actions in the aftermath of three deadly mass shootings -- including the killing of Asian Americans in Atlanta and shoppers at a grocery store in Colorado in recent months -- calling the divisive issue an “epidemic and an international embarrassment”.“Gun violence in this country is an epidemic. We say it again, gun violence in this country is an epidemic,” Biden said at a White House event to announce the executive actions, in the presence of survivors of gun violence and relatives of victims. “And it’s an international embarrassment,” he added.The Justice Department will be required to propose a rule within the next 30 days to stop the proliferation of “ghost guns” that are bought in parts and can be assembled into a weapon within 30 minutes, according to one of the actions.The next will ask the Justice Department to announce a rule that will subject stabilisation braces, which can turn pistols into mini rifles, to registration under the more stringent National Firearms Act. Authorities say the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, shootings last month -- in which 10 people were killed -- used a pistol with an arm brace that made the weapon more stable and accurate.The Justice Department will also be required to publish a model “red flag” legislation for states, allowing for a person to be denied access to firearms if petitioned by family members or police. The remaining two actions called for increased investment in evidence-based community violence intervention and the publication of an annual report on firearm trafficking, which has not been done since 2000.But Thursday’s announcement underscores the limitations of Biden’s executive power to act on guns. His orders tighten regulations on homemade guns and provide more resources for gun-violence prevention but fall far short of the sweeping gun-control agenda he laid out on the campaign trail.These actions also do not address the issue of assault rifles, which have been used most commonly in mass shootings in the US.The President is backing a legislation passed recently by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives that seeks to expand background checks for gun deals, cover transactions made on the internet, and close certain loopholes in the current laws.He called for the passage of the bill on Thursday.“This is not a partisan issue among the American people,” Biden insisted.“Every day in this country 360 people are shot, every single day 106 of them die, every day,” Biden said, reeling off numbers. “Our flag was still flying at half-staff for the victims of the horrific murder, primarily Asian American people in Georgia … 10 more lives were taken in a mass murder in Colorado.”A gunman last month killed eight people, including six Asian women, at spas during a string of shootings in the Atlanta area.“You probably didn’t hear between those points in less than one week apart more than 850 additional shootings; 850, that took the lives of more than 250 people and left 500 injured. This is an epidemic, for God’s sake, and it has to stop,” he said.While Biden asserted that he’s “willing to work with anyone to get it done,” gun control measures face slim prospects in an evenly divided Senate, where Republicans remain near-unified against most proposals.Biden announced the measures alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Merrick Garland, who Biden said would prioritise gun violence as head of the Department of Justice.“We’ve had more tragedy than we can bear,” Harris said, adding: “People on both sides of the aisle want action .... So all that is left is the will and the courage to act.”The US has experienced a significant number of deadly mass shootings at schools and other public venues for decades. Nearly 40,000 Americans die each year from shootings.The US Constitution’s Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, and state attempts to limit who can buy guns or how they can carry them have been challenged in court by pro-gun lobby groups.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-an-epidemic-us-president-joe-biden-announces-gun-control-rules-101617918283845.html
