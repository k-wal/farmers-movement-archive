President Joe Biden wants to rejoin the deal, however, and there is a US delegation in Vienna taking part in indirect talks with Iran, with diplomats from the other world powers acting as go-betweens.The deal promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. The reimposition of American sanctions has left the country's economy reeling, and Tehran has reacted by steadily increasing its violations of the restrictions of the deal, such as increasing the purity of uranium it enriches and its stockpiles, in a thus-far unsuccessful effort to pressure the other countries to provide relief.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it doesn’t want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.The comments from Zarif, who himself helped negotiate the original 2015 nuclear deal, have the potential to complicate the Vienna talks, which are currently focused on how the US would roll back its sanctions — and which ones — and how Iran would return to compliance.In the interview, reviewed by The Associated Press, Zarif describes Russia as wanting to stop the nuclear deal before it was struck under the Obama administration in 2015, suggesting Moscow wanted to keep Iran at odds with the West.Iran's Foreign Ministry has called the leak of the recording “illegal,” but hasn't disputed its authenticity.The Vienna talks began in early April, and there have been several rounds of high-level discussions, while expert groups have been working on proposals on how to resolve the issues around American sanctions and Iranian compliance, as well as the “possible sequencing” of the U.S. return.The comments from Zarif are just the latest complication that the diplomats have to deal with.Among other things, an attack suspected to have been carried out by Israel recently struck Iran’s Natanz nuclear site, causing an unknown amount of damage.Tehran retaliated by beginning to enrich a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, its highest level ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-talks-resume-in-vienna-amid-new-complications-101619542342814.html
27-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Spain to impose 10-day quarantine on travellers from India||Spain said Tuesday it will impose a 10-day quarantine on all travellers arriving from India in response to the emergence of a fast-spreading coronavirus variant in the country.The measure, which will take effect on Wednesday, will apply to people who travelled via third countries since there are no direct flights between India and Spain, government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said."This is a measure which our country has already adopted towards passengers from countries where a virus variant has been found," she told a news conference following a weekly cabinet meeting.Spain has imposed a 10-day quarantine on passengers arriving from Brazil, Peru, and Colombia as well as nine nations in Africa including South Africa and Mozambique.Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya announced that Spain would later this week send more than seven tonnes of medical aid to India to help it deal with its surge in Covid-19 infections.Spain has also been hard-hit by the pandemic, recording nearly 78,000 deaths from around 3.5 million cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-spain-to-impose-10-day-quarantine-on-travellers-from-india-101619542214711.html
27-04-2021||World||France, Germany plan billions in Covid-19 pandemic recovery spending||France and Germany together laid out plans for billions in spending from the European Union's pandemic recovery fund aimed at fighting climate change and boosting the use of digital technology across the economy.The finance ministers of the EU's two biggest economies on Tuesday underlined their joint determination to use the spending to transform Europe's economy and get the continent growing again as it lags behind the US and China in rebounding from the pandemic recession.Under the fund's formula, France should get around 40 billion euros ($48 billion) while German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said his country planned about 30 billion euros ($36 billion) in spending. Scholz said that half the money would go to environmentally friendly projects and a quarter to spreading the use of digital technology. He said the fund would build on domestic relief and stimulus measures already passed by the German governmentHe called the fund “a groundbreaking step for Europe.”French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire urged the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, to quickly evaluate the plans so that money can start flowing to members states from the 750 billion euro ($906 billion) fund as early as July, noting that the U.S. and China have recovered faster. He said that since the fund was approved “we have lost too much time” and that “Europe must remain in the race.” Last year, France’s economy shrank by 8.3% amid the virus crisis, the worst slump since World War II, according to national statistics institute INSEE.They said the new spending, funded by shared debt, would avoid mistakes made in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and recession, when countries focused excessively on cutting spending and closing deficits. Le Maire said “today the priority is clearly to invest massively, not to consolidate public finances. We have drawn lessons from the past.”Spain’s Cabinet also approved its proposal for how it wants to invest the recovery funds. Spain, which has suffered heavily from the pandemic, is set to receive 140 billion euros ($166 billion) — half in direct payments and the other half in loans — from the EU's recovery plan, second only to Italy. In line with EU priorities, Spain’s left-wing government has placed a heavy emphasis on creating a greener economy while boosting productivity for an economy that shrunk by 11% last year.The money comes with pressure from Brussels to address problems identified by the European Commission's review of members states' economic policies. Spain, for instance, is being asked to overhaul labor laws, tax practices and pensions. Countries with low tax regimes such as Ireland or Cyprus are under pressure to discourage aggressive tax planning by multinational companies.Italy's 221.1 billion euro ($267.3 billion) recovery plan includes steps to reduce its backlog of court cases, considered a drag on businesses that can't get commercial disputes resolved quickly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-germany-plan-billions-in-covid-19-pandemic-recovery-spending-101619537352999.html
27-04-2021||World||Fully vaccinated Americans can go unmasked outdoors, CDC says||Fully-vaccinated Americans can be unmasked when exercising, dining and socializing outdoors in small groups, federal health officials said, and can gather indoors with other fully vaccinated people and family members without masks or social distancing.But masks should remain on anywhere there’s a large gathering, including ballparks, malls or church, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday. And the agency urged that vaccinated people be mindful around those with a higher risk for severe illness.“Today is another day we can take a step back to the normalcy of before,” Rochelle Walensky, the CDC chief, said at a news briefing announcing the changes. She cited a “really hopeful decline” of about 21% in the 7-day average for cases.The new recommendations, which represent one of the most significant relaxations of guidelines since the pandemic began, are complex and wide-ranging. They come with almost 30% of Americans fully inoculated and with increases in the daily Covid-19 caseload starting to slow. Many public-health experts have advocated the change, saying it follows the science.Under the new rules, fully vaccinated people can attend a small outdoor gathering maskless or dine at an outdoor restaurant with others, whether they’re fully vaccinated or not. They can also get together indoors with unvaccinated people of any age from one other household without masks or social distancing, according to the agency.Additionally, inoculated Americans don’t need to be isolated or get tested if they’ve been around someone with Covid-19, unless they have symptoms. If so, get tested and stay home, the agency urges.But the guidance also includes some reservations.The CDC urges all Americans to wear masks when attending medium or large-size gatherings, such as live performances or sporting events, and during visits to malls and full-capacity places of worship. And the agency encourages people to be mindful when around those with an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19, including those with diabetes and some types of cancer, lung or kidney disease.“You will still need to follow guidance at your workplace,” the CDC said, adding that the fully vaccinated “should continue to follow guidance to protect themselves and others, including wearing a well-fitted mask, when indoors or in an outdoor setting or venue where masks are required.”You’re considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the final vaccine dose of the two-dose vaccines made by Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc., or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.It’s long been understood that indoor environments present the highest risk of virus transmission. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, spreads largely through aerosolized viral particles. The size of a space, how many people are in it, length of exposure and air circulation all factor into how easily viral particles might spread.Infection OddsThe odds of infection are much smaller in outdoor settings, but numerous factors, such as social distancing, vaccination status and duration of face-to-face exposure can play a role in determining the likelihood of transmission.In recent weeks, a growing chorus of public-health advocates and medical experts have been calling for the US to relax its rules on outdoor masking.Earlier this month, the New England Journal of Medicine published a blog questioning whether it’s time to do away with such mandates written by Paul Sax, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.Follow the ScienceFormer Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wrote in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday that the Biden administration should end outdoor mask edicts.“I think it’s best when public health mandates come out that they really follow the science,” he said. “Transmission doesn’t happen when people are outdoors by themselves walking around.” He still recommends wearing masks outdoors if you’re not vaccinated, having a face-to-face conversation with someone you don’t know, or in a crowded place.“For awhile, the mask outdoors has been more a marker of supporting public health,” he said. “Covid isn’t going away any time soon, so we have to find ways we can live with it more easily. Not wearing masks when you are outdoors by yourself could be one thing that could help with that.”However, other health experts say outdoor mask wearing can contribute to a sense of social solidarity in combating the virus, and are a visual reminder of the need for caution even as vaccinations increase and illness recedes.“There’s no clear rule that can be applied,” said Krystal Pollitt, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health. “There are so many things to take into consideration to best evaluate risk. We still need to be vigilant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fully-vaccinated-americans-can-go-unmasked-outdoors-cdc-says-101619541634561.html

27-04-2021||World||Russian court restricts activities of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption foundation||A court in Moscow ruled Tuesday to restrict the activities of an organization founded by imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny pending a decision on whether it should be outlawed as an extremist group.The Moscow City Court's ruling on Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption came amid a sweeping crackdown on Russian President Vladimir Putin most prominent critic, his allies and his political infrastructure.The Moscow prosecutor’s office petitioned the court this month to label the foundation and Navalny's network of regional offices as extremist groups and effectively outlaw their activities, exposing members and supporters to lengthy prison terms.If the court grants the request, it would be a crippling blow to Navalny's beleaguered team. He has been in prison since January, and many of his aides and associates were arrested or face criminal charges.On Monday, the prosecutor's office ordered Navalny's offices in dozens of Russian regions to suspend their activities, prompting them to effectively shut down. The Tuesday ruling on the foundation just barred it from performing certain activities.Ivan Pavlov, a lawyer representing the foundation, said the organization is no longer allowed to use the media or the internet to distribute content or to organize rallies and public events, take part in elections or use bank deposits.Restrictions on the foundation, however, will not disrupt its work, director Ivan Zhdanov said on social media, arguing that most of the restrictions don't apply to the anti-corruption organization's activities.“Some nonsense,” Zhdanov tweeted. “(These) aren't going to influence our work in any way.”Navalny’s foundation opened 10 years ago and has since targeted high-ranking Russian officials with exposes on corruption, many in the form of colorful and widely watched YouTube videos.One of its latest posts, which has received 116 million views, alleges that a lavish palace on the Black Sea shore was built for Putin through an elaborate corruption scheme. The Kremlin has denied there are any links to Putin. TheAlong with the foundation, Navalny set up a vast network of regional offices in dozens of Russian regions when he was campaigning to run against Putin in the 2018 presidential election. He eventually was barred from running but kept the infrastructure in place.The regional sites began their own investigations of graft by local officials and recruited activists, some of whom later ran for public offices themselves. The locations also were instrumental in organizing nationwide rallies in support of Navalny this year.Navalny himself was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject.The arrest triggered protests across Russia that proved to be the biggest show of defiance in years. However, they didn’t stop authorities from putting Navalny on trial for violating the terms of a suspended sentence while he was in Germany. The sentence stemmed from a 2014 embezzlement conviction widely that Navalny has characterized as politically motivated. He was ordered to serve 2½ years in prison and last month was transferred to a penal colony notorious for its harsh conditions.The foundation and the regional offices have been targeted regularly with raids, fines and detentions of activists before, but the extremism petition takes the pressure to a new level, Navalny's allies have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-court-restricts-activities-of-navalny-s-anti-corruption-foundation-101619528207576.html

27-04-2021||World||Full Covid-19 lockdown adds to financial strain in Turkey||As cases and deaths soar, Turkey’s president has instructed people to stay home for nearly three weeks and shut down many businesses as part of the country's strictest Covid-19 measures yet.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan did not announce a stimulus package to offset the economic impact of the new restrictions. With Turkey's double digit inflation, sinking national currency and businesses in trouble, many Turks already have been struggling financially.Gozde Aslan, a newspaper seller in Istanbul, said the lockdown would be difficult to weather.“We have to bring food to our homes, and we live in a period where everything is very expensive,” she said. “May God help us.”Erdogan announced Monday that a “full lockdown” would begin Thursday and last until May 17. Residents will be required to stay home except for grocery shopping and other essential needs, while intercity travel only will be allowed with permission. Restaurants are allowed to deliver food.Some businesses and industries will be exempt from the shutdown, including factories, agriculture, health care and supply chain and logistics companies. The Interior Ministry also published a list of exempt individuals, who include parliament members, health care workers, law enforcement officers and many others.Aslan’s husband and business partner, Baris, said the Turkish government's decision came late but was correct. He added: “It’s a very difficult decision for the shopkeepers, for the working people. For this, the state should provide great assistance.”Earlier this month, Erdogan announced an extension of short labor payments for registered workers whose hours were cut due to pandemic restrictions. Some payments previously were made to small businesses.Shoe store manager Burcin Yilmaz lamented that he would again have to shut his business. During the past three months, several baerby shops that had been open a long time shut down for good, he said..“We have to close down and wait and see what happens in the end,” Yilmaz said.Erdogan said daily confirmed cases would have to rapidly drop below 5,000 for Turkey “to not be left behind” as many European countries start reopening."Otherwise, we will inevitably face a heavy price in every area, from tourism to trade and education,” the president said.Opposition lawmakers blasted the government Tuesday. The leader of the main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, called on Erdogan to propose a social aid package that would help closed businesses and day laborers in Turkey’s informal economies. He also said urged the suspension of debt enforcement proceedings for some time.While agreeing with the necessity of a lockdown, Kilicdaroglu said, “People need to eat. They need to live.”The government has been distributing tons of onions and potatoes this month with much fanfare. Many see it as a clear example of how much Turks are suffering from rising food prices and poverty. The World Bank, in a report published Tuesday, said Turkey's poverty levels rose from 10.2 percent in 2019 to 12.2 percent in 2020.In March, the Turkish government split the country into four risk tiers and lifted weekend curfews and allowed indoor dining in many provinces. Coronavirus infections rose again before long, putting most Turkish cities into “very high-risk” categories.Facing record numbers of confirmed cases, Erdogan in mid-April announced a partial lockdown during the month of Ramadan, bringing back weekend curfews, extending evening curfew hours and closing down restaurants for in-person dining.Confirmed cases averaged around 60,000 per day during the peak week this month. The country recorded its highest daily death toll on April 21, with 362.The latest Health Ministry statistics reported Monday showed 37,312 new confirmed cases and 353 deaths. Turkey's total death toll in the pandemic stands at 38,711.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/full-covid-19-lockdown-adds-to-financial-strain-in-turkey-101619525046579.html
27-04-2021||World||Iran orders probe into leaked Zarif audio 'conspiracy'||Iran's president has ordered a probe into the "conspiracy" of leaked audio in which the foreign minister says the military was too influential in diplomacy, a government spokesman announced Tuesday.President Hassan Rouhani ordered the investigation to identify who leaked the "stolen" three-hour-long recording by top diplomat and member of his moderate government Mohammad Javad Zarif, the spokesman said.The tape, which comes ahead of presidential elections in June, has dominated the discussion in the Islamic republic since its publication by media outlets outside Iran on Sunday."We believe this theft of documents is a conspiracy against the government, the system, the integrity of effective domestic institutions, and also against our national interests," government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters."The president has ordered the intelligence ministry to identify the agents of this conspiracy," he added.The file was "stolen for clear reasons", he said, without elaborating further.Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not deny the authenticity of the recording but said on Monday that it was cut from a seven-hour interview that included "personal opinions".Zarif did not comment on the controversy, but published on Tuesday a brief audio message on Instagram, saying "I believe you should not work for history... I say that don't worry about history so much, but worry about God and the people".He did not specify when he recorded this message.The leaked remarks sparked harsh criticism from conservative media and politicians, with the mention of Iran's slain general Qasem Soleimani hitting a nerve.Soleimani, considered one of the prominent architects of Iranian regional policy, was killed early last year in an American drone strike in Baghdad, ordered by former US president Donald Trump.The leak and probe come ahead of presidential elections on June 18, which will see the moderate Rouhani step down after two terms in office and after conservatives fared well in parliamentary elections last year.'Character assassination'The ultra-conservative Vatan-e Emrooz newspaper published a large black and white picture of Zarif on its front page, with the headline "Despicable" written in red."Diplomacy must follow the path of increasing the system's power," it said, criticising Zarif's comments regarding the military.It added that his stance confirmed that "America's constant demand about negotiating Iran's regional power and missile capabilities" stemmed from Iranian diplomats' "wishes and cooperation with this demand".Javan daily said Soleimani was "physically assassinated (upon) the order of the most wretched creature of the world... America's president".But Zarif had "assassinated (Soleimani's) character".Ultra-conservative Kayhan daily inferred that the audio may have been leaked by Rouhani's government to force "Zarif into (political) suicide" in a bid to save itself from the judgement of "public opinion".It said Zarif, while being "sacrificed like a simple pawn", had broken rules of "confidentiality" and provided Iran's enemies with "intelligence and ammunition" for their psychological war against the country.For their part, the reformist papers sought to question which faction stood to gain from the leak.Shargh daily on its front page wrote "Who leaked it, who benefited?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-orders-probe-into-leaked-zarif-audio-conspiracy-101619520977150.html

Apple will have the chance to argue its case against any EU suspicions before regulators take a final decision. The EU is also probing Apple over e-books and payments.Spotify complained in 2019 that Apple unfairly squeezes its music streaming service with ever-changing rules and a large sales commission on the app store. It has said it was forced to “artificially” increase monthly subscriptions for its premium service to cover the extra costs.Apple’s regulatory woes have intensified in recent months as software developers criticize the the levies Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google charge outside developers for using their digital distribution platforms. App executives urged the U.S. Senate last week to tackle Apple’s control over the App Store.Apple declined to comment on the EU probe, referring to a 2019 blog post where it said Spotify was trying to keep “substantial revenue that they draw from the App Store’s customers without making any contributions to that marketplace.”The European Commission also declined to comment and Spotify didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The Financial Times reported earlier on the EU’s complaint against Apple.The EU is separately fighting Apple’s victory in a 13 billion-euro ($15.7 billion) tax dispute, in an effort to restore a landmark decision that took aim at Apple’s taxation structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-set-to-get-eu-antitrust-complaint-over-spotify-101619519432174.html
27-04-2021||World||Myanmar’s junta rebuffs Asean plan to end violence||Myanmar’s military government rebuffed a plan by Southeast Asian leaders to help end violence in the country, saying any “suggestions” would need to fit with the junta’s stated roadmap and come after “stability” is restored.Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, including coup chief Min Aung Hlaing, appeared to reach a five-point “consensus” on Myanmar during a special summit in Jakarta on Saturday that included an “immediate cessation of violence” following the military takeover on Feb. 1. It also said the bloc would appoint an envoy to mediate talks between “all parties” in Myanmar.But in a press release on Monday, the military’s State Administration Council only said the “suggestions” made by Asean leaders “would be positively considered” if they facilitate the junta’s own platform and “served the interest of the country.”“Myanmar informed the meeting that it will give careful consideration to constructive suggestions made by Asean leaders when the situation returns to stability in the country since priorities at the moment were to maintain law and order and to restore community peace and tranquility,” the junta said in the release, which was also presented to the Asean Secretariat in Jakarta.The Myanmar statement lowers expectations that the dialogue process will prompt the military to release Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained civilian leaders, or alter a plan to hold a fresh election in early 2022 following a yearlong period of emergency rule. The move to appoint a special envoy is unusual for Asean, which traditionally has avoided direct interventions into domestic political disputes, and had been welcomed by Myanmar’s opposition.Armed AttackOn Tuesday, an armed ethnic group in Myanmar known as the Karen National Liberation Army seized a military outpost near the Thai border in a sign civil conflict will continue even as the junta pledged over the weekend to end the violence.The KNLA, the armed wing of Karen National Union (KNU), -- the oldest ethnic armed group in Myanmar -- attacked a military border post in Thaw Le Hta near Thailand’s northwestern town of Mae Hong Song, resulting in several casualties, Saw Taw Nee, head of KNU’s Foreign Affairs Department, said by phone Tuesday.Since overthrowing the civilian-led government, the junta has killed more than 750 protesters throughout the country with nearly 3,500 others detained or sentenced to prison, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.There was no immediate comment on Tuesday’s attack from the Myanmar military.Saw Taw Nee said more than 30,000 residents have fled to safe zones since the national army, or Tatmadaw, conducted deadly air strikes in March. At the time, fighter jets came out in retaliation for an attack by the group on a military base in which 10 soldiers were killed and another eight were captured.Earlier this month, close allies of Myanmar’s detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi joined with ethnic groups to form a new unity government, escalating the chances of a prolonged conflict with the junta. As part of its formation, members were also pushing for the formation of a union army to take on the military. Saw Taw Nee said at the time that such an army is “essential,” though it would take time as negotiations are ongoing.“The junta is making people live with fear in the mainland as well as in KNU-controlled areas,” he said. “We, the KNU, accept forming the federal army in principle, but it is not realistic it will be formed in a short period of time.”“Only when the rights we are asking for can be guaranteed will the federal army become a reality,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-junta-rebuffs-asean-plan-to-end-violence-101619518564046.html

He said that each of these generators will enhance the capacities of the hospitals by allowing them to produce oxygen for 10 years from ambient air.The French president in Facebook post said that France is aware of India's situation and said that both countries will remain united in these times of crisis. "No one is untouched by the pandemic which we are going through. We know that India is going through a difficult period. France and India have always been united. We remain united to provide our help. France will send medical equipment, ventilators and 8 oxygen generators to India. Each generator will make a hospital self-sufficient for 10 years by producing oxygen from ambient air," Macron said in his post.He also said that solidarity is one of the core principles of France and remains at the center of friendship between both nation. "Solidarity is at the center of our nation. This is also at the center of friendship between our countries. Together we will win," he further added. Macron assured that French ministries are working with several industries to meet India's needs.Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to US president Joe Biden and discussed procurement of materials required for manufacturing and production of vaccines. The United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and Australia will also send oxygen production plant and ventilators to help India's hospitals which are facing a hue crisis due to surge in cases. China, Taiwan and Pakistan have also expressed solidarity with India in its fight against Covid-19. India recorded 323,144 cases on Tuesday which pushed the countries tally to 17,636,307.

27-04-2021||World||Hong Kong to reopen bars, nightclubs for vaccinated residents||Hong Kong will ease social-distancing restrictions by allowing bars, nightclubs and karaoke parlors to re-open and operate past midnight only for vaccinated residents starting Thursday, as the government intensifies efforts to boost the city’s lackluster inoculation drive.Staff and customers must have had received at least a first vaccine dose for the venues to open their doors, Food and Health Secretary Sophia Chan told a briefing on Tuesday. Patrons will need to sign in using Hong Kong’s LeaveHomeSafe app.The new rules will allow bars and nightclubs to remain open until 2am, she said. Tables will be limited to just two people, with four people allowed in karaoke rooms.The government is also studying a new mobile app venues can use identify customers’ vaccination status, Chan said.“This vaccine bubble is a very important public health measure,” Chan said. “We can have a safe relaxation. But on the other hand, we can also mitigate the risk associated with the relaxation.”While vaccine supply is abundant in Hong Kong, only about 11% of the population has gotten vaccinated with at least one dose, amid public distrust of the government and concerns about the efficacy of Chinese vaccines. The low inoculation rates could hamper the city’s efforts to reach the herd immunity crucial to fully reopening, prompting authorities to expand access to all adults and come up with measures favoring the inoculated to encourage more people to get jabs.Restaurants will also be allowed to relax table limits and operating hours if staff are vaccinated, said Chan, but only in designated “zones” for inoculated customers.Measures will be further relaxed for restaurants whose staff have had both vaccine doses and a waiting period afterward of 14 days, Chan said.Capacity at companies’ annual general meetings with shareholders will also be relaxed to 50 people at indoor venues and 100 people at outdoor sites, Chan said. Participants aged 16 and above have to have completed their first vaccine doses, she said.Pubs have been ordered shut since November but some have managed to operate until 10 p.m. by getting a license to serve food, while nightclubs have stayed closed. The ease in measures for those vaccinated comes after Hong Kong announced its long-awaited plans to introduce a quarantine-free travel bubble with Singapore next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-reopen-bars-nightclubs-for-vaccinated-residents-101619513225791.html

Macron has said that while open-air bar and restaurant terraces may reopen in mid-May, indoor venues will not re-open before June, and only in regions where the Covid-19 figures have dropped sufficiently to allow this.(Reporting by Sudip Kar-Gupta; Editing by Andrew Heavens)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frances-macron-expected-to-announce-easing-of-covid-19-rules-in-coming-days-101619508258946.html
27-04-2021||World||Washington DC to loosen Covid-19 restrictions this weekend amid fall in cases||With Covid-19 numbers dropping, officials in the nation's capital are relaxing a number of restrictions after more than a year of lockdown. The changes represent a step toward normality for Washington, DC, residents and long-term hope for the city's vital tourism and convention industry, which has been devastated by the pandemic.Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Monday that starting on May 1, gyms and fitness centers can operate at 50 per cent capacity, and live music will be permitted in gardens and outdoor spaces. Restaurants will be permitted to seat 10 people per table outdoors, up from the previous limit of six per table. However, the 25 per cent capacity limit for indoor dining will remain unchanged for now. Retail businesses can increase admittance from 25 per cent to 50 per cent capacity. Houses of worship can increase to 40 per cent capacity, though Bowser said the government was still encouraging residents to attend virtual or outdoor services for now.Earlier in April, Bowser had announced some other changes that will also take effect in May. These include allowing entertainment venues like concert halls and movie theaters to increase to 25 per cent capacity and allowing public pools to open this summer at 50 per cent capacity. The Smithsonian network of museums had previously announced that several museums and the National Zoo will reopen on a staggered schedule over several weeks during the month of May. The National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, will reopen on May 5. The National Museum of African American History and Culture, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum and Renwick Gallery will reopen on May 14. The National Museum of American History, National Museum of the American Indian and the National Zoo will reopen on May 21.All Smithsonian facilities will required timed entry passes to limit the crowds; the passes are free and available from the Smithsonian website. As of Monday, Washington's daily infection rate has dropped to 14 cases per 100,000, the lowest number since last fall. But Bowser still preached caution, saying residents needed to remain patient as the vaccination programme continued. “The way we get open is to crush the virus and get people vaccinated,” she said. “So we're trying to do all of those things — moderate the restrictions where they're warranted and safe, but really focus on crushing those numbers of infections and getting people vaccinated.” Bowser said that approximately 237,000 residents had received at least one vaccine dose, out of about 500,000 adults in the District of Columbia. The government will also begin offering vaccinations to residents as young as 16, she said. City Health Director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt acknowledged that vaccine reluctance remained an issue, but called on residents to encourage skeptical friends and relatives to take the step. “It's time for people to start having talks with their friends and say, Hey, we're not hanging out with you unless you get vaccinated,'” Nesbitt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-dc-to-loosen-covid-19-restrictions-this-weekend-amid-fall-in-cases-101619512887388.html
27-04-2021||World||France, Germany support US 21% tax plan for corporations||France and Germany support the U.S. proposal of a 21% minimum tax on multinational companies, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire and his German counterpart Olaf Scholz told Le Figaro and Die Zeit in a joint interview released on Tuesday.“If the Biden administration proposes a 21% rate and there is consensus, it would be acceptable for us,” Le Maire is quoted as saying.“It is important that we agree on a percentage -- where exactly that will lie, the talks in the next few weeks will determine,” Scholz said. “Personally I would have nothing against the U.S. proposal.”U.S. President Joe Biden’s administration has proposed combating corporate tax-reduction strategies with a global minimum rate of 21%, and a system for ensuring that the world’s 100 or so biggest companies pay more in places they actually do business.While the broad proposal has received widespread support, after years of talks hosted the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development tried to reach a global deal, the precise tax rate could still be a sticking point.France is also concerned whether the proposal on where the biggest companies pay their taxes would actually cover all the digital giants.“As soon as this summer, we can reach an historical deal,” Le Maire said in the interview, adding that as long as a deal isn’t reached, France will keep its current tax over digital companies. “The change in stance from the Americans is excellent news.”“We have good hope to reach a deal this summer,” Scholz said. “This will change the world because the tax competition is bad for everyone.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-germany-support-us-21-tax-plan-for-corporations-101619512958086.html

27-04-2021||World||US Senate delays bill to strengthen competition with China||A cornerstone of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s legislative package to make the U.S. a stronger competitor against China may be delayed as a key committee postponed consideration of the bill.“It needs some time for consensus to build,” Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, said on Monday. He added that the panel would likely take up the legislation, called the Endless Frontier Act, after the Senate returns in May from a recess.Wicker said more than 200 amendments had been filed. In addition to the complications that would come with dealing with such a large number of proposed changes and additions, some Republican senators had concerns about the substance of the legislation, according to a person familiar with the matter.Congressional Republicans have expressed wariness over the proposal’s cost.The delay would set back Schumer’s plan for quick action on the measure. The committee’s chair, Maria Cantwell, a Washington State Democrat, put off work on the bill. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday evening.The delay could also affect funding for increased U.S. production of semiconductors amid a global shortage. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, is planning to push for the Endless Frontier Act to include money for his CHIPS for America legislation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The bill became law earlier this year but was never funded. President Joe Biden has called for as much as $50 billion for the initiative.The legislation, which was introduced by Schumer and Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, would allocate $100 billion over five years to bolster U.S. research and development to counter China. It would also provide $10 billion to establish regional innovation hubs -- a provision intended to shore up support for the bill among lawmakers from across the country.With both parties showing an increasing willingness to confront China economically, there are no shortage of proposals for how to best do that. But the huge number of amendments may in and of itself proved to be too much to resolve before the bill was scheduled to be put together on Wednesday.The Senate is scheduled to be out next week and return the week of May 10.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-delays-bill-to-strengthen-competition-with-china-101619480325061.html
27-04-2021||World||Washington DC police hit by 'extortion' attack, FBI to probe 'unauthorised access'||The Washington, D.C., police department said Monday that its computer network was breached, and a Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate claimed to have stolen sensitive data, including on informants, that it threatened to share with local criminal gangs unless police paid an unspecified ransom.The cybercriminals posted screenshots on their dark web site supporting their claim to have stolen more than 250 gigabytes of data.The District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement that it had asked the FBI to investigate the “unauthorized access.” There was no indication that any police operations were affected, and the department did not immediately say whether it had been hit by ransomware.The Babuk group, a relatively new ransomware gang, said on its website that it had “downloaded a sufficient amount of information from your internal networks” and gave the police three days to contact it or "we will start to contact gangs in order to drain the informants."Screenshots it posted suggested it has data from at least four computers, including intelligence reports, information on gang conflicts, the jail census and other administrative files. One of the images, apparently of network locations accessed by the criminals, showed a text document on one computer entitled “How To Restore Your Files.”Such documents generally include instructions on how to contact the ransomware criminals, whose standard operating procedure is to exfiltrate sensitive data from networks they infiltrate as they sow malware that, once activated, encrypts data. Only after receiving payment do the criminals provide software keys that unscramble the data.So far this year, 26 government agencies in the U.S. have been hit by ransomware, with cybercriminals releasing online data stolen from 16 of them, said ransomware analyst Brett Callow of the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Ransomware victims don’t always pay, often preferring the arduous task of rebuilding networks from backups.The D.C. police department said it was taking the threat seriously.“We are aware of unauthorized access on our server. While we determine the full impact and continue to review activity, we have engaged the FBI to fully investigate this matter,” the department statement said. An FBI spokeswoman had no immediate comment.A worsening global epidemic of ransomware attacks is considered a national security threat by many, doing tens of billions of dollars in damage. U.S. law enforcement is relatively powerless to counteract it as most of the criminals enjoy safe harbor in Russia and other nations with weak rule of law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-dc-police-hit-by-extortion-attack-fbi-to-probe-unauthorised-access-101619504639348.html

A total of 11 Indians were among the dead.“The attackers died but the police attention was on those who motivated them," Rohana said.He said a total of 702 persons were in custody with 202 of them being remanded. 83 more are being detained for questioning at the police’s CID and the Terrorism Investigation Division.Rishad's lawyers claimed that the arrest was politically motivated as the special presidential panel to probe the Easter Sunday attack had not named them for aiding and abetting Islamic extremists.Nine suicide bombers, belonging to local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaat (NTJ) linked to ISIS, carried out a series of blasts that tore through three churches and as many luxury hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday on April 21, 2019.In May last year, Riyaj was arrested for making contacts with suicide bombers and given bail in October. Rishad was arrested in October and given bail in November over the misappropriation of state resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/easter-sunday-attacks-former-sri-lankan-minister-brother-to-be-detained-for-90-days-101619504169295.html

Rising commodity prices are also pushing up costs for businesses, she said.The economy posted record growth in the first quarter, with signs of a more balanced recovery underway. Growth in industrial production remained solid in March, though the pace moderated from previous months. Producer prices climbed in the month by the most since July 2018, boding well for profits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-industrial-profits-surge-as-economy-booms-prices-rise-101619491955428.html

27-04-2021||World||China announces measures to prevent foreign spying in companies||China’s top spy agency announced measures to fight infiltration by “hostile forces” in companies and other institutions, state media said, in the latest sign of businesses getting caught in the competition between Beijing and Washington.The new rules allow Chinese security authorities to draw up lists of companies and organizations considered susceptible to foreign infiltration and require them to take security measures, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday, citing a senior official with the Ministry of State Security.“Overseas espionage and intelligence agencies and hostile forces have intensified infiltration into China, and broadened their tactics of stealing secrets in various ways and in more fields, which poses a serious threat to China’s national security and interests,” Xinhua said.The rules were issued amid increasingly tense relations between China and the West, as Washington seeks to counter Beijing’s increasing economic and security clout. The powerful Ministry of State Security has played a central role in that struggle, most obviously with its high-profile detentions of foreign citizens such as Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who are awaiting verdicts after spying trials.State-owned enterprises have been increasing counterintelligence supervision on personnel traveling overseas since at least 2019, the Global Times newspaper reported separately Monday, citing an unidentified staff member in charge of foreign affairs at the headquarters of a central SOE in Beijing.Five Eyes“Staff going on business trips to foreign countries, such as countries of the Five Eyes alliance -- the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand -- have been told to strictly report their travel destinations, agendas, and meetings with foreign personnel, and they must get approval from their direct superiors before the applications are reviewed by the headquarters,” the person was quoted as saying.The enterprise has also strengthened pre-departure anti-spying education through seminars and short movies, where cases of foreign intelligence work are shown, the state enterprise staff told the newspaper. The company has required staff “involved in sensitive fields or those holding important files” to leave their devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and USB drives at home before going abroad.“For visits to countries that have been categorized as high-risk in terms of spying activities, we will evaluate if the trips are necessary and would advise against going if they are not essential,” the staff member was quoted as saying.The regulation didn’t specify which industries or companies would be on the list, but it said the list will be drawn up based on the level of confidentiality that the industry involves, the degree of foreign involvement and whether there have been previous incidents that endangered national security, according to the Global Times.To carry out anti-espionage missions and eliminate the hidden dangers of foreign espionage, the regulation also gives national security organs access to buildings, internal materials, electronic kits, facilities, or computers and information systems of the companies involved, the report said.China’s state security authorities will make further efforts to “organize and mobilize all social forces to jointly prevent and curb espionage activities and other acts hurting national security to strengthen the national security shield,” Xinhua said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-announces-measures-to-prevent-foreign-spying-in-companies-101619489881355.html

27-04-2021||World||Covid-19: USTR holds talks with Pfizer, Astrazeneca over increased vaccine production, IP rights waiver||United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai has held a virtual meeting with AstraZeneca and Pfizer leadership to discuss increasing vaccine production and a proposed waiver to certain provisions of the WTO's agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for the Covid-19 pandemic.The United States so far has remained non-committal on the World Trade Organization's (WTO) move of India and South Africa over this.The White House on Monday told reporters that no decision has been made yet, even as top American lawmakers urged the Biden administration to support the move at WTO to provide TRIPS waiver to Covid-19 vaccines."As the US approaches vaccinating our population, we cannot simply stand by as over a 100 countries struggle to vaccinate theirs. We must push Pfizer and Moderna to offer licensing to the rest of the world so they can develop vaccines and advocate a trips waiver at the WTO," Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna told PTI.Reiterating that the Biden-Harris administration’s top priority is saving lives and ending the pandemic here at home and around the world, Tai expressed her deep sympathy for the people of India.She highlighted the announcement that the United States was examining options to share AstraZeneca vaccine doses with other countries as they become available, an official statement said.Tai's meeting was with Dr Ruud Dobber, executive vice-president of the biopharmaceuticals business unit and head of the US business at AstraZeneca.She had a separate meeting with Dr Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer."Ambassador Tai and Dr Dobber discussed increasing vaccine production, global health issues and the proposed waiver to certain provisions of the WTO's Agreement on TRIPS for the Covid-19 pandemic," the USTR said in a readout of the meeting.“United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai today (Monday) met virtually with Dr Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer, to discuss increasing vaccine production, global health issues and the proposed waiver to certain provisions of the WTO's Agreement on TRIPS for the Covid-19 pandemic,” it added.Ahead of a May 5 meeting of the WTO’s General Council, Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a group of 10 senators and sent a letter to Biden, urging him to publicly support a temporary patent waiver for Covid-19 vaccines that would allow countries to manufacture treatments locally, expediting the global vaccination effort, saving countless lives and crushing the pandemic.“Your administration has the opportunity to reverse the damage done by the Trump administration to our nation’s global reputation and restore America’s public health leadership on the world stage,” the senators wrote.“To bring the pandemic to its quickest end and save the lives of Americans and people around the world, we ask that you prioritise people over pharmaceutical company profits by reversing the Trump position and announcing US support for the WTO TRIPS waiver,” they added.The proposal to temporarily waive the WTO’s intellectual property rules was put forward by South Africa and India in October, and will be a focus at the body’s meeting early next month.Over 60 former heads of state and 100 Nobel Prize winners signed a letter last week to Biden backing the effort.In a poll conducted by the Data for Progress and Progressive International, 60 per cent of American voters backed the waiver, including 50 per cent of registered Republicans.In February, more than 400 prominent US health, faith, consumer, labour, development and other organisations wrote to Biden, urging him to reverse Trump’s block on the waiver.Khanna said the Biden Administration should call on Pfizer and Moderna to provide an intellectual property waiver for six months to a year as India grapples with this crisis.“It will buy them an inordinate amount of goodwill in one of the largest emerging markets. The White House should also convene Indian business leaders to make the case for why this is in these companies’ long-term strategic interest,” he said.“India has their own IP and they are also manufacturer of vaccines. Some of it has been delayed. The last time we really communicated about this at a high-level was from our USTR, Katherine Tai, but I don't have any updates to that," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-ustr-holds-talks-with-pfizer-astrazeneca-over-increased-vaccine-production-ip-rights-waiver-101619493987909.html

Modi told Biden “about India’s initiative at the WTO for a relaxation in the norms of the Agreement on TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Right) to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries”, according to a readout of their call released by the external affairs ministry.US response was best captured by the White House readout that had no mention of it. Asked about it at a briefing on background, a senior administration official said “It was discussed briefly. We are looking at it, but I have nothing to say about our position right now.”But pressure is mounting on the Biden administration from a growing number of its Democratic allies on the Capitol Hill. “This temporary, targeted TRIPS waiver is a critical tool in overcoming this once-in-a- lifetime pandemic,” a group of 10 Democratic senators of the party’s progressive wing wrote to President Biden recently, adding, “Your Administration has the opportunity to reverse the damage done by the Trump Administration to our nation’s global reputation and restore America’s public health leadership on the world stage.”The Indian-South African proposal was moved at the WTO last October. The United States and other high-income countries, most of who have since built up large stockpiles of vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies, have prevented the world body from even discussing the proposal, which has been backed by more than 80 member countries.Also Read | Biden pledges US help for India’s Covid fightTammy Baldwin, one of these 10 senators, said Monday, “While wealthy nations are able to purchase more shots, international efforts to get the vaccine to the rest of the world, like the World Health Organization’s so-called COVAX effort (a WHO-led effort to provide vaccines to all), are falling woefully short of increasing the global supply to a level that is needed to stomp out the virus and save the lives of Americans and people around the world, we ask that you prioritize people over pharmaceutical company profits by reversing the Trump position and announcing US support for the WTO TRIPS waiver.”Atman Trivedi, a former state and commerce departments official who is now managing director with international consultants Hills & Company, said, “The ten progressive senators’ letter may move the needle, especially as the devastation in India serves as a poignant reminder that many parts of the world have yet to vaccinate their people.”While publicly defiant in the face of mounting pressure, the Biden administration is understood to be debating the issue internally, especially as more and more Americans get inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-still-cagey-about-wto-waiver-india-and-south-africa-plough-on-101619496563082.html

Previous posts on Chinese social media websites had been blocked as well.Zhao on Sunday night became the second woman ever to win the coveted award at the Oscars, as her film Nomadland -- about marginalised Americans roaming the West -- bagged best picture and its lead, Frances McDormand, won best actress.According to a Reuters report, a live-stream of the Academy Awards in Shanghai hosted by alumni of Zhao’s alma mater ran into China’s censors, with the organiser saying access to his virtual private network (VPN) service was blocked for nearly two hours.“One of the exceedingly rare pieces of coverage, on private news site 163.com, actually used the occasion of her victory as an opportunity to not-so-subtly assert one of China’s most important — and contentious — geopolitical priorities,” the Hollywood Report said in an article.Beijing’s anger on Zhao stems from an interview she gave to the Filmmaker magazine in 2013 where she said China is “…a place where there are lies everywhere”.Until the speech resurfaced recently, Zhao and her work had been praised even by Xinhua.“The evocative feature film, Nomadland, the latest effort by insightful Chinese female director, Chloe Zhao, is sweeping the awards circuit in the United States, putting her on the fast track for Oscar contention… Zhao has a unique vision which is serving her in good stead now,” Xinhua wrote in a gushing piece in December.Twitter-like Weibo was initially flooded with posts praising Zhao on Monday morning, while others decried censorship.“Chloe Zhao becomes the first Asian diaspora/Chinese female filmmaker to win the best director Oscar in history,” wrote an entertainment blogger, before the tweet was deleted. “China’s public opinion control is outrageous. After Chloe Zhao’s starling Oscars win, there is not even a fart on Weibo,” wrote an outraged userState-backed opinion on her quickly changed after the interview was found and shared on Chinese social media.Later on Monday, the nationalistic tabloid Global Times published reports on Zhao’s victory, almost grudgingly praising her work.Zhao’s acceptance speech showed her Chinese cultural roots when she quoted the classic Chinese philosophical ethos that people are born with goodness and kindness within them.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-censors-chloe-zhao-s-historic-oscar-win-101619488572931.html
27-04-2021||World||US pledges additional $310 million in aid to stem crisis at border||Vice President Kamala Harris pledged $310 million in additional humanitarian aid for Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador in an effort to stem a wave of migration from those countries to the U.S., her office said.Harris discussed the funding in a Monday discussion with Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei. The virtual meeting lasted roughly an hour, according to a senior administration official, and came before a June trip by Harris to the country.Harris spokeswoman Symone Sanders said the leaders discussed the need for long-term economic growth to create jobs and stop the flow of migrants to the U.S., which has caused an early political and humanitarian crisis for President Joe Biden.The aid package includes $255 million in relief funds to mitigate the damage from persistent drought as well as food shortages and the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Harris’ office. The money would also fund safety precautions for refugees and asylum seekers and provide health and disaster-relief services to people in those three countries.Another $55 million in Department of Agriculture funds would go to strengthen Guatemala’s farming industry and expand access to daily meals and literacy programs in Guatemala and Honduras, Harris’ office said.Biden chose the vice president to lead the diplomatic response to the migration crisis by engaging with Central American governments.The president has said that the U.S. must address so-called “root causes” of migration such as poverty and violence in Central America to solve the problem.But congressional Republicans as well as former President Donald Trump say Biden’s reversal of Trump’s hard-line immigration policies encouraged more border crossings, a charge the administration rejects.The administration is also pressing Central American governments to crack down on corruption and crime, which officials say are the main impetuses for migration, and take immediate steps to secure their own borders.Guatemala pledged to increase the number of security personnel at its borders to stop migrants from Honduras and El Salvador from continuing north, Sanders said. The two governments also promised to deepen law-enforcement cooperation against narcotics traffickers and human-smuggling rings.Guatemala also plans to open so-called Migrant Resource Centers jointly with the U.S. for people to apply for asylum or refugee status, or seek an immigrant or work visa, before making the journey to the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pledges-additional-310-million-in-aid-to-stem-crisis-at-border-101619486627217.html
27-04-2021||World||Tesla says it appears driver was at the wheel in crash||Tesla said Monday scrutiny of wreckage from a fatal crash in Texas indicates that someone was at the wheel, contrary to an early report that the driver's seat was empty.During an earnings call, the electric car maker defended itself anew against a report that a Tesla had been fooled into driving with no one behind the wheel, with tragic results."It was claimed to be autopilot, but this is completely false," Tesla chief Elon Musk responded while fielding questions.Tesla has been working with federal and state investigators, and a study of the wreckage indicated there was someone at the wheel at the time of the impact, according to vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy."We were able to find that the steering wheel was indeed deformed, leading to a likelihood that someone was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash," Moravy said on the call.Tesla's auto-steer feature was not engaged, and all the seat belts were found to be unbuckled after the crash, according Moravy.Tesla came under renewed scrutiny last week following a report its cars could be fooled into driving with no one behind the wheel, with two senators demanding a vigorous federal probe of the crash.The accident, which killed two people, involved a Tesla Model S that caught fire after hitting a tree late on April 17 near Houston. Investigators found no one in the driver's seat of the vehicle, local police said.The developments added to questions about the high-flying electric car maker led by the mercurial Musk, who said last week that data logs show Autopilot was not engaged during the Texas crash.On its website, Tesla describes Autopilot as a driver enhancement system that, despite its name, requires a human operator."Autopilot enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane," the website says. "Current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous."But engineers from Consumer Reports "easily tricked" Tesla's Autopilot to drive without anyone in the driver's seat, "a scenario that would present extreme danger if it were repeated on public roads," the magazine said on its website last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-says-it-appears-driver-was-at-the-wheel-in-crash-101619483854148.html
27-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Australia to consider proposal to suspend flights from India||Australia is set to consider a proposal on Tuesday to suspend flights from India to prevent more virulent coronavirus variants entering the country following a surge in positive COVID-19 cases in the world's second-most populous country.Queensland state has urged the federal government to halt all flights from India due to the high risk of potential COVID-19 outbreaks from highly contagious virus variants in the country's hotel quarantine system."I sent a letter to the Prime Minister at the end of last week asking for the suspension of flights coming in from India ... and I know that the federal government is considering it today," Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Tuesday.Australia's national security committee will meet later on Tuesday to consider halting flights from India and will also unveil measures including sending medical supplies to help India, Australian media reported.The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to requests seeking comments on the reports.Last week, Australia announced it would cut the number of its citizens able to return from India and other red-zone countries to contain the risk of more virulent strains of COVID-19 spreading.India has ordered its armed forces to help tackle the COVID-19 crisis, as nations including Britain, Germany and the United States pledged urgent medical aid to try to contain an emergency overwhelming the country's hospitals.On Monday, India reported more than 352,000 new COVID-19 cases, a global record for the rise in daily cases for the fifth straight day, eclipsing even the United States at the height of its pandemic last year. More than 2,800 deaths were recorded over the last 24 hours, an all-time high.Australia closed its borders to non-citizens and permanent residents last March to prevent the new coronavirus reaching the country. All returning travellers have to undergo a mandatory two-week hotel quarantine at their own expense.The quarantine system has largely helped Australia to keep its COVID-19 numbers relatively low, with just under 29,700 cases and 910 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australia-to-consider-proposal-to-suspend-flights-from-india-101619486244428.html

Anvisa had previously said there were "critical issues" surrounding the vaccine's effectiveness and safety that needed clarifying.Ana Carolina Moreira Marino Araujo, general manager for health monitoring, said that taking into account all the documentation presented, data acquired at in-person inspections and information from other regulators, Anvisa's technical staff said "inherent risks" were too great at this time.A crucial issue was the presence in the vaccine of the adenovirus that could reproduce, a "serious" defect, according to Anvisa's medicines and biological products manager Gustavo Mendes.Brazil's vaccination program has been blighted by a series of delays and procurement failures, turning the country into one of the world's deadliest Covid-19 hotspots this year and pushing the national health system to the brink of collapse.Brazil has registered 14.4 million confirmed cases of the virus and almost 400,000 deaths since the onset of the pandemic over a year ago, much of that in the last few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-health-regulator-s-technical-staff-recommend-against-sputnik-v-vaccine-101619484327228.html

The vote in the House of Commons was 178 to 157 in favor.In her first fiscal plan as finance chief, Freeland’s budget outlines almost C$500 billion ($403 billion) in spending with a return to small deficits by 2025. It also earmarks C$101 billion for new programs over a three-year period.The centerpiece of the budget is C$30 billion over five years to establish a national childcare strategy, with the goal of offering daycare spaces at C$10 a day.The budget’s approval means Canadians likely won’t be going to the polls this spring, though Trudeau may try to force an election at some point this year in a bid to regain the majority his Liberal Party lost in 2019. The prime minister has promised that all adult Canadians who want a Covid-19 vaccine will be able to get one by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-pm-trudeau-survives-confidence-vote-as-opposition-party-backs-budget-101619484654512.html
27-04-2021||World||US homeland security launches review of extremism within agency||The Department of Homeland Security on Monday announced an internal review to assess the threat of violent extremism from within the agency, part of a broader administration focus on domestic threats following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.Senior DHS officials will immediately begin the review, which is aimed at preventing, detecting and responding to extremism within the ranks of a sprawling agency that includes the Coast Guard and the nation's immigration enforcement organizations, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in announcing the effort.DHS, which was formed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, calls domestic violent extremism the “most lethal and persistent terrorism-related threat” facing the nation following a series of deadly incidents in recent years.“As we work to safeguard our nation, we must be vigilant in our efforts to identify and combat domestic violent extremism within both the broader community and our own organization," Mayorkas said.DHS plans in the coming days to issue new policies for reporting internal threats and suspected extremism.The agency did not cite any specific incidents in announcing the review. Past known cases include that of a Coast Guard lieutenant who was accused of being a domestic terrorist and convicted on weapons and drug charges last year.Prosecutors said the lieutenant, who was sentenced to more than 13 years, was preparing to carry out a mass attack to act out white nationalist views. At his sentencing, the Maryland resident said he never planned to hurt anyone and apologized for his actions.In February, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered military leaders to spend time talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks after a number of former and current service members took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection. The rioters — supporters of former President Donald Trump — had hoped to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election."Those of us who know DHS well know that the number of problematic officers within DHS is small," said Thomas Warrick, a former senior official at the agency who focuses on ways to reform it as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “But even a small number is corrosive. It undermines the trust of the American people and the entire mission of the department and its components.”Shortly after President Joe Biden took office, DHS issued a rare terrorism bulletin warning of the lingering potential for violence from people motivated by antigovernment sentiment after the election, suggesting the insurrection might embolden extremists and set the stage for additional attacks.The agency also directed state, local and tribal agencies receiving annual DHS grants to direct 7.5% of the funds toward addressing the threat from domestic extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-homeland-security-launches-review-of-extremism-within-agency-101619481686150.html

It reported 2,048 new cases on Monday, of which 901 were in Bangkok."They shouldn't wait until there is a new outbreak to come up with regulations," said Ungkana Kesornphud, who owns a massage shop in Bangkok.The president of Thailand's Thoracic Society, Nithiphat Chiarakun, also urged the government to take "decisive measures to stop the movement of people as quickly as possible".An online petition on Change.org calling for the resignation of health minister Anutin Charnvirankul had garnered over 160,000 signatures in two days.Anutin has said he will not resign.The city of Bangkok fined Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha 6,000 baht ($190) after he posted a photo of him not wearing a mask during a meeting.The photo was later removed.Thailand plans to procure more vaccines from several producers with a vaccination goal of 300,000 doses per day to inoculate at least 50 million people by end-2021, the prime minister posted.Thailand has a population of about 66.1 million.INDIA TRAVEL CURBSThailand will consider additional restrictions later this week, Apisamai Srirangsan, a spokeswoman for its coronavirus taskforce said at a briefing, after the country announced curbs on travel from India where infections have set a global record for a fifth straight day.The Thai embassy in New Delhi said in a statement that certificates of entry for non-Thai nationals travelling from India will be suspended until further notice.The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) denied reports that private jets carrying wealthy people from India were flying into Thailand."We confirm that no chartered flights from Indian millionaires have sought permission from the CAAT to come to Thailand," it said in a statement over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-starts-stricter-covid-19-shutdown-but-experts-say-not-enough-101619483897240.html
27-04-2021||World||US population growth slowed sharply over 2010-2020: Census||US population growth fell over the past decade to the second-slowest pace in history, the Census Bureau reported Monday, after Donald Trump's tough crackdown brought immigration to a near halt.The official 10-year count estimated that 331,449,281 million people lived in the world's third-most populous country on April 1, 2020.That was a 7.4 percent rise from 2010, when the official population stood at 308,745,538, the Census Bureau said.The 10-year expansion was significantly slower than the previous decade, when the population grew by 9.7 percent, and was barely above the record low of 7.3 percent over 1930-1940, when the United States and the world were mired in the Great Depression.The population growth rate accelerated with the "baby boomer" birth surge after World War II, but since the early 1950s has been on a fairly steady decline.That was only interrupted for a few years in the 1990s when millions of migrants, mostly Mexicans, entered the country without documents and stayed.Since then, data shows the dropoff has been sharp.In the past decade, researchers have said that the deep, year-long economic slump from the 2008 financial crisis contributed to the slowdown, with a lower birth rate and with many Mexican migrants returning to their country.In addition, after he became president in 2017, Donald Trump sought to sharply cut legal immigration and halt illegal immigration completely.The region showing the largest growth since 2010 was the south, followed by the west.Arid, heavily desert Utah in the west had the fastest growing population of the 50 states, gaining 18.4 percent, while mountainous West Virginia in the east fell by 3.2 percent.The Census Bureau only released the broad numbers for the country and individual states Monday, to serve as a basis for reapportioning seats in the 435-member US House of Representatives.In all, 13 states will either gain or lose seats, with California, the largest by population, losing one of its 53, while Texas, the second-largest, adding two to its current 36.Others gaining one seat are Colorado, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon. Other losers were Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.The census was taken under a cloud of politics, with Trump trying to reverse past practice and force the agency not to count undocumented or non-citizen residents.His push against immigration is also thought to have made many people afraid to respond to census takers.The census was also hampered by the Covid-19 outbreak."Trying to count people in a global pandemic made it even more challenging," said Ron Jarmin, acting director of the Census Bureau.The bureau plans to release details on age, race and other characteristics of the population in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-population-growth-slowed-sharply-over-2010-2020-census-101619481639081.html
27-04-2021||World||US to share AstraZeneca shots with world after safety check||The US will begin sharing its entire stock of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines with the world once it clears federal safety reviews, the White House said Monday, with as many as 60 million doses expected to be available for export in the coming months.The move greatly expands on the Biden administration's action last month to share about 4 million doses of the vaccine with Mexico and Canada. The AstraZeneca vaccine is widely in use around the world but has not yet been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration.The White House is increasingly feeling assured about the supply of the three vaccines being administered in the US, particularly following the restart of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot over the weekend. The US has also been under mounting pressure in recent weeks to share more of its vaccine supply with the world, as countries like India experience devastating surges of the virus and others struggle to access doses needed to protect their most vulnerable populations.“Given the strong portfolio of vaccines that the US already has and that have been authorized by the FDA, and given that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorized for use in the U.S., we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next several months," said White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients. "Therefore the US is looking at options to share the AstraZeneca doses with other countries as they become available.”More than 3 million people worldwide have died of Covid-19, including more than 572,000 in the US. The US has vaccinated more than 53% of its adult population with at least one dose of its three authorized vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and J&J, and it expects to have enough supply for its entire population by early summer.About 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have been produced but have yet to pass review by the FDA to “meet its expectations for product quality,” Zients said, noting the US regulator is recognized as the “gold standard” for safety around the world. That process could be completed in the next several weeks. About 50 million more doses are in various stages of production and could be available to ship in May and June pending FDA sign-off.The US has yet to finalize where the AstraZeneca doses will go, Zients said. Neighbors Mexico and Canada have asked the Biden administration to share more doses, while dozens of other countries are looking to access supplies of the vaccine.“We’re in the planning process at this point in time," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, when asked where the doses would go.The AstraZeneca doses will be donated by the US government, which has contracted with the company for a total of 300 million doses — though the company has faced production issues.The administration's move to share vaccines drew praise from nongovernmental aid groups, who encouraged the White House to develop plans to share even more doses.“The Biden administration’s decision to begin sharing AstraZeneca vaccines is welcome news and an important first step towards the US sharing more of its massive vaccine stockpile," said Tom Hart, acting CEO at The ONE Campaign. "The Biden administration should build on this welcome first step and start sharing more vaccines as soon as possible.”In part because the AstraZeneca vaccine is not expected to play a significant factor in the US virus response, the White House was also moving to share raw materials for the production of the AstraZeneca vaccine with India, which has emerged as a global hotspot for the virus, by diverting some of its orders to the vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India.Zients told the AP that the Biden administration was working to satisfy other “key requests” from the Indian government, namely for personal protective equipment, tests, therapeutics and supplies of oxygen and respiratory assistance devices.“The administration’s identified US commercial suppliers of therapeutics that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering of the Covid-19 patients in India,” said Zients. “We’ve identified rapid diagnostic tests and supplies and PPE, and additional ventilators that are available to transferred to India.”Epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also expected to soon travel to India to assist the country with its virus response.The additional quality review before the US shares the AstraZeneca doses were in order because of issues at the facility that produced them, White House officials said.AstraZeneca’s doses in the US were produced at an Emergent BioSolutions plant in Baltimore that has come under increased regulatory and public scrutiny after botching batches of the J&J vaccine. The US pressed J&J to take over the plant and, as part of the effort to ensure the quality of newly produced vaccines, directed the facility to stop making the AstraZeneca shot. AstraZeneca is still looking to identify a new US production facility for its future doses.The US government ordered enough for 150 million Americans before issues with the vaccine’s clinical trial held up clearance. The company’s 30,000-person US trial didn’t complete enrollment until January, and it still has not filed for an emergency-use authorization with the FDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-share-astrazeneca-shots-with-world-after-safety-check-101619481484016.html
27-04-2021||World||Germany, China to increase cooperation on climate change||Germany and China have agreed to step up their cooperation in combating climate change in an effort to help keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the year 2100.Countries are running out of time to achieve that target, laid down in the Paris agreement more than five years ago, because global temperatures have already increased by about 1.2 C since pre-industrial times, scientists say.“We need to do everything possible to lower greenhouse gas emissions faster than planned so far,” Svenja Schulze, Germany's environment minister, said on Monday.“Along with the big industrialized countries we also need China for this,” he said.China has become the world's largest emitter of planet-heating gases, overtaking the United States, which now ranks second. It has pledged to stop adding carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere by 2060 — a decade later than the US and the European Union.The agreement comes ahead of the two countries' Cabinets holding a bilateral meeting Wednesday.Schulze said she and her Chinese counterpart Huang Runqui discussed how Beijing can bring forward the year when it will start reducing emissions and cuts its use of coal, a particularly polluting fossil fuel. Germany aims to phase out the burning of coal for electricity by 2038.On Monday, three German environmental think tanks said the country could bring forward its target for going “climate neutral” forward five years if it stopped the use of coal by 2030, significantly increased renewable energy generation, replaced natural gas with hydrogen by 2040 and banned the registration of combustion engine vehicles from 2032.Together, the measures could help Germany save almost 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, they said.The plan received support from the environmentalist Greens, who are leading in the latest polls five months before Germany's federal election. Annalena Baerbock, the party's candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel, said the proposal showed that “reshaping German industry with an ambitious climate goal is more than feasible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-china-to-increase-cooperation-on-climate-change-101619481066602.html
27-04-2021||World||India going through same Covid-19 crisis as UK, Europe did earlier: South Africa's health minister Zweli Mkhize||The current Covid-19 crisis of huge number of daily infections in India is something that has already happened elsewhere in the world, South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said here.The minister appeared on the national public broadcaster, SABC, on Monday morning, where he was asked why the extensive vaccination programme in India had not stopped the current surge."Different countries have had the same experience. While they are going through the vaccination, the next wave was coming through so you cannot necessarily say that the vaccination will stop it," Mkhize said."Many countries have gone through what India is going through – the UK and countries in Europe had exactly the same problem," he added."What we have learnt from our side is that we went through the second wave without any vaccines and we managed to get our numbers down because of our precautionary measures (of masks and social distancing)," the minister said.And these measures have to be intensified so that whenever the next wave hits, the situation does not get out of hands, he added."Vaccinations will be going on throughout the year, so we will still be getting the outbreaks and hotspots here and there – that will be part of the way we will live for the rest of this year," the minister said."Only when we have vaccinated the majority of the people will we start to see it receding," he added.Mkhize also announced that South Africa would be resuming on Wednesday the Johnson and Johnson vaccine trial programme.The programme was suspended a fortnight ago, as was the case in many other countries, after cases of blood clots in eight women were reported.Mkhize said the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) had now reviewed all the reports and recommendations on what was happening all over the world and decided that South Africa should resume the vaccination.SAHPRA has recommended that pregnant and lactating women be excluded from the vaccination programme at this stage."Those continuing with the programme will be have to sign a consent but they will also be given additional information about what precautions to take, what symptoms to look out for, and if there is anything suspicious, to get medical attention," the health minister said.Mkhize said the American studies had shown the risk to be one in a million, which made it very low compared to the rates of infection.Around 3,00,000 healthcare workers had already been vaccinated before the programme was suspended. A further 200,000 are expected to be vaccinated within the next week or two, he said."We have to clear the rest of the health workers and then get to the rest of the public. We must move up to about 5.5 million to be vaccinated (who are) over 50 years (of age) very quickly," the minister said.More than 600,000 people have already registered on the electronic date system that has been set up to prioritise vaccination sites across the country as speedily as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-going-through-same-covid-19-crisis-as-uk-europe-did-earlier-south-africa-s-health-minister-zweli-mkhize-101619480623510.html
27-04-2021||World||Chinese airlines suspends cargo flights to India||The largest cargo flight operator from China to India, the Chinese state-owned Sichuan Airlines, has suspended all cargo flights to India for 15 days because of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the country.The suspension, which is likely to disrupt frantic efforts by Indian private companies to import medical supplies including oxygen concentrators to fight the pandemic from China, comes despite Beijing’s repeated offers of “support and assistance” to India to fight the pandemic.The airlines operated 10 flights on six routes to four Indian cities - New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore.In a late night development, the airlines told the state-run tabloid Global Times that it was “discussing a new plan” to resume cargo services to India.“We are re-evaluating the original plan of suspending cargo services to India, and actively discussing a new plan to guarantee cargo services to the region,” the company told Global Times.The company said the reason why it suspended cargo flights to India was the recent sudden change in Covid-19 cases in the country.A discussion to resume cargo flights was taken after Indian media from Beijing reported the company’s decision to suspend the operations, the Global Times report said.In a letter to the sales agents on Monday, the Sichuan Chuanhang Logistics Co. Ltd, part of Sichuan Airlines, said the airline has suspended its cargo flights on all six routes -- Xi’an-Delhi, Xi’an-Mumbai, Chengdu-Chennai, Chongqing-Chennai, Chengdu-Bangalore, and Chongqing-Delhi – for 15 days,The airlines said “…in the face of sudden changes in the epidemic situation (in India), in order to reduce the number of imported cases, it is decided” to suspend the flights.The airlines added the India route has “always been the core strategic route for Sichuan Airlines” but added that the Indian Covid-19 outbreak had not only caused “…a record number of deaths but also caused a surge in imported cases”.The Chinese foreign ministry, however, did not offer any comment. “With regard to the operation of airlines, I will refer you to the relevant airlines for more information,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked about the development.The ministry also did not confirm or deny a tweet by the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka, which said 800 oxygen concentrators have been airlifted from Hong Kong to Delhi with another 10,000 to be dispatched in the coming week.“800 Oxygen Concentrators have been airlifted today from #HongKong to #Delhi; 10000 more in a week. #China is keeping in touch with #India for urgent needs. Stay Strong,” the tweet published by the Chinese embassy in Colombo early on Monday said.When asked to comment on the tweet at the regular ministry briefing, Wang said: “As I said, China is willing to provide necessary support and help to India in its fight against the virus. If India raises specific demands, we will provide help and support to the best of our capability.”He added: “We have stated that we are ready to help India fight the virus in the first opportunity available. [The] two sides are in communication regarding this... China has been following closely the epidemic situation in India. We show our sincerest sympathies to the worsening situation in India.”To a question from Blommbergon three other Quad members (the US, Australia, and Japan) not helping the fourth member, India, during this crisis, Wang said countries should work together to fight the virus.“With regard to some mechanisms that you mentioned, we hope we can also follow this principle and work towards building a community with a shared future and to provide support and help to other countries in their fight (the) virus and show their true responsibilities and obligations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-airlines-suspends-cargo-flights-to-india-101619474732252.html
