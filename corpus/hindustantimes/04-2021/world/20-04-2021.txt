Since then they have waged a long-running insurgency and still control wide swathes of territory.The foreign troop withdrawals have raised concerns that the country could erupt in full-scale civil war, providing al Qaeda space in which to rebuild and plan new attacks on U.S. and other targets.A United Nations report in January said there were as many as 500 al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and that the Taliban maintained a close relationship with the Islamist extremist group. The Taliban denies al Qaeda has a presence in Afghanistan.Announcing his decision to withdraw troops, Biden said the United States would monitor the threat, reorganize counter-terrorism capabilities and keep substantial assets in the region to respond to threats to the United States emerging from Afghanistan.McKenzie said he would provide the defense secretary a plan for counter-terrorism forces outside of Afghanistan by the end of the month. He cautioned that the loss of the current U.S. military network in Afghanistan, and the intelligence capability it allows, would have an impact."If you're out of the country and you don't have the ecosystem that we have there now, it will be harder to do that. It is not impossible to do that. It will just be harder to do it," he said.A top White House official said on Sunday that no one could offer guarantees about Afghanistan's future after U.S. troops leave, even as he stressed the United States would stay focused on threats emanating from the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-general-says-has-grave-doubt-about-taliban-s-reliability-101618939205689.html
20-04-2021||World||Bangladesh eyes Sputnik vaccine to overcome supply shortage from India||Russia has proposed to manufacture its 'Sputnik V' Covid-19 vaccine in Bangladesh in collaboration with local pharmaceutical firms under a co-production arrangement while Dhaka is searching other sources apart from India amidst a spike in infections in the country, according to Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen."We agreed with them (Russia) on coproduction (of vaccine) … though it's not finalised yet," Momen told the official BSS news agency.Russia has invited Bangladesh to be a vaccine co-producer with its technology, saying currently the country lacks the production capacity to export its vaccine to Bangladesh.As per the proposal, Russia will give the technology and Bangladeshi pharmaceutical companies will produce the Sputnik vaccine here, he said.“If things go well … It will be cheap and hopefully it will be better,” he added.Bangladesh so far was dependent on India’s Serum Institute. But as India was facing vaccine shortages amid an intensifying second wave of the deadly Covid-19 virus, the Pune-based vaccine producer has not been able to supply the doses to Bangladesh and other countries.A Bangladeshi health ministry official meanwhile said the government constituted a five-member committee to explore newer vaccine sources and asked it to submit a report to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's office in the next seven days."The committee has been formed as availability of vaccines appeared uncertain," director general of health services Professor Dr Abul Bashar Mohammmad Khurshid Alam told newsmen.Dhaka started vigorously hunting for other sources, including China, for getting the high demanded inoculation fearing India could get run out of vaccines for its own citizens.Momen said Bangladesh earlier did not show much interest in the Chinese vaccine as their vaccine was yet to get the World Health Organisation (WHO) approval.“But, now we are keeping open all options to get vaccines,” Momen said.Momen said China, however, informed Bangladesh that they would not be able to export any vaccine before December as they already gave commitments to other countries to supply their vaccine.Besides, he said, the World Bank recently informed Bangladesh to provide 80 lack doses of vaccine under COVAX by next month. “We are hopeful to get those vaccines under COVAX,” he said.Bangladesh purchased 30 million doses of India-made vaccine under a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed on November 5 and a subsequent agreement on December 13 among Bangladesh government, Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd (BPL) and the Serum Institute of India (SII).As per the agreement, Bangladesh is supposed to receive 5 million doses in each month, but after the first consignment of 5 million, Dhaka is yet to receive the second consignment of 5 million that was scheduled to arrive here by March.Bangladesh received 21.5 million vaccine doses from the Indian government as a gift apart from the commercially procured ones.“They (India) have been telling us that they would send the vaccines... they never said that they couldn’t,” Momen said, adding that Dhaka keeps confidence in Indian assurance and is hopeful to get all the 30 million doses of vaccine within the timeframe of the agreement.However, the minister said, Dhaka feared that Indian vaccine production is not enough considering their internal demand and international commitment.Momen said the government has also been considering engaging the private sector in importing and marketing commercially expensive vaccines like the Pfizer-BioNTech one in the Bangladesh market to meet the demand.He said the government aims to vaccinate 80 per cent of the total population free of cost to check the spreading of the deadly virus.In Bangladesh, so far, nearly 5.5 million people have received the first dose of the vaccine while around seven million more registered for the vaccination.Bangladesh is among the nations which has continued to witness a sharp surge in the cases of coronavirus, with right now 727,780 cases and 10,588 deaths caused by the disease, according to media reports.Bangladesh recorded 91 deaths and 4,559 new infections in the 24 hours, according to government figures released on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-eyes-sputnik-vaccine-to-overcome-supply-shortage-from-india-101618927154228.html
20-04-2021||World||Japan says Chinese military likely behind cyberattacks||Tokyo police are investigating cyberattacks on about 200 Japanese companies and research organizations, including the country’s space agency, by a hacking group believed to be linked to the Chinese military, the government said Tuesday.Police have forwarded the case involving attacks on the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to prosecutors for further investigation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters.Police believe a series of hacks of JAXA were conducted in 2016-2017 by “Tick,” a Chinese cyberattack group under the direction of a unit of the People’s Liberation Army, Kato said.A suspect in the JAXA case, a Chinese systems engineer based in Japan, allegedly gained access to a rental server by registering himself under a false identity to launch the cyberattacks, Kato said, citing the police investigation.NHK public television said another Chinese national with suspected links to the PLA unit who was in Japan as an exchange student was also investigated in the case. Both men have since left the country, it said.Police are investigating the attackers’ intent and methods, while also pursuing scores of other cyberattacks that they suspect are linked to China’s military, Kato said.“The involvement of China’s People’s Liberation Army is highly likely,” Kato said. He added that no actual data leak or damage has been found so far but police are urging the companies to strengthen their protection.Japan's Defense Ministry says cyberattacks are part of rising security threats from China as it becomes more assertive in the region — a shared concern discussed in April 16 talks at the White House between U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said cyberattacks are a common challenge faced by all countries and warned Japan against wrongly accusing China.“Groundless speculation should not be allowed. China is firmly opposed to any country or institution using cyberattacks to throw mud at China or to serve the despicable political purposes with cybersecurity issues," he said. "China is willing to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with all parties to jointly address cybersecurity threats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-says-chinese-military-likely-behind-cyberattacks-101618925322865.html

The government introduced the Colombo Port City Economic Commission draft bill in parliament this month.For parliamentarian Harsha de Silva, a member of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya, the move to allow the president to appoint the board and chief executive officer of the commission adds to Rajapaksa’s authority. The president last year succeeded in a bid to amass executive powers for his office after his government won a super majority vote to amend the constitution.The port city “will catalyze the next phase of growth, however for this to work, we want to make sure that it is done right,” said de Silva, who was involved in developing a first draft for a law administering the Colombo Port city when in government.Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Bar Association in its challenge said the bill infringes on judicial functions and may violate articles of the constitution dealing with the unitary state and sovereignty of the people. Some lawmakers and Buddhist clergy linked to Rajapaksa’s party have also opposed the Commission, calling it an attempt to form a Chinese colony.Sri Lanka has been one of the countries drawn to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The port city in Colombo, being built by China Communications Construction Co., also has a plan to build a financial district -- pitched as a new hub between Singapore and Dubai -- with a marina, a hospital, shopping malls, and 21,000 apartments and homes.Concerns over the port city being a Chinese colony are misplaced, and the project will be a source of non-debt inflows that will help drive growth by reducing red-tape faced by investors, said State Minister for Money and Capital Markets Nivard Cabraal.The Colombo port city has been exempted from a number of laws and agencies to improve the ease of doing business, Cabraal said, although it’s kept rules against money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinabuilt-port-city-plan-challenged-in-sri-lanka-s-top-court-101618908099257.html
20-04-2021||World||Biden praying for 'right verdict' in Chauvin trial, says evidence 'overwhelming'||President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he is “praying the verdict is the right verdict” in the trial of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin and that he believed the case, which has gone to the jury and put the nation on edge, to be “overwhelming.”Biden, ahead of a meeting with lawmakers in the Oval Office, told reporters that he was only weighing in on the trial into the death of George Floyd, who died with Chauvin's knee on his neck, because the jury in the case had been sequestered. He confirmed that he called Floyd's family on Monday to offer prayers and said he “can only imagine the pressure and anxiety they’re feeling.”“They’re a good family and they’re calling for peace and tranquility no matter what that verdict is,” Biden said. "I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict. It’s overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn’t say that unless the jury was sequestered now.”The president has repeatedly denounced Floyd's death but had previously stopped short of weighing in on the trial itself. His comments came as his administration has been privately weighing how to handle the upcoming verdict, including considering whether Biden should address the nation and dispatching specially trained community facilitators from the Justice Department, aides and officials told The Associated Press.The jury resumed deliberations Tuesday morning after spending a few hours Monday discussing the case behind closed doors. In closing arguments earlier in the day, a prosecutor told jurors that Chauvin “had to know” he was squeezing the life out of George Floyd as he cried over and over that he couldn’t breathe and finally fell silent. Chauvin faces murder and manslaughter charges.The plans for possible presidential remarks are still fluid, with the timing, venue and nature of the remarks still being considered, in part depending on the timing of the verdict, according to two White House aides who were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The White House has been warily watching the trial proceed in Minneapolis — and then another shooting of a Black man by a white police officer last week — and are preparing for the possibility of unrest if a guilty verdict is not reached in the trial. Biden may also speak after a guilty verdict, the White House aides said.Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, told NBC's “Today” show that Biden “knows how it is to lose a family member ... so he was just letting us know that he was praying for us and hoping that everything would come out to be OK.”The verdict — and the aftermath — will be a test for Biden, who has pledged to help combat racism in policing, helping African Americans who supported him in large numbers last year in the wake of protests that swept the nation after Floyd’s death and restarted a national conversation about race. But he also has long projected himself as an ally of police, who are struggling with criticism about long-used tactics and training methods and difficulties in recruitment.Psaki said Monday that the White House has had a “range of conversations” about preparations for the upcoming verdict and added, “Our objective is to ensure there is space for peaceful protest."“Of course we’ll let the jury deliberate and we’ll wait for the verdict to come out before we say more about our engagements,” Psaki said.Psaki said administration officials have been in contact with leaders in Minnesota and in other cities and states that saw unrest after Floyd’s death last year.She declined to answer if Biden would be “disappointed” if a not guilty verdict was reached. She said that Americans could expect to hear from the president soon after the verdict, no matter what it is.Judge Pete Cahill said on Monday after closing argument were done, rejecting a defense request for a mistrial based in part on comments from California Rep. Maxine Waters, who said “we’ve got to get more confrontational” if Chauvin isn’t convicted of murder. He framed it as politicians in general.“I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function," said Cahill. "I think if they want to give their opinions, they should do so in a respectful and in a manner that is consistent with their oath to the Constitution to respect a coequal branch of government. Their failure to do so, I think, is abhorrent."Meanwhile, the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have been working with local officials to support law enforcement as they prepare for the possibility of unrest after the verdict, officials said.And the Justice Department has also dispatched specially trained community facilitators ahead of a verdict, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the plans publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The officials, part of the Justice Department’s Community Relations Service, tout themselves as “America’s Peacemaker” by mediating disputes in communities and holding listening sessions to help prevent future conflicts.A federal civil rights investigation, separate from the trial, remains ongoing. Several witnesses were subpoenaed earlier this year to appear before a federal grand jury considering charges against Chauvin.The Justice Department’s civil rights investigation has been focused on Chauvin and some of the witnesses, including other officers who worked with Chauvin, people familiar with the matter have told the AP.Chauvin was prepared to plead guilty to third-degree murder in George Floyd’s death before then-Attorney General William Barr personally blocked the plea deal last year. Barr rejected the deal in part because he felt it was too soon, as the investigation into Floyd’s death was still in its relative infancy, law enforcement officials said.Across the country, police departments are also preparing for the possibility of rioting or other unrest, with some canceling vacation time and increasing the number of officers available for shifts. The federal government hasn't detailed its plan in the event of widespread or sustained civil unrest.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that there has been a request from officials in Washington, D.C., for D.C. National Guard forces in the event there is civil unrest in the nation's capital, and it is currently being reviewed by the Army. He said the Army secretary has the authority to approve any request for D.C. National Guard but did not have details on the request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-praying-for-right-verdict-in-chauvin-trial-says-evidence-overwhelming-101618936626683.html

But it has faced occasional criticism over issues such as complaints of battery fires.Monday's incident led state broadcaster CCTV to call for an investigation of reported brake problems on Tesla cars, while China's anti-graft watchdog weighed in with a commentary saying such disputes should be resolved within the rule of law."Individuals should not take extreme measures, and enterprises should not be arrogant and unreasonable," the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said late on Tuesday.Tesla said on Monday that the woman was a vehicle owner who had been involved in a collision earlier this year. It cited "speeding violations" for the crash, adding in a social media statement that it had been negotiating with her about returning the car, but the talks had stalled over a third-party inspection.Zhang and Li could not be contacted for comment.The incident continued to attract social media attention on Tuesday, accounting for two of the top 10 trending topics on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.Last month, Tesla came under scrutiny in China when the military banned its cars from entering its complexes, citing security concerns over cameras in its vehicles, sources told Reuters.That prompted founder Elon Musk to say that if Tesla used cameras to spy in China or anywhere, it would be shut down. Earlier this month, Tesla said cameras in its cars are not activated outside of North America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-woman-s-tesla-protest-prompts-5-day-detention-company-apology-101618936619706.html

Now in place for 13 months, they are being renewed month by month. Mexico said late on Monday it was maintaining some of its border restrictions, too."We are guided by science and public health data and engaged in discussions with Canada and Mexico about easing restrictions as health conditions improve," the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Twitter.The restrictions have hit many border communities and businesses hard. Many U.S. lawmakers have urged loosening the restrictions or setting a road map to resuming normalized travel.Canada continues to lag the United States on vaccinations, and much of the country is now fighting a virulent third wave of the disease with school and business closures.Canada's required three-day hotel quarantine following testing at airports, which was introduced as a temporary measure to discourage spring break travel, was also extended to May 21, health authorities said.Canada began testing international air arrivals in February, and requiring them to pay for a three-day hotel quarantine themselves, a measure criticized by airlines hit hard by the pandemic.Air travelers are also are required to have had a test within three days of departure. If the airport text comes back negative, they can finish a 14-day quarantine at home.However, data obtained by Reuters showed that more than 1,000 passengers, or 1.5% of those who arrived from Feb 22 to March 25, tested positive for Covid-19, casting doubt over a broad easing of restrictions before the summer travel season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadaus-land-border-restrictions-hotel-quarantine-extended-101618936610699.html

"Right now I'm feeling very good."Mexico's health regulator said earlier this month that it did not plan to limit the use of the two-shot vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, but was looking into information from Britain's vaccine advisory committee.The committee has said an alternative to AstraZeneca should be given to people under 30 where possible.Mexico began vaccinations late last year and has so far fully inoculated nearly 4 million people, most of whom are adults over 60, out of a total population of 126 million.Officials plan to soon roll out vaccinations for adults over 50 and teachers, just as infection rates in 10 states start to trend higher following Easter week celebrations.Mexico as of February had agreed to buy 77.4 million AstraZeneca doses, making the drugmaker its top vaccine provider. It will also receive AstraZeneca shots through the COVAX vaccine-sharing program, which will supply a total of 51.5 million doses from various manufacturers.Additionally, Mexico has agreed to bottle AstraZeneca shots using vaccine material produced in Argentina, with an initial supply of 150 million doses to be distributed in Latin America.A Mexican official said in March that the first doses were expected to be shipped the first week of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-president-touts-no-risks-as-he-receives-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101618934747656.html
20-04-2021||World||British PM Boris Johnson launches search for Covid-19 antiviral treatments||Britain is launching a search for antivirals to treat Covid-19 with the aim of having at least two effective at-home treatments by the end of the year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday.Johnson has hailed the advent of Covid-19 vaccines and regular testing as the keys to restoring normality by summer, but his government is also supporting research into therapeutics to help in the fight against the pandemic."Our new Antivirals Taskforce will seek to develop innovative treatments you can take at home to stop Covid-19 in its tracks," Johnson said."These could provide another vital defence against any future increase in infections and save more lives."The government hopes that new treatments could be taken at home after a positive test or exposure to the coronavirus in order to reduce transmission and speed up recovery, and they would further bolster a range of therapeutics already available.Research by British scientists has established that both steroid dexamethasone and tocilizumab, an arthritis drug developed by Roche, reduced the risk of death in patients with severe Covid-19.Patrick Vallance, the government's Chief Scientific Adviser, said that antivirals in tablet form could help protect people who could not have vaccines, and be a layer of defence in the face of new coronavirus variants of concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-launches-search-for-covid-19-antiviral-treatments-101618934752680.html
20-04-2021||World||Pilot views obstructed, alerts missing in midair plane crash||The pilots of two Alaskan sightseeing planes that collided in midair couldn't see the other aircraft because airplane structures or a passenger blocked their views, and they didn't get electronic alerts about close aircraft because safety systems weren't working properly.That's what the staff of the National Transportation Safety board found in their investigation of the May 2019 crash, which killed six people.The board is meeting Tuesday in Washington to determine a probable cause of the crash and make recommendations to prevent it from happening again.Mountain Air Service pilot Randy Sullivan and his four passengers, and a passenger in a plane owned by Taquan Air were killed. Ten people suffered injuries when the aircraft converged at 3,350 feet (1,021 meters).The Ketchikan-based floatplanes carrying passengers from the same cruise ship, the Royal Princess, were returning from tours of Misty Fjords National Monument.Mountain Air’s single-engine de Havilland DHC-2 MK 1 Beaver and Taquan’s larger turboprop de Havilland DHC-3 Otter collided just after noon over the west side of George Inlet.Aircraft rely on “see and avoid” by pilots to prevent midair crashes, the staff said. But the crash occurred on a clear day in the afternoon.Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said the “see and avoid” system doesn’t work well in high traffic areas where the sight-seeing planes were traveling.Chairman Robert Sumwalt read a statement of probable cause, which has not yet been approved by the board. He said the pilots didn’t see each other in time to avoid a collision. Contributing factors included “preoccupation with matters unrelated to duties such as attempting to provide passengers with a scenic view and physiological limits on the human vision, reducing the time opportunity to see-and-avoid other aircraft,” he said.Staff members told the board the Otter pilot recalled seeing a white and red flash, then a tremendous collision.The Beaver pilot’s view would have been obstructed by the airplane’s structure and a passenger seated to his right during the critical moments before the crash. The Otter pilot’s view was obscured by a window post, the staff said.William Bramble, the NTSB’s human performance specialist, told the board that both planes were equipped with systems that track other planes, but visual and audible alerts weren’t working in either plane due to malfunctions.“The Otter pilot seemed to miss seeing the target (the other plane) on the display because he last recalled looking at the display about four minutes before the collision,” Bramble said.Documents released earlier by the NTSB show the propeller of the Taquan Otter hit the other aircraft, leaving deep cuts later documented by investigators. The tail of the Mountain Air plane hit the left side of the Taquan aircraft, popping open a door.The leg of a passenger sitting near the door was sucked outside the plane as other passengers held him in place, witnesses said.Otter Pilot Lou Beck estimated his plane took five seconds to hit the water 10 miles (16 kilometers) northeast of Ketchikan.At least three people could be heard saying, “brace brace brace,” on a camera recording audio before the Taquan plane hit the water.The Mountain Air Beaver plane broke up in flight, scattering debris across 3,000 feet (914 meters).Mountain Air Service closed after the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilot-views-obstructed-alerts-missing-in-midair-plane-crash-101618933697693.html
20-04-2021||World||US unveils plan to protect power grid from foreign hackers||The White House unveiled on Tuesday a 100-day plan intended to protect the US power grid from cyber-attacks, mainly by creating a stronger relationship between US national security agencies and the mostly private utilities that run the electrical system.The plan is among the first big steps toward fulfilling the Biden administration’s promise to urgently improve the country’s cyber defenses. The nation’s power system is both highly vulnerable to hacking and a target for nation-state adversaries looking to counter the US advantage in conventional military and economic power.“The United States faces a well-documented and increasing cyber threat from malicious actors seeking to disrupt the electricity Americans rely on to power our homes and businesses,” Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said.Although the plan is billed as a 100-day sprint -- which includes a series of consultations between utilities and the government -- it will likely take years to fully implement, experts say. It will ask utilities to pay for and install technology to better detect hacks of the specialized computers that run the country’s power systems, known as industrial control systems.While an early draft had proposed helping small utilities and rural co-ops pay for the new monitoring, the final version is more vague about whether the money will come from the federal government or be passed to customers in the form of higher utility bills. Large utilities often have sophisticated security teams and pay for cutting edge monitoring technology, but it’s unclear how enthusiastically smaller utilities will take on the cost of additional security.The government will take suggestions from utilities within 21 days about ways to incentivize participation in the voluntary effort, according to details of the plan described by a person familiar with it.The final plan also drops the draft’s proposal for enhancing supply chain security for grid components by calling for a list of recommended equipment vendors. Now, the administration plans to ask utilities for suggestions for improvement.Experts say initiatives to enhance the security of the US electrical grid are years behind better-known efforts to shield data centres and corporate systems. At the same time, hackers from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are launching increasingly aggressive attacks on US power companies, hoping to install malware that could leave cities and towns in the dark.Under the new plan, owners and operators of electricity networks are now expected to “enhance their detection, mitigation and forensic capabilities,” according to the Department of Energy statement. They would also need to share information with the federal government if something happens to their systems. Priority sites will need to identify and report their technology capabilities, gaps and requirements within 45 days of the launch.CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, will establish a team of government and agency representatives to coordinate analysis between the government and private sector.“The safety and security of the American people depend on the resilience of our nation’s critical infrastructure,” said acting CISA director Brandon Wales, in a statement. The partnership would “prove a valuable pilot as we continue our work to secure industrial control systems across all sectors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unveils-plan-to-protect-power-grid-from-foreign-hackers-101618931230684.html
20-04-2021||World||Tokyo to ask Japanese govt to declare state of emergency due to Covid-19: Report||Tokyo has decided to ask the Japanese government to declare a state of emergency, Mainichi newspaper reported, as authorities step up restrictions to contain a surge in coronavirus infections ahead of an Olympics just three months away.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has told ruling Liberal Democratic Party Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai she plans to seek the designation for the capital, the report said, without saying where it obtained the information. The city will make the final decision after a virus panel meeting on Thursday, it said. Covid-19 cases in the city have in recent days surged to levels not seen since late January, when the capital was under its second state of emergency.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government stepped up restrictions this month in Tokyo, Osaka and other regions to slow the spread, imposing measures that call on bars and restaurants to close by 8 p.m., and those that fail to comply face fines.Tokyo may be looking to ratchet up restrictions even more by asking restaurants to close if a state of emergency is declared, TV network TBS reported, without saying where it obtained the information. This would be the strictest measure under an emergency so far in Japan, but such a move could raise the risk of a double dip recession and deal a heavy blow to thousands of eateries struggling to survive.Civil liberties enshrined in the Japanese Constitution prevent imposing a lockdown backed by police action, as has been seen in other nations.Tokyo’s single-day virus cases jumped by 70% in just two weeks to 759 on Saturday, a sign the capital is following Osaka, the second largest metropolitan area where daily cases have hit record highs this month. There is no law that prohibits the Olympics from taking place under an emergency, but it will likely impact the number of domestic spectators allowed, a decision that’s expected this month. Overseas fans are already banned from the event.The surge in cases has further soured Japanese public support for the Olympics, which would be one the biggest global events of the pandemic era, with more than 70% surveyed by broadcaster ANN over the weekend saying they were against holding the Games in July.Japan’s vaccine rollout will be far from complete before the Olympics, which will draw more than 60,000 athletes, coaches, national team staff, media and other essential workers from more than 200 countries. Immunizations of people aged over 65, which began this month, might not be finished until next year due to insufficient cooperation from medical personnel in some regions, the Nikkei newspaper cited ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Hakubun Shimomura as saying Monday.Despite the rising numbers in Japan, the country has by far the fewest recorded Covid-19 cases of any Group of Seven country. Its death tally has also been among the lowest in the group at about 9,650, well below the some 128,000 in the UK, which has a population about the half the size of Japan’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-to-ask-japanese-govt-to-declare-state-of-emergency-due-to-covid-19-report-101618926798392.html

In about a week, they are expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops," Kuleba told an online news conference."This does not mean they will stop building up their forces at that number," Kuleba said, warning of what he said was Moscow's unpredictability although he said Ukraine did not want conflict with Russia.The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Monday that Russia had concentrated more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine's border and in Crimea.Kuleba also called for Moscow to re-commit to a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has supported separatist forces in a conflict that began in 2014.Russia has said the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from NATO. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.Kuleba attended a video conference with EU foreign ministers and said he openly "called on colleagues to start considering a new round of sectoral sanctions against Russia".He said he did not feel EU ministers were ready for such a move but he told them that individual sanctions on Russian officials were insufficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-will-soon-have-over-120-000-troops-on-ukraine-s-borders-kyiv-says-101618927206637.html

20-04-2021||World||Europe regulator to rule on J&J shot as EU vows increased Covid-19 doses||Europe's drug regulator was expected to rule Tuesday on the safety of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine after fears it could be linked to extremely rare blood clots, as the US drugmaker said it was "very confident" in its shot.The announcement was expected as an EU official promised to have enough vaccines in hand to inoculate the majority of European adults by the summer -- a boon for the continent's sluggish rollout.The United States is also expected to announce its decision on the single-shot J&J vaccine by Friday, as nations around the world try to accelerate their rollouts and revive their pandemic-ravaged economies.The American drugmaker said Tuesday it was "very confident" in its vaccine, speaking ahead of a European Medicines Agency (EMA) briefing about very rare cases of blood clots reported among people who got the J&J shot.The number of reported clots were "extremely small" compared with the millions of J&J shots administered worldwide, the EMA has said.That comparison echoes the comments by top US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, who described the clots as "an extraordinarily rare event".Fauci said this week he believed the US would resume use of the jab, possibly with some restrictions or warnings.A top Johnson & Johnson executive said Tuesday he was confident in the jab and that he hopes for a speedy resolution to the current pause."We remain very confident and very hopeful that the benefit-risk profile will play out," J&J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told CNBC.The company hopes "very shortly ... perhaps as early as the end of this week, to have some resolution with how we are going to proceed," he added.The J&J vaccine concerns follow similar reports of blood clots in a very small number of people who received the AstraZeneca shot.The EMA described those clots as a "very rare" side effect, stressing that the AstraZeneca jab's benefits outweigh the risks.The leaders of Europe are keen to accelerate vaccinations and expand availability after facing intense criticism over a sluggish rollout and with the public desperate for a return to some degree of normality.A senior EU official said Tuesday the bloc will have enough vaccine doses in hand to cover 70 percent of its adult population by mid-July, after the bloc struggled to secure supplies from drugmakers."I am now certain of how many doses are currently in production and I know how many millions will be delivered each week," internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton told French daily Le Figaro in an interview."This allows me to assure you that we well have by mid-July the number of doses necessary for vaccinating 70 percent of the European Union's adult population."- Crisis in India -India, home to 1.3 billion people, is battling a worrying surge, with record daily case numbers overwhelming already stretched hospitals and medical supplies.Its capital New Delhi was locked down Monday for a week, and the government said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine from May as it tries to get a grip on the spike.The Delhi lockdown follows the strict restrictions already imposed in other Indian states.The US Centers for Disease Control on Monday advised against all travel to India because of the Covid-19 crisis, and the UK imposed restrictions on arrivals from the country.The brutal wave has dramatically increased the workload for crematoriums and gravediggers, with social media and newspapers flooded with horrifying images of row upon row of burning pyres.The chimney of one electric furnace in the western city of Ahmedabad cracked and collapsed after being in constant use for up to 20 hours a day for the past two weeks.And the iron frames inside another in Surat melted because there was no time to let the furnaces cool.At a cemetery in New Delhi, gravedigger Shamim told AFP: "At this rate, I will run out of space in three or four days."Concerns about a spike were growing in Japan too, where its third-most populated region Osaka on Tuesday will ask the central government to impose a state of emergency.Tokyo and several other areas are expected to follow suit, hoping to avoid the crisis in Osaka, where hospital beds for coronavirus patients in severe condition have run out.- Vaccine inequality -There are concerns that vaccine inequality between wealthy and poor nations will further complicate and prolong the pandemic.Climate activist Greta Thunberg became the latest high-profile figure to criticise the lopsided distribution, describing vaccine inequity as a "tragedy".Mass vaccinations are considered key for resuming regular life and economic activity, especially travel.But the World Health Organization's emergency committee said it was against international passengers being required to have proof of vaccination -- a proposal being mulled by numerous countries.The committee said such requirements would "deepen inequities and promote differential freedom of movement" because of the uneven global vaccine rollout.But the threat of the virus being spread by international travellers was brought into sharp focus in Hong Kong, where at least 53 passengers on a single flight from India tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-regulator-to-rule-on-j-j-shot-as-eu-vows-increased-covid-19-doses-101618925302863.html
20-04-2021||World||US takes steps to protect electric system from cyberattacks||The Biden administration is taking steps to protect the country's electric system from cyberattacks through a new 100-day initiative combining federal government agencies and private industry.The initiative, announced Tuesday by the Energy Department, encourages owners and operators of power plants and electric utilities to improve their capabilities for identifying cyber threats to their networks. It includes concrete milestones for them to put into use technologies so they can spot and respond to intrusions in real time.The department is soliciting input from electric utilities, energy companies, government agencies and others for recommendations about how to safeguard the energy system supply chain.The effort underscores the heightened concern about the prospects for cyberattacks that disrupt the nation's power supply. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said in an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month that the administration was undertaking a new effort to help electric utilities, water districts and other critical industries protect against potentially damaging attacks.The U.S. “faces a well-documented and increasing cyber threat from malicious actors seeking to disrupt the electricity Americans rely on to power our homes and businesses,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-takes-steps-to-protect-electric-system-from-cyberattacks-101618920253596.html
20-04-2021||World||China ties with Japan, Korea to deepen amid new focus: Moody’s||China’s strategy to boost technological self-reliance won’t stop its economic integration with Japan and South Korea, but the inward shift increasingly will put it in competition with its key trading partners, according to Moody’s Investors Service.Booming trade has helped power China’s development since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. For the next phase of the country’s development, President Xi Jinping proposed a “dual circulation” strategy last year under which “internal circulation” will be the mainstay of the economy, with “external circulation” as a complement.The recent five-year plan fleshes out the strategy, aiming to boost R&D spending by at least 7% per year over the next five years and raise the contribution from core digital economy industries to 10% of gross domestic product by 2025, from 7.8% last year.China already is South Korea’s top export destination -- taking one-quarter of the country’s shipments in 2019 -- and the second largest for Japan, absorbing 20% of its exports, according to Moody’s.At least initially, the dual-circulation strategy will mean greater access for Japanese and Korean companies in high value-added sectors, Moody’s wrote in a research note. Coupled with China’s huge market potential, that will further deepen the countries’ economic integration.“We expect China to continue to increase its imports for some critical technology goods or attract direct investments from Korea and Japan to localize production intended for the Chinese market,” analysts led by Lillian Li wrote.Cooperation and CompetitionCloser economic ties could help all three countries address structural issues such as aging populations, rising labor costs and slowing productivity. Japan’s and South Korea’s security ties with the U.S. could cause friction, but “even if heightened geopolitical tensions complicate the relationship between the three countries, it will not reverse the ongoing economic integration,” Moody’s wrote.Longer term, though, China’s reliance on imported components is expected to decline. Key sectors the government wants to enhance include integrated circuits, advanced machinery, medical and transportation equipment, aviation and robotics -- areas where China could be in direct competition with South Korea and Japan over the next five to 10 years, both locally and in other export markets.“Japanese and Korean companies in some high-tech sectors will benefit from China’s growing demand for their products but competition is likely to grow from Chinese companies, which enjoy strong policy support from the government,” Moody’s wrote.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ties-with-japan-korea-to-deepen-amid-new-focus-moodys-101618908251584.html

The central bank expects the economy will expand by around 3% in the year to June, after a rare contraction in the previous 12 months.Qureshi started a three-day official visit to the UAE on Saturday, while his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was due to arrive in the nation on Sunday, government officials said. The two were due to meet separately with their Emirati counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, weeks after it was revealed the Gulf monarchy had brokered secret talks between the rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-gets-payment-relief-as-uae-rolls-over-2-billion-loan-101618923268619.html
20-04-2021||World||In a dig at West, China’s Xi warns against ‘bossing’ and ‘meddling’||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday called for a rejection of hegemonic powers in global governance, saying there should be no “bossing” and “meddling” in another country’s affairs.The Chinese president’s statement comes amid rising China-US tensions over wide-ranging issues, including Beijing’s role in Xinjiang, Taiwan and Hong Kong. In state-to-state relations, the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutual trust must be put front and centre, Xi said.“Bossing others around or meddling in others’ internal affairs would not get one any support,” Xi said, addressing the annual Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) over video link.Xi criticised efforts by some countries - without naming any - to “build barriers” and “decouple”, which he said would harm others and benefit no one.“Big countries should behave in a manner befitting to their status and with a greater sense of responsibility,” Xi added.“The Covid-19 pandemic has made it all the more clear to people around the world that we must reject the Cold War and zero-sum mentality and oppose a new Cold War and ideological confrontation in whatever forms,” Xi said.Notwithstanding a patch of common ground on the fight against the climate crisis, US President Joe Biden has been working on uniting allies such as the UK, the EU and Japan on countering China. Last month, Biden held the first summit of the Quad, comprising the US, India, Australia and Japan.Marking the 20th anniversary of the BFA, referred to as Asia’s answer to the World Economic Forum in Davos, this year’s annual conference is themed “A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation”.The Chinese president said his country will never enter an arms race.“China will continue to carry out anti-Covid cooperation with the World Health Organization and other countries, honour its commitment of making vaccines a global public good, and do more to help developing countries defeat the virus. However strong it may grow, China will never seek hegemony, expansion, or a sphere of influence. Nor will China ever engage in an arms race,” Xi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-dig-at-west-china-s-xi-warns-against-bossing-and-meddling-101618925918264.html
20-04-2021||World||Facebook Messenger users hit by scammers in over 80 countries: Report||Group-IB, a global threat hunting and adversary-centric cyber intelligence company have detected a large-scale scam campaign targeting Facebook Messenger users all over the world.Group-IB Digital Risk Protection (DRP) analysts have found evidence proving that users in over 80 countries in Europe, Asia, the MEA region, North and South America might have been affected, the company said in a release. "By distributing ads promoting an allegedly updated version of Facebook Messenger, cybercriminals harvested users' login credentials," the company said.The cyber intelligence company has discovered about 1,000 fake Facebook accounts distributing links to an allegedly updated version of Facebook Messenger. Users who followed the link would then be redirected to a fake Facebook Messenger website with a login form, through which cyber criminals harvested users' credentials.According to the intelligence company, scammers used official Facebook logos and shortened link names that resembled the real ones. Group-IB said that the social media giant itself has nothing to do with the scheme.The scale of the scam has grown substantially over the past several months, the company noted. As of April, investigative team found 5,600 Facebook posts inviting users to install the fake "latest Messenger update," Sputnik reported.Group-IB's DRP analysts have found scam ads targeted at users in at least 84 countries worldwide, including Canada, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Malaysia, and South Africa.Users who fell victim to this scheme risk leaking their personal data and have their account hijacked, the company said."Scammers, in turn, are likely to use the compromised account to either blackmail the victim, pushing them to pay a ransom to have access to their account restored, or further scale up the scheme using the Facebook profile to distribute scam ads," the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-messenger-users-hit-by-scammers-in-over-80-countries-report-101618925448408.html
20-04-2021||World||Killer in Indianapolis FedEx shooting browsed white supremacist websites: Police||The gunman who killed eight workers at an Indianapolis FedEx facility appeared to browse white supremacist websites about a year before the attack, police said.The attacker, Brandon Hole, also killed himself in last Thursday's attack, and four of his victims were members of the Sikh religious community.In March 2020, Hole's family asked police to intervene when he purchased a gun and threatened to commit suicide."I am going to point this unloaded gun at the police and they will shoot me," he told his mother, according to Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department's incident report.When the police arrived at their home, one of the officers said he had noticed that Hole had white supremacist websites opened on his computer.The police report said an officer "clearing the upstairs and securing the shotgun observed what through his training and experience indicated was white supremacist websites."Police then seized Hole's gun, and he was sent to a local hospital for mental health assessment.Police had said previously that Hole legally bought two semiautomatic rifles used during last week's shooting, months after he had been in psychiatric detention.Authorities are continuing to investigate the incident and Hole's motivation.A trace by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives turned up the two legal purchases last July and September by Hole, 19, a former employee at the FedEx facility.Prosecutors had not used Indiana's red-flag law, intended to prevent people from buying or possessing firearms if they are found to be an imminent risk to themselves or others, since Hole had surrendered the gun and there had been no overt violent act, said Ryan Mears, prosecutor for Marion County, which includes Indianapolis.Mears said gaps in the red-flag law in effect negated efforts to keep guns out of shooters' hands, Fox-affiliated television station Fox 59 reported https://fox59.com/news/marion-county-prosecutor-discusses-red-flag-status-of-fedex-shooting-suspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/killer-in-indianapolis-fedex-shooting-browsed-white-supremacist-websites-police-101618920280634.html
20-04-2021||World||France urges rebuke for Syria over chemical weapons use||A group of 46 nations called Tuesday on member states of the global chemical weapons watchdog to diplomatically rebuke Syria for using toxic gas and nerve agents in the country's decade-long civil war.French Ambassador Luis Vassy proposed stripping Syria of its voting rights at the annual meeting of members of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.“We owe this to the Syrian people,” Vassy said.The proposal, which has support from countries that include the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, is expected to be put to a vote Wednesday morning.Vassy said Syria's use of prohibited chemical weapons was “irrefutable,” and he urged OPCW member states to back his attempt to strip Damascus of its rights, saying “we cannot let indifference win.”Syria, which joined the organization in 2013 after being threatened with air strikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of the country's capital, denounced the move as a “propaganda tool” and denied using chemical weapons.After joining the OPCW, Syria declared its stockpile of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals, which were then removed from the country. Questions have remained, however, about chemicals and production facilities that may not have been identified.An investigation mechanism set up by the OPCW has twice blamed Syrian government forces for chemical attacks.Last week, the organization said its investigative team found “reasonable grounds to believe” that a Syrian air force military helicopter dropped a chlorine cylinder on a Syrian town in 2018, sickening 12 people.The team found last year reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Air Force was responsible for attacks using chlorine and the nerve agent sarin in March 2017 in the town of Latamneh.The investigative team was established after Russia blocked the extension of a joint investigation mechanism set up by the United Nations and OPCW in 2015. That team accused Syria of chemical weapons attacks, including unleashing sarin in an aerial attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that killed about 100 people.Meanwhile, a group of Syrians living in Sweden have joined with an international human rights organization to file a criminal complaint against the Syrian government for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In a statement, they said the government used sarin gas against civilians in 2013 and 2017 and that “hundreds were killed and many more received serious injuries, including children.”Syrian victims and civil society organizations Civil Rights Defenders, Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), Syrian Archive and the Open Society Justice Initiative brought the criminal complaint.“The government has strategically used chemical weapons as a tool to wear out the civilian population living in opposition-controlled areas and to suppress any resistance against the regime,” Aida Samani, a legal adviser at Civil Rights Defenders, said. “It is unacceptable that those responsible for these heinous attacks are enjoying absolute impunity.”____Associated Press writer Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen, Denmark contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-urges-rebuke-for-syria-over-chemical-weapons-use-101618921873214.html
20-04-2021||World||China censors ex-premier's article ahead of Communist Party anniversary||Chinese internet firms blocked users from sharing a lengthy article written by former Premier Wen Jiabao in tribute to his late mother, censoring a senior member of the ruling Communist Party, possibly because he spoke out of line.The obituary-style article written by Wen about his mother, who died recently, appeared in a small weekly newspaper called the Macau Herald on Friday and was posted on a public account on Chinese chat app WeChat on Saturday, but was swiftly restricted.The heartfelt tribute includes details of Wen's mother's struggle during periods of upheaval in China, including the second Sino-Japanese War and the political purges of the Cultural Revolution."In my mind, China should be a country full of fairness and justice, always with a respect for the will of the people, humanity, and human nature," said Wen's article, which did not directly discuss China's current political environment.China's ruling Communist Party (CCP) has sought to tighten control over how netizens discuss history on the country's heavily controlled internet in the run-up to the 100th anniversary of the party's founding, in July.Under President Xi Jinping, the space for dissent in China has narrowed, while censorship has expanded.Wu Qiang, an independent political analyst in Beijing, said the article represented an "alternative voice from within the party" that is out of step with efforts of the last few years to stifle dissent."The power of this article by Wen is that it challenges that, and this is the main reason why it has been banned from being shared," he said, noting the party's sensitivity around its anniversary.Last week, an arm of China's cyber regulator launched a hotline for netizens to report "illegal" comments that "distorted" the Party's historical achievements and attacked the country's leadership.When users tried to share Wen's article, a notice appeared saying that the content went against WeChat's regulations and could not be shared, a common censorship measure in China that is one step below purging articles completely.On Weibo, the Chinese social media site similar to Twitter, there was scant mention of the article, and comments and sharing functions had been disabled. Links to articles on Wen's tribute posted on Weibo returned "404" messages on Tuesday morning, indicating they had been deleted.The operators of WeChat and Weibo, as well as China's internet regulator, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Former Chinese leaders and high-profile politicians rarely cultivate public personas or share detailed biographical information in their retirement, and are expected to slip gracefully from the limelight.Since assuming power in 2012, Xi's signature policies have been cemented in the party constitution and term limits abolished, putting him almost on par with Communist China's founder Mao Zedong in the pantheon of its leaders.Wen, who was premier under former Chinese leader Hu Jintao, was a leading figure behind the country's economic policies in the 2000s, and left office in 2013 when he was succeeded by current Premier Li Keqiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-censors-ex-premier-s-article-ahead-of-communist-party-anniversary-101618919646424.html

We must advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values of humanity, and encourage exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations to promote the progress of human civilization," Xi said, without directly referring to the US."What we need in today's world is justice, not hegemony," he said addressing the annual Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), a China promoted influential think tank based in Hainan via video link."Big countries should behave in a manner befitting to their status and with a greater sense of responsibility," he said.His snide remark against Washington came as US President Joe Biden vigorously pursued a strong China containment policy initiated by his predecessor by Donald Trump.Biden united US allies like the UK, the EU and Japan over his China policy. He also held the first quadrilateral summit of the emerging alliance called Quad which included US, Australia, Japan and India.The US, the European Union, Britain and Canada have imposed coordinated sanctions on China over alleged human rights violations against Uygur Muslims in Xinjiang, a charge Beijing denied.These countries have also taken united position on China firming up its control over Hong Kong with its new national security law subduing the massive pro-democracy agitation in the former British colony.Those who attended BFA meeting including Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.Xi, in his address, also called on all countries in Asia and beyond to answer the "call of our times," defeat the pandemic through solidarity, strengthen global governance, and keep pursuing a community with a shared future for mankind.Marking the 20th anniversary of the BFA, this year's annual conference is themed "A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation.""Global governance should reflect the evolving political and economic landscape in the world, conform to the historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation, and meet the practical needs in addressing global challenges," Xi said.On creating a future of health and security with solidarity and cooperation, Xi said the key role of the World Health Organization (WHO) must be given full play in the ongoing fight against COVID-19.On climate change, Xi stressed the importance of following the philosophy of green development, advancing international cooperation and doing more to implement the Paris Agreement.Efforts should also be made to boost the digital economy, and step up exchanges and cooperation in areas such as artificial intelligence, biomedicine and modern energy, to turn the fruits of scientific and technological innovation into greater benefits for people in all countries, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-says-us-should-not-boss-and-meddle-in-other-s-internal-affairs-101618917834594.html

The cause of death was not yet clear.Army spokesman Azem Bermendao Agouna announced his death in a broadcast on state television, surrounded by a group of military officers he referred to as the National Council of Transition."A call to dialogue and peace is launched to all Chadians in the country and abroad in order to continue to build Chad together," he said."The National Council of Transition reassures the Chadian people that all measures have been taken to guarantee peace, security and the republican order."Western countries have seen Deby as an ally in the fight against Islamist extremist groups, including Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin and groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in the Sahel.Deby was also dealing with mounting public discontent over his management of Chad's oil wealth and crackdowns on opponents.His election victory had given him a sixth term in office but the April 11 vote was boycotted by opposition leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chad-president-idriss-deby-killed-on-front-lines-says-army-soon-after-poll-win-101618917652304.html

This number is increasing on a daily basis."He did not identify the 12 member states or say which countries were less comfortable with the 70% figure.An announcement last week that EU countries will receive 50 million more vaccines produced by Pfizer and BioNTech this quarter has given the executive additional comfort on its delivery targets, Breton said.It has also provided "room for manoeuvre" to cope with Breton's expectation that the bloc will initially have fewer Johnson & Johnson shots than hoped.He said he was also confident AstraZeneca will be able to deliver its reduced second quarter target of 70 million vaccines.Breton, who expressed hope recently that Europe will have a summer tourist season this year, said the vaccine target was important to provide "light at the end of the tunnel" before the holiday season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-12-eu-member-states-confident-of-july-vaccination-target-official-101618915565943.html

The drugs were being illegally brought into the country from the US - primarily from California - and also from India.York Regional Police (YRP), which led the investigation and the subsequent crackdown, said multiple agencies worked on the operation that “dismantled a large-scale international drug trafficking network that extended to western Canada, the United States and India”.Other law enforcement agencies that were part of the operation were from Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Peel Regional Police, and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).The investigation, named Project Cheetah, began in May last year and penetrated “a robust network” involved in importing large quantities of banned drugs into Canada. “The drugs were then distributed across the country through a sophisticated system run by the traffickers,” YRP said.On April 8, police in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia as well as in California executed over 50 search warrants, resulting in 33 people being charged with over 130 offences.Among them, 27 were arrested and charged in the Greater Toronto Area, with 19 of them hailing from the town of Brampton. Of these, 23 are of Punjabi origin. One suspect, Gurbinder Sooch, remains at large. In a video statement, inspector Ryan Hogan of the Organised Crime Enforcement Bureau of YRP, said Project Cheetah was a “transnational investigation into the importation and distribution of cocaine, heroin, opium and ketamine into Canada both from India and from California”. The charges include drug trafficking, conspiracy to traffic drugs and possession of proceeds from criminal activities.During the course of the operation, officers seized about 2.3 million Canadian dollars (US$1.84 million) worth of drugs that included 10kg of cocaine, 8kg of ketamine, 3kg of heroin and 2.5kg of opium. Investigators also seized 48 firearms and 730,000 Canadian dollars (US$582,882) in cash.“This drug trafficking network was active throughout the Greater Toronto Area and negatively impacted our communities,” said superintendent Dermot Coughlan of Peel Regional Police’s intelligence operations.Inspector Marwan Zogheib, officer in charge of RCMP’s Toronto West Detachment, said, “RCMP’s resources across Canada and overseas and our partnership with YRP provide a multiplier effect to our collective efforts to dismantle such criminal networks.”The Criminal Intelligence Service Ontario also supported this joint-forces investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-busts-major-drug-trafficking-ring-indo-canadians-among-dozens-charged-101618915537615.html

Bush said that he was “shocked” by people’s reaction over his friendship with former first lady Michelle Obama. During a CBS Sunday Morning show, Bush, a Republican, reflected on his across-the-aisle relationship with Michelle Obama as he recalled the memorable moment of the duo embracing at the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.They also grabbed headlines when Bush handed cough drops to Obama at the memorial service for late Senator John McCain and at the funeral for his father George H.W. Bush.“It shocked me,” the former president said, stressing that the polarisation among Americans has impacted their imagination."We got in the car and I think Barbara or Jenna said, 'Hey, you're trending!' The American people were so surprised that Michelle Obama and I could be friends. I think it's a problem that Americans are so polarised in their thinking that they can't imagine a George W. Bush and a Michelle Obama being friends," he added.Also Read: Trump shuns 'ex-presidents club' — and the feeling is mutualWhile Donald Trump made anti-immigrant rhetoric a centrepiece of his presidential campaign, Bush supports the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in case they pass background checks and pay back taxes. He told CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell that a more respectful attitude to those who come to the United States will help lead to reform of the immigration system.Michelle Obama had earlier opened up about her friendship with Bush, saying she found common ground with the former president despite contrasting views. In an interview with Jenna Bush Harger, Bush’s daughter, Obama said that they disagree on policy but not on humanity. "Our values are the same," she said."We disagree on policy but we don’t disagree on humanity. We don’t disagree about love and compassion. I think that’s true for all of us...I had the opportunity to sit next to your father at funerals – the highs and lows...We shared stories about our kids and about our parents," Obama added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-w-bush-shocked-by-reaction-over-his-friendship-with-michelle-obama-101618914056792.html

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that ministers would be making an announcement “shortly, taking into account the latest advice from the Climate Change Committee.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to host a major global climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow in November.Britain has already pledged to slash emissions by 68 per cent by 2030, one of the most ambitious targets among developed nations.The government's Climate Change Committee recommended the 2035 target last year, and said achieving it would require more electric vehicles, expanded wind power capacity and a reduction in meat and dairy consumption.Rebecca Newsom of Greenpeace UK welcomed the commitment, but said “targets are much easier to set than they are to meet, so the hard work begins now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-toughen-climate-target-before-us-president-joe-biden-s-summit-reports-101618914032390.html

20-04-2021||World||Iran says 60% enrichment meant to show nuclear prowess, is reversible||Iran began enriching uranium to 60% purity in order to show its technical capacity after a sabotage attack at a nuclear plant, and the move is quickly reversible if the United States lifts sanctions, the Iranian government said on Tuesday.Talks in Vienna aimed at bringing the United States and Iran back to full compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal have been further complicated by an explosion at Iran's main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.Iran has responded by saying it is enriching uranium to 60% fissile purity, a big step towards weapons-grade from the 20% it had previously achieved. The 2015 pact between Iran and world powers had capped the level of enrichment purity at 3.67% - suitable for generating civilian nuclear energy. Iran denies seeking a nuclear weapon."The start of 60% enrichment in Natanz was a demonstration of our technical ability to respond to terrorist sabotage at these facilities," Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters in Tehran."As in previous steps (in curbing Iran's commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal), ... this measure can quickly be reversed for a return to the agreed enrichment level in the nuclear accord if other parties commit to their obligations," Rabiei said, in remarks streamed live on a state-run website.Tehran says the Natanz blast was an act of sabotage by Israel, and on Saturday Iranian authorities named a suspect. Israel has not formally commented on the incident.Iran responded to the explosion by saying it is enriching uranium to 60%.Iran and world powers have made some progress on how to revive the 2015 nuclear accord later abandoned by the United States, and an interim deal could be a way to gain time for a lasting settlement, Iranian officials said on Monday.In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi told visiting British Cabinet Office Minister Michel Gove that Iran should not be permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon."Iran is undermining stability in the entire Middle East and the international community must act to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons capability. Not today and not in the future," an Israeli statement quoted Ashkenazi as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-60-enrichment-meant-to-show-nuclear-prowess-is-reversible-101618911741486.html

20-04-2021||World||Facebook takes on Clubhouse, unveils upcoming audio products||Facebook Inc CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday the company planned to launch several audio products, including Clubhouse-style live audio rooms and a way for users to find and play podcasts.Facebook's incursion into the audio market comes as the sudden explosion of interest in Clubhouse, an audio app where billionaires and celebrities including Tesla CEO Elon Musk have popped in to chat, could be waning. Downloads of the Clubhouse app, which is only available on Apple's iOS devices, suffered an estimated 70% decline in downloads in March from February when it hit a high.Zuckerberg said the world's largest social media network planned in the coming months to launch features including short-form audio clips called "Soundbites" and ways to create sound effects or improve audio quality. Facebook said in a blog post https://bit.ly/3e8FGsc it would begin to test live audio rooms, which would launch by the summer.Zuckerberg said Facebook was looking to "treat audio as a first-class medium in the way that we would photos or video" in an interview on Discord with Casey Newton, editor of newsletter Platformer.The rapid growth of the year-old app Clubhouse has demonstrated the potential of audio chat services.What is not clear is if Clubhouse, which just closed a new round of Series C funding in which a source said it was valued at $4 billion, will have staying power as installs decline.The app, which is not yet available on Android, faces competition from multiple companies working on Clubhouse clones. Twitter Inc is testing its live audio feature Spaces, along with new features from Discord, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, Slack and Spotify Technology.Reddit also unveiled a preview of its "Reddit Talks" product to moderators on Monday.Analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated Clubhouse had a 72% decline in growth from about 9.6 million February installs to about 2.4 million in March.Facebook, which has long been criticized for its handling of problematic content across its products, will face the challenges of moderating live and recorded audio content.Facebook said its live audio rooms would be available on its Messenger product and in its main app. It said it would test the rooms with public figures as well as in Groups - a product the company has vigorously promoted as providing places for people with common interests but which have also been used to spread misinformation and organize extremist activity.As part of the announcements, Zuckerberg also said Facebook is working with Spotify on "Project Boombox" to share and listen to music on its platform.Facebook said users would be able to send donations, or tips, to creators in live audio rooms through "Stars". After launch, it will offer other types of monetization like single-purchase access or subscription for rooms. It also announced an audio creator fund for Soundbites.The company is working to attract more creators who are accustomed to receiving tips and other direct payments from fans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-takes-on-clubhouse-unveils-upcoming-audio-products-101618911041283.html

Alaska was the first state to lower statewide eligibility to age 16 and was followed by states including Georgia, Texas and California.Earlier in April, U.S. President Joe Biden had directed states to widen the vaccine eligibility to people aged 18 or above by April 19. No Covid-19 vaccine is authorized yet for those under 16, although testing is underway.More than half of U.S. adults have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, according to CDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-expands-covid-19-vaccine-eligibility-to-16-and-older-101618911032619.html

The extremist group has been leading an anti-France campaign for months over President Emmanuel Macron’s defence of the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, an act considered blasphemous by Muslims.Pakistan watchers in India said the National Assembly’s recommendation to expel the French ambassador was a foregone conclusion since the political class in Islamabad would not want to anger the TLP.The radical group, formed in 2016, has emerged as one of Pakistan’s most hardline Islamist parties and has been pushing for strict implementation of Islamic sharia laws and death for blasphemers. PM Khan banned the group after it led street protests against the arrest of their leader, cleric Saad Rizvi. News agency AP said the TLP wants the government to expel the French ambassador under an agreement signed between the government and Rizvi’s party in February.To be sure, PM Khan sought to reach out to the protesters on Monday, underlining that he and the TLP shared the ultimate objective to end incidents of blasphemy across the world but had adopted a different approach. He tried to reason that expelling the French envoy would hurt Pakistan and would not help stop such incidents.“When we send the French ambassador back and break relations with them it means we break relations with the European Union,” he said in a televised address, according to a Pakistani newspaper, Dawn. “Half our textile exports go to the EU, so half our textile exports would be gone.”That appeal, which was also aimed at clarifying his government’s stand to the international community, however, couldn’t convince the TLP to back down. Over the last few weeks, the group has blocked highways, railways and access routes to major cities.Four police officers were killed, almost a dozen were taken hostage and more than 800 wounded, many of them seriously, during the clashes that followed.But Pakistan watchers in New Delhi said it was Imran Khan who lit the fire last October that had singed PM Khan’s credibility and encouraged groups that are challenging his authority. PM Khan was one of the few leaders in Muslim-majority countries to lead a campaign against President Macron for comments defending the “right to blaspheme” under freedom of expression; Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan was another.PM Khan, who was then seen to be aspiring for a leadership position in a new alliance of Islamic countries along with Turkey and Malaysia, wrote to leaders of Muslim-majority countries, asking them “to act collectively to counter growing Islamophobia in non-Muslim states”.Analysts said this initiative to placate the ultra-conservative groups in Pakistan and project himself as a defender of Islam abroad started to boomerang on him soon after.“I think the prime minister has realised that appeasing the radical forces isn’t an easy task because when you try to please them they demand more and more,” security analyst Amir Rana told news agency AFP. “So far he has failed to maintain the balance.”PM Khan, Indian officials suggest, isn’t the first one to play to the hardline extremist groups. Back in the eighties, military dictator President Zia-ul-Haq who ruled Pakistan for a decade tried the same strategy with equally disastrous results.“The Pakistani state has, over decades, actively fostered the ideology that led to the TLP and that leads many in the population to sympathise with the TLP,” said Madiha Afzal, a Brookings Institution fellow, said, according to AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-feels-the-bite-asks-parliament-to-decide-french-envoy-s-expulsion-101618910077328.html
20-04-2021||World||Navalny's personal doctor denied access to hospital where he is being treated||A team of medics including ailing Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's personal doctor were denied access Tuesday to a penal colony where he is being treated at a prison hospital.Navalny, 44, launched a hunger strike on March 31 and his medical team over the weekend warned that his health was failing so rapidly he could die at "any minute".Russia's prison service, which has repeatedly prevented Navalny's doctors from visiting him, on Monday moved him from his penal colony in the Vladimir region some 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Moscow to a medical facility at another colony in the same region.A team of physicians including his personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva has made multiple attempts to see him but been rejected each time.On Tuesday morning the team was once again barred from seeing him, but was told to try again later in the day."This is super disrespectful to people who came to fulfil their human duty, a medical duty to help a patient," Vasilyeva told AFP outside the colony."We are talking now only about health and life."Navalny's lawyers also arrived at the penal colony on Tuesday and were allowed in, an AFP journalist at the scene reported.Navalny is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for violating parole terms on old fraud charges he says are politically motivated.The opposition politician was arrested on his return to Russia in January from Germany, where he had spent months recovering from a poisoning attack with the Novichok nerve agent.Navalny blames the attack on President Vladimir Putin, a claim the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.The European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions on Russia over the poisoning, and on Monday threatened Moscow with further penalties in the event of Navalny's death.The opposition figure launched his hunger strike last month demanding proper medical treatment over severe back pain and numbness in his limbs.His team over the weekend said a blood test had shown showed high potassium levels and elevated creatinine, indicating Navalny could be suffering from impaired kidney function and risked cardiac arrest.Russia's prison service on Monday insisted his condition was "satisfactory", despite moving him to the medical facility, and said he was taking vitamin supplements as part of medical treatment.Navalny's team has called on supporters to take to the streets on Wednesday -- when Putin is due to deliver his annual state of the nation address -- to protest how he is being treated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalnys-personal-doctor-denied-access-to-hospital-where-he-is-being-treated-101618909438913.html

20-04-2021||World||EU expands sanctions against Myanmar military, companies controlled by army||The European Union expanded its sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders and army-controlled companies ahead of a regional meeting to discuss the worsening crisis after army leaders deposed the elected government.The Council of the European Union's latest sanctions target 10 individuals and two military-controlled companies already subject to sanctions by the US, Britain and other governments.It is unclear if such moves are having any impact as the military escalates its efforts to crush opposition to its seizure of power. Myanmar's economy is already in crisis, worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and by the mass civil disobedience movement that arose following the Feb. 1 coup.The EU said the number of individuals sanctioned was expanded to 35 people it said were responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, for repressive decisions and for serious human rights violations.The two military-controlled companies, Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company Ltd. (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corp. (MEC), have vast holdings in many industries and help to fund the military.All are subject to having their assets frozen, travel banned and other measures. EU citizens and businesses are banned from doing business or providing funds to them without special permission.“Today’s decision is a sign of the EU’s unity and determination in condemning the brutal actions of the military junta, and aims at effecting change in the junta’s leadership," the EU said in a statement.“Today’s decision also sends a clear message to the military leadership: continuing on the current path will only bring further suffering and will never grant any legitimacy," it said.Since the coup, security forces have killed at least 738 protesters and bystanders, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests. It says more than 3,200 people are still detained, among the nation's deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.The EU already had an embargo on sales to Myanmar of arms and equipment that can be used for internal repression; an export ban on dual-use goods for use by the military and border guard police; export restrictions on equipment for monitoring communications that could be used for internal repression, and a prohibition on military training for and military cooperation with the army.Last week, the US S&P 500 said it was removing India's Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. from its sustainability index due to its alleged dealings with Myanmar authorities. Adani did not respond to a request for comment on that move.Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday exhorted the UN Security Council to act immediately to halt the violence and protect civilians. So far, the council has not taken such action, which would likely be blocked by China and Russia.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations — which is holding a summit on Myanmar this month — maintains a policy of “non-interference'' in each others' political matters and has rejected the idea of imposing sanctions against the junta.Ban urged ASEAN to send a high-level delegation to Myanmar. He said he had tried unsuccessfully to make a diplomatic visit himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-expands-sanctions-against-myanmar-military-companies-controlled-by-army-101618908436675.html

He underlined that there needed to be respect for mutual concerns and sensitivities and for each other’s priorities,” a tweet by the Indian consulate general in Guangzhou said on the event.India and China have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the nearly year-long friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The 10th meeting of the senior military commanders was held on February 20 after the two sides completed the withdrawal of frontline troops with armoured formations and artillery from the banks of Pangong Lake.However, the two sides were unable to make progress on efforts to disengage at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains.The 11th round of military talks held on April 9 failed to resolve the differences.At the end of the 11th round, Beijing said the Chinese military will maintain diplomatic communication with its Indian counterpart to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the border region.“China hopes the Indian side can cherish the positive trend of de-escalation in the region and uphold the consensus reached by previous meetings, and work together with China to safeguard peace and tranquility in the area,” colonel Long Shaohua, who is with PLA’s western theatre command, was quoted as saying in a readout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deploys-advanced-rocket-launchers-in-western-theatre-command-101618901497262.html
20-04-2021||World||Memorial created in Ottawa to remember Indian diplomat K Sankara Pillai||A memorial has been created at the Indian high commission in Ottawa in memory of K Sankara Pillai, who was widely considered the first diplomat “martyr” of independent India.Pillai was assassinated on April 19, 1961 in Ottawa and the memorial marked the 60th anniversary of that tragedy. The consular waiting area at the high commission in the Canadian capital has been named after him as the K Sankara Pillai Memorial Hall. A sapling was planted on the high commission premises in his memory as well.Pillai was serving as the first secretary at the high commission in Ottawa when he was killed by Shani Ferizi, who was of Yugoslavian origin. Pillai had just finished lunch and had gone to greet Ferizi when he was gunned down. Ferizi had earlier been denied a visa to travel to India as he was blacklisted in the country.Pillai was 38 when he was killed and was survived by his pregnant wife and two children. He belonged to the first batch of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and his death was condoled in the Indian Parliament by then PM Jawaharlal Nehru.A virtual memorial meeting was also organised by the high commission, with India’s envoy Ajay Bisaria saying the effort was to create a “permanent institutional memory” so that the late diplomat was not forgotten.In a message, India’s foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the recognition of Pillai’s “sacrifice” had been “long overdue”. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, a former IFS officer, tweeted in remembrance and said the high commission had “appropriately named a hall in his memory”.The virtual memorial meeting was attended by Pillai’s three children as well as retired diplomat TP Sreenivasan, who triggered the commemoration with an article on the episode last year. A film on Pillai’s life and his shocking demise was featured at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/memorial-created-in-ottawa-to-remember-indian-diplomat-k-sankara-pillai-101618897236801.html

20-04-2021||World||Murder case against ex-cop in Floyd's death goes to the jury||The murder case against former Officer Derek Chauvin in the death of George Floyd went to the jury Monday in a city on edge against another round of unrest like the one that erupted last year over the harrowing video of Chauvin with his knee on the Black man's neck.The jury of six white people and six people who are Black or multiracial began deliberating after nearly a full day of closing arguments in which prosecutors argued that Chauvin squeezed the life out of Floyd last May in a way that even a child knew was wrong.The defense contended that the now-fired white officer acted reasonably and that the 46-year-old Floyd died of a heart condition and illegal drug use.The jurors deliberated about four hours before retiring for the night to the hotel where they are being sequestered for this final phase of the trial. They were due to resume Tuesday morning.After closing arguments were done, Judge Peter Cahill rejected a defense request for a mistrial based in part on comments from California Rep. Maxine Waters, who said “we've got to get more confrontational” if Chauvin isn't convicted of murder.The judge told Chauvin's attorney: “Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.” He called her comments “abhorrent” and "disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch.”Chauvin, 45, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, all of which require the jury to conclude that his actions were a “substantial causal factor” in Floyd’s death and that his use of force was unreasonable.The most serious charge carries up to 40 years in prison.“Use your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw,” prosecutor Steve Schleicher said in closing arguments, referring to the bystander video of Floyd pinned to the pavement with Chauvin's knee on or close to his neck for up to 9 minutes, 29 seconds, as onlookers yelled at the officer to get off.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson countered by arguing that Chauvin did what any reasonable police officer would have done after finding himself in a “dynamic” and “fluid” situation involving a large man struggling with three officers.As Nelson began speaking, the now-fired Chauvin removed his Covid-19 mask in front of the jury for one of the very few times during the trial.With the case drawing to a close, some stores were boarded up in Minneapolis. The courthouse was ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire, and National Guard troops were on patrol. Floyd's death set off protests last spring in the city and across the US that sometimes turned violent.The city has also been on edge in recent days over the deadly police shooting of a 20-year-old Black man, Daunte Wright, in a nearby suburb on April 11.About 300 protesters marched in the streets outside the courthouse shortly after the jury got the case, lining up behind a banner reading, “Justice 4 George Floyd & all stolen lives. The world is watching.”Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell had the final word Monday, offering the state's rebuttal argument. The prosecutor, who is Black, said the questions about the use of force and cause of death are “so simple that a child can understand it.”“In fact, a child did understand it, when the 9-year-old girl said, ‘Get off of him,’” Blackwell said, referring to a young witness who objected to what she saw. "That’s how simple it was. `Get off of him.' Common sense.”Under the law, police have certain latitude to use force, and their actions are supposed to be judged according to what a “reasonable officer” in the same situation would have done.Nelson noted that officers who first went to the corner store where Floyd allegedly passed a counterfeit $20 bill were struggling with Floyd when Chauvin arrived as backup. The defense attorney also pointed out that the first two officers on the scene were rookies and that police had been told that Floyd might be on drugs.“A reasonable police officer understands the intensity of the struggle,” Nelson said, noting that Chauvin’s body camera and badge were knocked off his chest.Nelson also showed the jury pictures of pills found in Floyd’s SUV and pill remnants discovered in the squad car. Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd’s system.The defense attorney said the failure of the prosecution to acknowledge that medical problems or drugs played a role “defies medical science and it defies common sense and reason.”During the prosecution's argument, Schleicher replayed portions of the bystander video and other footage as he dismissed certain defense theories about Floyd's death as “nonsense." He said Chauvin killed Floyd by constricting his breathing.Schleicher rejected the drug overdose argument, as well as the contention that police were distracted by hostile onlookers, that Floyd had “superhuman” strength from a state of agitation known as excited delirium, and that he suffered possible carbon monoxide poisoning from auto exhaust.The prosecutor sarcastically referred to the idea that it was heart disease that killed Floyd as an “amazing coincidence.”"Is that common sense or is that nonsense?” Schleicher asked the jury.Blackwell, his fellow prosecutor, likewise rejected the defense theory that Floyd died because of an enlarged heart: “The truth of the matter is that the reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr. Chauvin’s heart was too small.”Earlier, Schleicher described how Chauvin ignored Floyd’s cries and continued to kneel on him well after he stopped breathing and had no pulse. Chauvin was “on top of him for 9 minutes and 29 seconds and he had to know,” Schleicher said. “He had to know.”He said Chauvin heard Floyd, “but he just didn't listen.”The prosecutor said Floyd was "not a threat to anyone" and was not trying to escape when he struggled with officers but instead was terrified of being put into the tiny backseat of the squad car.He said a reasonable officer with Chauvin’s training and experience — he was a 19-year Minneapolis police veteran — should have sized up the situation accurately.Chauvin, wearing a light gray suit with a blue shirt and blue tie, showed little expression as he watched himself and the other officers pinning Floyd to the ground on bodycam video played by his attorney. He cocked his head to the side and occasionally leaned forward to write on a notepad.An unidentified woman occupied the single seat set aside in the pandemic-spaced courtroom for a Chauvin supporter.Floyd’s brother Philonise represented the family in court, as he often has during the trial.Schleicher also noted that Chauvin was required to use his training to provide medical care to Floyd but ignored bystanders, rebuffed help from an off-duty paramedic and rejected a suggestion from another officer to roll Floyd onto his side.“He could have listened to the bystanders. He could have listened to fellow officers. He could have listened to his own training," Schleicher said. “He knew better. He just didn’t do better."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murder-case-against-ex-cop-in-floyd-s-death-goes-to-the-jury-101618887200831.html
20-04-2021||World||Walter Mondale, former US Vice President, dies at 93||Former US Vice President Walter Mondale, a liberal icon who famously told voters to expect a tax increase should he win the presidency, died Monday, US media reported. He was 93 years old.No cause was given for Mondale's death, according to reports citing a statement from his family.Mondale served as vice president under President Jimmy Carter, from 1977-1981."Today I mourn the passing of my dear friend Walter Mondale, who I consider the best vice president in our country's history," Carter said in a statement, extending his condolences to his former number two's family."He was an invaluable partner and an able servant of the people of Minnesota, the United States, and the world."Prior to his stint at the White House, Mondale had served as attorney general to his home state of Minnesota from 1960-1964, and then as US senator from that state from 1964-1976.After Carter left office, Mondale went on to serve as ambassador to Japan between 1993 and 1996.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Minnesotan, mourned Mondale's passing, calling him "kind and dignified to the end.""Walter Mondale was a true public servant and my friend and mentor," she said on Twitter."He set a high bar for himself and kept passing it and raising it."Walter Frederick "Fritz" Mondale was born on January 5, 1928 in the tiny town of Ceylon, Minnesota. The son of a Methodist minister and a music teacher, he moved through several small towns in the southern part of the state throughout his childhood.At age 20, Mondale became a congressional district manager for US politician Hubert Humphrey's successful Senate campaign. Humphrey would later become Mondale's political mentor.Mondale began his national political career in 1964, when he was appointed to fill Humphrey's Senate seat, the latter having resigned to become vice president.An outspoken supporter of civil rights, Mondale advocated throughout his Senate career for education, housing, migrant worker rights and child nutrition.He made his own bid for the White House 1984, facing off against Republican Ronald Reagan. Mondale picked US Representative Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, making him the first major-party presidential nominee to put a woman on the ticket.During his campaign, he infamously told voters to expect a tax increase if he won, which would later go on to define the race.On Election Day, Mondale won only Minnesota and the District of Columbia."I did my best," he said the day after the vote.Mondale served as the US ambassador to Japan under Bill Clinton, and he sought to increase trade between the two countries.He kept up his relationship with the Clintons and in 2008 initially endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. He changed his endorsement once Barack Obama secured the nomination.Mondale married his wife, Joan Adams Mondale, in 1955. The couple had three children: sons Ted and William, and daughter Eleanor.Ted and William followed their father into politics and public service, while Eleanor became a broadcast journalist.Joan died in 2014 after an extended illness, and Eleanor died in 2011 from brain cancer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/walter-mondale-former-us-vice-president-dies-at-93-101618885909323.html

"Even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading variants and should avoid all travel to India. If you must travel to India, get fully vaccinated before travel," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an advisory.This comes a day after the US state department said that it would issue specific warnings against travelling to roughly 80% of the world's countries due to pandemic risks. It also asked Americans to reconsider their international travel plans before proceeding in view of the viral infection resurfacing in many countries. "The Covid-19 pandemic continues to pose unprecedented risks to travelers. In light of those risks, the Department of State strongly recommends US citizens reconsider all travel abroad," it said.However, the department has not revealed which countries will fall under which category. That will become known as guidance is issued individually for each country in the coming week.The United States hasn't had a global advisory warning against international travel since August when guidance was revoked by the Trump administration. The state department's assessments for classification of the countries include Covid-19 infection rates as well as the availability of local testing and treatment.The number of active cases in India crossed the two million mark as the country continued to record a mammoth surge in daily cases of the coronavirus disease. The number has doubled in just 10 days, marking a grim milestone in the fight against the pandemic. Active cases in the country crossed the 1 million active cases mark on April 10.Active cases are those in which Covid-19 patients are still carrying the virus and thus under treatment. It is a crucial metric representing the country’s battle against the coronavirus disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in a region. The positivity rate has also doubled in the last 12 days to 16.69 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-travel-advisory-against-india-as-covid-19-cases-surge-101618885699117.html

20-04-2021||World||Nasa’s Ingenuity chopper performs first flight from Mars||Nasa’s miniature robot helicopter Ingenuity performed a successful takeoff and landing on Mars early on Monday, achieving the first powered, controlled flight by an aircraft over the surface of another planet, the US space agency said.The twin-rotor whirligig’s debut on the Red Planet marked a 21st-Century Wright Brothers moment for Nasa, which said success could pave the way for new modes of exploration on Mars and other destinations in the solar system, such as Venus and Saturn’s moon Titan.Mission managers at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles burst into applause and cheers as engineering data beamed back from Mars confirmed that the 1.8-kg solar-powered helicopter had performed its maiden 39-second flight as planned three hours earlier.Altimeter readings from the rotorcraft showed that it became airborne at 3.34am EDT (0734 GMT), climbed as programmed to a height of three metres, then hovered steadily in place over the Martian surface for half a minute before touching back down safely on its four legs, Nasa said.During Nasa’s presentation of the event livestreamed from JPL headquarters, mission managers also displayed its first images from the flight.A black-and-white photo taken by a downward-pointing onboard camera while the helicopter was aloft showed the distinct shadow cast by Ingenuity in the Martian sunlight onto the ground just below it.And a snippet of colour video footage captured by a separate camera mounted on the Nasa’s Mars rover Perseverance, parked about 200 feet away, showed the helicopter in flight against the orange-coloured landscape surrounding it. “We can now say that human beings have flown an aircraft on another planet,” said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at JPL.Despite the flight’s brevity, it marked a historic feat in interplanetary aviation, taking place on an “air field” 173 million miles from Earth on the floor of a vast Martian basin called Jezero Crater. Nasa likened the achievement to the Wright Brothers’ first controlled flight of their motor-driven airplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in December 1903 — a takeoff and landing that covered just 37 metres in 12 seconds.Paying tribute to that modest but monumental first flight, Nasa engineers affixed a tiny swath of wing fabric from the original Wright flyer under Ingenuity’s solar panel before sending it on its way to Mars.“Ingenuity is the latest in a long and storied tradition of NASA projects achieving a space exploration goal once thought impossible,” acting NASA chief Steve Jurczyk said in a statement. “Today’s results indicate the sky - a least on Mars - may not be the limit.”The tiny rotorcraft was carried to the Red Planet strapped to the belly of the Mars rover Perseverance, a six-wheeled astrobiology lab that touched down in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18 after a nearly seven-month journey through space.Ingenuity was developed as a technology demonstration, separate from Perseverance’s primary mission to search for traces of ancient microorganisms and collect samples of Martian rock for eventual return to Earth for further analysis.With the helicopter’s first outing deemed a success, Nasa plans to send the aircraft on several additional, progressively more ambitious flights in the weeks ahead.Building a helicopter that could fly on Mars posed a major challenge for JPL engineers.While Mars possesses much less gravity to overcome than Earth, its atmosphere is just 1% as dense, making it especially difficult to generate aerodynamic lift. To compensate, engineers equipped Ingenuity with rotor blades that are larger (four feet long) and spin far more rapidly than would be needed on Earth for a similar aircraft of its size. The design was successfully tested in vacuum chambers built at JPL to simulate Martian conditions, but it remained to be seen whether Ingenuity would actually fly on the fourth planet from the sun, until Monday.Because of the enormous distances involved, Ingenuity was designed to execute pre-programmed flight instructions autonomously, using sophisticated onboard pilot and navigation systems. The small aircraft also had to withstand punishing cold, with nighttime temperatures dropping as low as 130 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius), using solar power alone to recharge and keep its internal components properly heated.The planned flight was delayed for a week by a technical glitch on April 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-ingenuity-chopper-performs-first-flight-from-mars-101618883857314.html

20-04-2021||World||US Supreme Court likely to bar some 'green card' applicants||The Supreme Court appears ready to prevent thousands of people living in the US for humanitarian reasons from applying to become permanent residents.The justices seemed favourable, in arguments via telephone, to the case made by the Biden administration that federal immigration law prohibits people who entered the country illegally and now have Temporary Protected Status from seeking “green cards” to remain in the country permanently.The designation applies to people who come from countries ravaged by war or disaster, protects them from deportation and allows them to work legally.The case pits the administration against immigrant groups that contend federal law is more forgiving for the 400,000 people who are TPS recipients.Many have lived in the US for many years, given birth to American citizens and have put down roots in this country, their advocates say.The Justice Department says it is maintaining a position held consistently for 30 years by administrations of both parties.President Joe Biden supports changing the law to put TPS recipients, among other immigrants, on a path to citizenship.Legislation that would allow people who are here for humanitarian reasons to adjust their immigration status has passed the House, but faces uncertain prospects in the Senate.Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the court should be “careful about tinkering with the immigration statutes as written,” especially when Congress could act.“But just kind of big picture, why should we jump in here when Congress is very focused on immigration?” Kavanaugh asked.The case turns on whether people who entered the country illegally and were given humanitarian protections were ever “admitted” into the United States under immigration law.Justice Clarence Thomas said “they clearly were not admitted at the borders. So is that a fiction? Is it metaphysical? What is it? I don't know.”The case before the court involves a couple from El Salvador who have been in the country since the late 1990s. In 2001, the US gave Salvadoran migrants legal protection to remain in the US after a series of earthquakes in their home country.People from 10 other countries are similarly protected. They are: Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-likely-to-bar-some-green-card-applicants-101618877401210.html

"This does not change the fact Officer Sicknick died in the line of duty, courageously defending Congress and the Capitol."The medical examiner's office determined that Sicknick suffered two strokes and classified him dying of natural causes.Two persons, Julian Elie Khater and George Pierre Tanios, were arrested on March 14 and charged with assaulting Sicknick and two other officers with a chemical spray on January 6.Federal prosecutors allege that Khater and Tanios were carrying Frontiersman bear spray, which is manufactured by Sabre, a company that makes self-defense products including pepper spray and stun guns. Though made from the same ingredient, bear spray can be many times more powerful than pepper sprays sold for self-defense and is not meant for use on humans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-police-says-officer-assaulted-in-jan-6-riot-died-of-natural-causes-101618877606493.html
20-04-2021||World||US agencies probe fatal Tesla crash believed to be driverless||Two US agencies on Monday said they were investigating a Tesla crash in Texas on Saturday that left two dead and which local police said appeared to have occurred with no one in the driver's seat.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates vehicle safety, and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) both said they would investigate the crash.The NHTSA said it "has immediately launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash. We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information."Just hours before the crash, Tesla Inc chief executive Elon Musk tweeted to his more than 50 million followers, "Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle."Tesla, whose shares were down 3.4% Monday, did not immediately comment.The crash occurred as scrutiny is increasing over Tesla's semi-automated Autopilot driving system following recent crashes.Autopilot was operating in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. NHTSA has sent teams to at least three other Tesla crashes in recent weeks that were believed to have been tied to Autopilot use.In Saturday's accident, the 2019 Tesla Model S was traveling at high speed near Houston when it failed to negotiate a curve and went off the road, crashing into a tree and bursting into flames, local television station KHOU-TV said.After the fire was extinguished, authorities located two occupants in the vehicle, with one in the front passenger seat and the other in the back seat of the Tesla, KHOU-TV said, citing Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman.Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention while using Autopilot. However, some Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid putting their hands on the wheel for extended periods when using Autopilot.Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that "using Tesla’s driverless system — or any other — shouldn’t be a death risk. Advancements in driving technology must first & foremost be safe."He added that "comprehensive oversight" by the NHTSA "is paramount to prevent future semi-automated driving deaths."Last month, NHTSA told Reuters it had opened 27 special investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 23 of which remain active, and that at least three of the crashes had occurred recently.The NTSB, which makes safety recommendations but cannot compel recalls, said it would send two people to conduct a safety investigation into the Texas crash focusing "on the vehicle’s operation and the post-crash fire."The NTSB last criticized the NHTSA’s approach to oversight of automated vehicles as "misguided, because it essentially relies on waiting for problems to occur rather than addressing safety issues proactively." It added that NHTSA has "taken a nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle safety."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agencies-probe-fatal-tesla-crash-believed-to-be-driverless-101618876787613.html

20-04-2021||World||US under Biden will no longer call migrants 'illegal aliens'||Employees of the two main U.S. immigration enforcement agencies were directed Monday to stop referring to migrants as “aliens,” a dated term that many people consider offensive.Memos issued by Customs and Border Protection, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, recommend agents instead use the words “non-citizen” or “migrant." The change reflect guidelines set by the Biden administration, which is reversing many of the anti-immigrant policies of former President Donald Trump.Instead of “illegal aliens,” which was still being used by some government officials in press releases and elsewhere, the employees of CBP and ICE should instead use “undocumented noncitizen” or “undocumented individual,” according to the memos.Acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said the directives were necessary to “set a tone and example” at an agency that includes the Border Patrol.“We enforce our nation’s laws while also maintaining the dignity of every individual with whom we interact,” Miller said. “The words we use matter and will serve to further confer that dignity to those in our custody.”Administration critics dismissed the new language guidelines.“We use the term ‘illegal alien’ because they’re here illegally,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas. “This kind of weakness and obsession with political correctness is why we’re having a crisis on the border in the first place.”As recently as last Thursday, CBP issued a press release out of Texas that described a Border Patrol operation in the Rio Grande Valley "resulting in the apprehension of ten illegal aliens.”But a release Monday from California seemed to comply with the memo, describing the rescue of a “lost undocumented noncitizen” near Ocotillo, California.The change in language comes as the Biden administration deals with a record number of children and teens, mostly from Central America, seeking to enter the U.S. at the southwest border.Under the new guidelines, “unaccompanied alien children” would be referred to as “unaccompanied noncitizen children,” according to the memos. Employees are also directed to describe the “assimilation” of refugees and immigrants as “civic integration.”CBP is turning away most adult migrants attempting to enter the U.S. under a public health order issued at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the Biden administration is allowing unaccompanied minors and some families to remain, at least temporarily, while authorities determine whether they can stay through the asylum process or under some other legal category.Biden administration officials blame the rising number of migrants at the southwest border on a number of factors, including two recent hurricanes that struck Central America and the economic ravages of Covid-19 in the region.Critics blame the administration's moves to reverse some of the hundreds of measures taken under President Donald Trump to curb both legal and illegal immigration and support for legislation that would enable some already in the country to remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-under-biden-will-no-longer-call-migrants-illegal-aliens-101618868180287.html
20-04-2021||World||Jaishankar and Blinken discuss multiple issues||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his US counterpart Antony Blinken discussed developments in the region and health cooperation against the backdrop of the planned withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and the Covid-19 crisis.“Spoke to my US counterpart Secretary of State @SecBlinken this evening. Conversation covered recent developments in India’s immediate and extended neighbourhood. Exchanged views on the UNSC agenda. Also discussed issues pertaining to our health cooperation,” Jaishankar said in a tweet without giving details.There was no official word from both countries on the conversation. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the situation in Afghanistan and the US embargo on exports of raw materials needed for Covid-19 vaccines had figured in the discussions.The Biden administration invoked the US Defence Production Act in February to curb the export of raw materials for vaccine production. The Serum Institute of India’s (SII) ability to make some 160 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine a month could be hit in the coming weeks if the US doesn’t lift the embargo on supplies of 37 critical items, reports have said. On April 16, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla raised the issue in a tweet addressed to US President Joe Biden.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said last month that the issue had been officially raised with the US through the Indian ambassador in Washington.Participating in an online discussion on Monday, Jaishankar referred to the matter indirectly when he said he was “pushing other countries, particularly some big countries, [to] please keep the raw materials flowing for vaccines to be made in India”.Also read: French police warn Prez Emmanuel Macron about rising levels of street violenceResponding to a question on criticism of India’s exports of Covid-19 vaccines amid growing domestic demand, Jaishankar noted that the vaccine being produced in India in the largest quantity – the AstraZeneca jab made by SII – is a “co-creation” and an international product. “Can I, on one hand, go round the world and say, guys, keep your supply chain flowing towards me, and by the way... I am asking you for raw material but I am not going to give you the vaccine?” he asked.He added, “As things got tough we spoke to the world very honestly and said look, we have done our best to live up to commitments – contractual commitments of producers, COVAX commitments – but right now please understand that I have this very serious situation at home and I think most countries understand that.”On the US exit from Afghanistan, Jaishankar said India has always played an active role in that country. “Afghanistan is a doorstep away. So how can we not have a role, influence, presence [and] activity out there?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jaishankar-and-blinken-discuss-multiple-issues-101618858131858.html
20-04-2021||World||‘2020 saw 1.2 degrees Celsius rise in global temperature’: Report||The global average temperature was about 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels despite the cooling effect of La Nina ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in 2020, the World Meteorological Organisation confirmed on Monday in its State of the Global Climate 2020 report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had warned that a 1.5 degree C warming will mark a menacing milestone in the warming of the planet.UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres who released the report on Monday said the UN is building a global coalition to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. “2020 was 1.2 degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times. We are getting dangerously close to the 1.5-degree Celsius limit set by the scientific community. We are on the verge of the abyss. To avert the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that we must limit global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees of the pre-industrial baseline. That means reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. We are way off track. This must be the year for action,” he said adding that all countries should phase out coal by 2040.Last year was one of the three warmest years on record; the six years since 2015 have been the warmest on record and 2011-2020 was the warmest decade on record, the report highlighted adding that decrease in the annual growth rate of CO2 concentration due to the Covid 19 lockdown will be practically indistinguishable.Globally averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have already exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm), 148% of pre-industrial levels, and if the CO2 concentration follows the same pattern as in previous years, it could reach or exceed 414 ppm in 2021, according to the report.“Developed countries must lead in phasing out coal -- by 2030 in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, and 2040 elsewhere. No new coal power plants should be built.” Guterres also called for an agreement among all countries to follow a common direction of travel. “The United Nations is building a global coalition committed to net zero emissions – to cover all countries, cities, regions, businesses and financial institutions. Second, the next 10 years need to be a decade of transformation. Countries need to submit ambitious new NDCs -- the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement – which are their climate plans for the next 10 years,” he said.The report comes ahead of the April 22-23 Virtual Leaders’ Summit on Climate convened by the United States of America. The Summit will have participation from 40 world leaders and one of its aims is “Galvanizing efforts by the world’s major economies to reduce emissions during this critical decade to keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius within reach,” according to the US department of state.United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and environment minister Prakash Javadekar earlier this month regarding increasing climate ambition ahead of COP 26 in Glasgow this November. Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France, Jean-Yves Le Drian had also met Javadekar and said all countries should be on track to achieve carbon neutrality and start phasing out coal.Javadekar had said India will not raise its climate ambition at the behest of or under pressure from developed countries. India has the right to develop and its poor have the right to grow and that countries should respect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR). (CBDR, a principle under the Paris Agreement requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them.)According to Climatewatch’s net-zero tracker, 59 countries representing 54% of global emissions have announced net-zero targets. Only 6 parties have legislations on net-zero emissions. India is among 6 countries that are compliant with the Paris Agreement’s 2-degree target including Bhutan, Costa Rica and the Philippines according to Climate Action Tracker. 7 countries are “critically insufficient” and their pledges will lead to 4+degree C warming including the US and the Russian Federation.Temperatures reached 38.0 degrees C at Verkhoyansk, Russian Federation on June 20, the highest recorded temperature anywhere north of the Arctic Circle. The Arctic minimum sea-ice extent in September 2020 was the second-lowest on record. The sea-ice retreat in the Laptev Sea was the earliest observed in the satellite era. Some 9.8 million people were displaced largely due to hydrometeorological hazards and disasters, and were recorded during the first half of 2020. Annual precipitation totals in monsoon in North America, Africa, South-West Asia and South-East Asia were unusually high in 2020. Monsoon seasonal totals in India were 109% of the long-term mean, the third-highest seasonal total after 1994 and 2019.“2020 was one of the warmest years despite having a La Niña with cool waters in the east Pacific. La Niñas typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is now offset by global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, La Niña years now are warmer than years with El Niño events of the past,” Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.“International agreements on climate change aim to keep global warming within the safe range of 1.5C to 2C, but few people realise that the world’s average temperature is already more than a degree warmer than it was 200 years ago. Parts of the world like the Himalayas are warming even faster. This is a serious concern for India because climate change could have a compounding effect on existing scarcities, stresses and extreme events. For example, in 2020, even as we were fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, we also had to face Cyclone Amphan, which intensified rapidly in a warmer ocean. It is crucial that all countries invest in adaptation to climate impacts, especially to protect those who are most vulnerable to extreme events. At the same time, we need to accelerate policies and technologies to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible,” said Ulka Kelkar, director of climate programme at the World Resources Institute, responding to the WMO report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-saw-1-2-degrees-celsius-rise-in-global-temperature-report-101618858476797.html
20-04-2021||World||5.2 million cases: World sees worst-ever week so far||More people were diagnosed with Covid-19 during the past seven days than during any other week since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic - topping 5.2 million globally - with the worst outbreaks accelerating in many countries that are ill-equipped to deal with them.The worrisome trend, just days after the world surpassed 3 million deaths, comes as countries are rolling out vaccinations in an effort to get the coronavirus under control. The data from Johns Hopkins University showing a 12% increase in infections from a week earlier casts doubt on the hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight.The weekly increase surpassed the previous high set in mid-December. While infection rates have largely slowed in the US and UK, countries in the developing world - India and Brazil in particular - are shouldering surging caseloads.The global death toll from the deadly disease is also resuming momentum. Covid-19 fatalities have increased for the past month and were about 82,000 the week ended April 18, an average of almost 12,000 a day.That’s up from just over 60,000 in the week ended March 14, or about 8,600 a day, the most recent low.Hugs, tears as bubble opens between Aus, NZFamilies reunited in emotional scenes on Monday as Australia and New Zealand launched a quarantine-free travel bubble that opened the border almost 400 days after its closure. There were ecstatic welcomes at airport terminals on both sides of the Tasman Sea. The bubble followed months of negotiations between the two neighbours.Travellers between the two countries had been previously required to quarantine for at least two weeks upon arrival at their destinations.Oxford study to reinfect recovered patientsPeople who have fought off Covid-19 will be reinfected in a first-of-its-kind trial at University of Oxford, potentially illuminating how to develop more effective vaccines against the virus.Researchers are looking for 64 healthy, previously-infected volunteers aged 18 to 30 years to be studied under controlled conditions. They’ll be infected with the original strain that had emerged in Wuhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/52-million-cases-world-sees-worst-ever-week-so-far-101618857328231.html
20-04-2021||World||150k Russian soldiers at Ukraine’s borders: EU||The European Union is estimating that 150,000 Russian troops have already amassed for the biggest military build-up ever near Ukraine’s borders and that it will only take “a spark” to set off a confrontation.At the same time, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the condition of imprisoned Kremlin critics Alexei Navalny was “critical” and that the 27-nation group would hold the Kremlin accountable for his health and safety.Despite the worrisome developments, Borrell said after a virtual meeting of the EU foreign ministers that, “for the time being, there is no move in the field of more sanctions” to be slapped on Russia.He said there wasn’t a request for a EU diplomatic move of expulsions in the standoff between EU member state Czech Republic and Russia following Prague’s accusation that Moscow was involved in a 2014 ammunition depot explosion.More dangerous at this time, Borrell said, was the massing of Russian troops, including military field hospitals, and “all kinds of warfare”. “It is the highest military deployment of the Russian army on the Ukrainian borders ever. It’s clear that it’s a matter of concern when you deploy a lot of troops,” Borrell said. “Well, a spark can jump here or there.” Borrell declined to say where he got the 150,000 Russian troop figure from. But it is bigger than the 110,000 estimate provided by Ukrainian defence minister Andriy Taran on Wednesday.More than 14,000 people have died in seven years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. The EU has steadfastly opposed the annexation but has been unable to do anything about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/150k-russian-soldiers-at-ukraine-s-borders-eu-101618856881548.html
