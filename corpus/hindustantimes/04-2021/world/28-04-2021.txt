The Singapore government despatched a consignment of 256 oxygen cylinders on two C-130 military transport aircraft to West Bengal. “Last year, [India] helped the world and [Singapore] by exporting essential medicines and supplies. Now, we stand with [India] as you fight Covid-19,” Singapore high commissioner Simon Wong tweeted. Singapore is among the first countries to send oxygen cylinders to India amid reports of a severe shortage of oxygen in several cities. The cylinders will support last mile oxygen delivery and more consignments are expected in the coming days. In Singapore, second minister for foreign affairs Maliki Osman formally handed over the assistance to Indian high commissioner P Kumaran at Paya Lebar airbase. Maliki said Singaporeans stand in solidarity with the people of India in the fight against the pandemic. “We have all witnessed in the past year how this pandemic is a trans-boundary threat. It gives no regard for country, nationality, or race. This is exactly why we must work collectively to support each other,” he said. On Saturday, the Indian Air Force airlifted four cryogenic tanks from Changi airport that will be used to transport oxygen. Canada announced it is providing $10 million for humanitarian assistance to the Canadian Red Cross to support the Indian Red Cross Society’s response to the devastating situation in India. This contribution will support the procurement of essential supplies and medicines, including oxygen cylinders and ambulances, said a statement from Canada’s foreign ministry. Canada’s international development minister Karina Gould said: “Canada stands with the people of India as they go through these difficult times. This funding will help meet some of the most urgent medical needs like purchasing and distributing essential supplies as well as supporting vital blood and ambulance services.” Foreign minister Marc Garneau also spoke with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Tuesday to convey Canada’s solidarity with the people of India, and said Canada is “exploring all options to support India’s urgent needs”. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau extended his support in a tweet. “Right now, the people of India are facing a tragic situation. To help with everything from ambulance services to buying personal protective equipment, we’re contributing $10 million to @IndianRedCross through @RedCrossCanada. We stand ready to donate extra medical supplies, too,” he said. The Norwegian government announced a contribution of 20 million Norwegian Kroners ($2.4 million) to be channelled through the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The support will be used to scale up ambulance and blood donation services and medical helplines, buy equipment such as oxygen tanks for ambulances and procure hygiene products to migrant workers and other vulnerable groups. Norwegian ambassador Hans Jacob Frydenlund said, “We stand with you in this time of crisis, with the hope that the second wave will recede soon.” The Norwegian business community in India is also preparing to help in the quickest way possible, he added. Meanwhile, the UK announced its second consignment of support materials will include three large oxygen generation units, each capable of producing 500 litres of oxygen a minute. The first consignment of British medical equipment arrived on Tuesday, and more will be delivered over the week. The UK will supply a total of 495 oxygen concentrators and 200 ventilators from surplus stocks. The support was sent in response to a request from India and a pledge from Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the UK to do all it can to help, the British high commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-canada-norway-send-support-for-india-s-covid-19-response-101619634219270.html
28-04-2021||World||Russia sending 22 tonnes of equipment to India as Covid-19 aid, both sides to set up 2+2 dialogue||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday extended support to Prime Minister Narendra Modi for countering the Covid-19 situation in India even as the two sides decided to establish a new 2+2 dialogue of foreign and defence ministers. Modi spoke to Putin on telephone against the backdrop of reports that the first Russian consignment of support materials for India’s Covid-19 response was expected to reach the country on Thursday. Russian military aircraft will deliver more than 22 tonnes of equipment, including 20 oxygen production units, 75 ventilators, 150 medical monitors and 200,000 packs of medicine. The leaders discussed the evolving pandemic situation, and Putin “expressed solidarity with the people and government of India and conveyed that Russia would extend all possible support in this regard”, according to a statement from the external affairs ministry. Modi thanked Putin and said the “prompt Russian support to India was a symbol of our enduring partnership”. The leaders decided to establish a new 2+2 dialogue mechanism comprising the foreign and defence ministers of both countries. Russia will be only the fourth country with which India has such a mechanism, the others being the US, Japan and Australia. The contact at the highest levels of the leadership in India and Russia came after bilateral ties went through a rough patch recently, following Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov’s visit to New Delhi. Lavrov’s decision to club the trip to India with a visit to Pakistan, and his comments about Moscow being ready to supply special military equipment to Islamabad, did not go down well in New Delhi. During their conversation, Modi and Putin also discussed cooperation between the two sides to fight the global pandemic. Putin appreciated India’s decision to grant emergency use approval for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, and the leaders “noted that the Russian vaccine will be manufactured in India for use in India, Russia and third countries”, the statement said. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the first consignment of Russian-made Sputnik V doses is expected to reach India by the end of the month. The developers of Sputnik V have tied up with several Indian pharmaceutical firms to manufacture 850 million doses a year. Putin and Modi discussed ways to further deepen bilateral cooperation in different sectors in line with the bilateral special and privileged partnership. Modi conveyed his appreciation for Russia’s support for India’s Gaganyaan programme or first manned space flight, and the completion of the Russian phase of training for the four astronauts. The first manned space flight, originally planned for 2022, has now been pushed to 2023 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The two leaders also noted the scope for increasing cooperation in renewable energy, including the hydrogen economy. They also recalled important decisions made during their last summit in Vladivostok in September 2019. Modi said he looked forward to Putin’s visit to India later this year for the bilateral summit, which would be an occasion to “continue their personal and trusted conversation”, the statement said. Putin assured Modi of Russia’s full support for the success of India’s presidency of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping during 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sending-22-tonnes-of-equipment-to-india-as-covid-19-aid-both-sides-to-set-up-2-2-dialogue-101619631039284.html
28-04-2021||World||Philippines extends limits on movement, gatherings to curb spread of Covid||President Rodrigo Duterte is extending restrictions on movement and gatherings in the Philippines' capital region and four nearby provinces for another two weeks to curb a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases and bolster its medical capacity.The country is battling one of the worst coronavirus outbreaks in Asia, with hospitals and medical workers in the capital Manila overwhelmed, while authorities face delays in the delivery of vaccines."I am sorry I have to impose a longer modified enhanced community quarantine. It is necessary," Duterte said in a late night televised address.Non-essential movement, mass gatherings and dining in restaurants will remain banned in Metro Manila and in the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna and Cavite for a further two weeks from May 1.Restrictions to curb the spread of the disease have taken a painful toll on the Southeast Asian economy, which suffered its worst contraction on record due to the pandemic last year.The Department of Health recorded 6,895 new Covid-19 cases and 115 more deaths on Wednesday, bringing the tallies to 1.02 million confirmed infections and more than 17,000 fatalities.While the government aims to inoculate 50 to 70 million out of the country's more than 108 million people, the pace of its inoculation campaign has been slow due to difficulties in securing supply.But Carlito Galvez, who is in charge of the government's vaccine procurement programme, said that will change in the second half when the bulk of the supply the country procured will have arrived, making 500,000 daily inoculations possible.Galvez also said the Philippines has told Israel of its wish to get AstraZeneca shots which it no longer needs.Around 1.56 million people have so far received at least one coronavirus vaccine shot. Only 3 million doses have been delivered, out of 140 million the Philippines aims to procure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-extends-limits-on-movement-gatherings-to-curb-spread-of-covid-101619629125489.html
28-04-2021||World||US Feds execute search warrant at Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's NYC home||Federal investigators have executed a search warrant at the Manhattan home of former President Donald Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Wednesday.The former New York City mayor has been under investigation for several years over his business dealings in Ukraine. Details of the search were not immediately available, but it comes as the Justice Department continues its investigation into the former New York City mayor and staunch Trump ally.The official could not discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. News of the search was first reported by The New York Times.The federal probe into Giuliani's overseas and business dealings stalled last year because of a dispute over investigative tactics as Trump unsuccessfully sought reelection, and amid Giuliani’s prominent role in subsequently disputing the results of the contest on Trump’s behalf.The full scope of the investigation is unclear, but it at least partly involves the Ukraine dealings, law enforcement officials have told the AP.Giuliani was central to the then-president’s efforts to dig up dirt against Democratic rival Joe Biden and to press Ukraine for an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter — who himself now faces a criminal tax probe by the Justice Department. Giuliani also sought to undermine former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was pushed out on Trump’s orders, and met several times with a Ukrainian lawmaker who released edited recordings of Biden in an effort to smear him before the election.A message left for Giuliani’s lawyer wasn’t immediately returned. Giuliani had previously called the investigation is “pure political persecution.”Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had pushed last year for a search warrant for records, including some of Giuliani’s communications, but officials in the Trump-era Justice Department would not sign off on the request, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation who insisted on anonymity to speak about an ongoing investigation.Officials in the deputy attorney general’s office raised concerns about both the scope of the request, which they thought would contain communications that could be covered by legal privilege between Giuliani and Trump, and the method of obtaining the records, three of the people said. The people could not discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.The issue was widely expected to be revisited by the Justice Department once Attorney General Merrick Garland assumed office. Garland was confirmed last month and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was confirmed to her position and sworn in last week. The Justice Department requires that applications for search warrants served on lawyers be approved by senior department officials.A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan and the FBI's New York office declined to comment Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-feds-execute-search-warrant-at-trump-attorney-rudy-giuliani-s-nyc-home-101619628746420.html
28-04-2021||World||Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins dies at age 90||American astronaut Michael Collins, who stayed behind in the command module of Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969, while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin traveled to the lunar surface to become the first humans to walk on the moon, died on Wednesday at age 90, his family said.A statement released by his family said Collins died of cancer.Often described as the "forgotten" third astronaut on the historic mission, Collins remained alone for more than 21 hours until his two colleagues returned in the lunar module. He lost contact with mission control in Houston each time the spacecraft circled the dark side of the moon."Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins," the mission log said, referring to the biblical figure.Collins wrote an account of his experiences in his 1974 autobiography, "Carrying the Fire," but largely shunned publicity."I know that I would be a liar or a fool if I said that I have the best of the three Apollo 11 seats, but I can say with truth and equanimity that I am perfectly satisfied with the one I have," Collins said in comments released by NASA in 2009.Collins was born in Rome on Oct. 31, 1930 - the same year as both Armstrong and Aldrin. He was the son of a US Army major general and, like his father, attended the US Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1952.Like many of the first generation of American astronauts, Collins started out as an Air Force test pilot.In 1963, he was chosen by NASA for its astronaut program, still in its early days but ramping up quickly at the height of the Cold War as the United States sought to push ahead of the Soviet Union and fulfill President John F. Kennedy's pledge of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade.Collins' first voyage into space came in July 1966 as pilot on Gemini X, part of the missions that prepared NASA's Apollo program. The Gemini X mission carried out a successful docking with a separate target vehicle.His second, and final, spaceflight was the historic Apollo 11.He avoided much of the media fanfare that greeted the astronauts on their return to Earth, and was later often critical of the cult of celebrity.After a short stint in government, Collins became director of the National Air and Space Museum, stepping down in 1978. He was also the author of a number of space-related books.His strongest memory from Apollo 11, he said, was looking back at the Earth, which he said seemed "fragile.""I really believe that if the political leaders of the world could see their planet from a distance of 100,000 miles, their outlook could be fundamentally changed. That all-important border would be invisible, that noisy argument silenced," he said.His family's statement said they know "how lucky Mike felt to live the life he did.""Please join us in fondly and joyfully remembering his sharp wit, his quiet sense of purpose, and his wise perspective, gained both from looking back at Earth from the vantage of space and gazing across calm waters from the deck of his fishing boat."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apollo-11-astronaut-michael-collins-dies-at-age-90-101619628417380.html

Business has already begun to improve with March the best month since the pandemic's full force was felt.Sundeep Jain, Uber's chief product officer, said the company was "evaluating opportunities" to expand the vaccine program to other countries.The company also announced partnerships with Avis Budget Group Inc, Hertz and other vehicle rental agencies.From Wednesday, U.S. customers can book rental cars through the Uber app, with Uber offering up to 10% of the rental cost as a credit to the user to spend on other Uber services.In May, users in Washington D.C. can have their rental car delivered to and collected from their home, after paying a fee to Uber, which will rollout the service nationwide this year.Jain said users will be able to handle most rental car paperwork digitally, but declined to comment on the financial details of the partnerships.Uber's smaller rival Lyft Inc already offers car rentals in partnership with Sixt SE.Uber also said it would expand an option to reserve rides in advance to more U.S. and European cities and allow customers to book and collect food delivery orders during a ride-hail trip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-app-in-us-to-enable-users-to-book-covid-19-vaccines-and-rental-cars-101619628198321.html

Public health groups filed a lawsuit last year in federal district court in Northern California to require the FDA to respond to the petition.The Post said it could be years before any ban would take effect, but the move would be praised by anti-smoking groups. Tobacco use remains a leading source of preventable illness and death in the country, particularly for people of color.The FDA declined to comment on the report from Post."There is not an open question on whether menthol in cigarettes is harmful - the evidence is overwhelming and consistent,” Joelle Lester, director of commercial tobacco control programs at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Minnesota, told the Post.The law center led a group of 19 public health organizations to file the 2013 petition.Last week, tobacco stocks tumbled after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration is weighing whether to move forward on a menthol ban or a nicotine reduction in all cigarettes—or both. Such a ban could impact Altria Group, maker of Marlboros; Europe's Imperial Brands, maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes; and British American Tobacco, maker of Lucky Strike and Newport cigarettes.Altria, Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco were not immediately available for comment on the Post report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-announce-plan-to-ban-menthol-cigarettes-report-101619625405312.html

While ordering the sanctions, US President Joe Biden also called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas.Russia quickly retaliated by ordering 10 US diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former US officials and tightening requirements for US Embassy operations.As part of the restrictions, Russia moved to ban the US Embassy and its consulates from hiring Russian citizens and third country nationals. Similar bans would also be applied to other nations designated as “unfriendly.”Lavrov said Wednesday that a list of those countries will be published soon to formalize the decision.Speaking in the interview with a Russian state TV host, Lavrov noted that Moscow has had a “positive” attitude to Biden’s proposal to hold a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but added that Russia still needs to analyze all aspects of the initiative.Lavrov said he would attend a meeting of top diplomats of the Arctic nations in Iceland set for next month and would be ready to meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken if he also joins the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usrussia-ties-worse-than-during-cold-war-russian-minister-101619624706128.html
28-04-2021||World||Melting glaciers disrupt China's plan to build dam over Brahmaputra in Tibet: Report||Melting glaciers and barrier lakes could threaten China's plan to build the world's biggest hydroelectric dam over the Brahmaputra River in Tibet close to the Arunachal Pradesh border, a media report said on Wednesday.The proposed dam which one Chinese official said has "no parallel in history” will be built in Medog county, where the Brahmaputra Grand Canyon is located. Medog is the last county in Tibet which is located close to the Arunachal Pradesh border.The plan to build the mega-dam, which is part of China’s 14th five-year plan beginning from this year, was approved by China’s Parliament, the National People’s Congress in March this year.But the engineers are concerned about the threats posed by landslides and barrier lakes to the dam, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.“But an icy obstacle could put a halt to much of the plan. In 2018, a landslide caused by a melting glacier blocked the Yarlung Tsangpo – the upper stream of the Brahmaputra River – at the Sedongpu Basin in Milin county," it said.It formed a lake containing about 600 million cubic metres of water. With the river spilling over the top at present, the dam could collapse at any time, it said.The Sedongpu lake sits just a few dozen kilometres upstream from the planned construction site of the super hydropower plant. With so much water hanging overhead, no construction workers can move in to clear the ground, it said.To build the big dam, they must get rid of the small dam formed by the landslide first, the report said.India and Bangladesh, the lower riparian states, have raised concerns over China's plan to build the massive dam on Brahmaputra River. But China has downplayed such anxieties saying it would keep their interests in mind.As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of the trans-border rivers, the Indian government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities and has urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream states are not harmed by any activities in upstream areas.Brahmaputra river is known as Yarlung Zangbo in Tibet.The Brahmaputra is the longest river in Tibet and its valley in southern Tibet is the world’s deepest with a 7,000-metre (23,000-foot) drop from the highest mountain peak to the lowest basin.China plans to build a hydropower plant in the valley with electricity generation capacity reaching 70 gigawatts, about three times that of the Three Gorges Dam, currently the world's largest built by the country, the report said.Several teams of scientists and engineers have flown to Sedongpu in recent years, including some of the nation’s top experts in civil engineering, glacier study and landslide prevention. They collected a large amount of data on the site using drones and other advanced equipment and were asked by authorities to come up with a solution after finishing their assessment, it said.“The situation is very difficult. There is not an immediate solution yet,” Xing Aiguo, a professor of civil engineering at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University who was involved in one of the studies told the Post.The experts could not find a way to strengthen the landslide dam or remove it safely. Worse still, they found similar disasters would likely happen again in the same area, thanks to climate change.“The area is large and there are many glaciers,” Xing said. Even if there is a method, treating such a harsh natural landscape with engineering methods could be technically challenging and costly, he said.A quarter of the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau have disappeared since the 1970s, and two-thirds of the remaining will be gone by the end of the century, the Post report quoted an estimate by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Studies have found that increased meltwater and rising temperatures could make the “roof of the world” more habitable with greater crop yields and advancing tree lines, but the risk of natural disasters, including flooding and landslides, also increased.And ice could turn a landslide into something more destructive. At Sedongpu, for instance, the icy debris travelled more than 10km with a top speed of 72km/h according to an estimate by Tibet autonomous region's geological environmental monitoring station.The icy material also loosened the landslide dam and made it more prone to collapse. The sheer drop in elevation means even a relatively small amount of water could cause serious destruction downstream, it said.Liu Chuanzheng, a government researcher with the Consultative Centre of Geohazard Mitigation under the Ministry of Natural Resources in Beijing, said human activity in the Sedongpu area “should be avoided altogether”.“The development and utilisation of natural resources and energy in the Yarlung Tsangpo river must fully consider the situation of avalanches and debris flows in the Sedongpu valley,” he said in an official report about the landslide published in the journal Geology in China in 2019.Some Chinese scientists have proposed that instead of building a super dam, a 16km-long tunnel could be dug through one of the high mountains in the Yarlung Tsangpo valley.The water could be directed into the tunnel to push electricity generating turbines. This scheme would reduce the power output to 50GW – or about twice that of the Three Gorges Dam – but reduce the risk of damage from landslides or other natural disasters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melting-glaciers-may-disrupt-china-s-plan-to-build-dam-over-brahmaputra-in-tibet-101619621981025.html
28-04-2021||World||Medical oxygen: Why it is lacking and how it is made||Difficulty breathing is one of the most common severe Covid-19 symptoms, and as photos of people waiting in long lines for oxygen canisters in India and elsewhere attest, supplies of medical oxygen are far from adequate everywhere in the world.- Why the long waits for oxygen in developing nations? - India is only the latest country to confront a lack of medical oxygen supplies. Earlier in the pandemic there were similar scenes of long lines in countries such as Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Peru and Venezuela.Unitaid, a global initiative that helps low- and middle-income countries confront public health challenges, puts the lack of supplies of medical oxygen down to its cost, limited infrastructure and logistical difficulties.Medical oxygen is key to treating people in respiratory distress, whether at home or in hospitals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one person in five suffering from Covid-19 needs medical oxygen to ensure that the level of oxygen in their blood is sufficient.- How much is needed in countries facing shortages? -In February, the WHO estimated that half a million people needed 1.2 million oxygen canisters a day.Unitaid put the price tag of helping the countries facing the greatest need at $1.6 billion this year."This is a global emergency that needs a truly global response," said Unitaid's Executive Director, Dr Philippe Duneton, in February.It has identified some 20 countries facing the greatest difficulties with oxygen supplies, including Malawi, Nigeria and Afghanistan.- How is oxygen made? - Oxygen is made in two ways:- Medical oxygen: is made by separating the oxygen from other gases and impurities found in air by repeated steps of compression, filtration and purification, according to Air Liquide Sante France.Such medical oxygen reaches more than 99.5 percent purity and is rigorously tested.It can be highly compressed into a liquid form, but has to be maintained below -182°C, which according to Air Liquide Sante France is the best way to meet variations in demand as one litre of liquid oxygen is the equivalent to around 800 litres when it is in normal gas form.Canisters that can travel with patients with one litre of compressed litres of oxygen contain about 200 litres of normal oxygen.- Compressed oxygen: machines that can separate out nitrogen from ambient air can raise oxygen levels to around 93 percent. The machines can be portable or larger to serve a hospital. However, these machines cannot meet surges in demand -- which rose by a factor of five or six in French hospitals as waves of Covid patients peaked. They are require lots of electricity and need to be regularly maintained by a technician.- Who are the main producers? -Outside of China, the three main producers of medical oxygen are the German firm Linde, which is allied with Praxair in the US; the French firm Air Liquide and the US company Air Products.But there are a large number of local and regional producers of medical oxygen given that it is difficult to shop long distances.Industrialised countries are better served as production facilities were designed to serve more than just the medical sector, such as the steel and chemicals industries.- What's being done for India? -The Indian military has used its cargo aircraft to transport oxygen tanker trucks where supplies are lacking, and a train called the Oxygen Express was put into service on April 22.The military has also said it plans to import 23 mobile production units from Germany.France plans to send eight such units that will be able to produce enough oxygen to serve 10,000 patients a day. It also plans to ship 200 tonnes of liquid oxygen to Indian hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-oxygen-why-it-is-lacking-and-how-it-is-made-101619622810946.html

Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarizing its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.This investment will also maximise local jobs through a targeted industry plan to contract local businesses throughout the entire supply chain, Morrison said."My commitment is keeping Australians safe and keeping Australians in jobs,” he said."All of our objectives through the activities of our Defence Forces is designed to pursue peace," he said during a press briefing."In a region as uncertain as this you need to ensure that you have the Defence capability that enables you to protect and defend Australia's interests in that region."And this enables us to ensure there's an appropriate balance — particularly in partnership with our United States allies to ensure we can promote an environment where peace will be the outcome."In an official statement, Defence Minister Peter Dutton said this significant investment would ensure the Australian Defence Force continues to deliver world-class training and our engagement with allies and other nations through the conduct of joint training exercises, including with the US Marine Rotational Force - Darwin.“This investment is critical to ensuring that our ADF land combat capability is equipped with the cutting edge technology it will require to maintain our competitive advantage,” Dutton said.These works will provide a strong economic benefit to the region, with significant opportunities for the local construction industry over a five-year delivery phase programme.Subject to parliamentary approvals, construction is expected to commence in the second half of 2021, with completion expected by mid-2026.The fraying of China-Australia ties that began with Canberra banning China’s Huawei from its 5G networks in 2018, worsened after Australia called on China to allow international investigators into Wuhan to probe the origins of the novel coronavirus last year.Beijing placed crippling tariffs on Australia’s barley exports and halted beef imports from four large meat plants. China also put embargoes on Australian cotton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-plans-747-million-budget-to-upgrade-defence-bases-in-indopacific-101619622460424.html
28-04-2021||World||US Supreme Court arguments begin in cheerleader's free speech case||U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday began hearing arguments on whether public schools can punish students for what they say off campus in a case involving a former Pennsylvania cheerleader's foul-mouthed social media post that could impact the free speech rights of millions of young Americans.The nine justices are considering an appeal by the Mahanoy Area School District of a lower court ruling in favor of Brandi Levy that found that the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech bars public school officials from regulating off-campus speech.Many schools and educators, supported by President Joe Biden's administration, have argued that ending their authority over students at the schoolhouse gates could make it harder to curb bullying, racism, cheating and invasions of privacy - all frequently occurring online.The American Civil Liberties Union, representing Levy, has argued that students need protection from censorship and monitoring of their beliefs.Under a 1969 Supreme Court precedent, public schools may punish student speech that would "substantially disrupt" the school community. Levy's case will determine whether this authority extends away from school.Peeved because she was denied a spot in a tryout for the varsity cheerleading team after being a member of the junior varsity squad as a ninth-grader, Levy - age 14 at the time - made a Snapchat post that set the case in motion.On a Saturday while at a convenience store in Mahanoy City in Pennsylvania's coal region, she posted a photo of her and a friend raising their middle fingers, adding a caption using the same curse word four times to voice her displeasure with cheerleading, softball, school and "everything."As a result, Mahanoy Area High School banished her from the cheerleading team for a year. She and her parents sued, seeking reinstatement to the squad and a judgment that her First Amendment rights had been violated. A judge ordered Levy's reinstatement, finding that her actions had not been disruptive enough to warrant the punishment.The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year went even further, deciding that the Supreme Court's 1969 precedent, known as Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, does not apply to off-campus speech and that the First Amendment prohibits school officials from regulating such speech.The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has shown sympathy toward free speech claims in important cases in recent years.Now 18 and a college student studying accounting, Levy said the case has taught her that school administrators should have limits on what they can enforce."If a student is targeting the school or threatening someone or bullying someone, that's when I feel the school should step in. But for a student to express themselves and get in trouble for it, I feel like that's not right," Levy said in an interview.The court's eventual decision would affect public schools, as governmental institutions, but not private schools.A ruling in the case is due by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-arguments-begin-in-cheerleader-s-free-speech-case-101619620260206.html
28-04-2021||World||World failed to prevent Covid-19 outbreak from overwhelming India, says Dr Fauci||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that countries around the world have failed to provide a global response to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic to prevent the outbreak from overwhelming India, according to a report by The Guardian. Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser, told Guardian Australia that a global response with equity throughout the world was the only way to fight the pandemic.“And that’s something that, unfortunately, has not been accomplished. Often when you have diseases in which there is a limited amount of intervention, be it therapeutic or prevention, this is something that all the countries that are relatively rich countries or countries that have a higher income have to pay more attention to,” the 80-year-old immunologist was quoted by The Guardian as saying.India is witnessing an unprecedented public health crisis amid a continued rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths. The ministry of health and family welfare on Wednesday morning announced that India recorded 3,60,960 new Covid-19 cases and 3,293 related deaths in the last 24 hours, setting another new daily global record. India’s total active caseload is more than 29 lakh, which comprises 16.55% of the country’s total positive cases.The huge spike in active caseload has overwhelmed the health infrastructure, leading to a shortage of oxygen and other medical supplies. Several hospitals have been frequently sending out distress messages on social media to flag the acute shortage of oxygen supply. The Centre has now taken a series of steps to overcome the shortage.Meanwhile, the United States has pledged to send oxygen generators, storage containers, PPE, remdesivir doses, a team of public health experts, and raw materials for the Covishield vaccine being manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India. Fauci stressed that though the World Health Organization (WHO) was trying to accelerate support to India through the Covax initiative, the rich countries need to assume more responsibility, per The Guardian.“Because we’re all in this together. It’s an interconnected world. And there are responsibilities that countries have to each other, particularly if you’re a wealthy country and you’re dealing with countries that don’t have the resources or capabilities that you have,” he was quoted by the British news website as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-failed-to-prevent-covid-19-outbreak-from-overwhelming-india-says-dr-fauci-101619616882630.html
28-04-2021||World||Russian authorities paint over large mural of Alexei Navalny in St Petersburg||Russian authorities rapidly painted over a large mural of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Wednesday after it appeared overnight on a building in central St Petersburg.The mural in President Vladimir Putin's hometown showed a smiling Navalny, whose activist network is on the brink of being outlawed as "extremist", making a heart shape with his hands next to the slogan "A hero of a new time".Police arrived at the scene at 9am local time and workers arrived to start painting over it with yellow paint within around 90 minutes. It was unclear who painted the mural.Navalny, Putin's most outspoken domestic opponent, is serving a 2-1/2 year jail sentence for parole violations on an earlier conviction that he says was politically motivated.A court is considering a request by Moscow's prosecutor to ban Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) and his regional offices on the grounds they are extremist. The next hearing in that case is expected on Thursday.Lyubov Sobol, a Navalny ally, mocked authorities for painting over the mural."That's how they transform everything 'alive' and beautiful into the impersonal and 'dead'. For us, Russia is for happiness, for them, it is for gloom and stagnation," she wrote on Twitter.(Reporting by Anton Vaganov; writing by Tom Balmforth; editing by Alexandra Hudson)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-authorities-paint-over-large-mural-of-alexei-navalny-in-st-petersburg-101619616288200.html
28-04-2021||World||US Navy Seals to shift from counter-terrorism, focus now on China and Russia||Ten years after they found and killed Osama bin Laden, U.S. Navy Seals are undergoing a major transition to improve leadership and expand their commando capabilities to better battle threats from global powers like China and Russia.The new plan cuts the number of Seal platoons by as much as 30% and increases their size to make the teams more lethal and able to counter sophisticated maritime and undersea adversaries. And there will be a new, intensive screening process for the Navy's elite warriors, to get higher-quality leaders after scandals that rocked the force and involved charges of murder, sexual assault, and drug use.Rear Adm. H. Wyman Howard III, the top commander for the Seals, laid out his plans in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. He said the Navy’s special operations forces have been focused on counterterrorism operations but now must begin to evolve beyond those missions. For the past two decades, many have been fighting in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan. Now they are focused on going back to sea.That decision reflects the broader Pentagon strategy to prioritize China and Russia, which are rapidly growing their militaries and trying to expand their influence around the globe. U.S. defense leaders believe that two decades of war against militants and extremists have drained resources, causing America to lose ground against Moscow and Beijing.The counterterrorism fight had its benefits, allowing the Seals to sharpen their skills in developing intelligence networks and finding and hitting targets, said Howard, who heads Naval Special Warfare Command, which includes the Seals and the special warfare combatant-craft crewmen. "Many of these things are transferable, but now we need to put pressure on ourselves to operate against peer threats."As a result, Howard is adding personnel to the Seal platoons to beef up capabilities in cyber and electronic warfare and unmanned systems, honing their skills to collect intelligence and deceive and defeat the enemy.“We are putting pressure on ourselves to evolve and understand our gaps in capability and what our true survivability is against these threats” posed by global competitors, he said.Adm. Mike Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said the goal is to better integrate the Seals into the Navy's missions at sea.“As the Navy Special Warfare community returns more and more to its maritime roots, their increased integration across the Fleet — above, under, and on the sea — will unequivocally enhance our unique maritime capabilities to help us compete and win against any adversary," Gilday said in a statement to the AP.Increasing the size of the Seal platoons will add high-tech capabilities. And decreasing the number of units will allow Howard to rid the force of toxic leaders and be more selective in choosing commanders. That decision is a direct result of the erosion in character that Navy officials have seen within the force.In recent years, Seals have been involved in a number of high-profile scandals. One of the most well-known was the arrest of Navy Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher on war crimes charges that included the murder of an Islamic State militant captive and attempted murder in the shootings of civilians during a 2017 deployment to Iraq.Gallagher was acquitted of all charges except one, posing in photos with the dead captive. A jury recommended his rank be reduced, cutting his pension and benefits as he was about to retire. But President Donald Trump intervened and ordered that Gallagher be allowed to retire without losing his Seal status.More recently, a Seal team platoon was pulled out of Iraq in 2019 amid allegations of sexual assault. Members of Seal Team 10 were involved in cocaine use and tampering with drug tests. And Navy Seal Adam Matthews was sentenced to a year in military prison for his role in the 2017 hazing-related death of an Army Green Beret in Africa.Navy leaders also chafed as Navy Seals broke away from their “quiet professional” ethos, publicizing their participation in the raid into Pakistan that killed bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader responsible for plotting the 9/11 attacks. Two Seals wrote books about the mission, prompting a rebuke from the Naval Special Warfare commander at the time, Rear Adm. Brian Losey.“A critical tenant of our ethos is ‘I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions,’” he said.Since taking over last September, Howard reached out to the Army and the Marine Corps for ideas on how to better screen his commando forces and assess them as they move through the ranks. Almost immediately, he instituted a “double-blind” process for candidate interviews that were being used by the Army, so that neither side is influenced by actually seeing the other.In addition, he is intensifying the screening process with more psychological assessments to evaluate personality traits. And he is expanding other assessments done by the subordinates and peers of candidates up for review. The increased scrutiny, said Howard, will extend through all the ranks and will help leaders get a better understanding of each service member's character. The process, he said, will provide more feedback for individuals so they can improve and will also help top leaders pair commanders with the right teams.In some cases, Howard said, sailors who already had gone through the initial Seal screening had to do it again under the new process. Not all did as well the second time.“We learned that some of the officers that scored in the midrange are officers that I thought would have scored much higher,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-seals-to-shift-from-counter-terrorism-focus-now-on-china-and-russia-101619615605042.html
28-04-2021||World||Covid-19: UK joins France with vaccine passport plan to lift travel||Britain is working on a digital Covid-19 vaccine passport as the move to restart travel in Europe gathers pace.The UK initiative, disclosed Wednesday by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, is based on an existing National Health Service app, which will be adapted to help travelers prove they’ve had a jab or tested negative for the virus. The announcement comes a day after France started to trial short flights with a tracing app updated to host records of shots and tests, on short flights.“In terms of vaccine certification, I can confirm we are working on an NHS application,” Shapps told Sky News. “It will be the NHS app that is used for people when they book appointments with the NHS and so on.”Vaccine passports are emerging as a key plank of efforts to jump-start European tourism in time for the summer peak. Britain had previously said that they were under consideration ahead of a planned reopening on May 17, while the European Union aims to introduce digital passes by June after governments reached a deal on technical standards earlier his month.In virtual talks Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang discussed the use of vaccine certificates as a way to boost travel, as well as working together to ease the impact of the pandemic, according to a German government statement.While Britain needs to remain cautious and protect the gains of its vaccine rollout, current data “does continue to look good” for reopening travel, Shapps said.International FlightsThe minister told Times Radio that he will chair a meeting of Britain’s G-7 counterparts next week to discuss international co-ordination on the recognition of vaccine passports.Within Europe, Greece has already started easing travel with some countries including its fellow EU members, with a full lifting of restrictions for international tourists set for May 15.Britain, which along with Germany is the biggest source of visitors to Mediterranean sun spots, is set to announce a Green List of countries to which leisure travel will be permitted early next month.Spanish tourism minister Fernando Valdes Verelst told The Sun newspaper on Wednesday that Britons will be allowed back in from June once an agreement on mutual recognition of vaccine passports is in place.Shapps said he couldn’t comment specifically on Spain before May’s planned announcements.EU PlanFollowing government approval for the EU’s plans on April 14, the European Parliament is set to adopt a position on the European Commission proposals Wednesday. Further negotiations will follow before an agreement on the final wording of rules is hatched sometime next month.Didier Reynders, the EU’s justice commissioner, said in a speech to the Parliament that lawmakers should move quickly to allow travel across the bloc to resume for summer, warning against rigid rules for vaccine passes or delays to gage the impact of jabs on new Covid variants.France’s transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, said Tuesday that the country’s fledgling vaccine passport, which already has about 15 million users as a Covid-tracing app, is being deployed on services between Paris and the Mediterranean island of Corsica.The trial will be extended to Air France-KLM flights to overseas territories next week and then to some neighboring countries. Talks have also been held with the UK on bilateral travel arrangements and discussions with the US will be next, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-joins-france-with-vaccine-passport-plan-to-lift-travel-101619614990572.html
28-04-2021||World||Covid: Vietnam urges vigilance as neighbouring nations battle infection spikes||Vietnam on Wednesday warned against mass gatherings ahead of long public holidays this weekend and said it would speed up its vaccine rollout amid a worsening coronavirus situation among its neighbours."A new Covid-19 outbreak is threatening to happen, especially during the upcoming holidays," the health ministry said in a statement.It called for "unanimity and determination" among the public to keep the virus at bay.Vietnam has been widely praised for its record in containing its outbreaks quickly through targeted mass testing and a strict, centralised quarantine programme.That has helped keep its case tally to 2,865, with only 35 deaths reported since the pandemic began, one of the best records in Asia."For the sake of the country, of the community and of the people, each citizen should be unanimously determined to hold on to our success in preventing and fighting against Covid-19," the statement said.The ministry separately said provinces, especially those bordering Cambodia, need to increase vigilance due to people illegally crossing the border into Vietnam.Cambodia has seen its case total jump from about 500 to 11,000 in the past two months, with 82 deaths, while nearby Thailand's infections tally has more than doubled in April alone to nearly 62,000, with 178 fatalities.Cases in Laos have nearly doubled since Saturday, to over 600, according to its state media."The global disease situation is evolving in a complicated manner, especially in some neighbouring countries, putting huge pressure on Vietnam," Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh said in the statement.The government on Wednesday said its Covid-19 vaccine rollout would be expedited, with the aim of administering all of the 928,800 AstraZeneca doses it has received so far by May 15. About 260,000 people have so far been inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vietnam-urges-vigilance-as-neighbouring-nations-battle-infection-spikes-101619612653515.html
28-04-2021||World||UK's Johnson faces formal investigation over funding of apartment renovation||Britain's Electoral Commission has opened an investigation into the financing of the refurbishment of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's apartment, saying there were grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed.Eight days before local elections across England and for the election of the Welsh and Scottish regional assemblies, Johnson is facing a stream of allegations about everything from his muddled initial handling of the COVID-19 crisis to questions about who leaked what from his office."We are now satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred," the Electoral Commission said of the financing of the apartment above Number 11 Downing Street where Johnson resides."We will therefore continue this work as a formal investigation to establish whether this is the case," the commission said.The investigation will determine whether any transactions relating to the works fall within the regime regulated by the commission and whether such funding was reported as required.If it finds that an offence has occurred, and that there is sufficient evidence, then the commission can issue a fine or refer the matter to the police.Asked who paid the initial invoices for the refurbishment, Johnson said he had covered the costs and he had conformed in full with the code of conduct and ministerial code."The answer is I have covered the costs," said Johnson under questioning in parliament from opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, who cast Johnson as "Major Sleaze".Though Johnson has over the years repeatedly weathered gaffes, crises over Brexit and disclosures about his adultery, he is now grappling with an array of accusations which opponents say show that he is unfit for office and that his government is riddled by sleaze and cronyism.His supporters deny he has done anything wrong and say he is focused on the COVID-19 crisis. Starmer said Johnson had been selecting wallpaper for 840 pounds ($1,164) a roll in the middle of the crisis.DOWNING STREET APARTMENTAsked last month about the refurbishment, Johnson's spokeswoman said all donations and gifts were properly declared, and that no Conservative Party funds were used to pay for it.Johnson has a taxpayer-funded 30,000 pound ($42,000) allowance each year for maintaining and furnishing his official residence, but anything above that must be met by the prime minister.Ministers have said Johnson has paid for the work himself, but it is unclear when he paid, and whether the refurbishment, reported to have cost 200,000 pounds ($280,000) was initially financed by a loan of some kind. Under political financing rules, Johnson would have been required to declare this.Critics say that if the funds had come originally from a Conservative Party supporter, this would raise the question of influence-peddling.Johnson was asked in parliament if the refurbishment was financed by Conservative Party donor David Brownlow."The answer is that I have covered the cost," Johnson said.Dominic Cummings, who was Johnson's main adviser on the Brexit campaign and helped him to win an election in 2019 before an acrimonious split last year, said on Friday that Johnson had wanted donors to pay for the renovation secretly.Cummings said he had told the prime minister such plans were "unethical, foolish, possibly illegal".In a further potentially damaging allegation, the Daily Mail newspaper on Sunday cited unidentified sources as saying that, in October, shortly after agreeing to a second lockdown, Johnson had told a meeting in Downing Street: "No more fucking lockdowns - let the bodies pile high in their thousands."Asked in parliament if he had used those works, Johnson repeatedly denied that he had."No," Johnson said. "I didn't say those words."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-johnson-faces-formal-investigation-over-funding-of-apartment-renovation-101619611635271.html
28-04-2021||World||Egyptologists uncover rare tombs from before the Pharaohs||Egyptian archaeologists working on the Nile Delta have uncovered dozens of rare predynastic tombs dating to the period before Egypt's Pharaonic kingdoms first emerged more than 5,000 years ago.They also found tombs nearby from the later Hyksos period (1650 to 1500 B.C.), when Western Asian migrants took over the country, putting an end to Egypt's Middle Kingdom.The findings in the Dakahlia province north of Cairo could shed light on two important transitional periods in ancient Egypt, Egyptologists said.The tombs include 68 from the Buto period that began around 3300 B.C. and five from the Naqada III period, which was just before the emergence of Egypt's first dynasty around 3100 B.C., according to a statement from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.They also include 37 tombs from the time of the Hyksos, who first began migrating across the Sinai into Egypt around 1800 B.C."This is an extremely interesting cemetery because it combines some of the earliest periods of Egyptian history with another important era, the time of the Hyksos," said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo."Egyptologists are working to understand how the Egyptians and the Hyksos lived together and to what degree the former took on Egyptian traditions."The Buto tombs were oval-shaped pits with the corpses placed inside in a squatting position, mostly on their left sides with the head pointing west, the ministry statement said.Some of the tombs from the Naqada period contained cylindrical and pear-shaped vessels.The Hyksos tombs were mainly semi-rectangular with the corpses lying in an extended position and the head also facing west."The mission also found a group of ovens, stoves, remnants of mud brick foundations, pottery vessels and amulets, especially scarabs, some of which were made of semi-precious stones and jewelry such as earrings," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egyptologists-uncover-rare-tombs-from-before-the-pharaohs-101619603992113.html

He has encouraged use of medications that scientists say are worthless. Critics say his policies, along with a bungled vaccine campaign, have contributed to the world's second-highest death toll from the coronavirus.While the investigation isn't formally aimed at criminal allegations, it potentially could lead to charges. It's also likely to provide a drumbeat of embarrassing accusations ahead of the 2022 presidential election.Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and instead blames governors and mayors, saying their restrictions on activity have caused more problems than the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-senate-begins-inquiry-govt-s-handling-of-coronavirus-pandemic-101619608236157.html

28-04-2021||World||US agency revokes Trump-era memo for smoother H-1B visa extension||The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Tuesday issued policy guidance instructing officers to defer to previous approvals while extending work visas such as H-1B. The guidance instructs officials to generally defer to prior determinations of eligibility when the same parties and facts are involved as in the initial petition.However, the officers may not defer to a prior approval when there is a material error, material change, or new material facts that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, applicant’s, or beneficiary’s eligibility.The US immigration agency has basically restored its policy guidance issue in 2004 which was rescinded during the Trump administration. In 2017, the USCIS rescinded the 2004 guidance, treating each visa extension request as a new application. This requirement led to an increase in additional documentation which increased administrative burden and costs for sponsoring employers.“With this update, USCIS is reverting in substance to prior long-standing guidance issued in 2004, which directed officers to generally defer to prior determinations of eligibility when adjudicating extension requests involving the same parties and facts as the initial petition or application,” the USCIS stated.The agency said that the update in its policy has been made in accordance with US President Joe Biden’s executive order titled ‘Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans’. The executive order, issued in February, had directed the secretary of homeland security to identify barriers that impede access to immigration benefits and fair, efficient adjudications of these benefits.“Affording deference to prior approvals involving the same parties promotes efficient and fair adjudication of immigration benefits,” the USCIS added.The Biden administration has undone several Trump-era immigration policies, including the suspension of employment-based nonimmigrant visas. In early April, the US department of state announced that H-1B applicants who were denied a visa due to travel ban can now reapply by submitting a new application. The department also assured that the visa applications of those who have not yet been interviewed or scheduled for an interview will be prioritised and processed in accordance with the existing phased resumption of routine visa services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agency-revokes-trump-era-memo-for-smoother-h-1b-visa-extension-101619607578916.html
28-04-2021||World||Beijing sees lowest birth rate in 2020, China’s population to decline: Reports||Beijing recorded its lowest number of births in 2020, official data has revealed, with a top expert saying the Chinese capital’s population could start shrinking from 2022, and China’s by 2027.The change in Beijing’s demographics, a city of more than 21 million people, is an indication that the number of people in China could start to decline six years from now, according to a report published in the tabloid Global Times on Wednesday.The number of newborns in Beijing hit a new low in a decade in 2020, decreasing by 32,000 as against the previous year to a total of 100,368.Not just Beijing, a dozen Chinese cities in eastern China’s Zhejiang and southern China’s Guangdong provinces have reported the numbers of newborns in 2020 hitting a new low in the past six to 10 years.The state media report comes a day after the London-based Financial Times newspaper reported that China was poised to report its first population decline in five decades following a once-in-a-decade census, which was completed last December.The FT report said the latest census figures are expected to show China’s population slipping to under 1.4 billion.The statistics from the new census were expected to be released earlier this year, but have been delayed possibly because of the complexities that have emerged around the population figure.The population figure is considered sensitive and won’t be published until government departments have a consensus on the data and its implications, The Financial Times wrote, citing its sources.A population drop will add pressure on Beijing to roll out measures to encourage couples to have more children and avert an irreversible decline, the report said.Overall, the number of babies born in China fell by 580,000 to 14.65 million in 2019 and the birth rate of 10.48 per thousand was the lowest since 1949 when present methods of collating data began, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The two-child policy implemented from 2016 has failed to make an impact on the low birth rates.Speaking to Global Times, Huang Wenzheng, a demography expert from the Beijing-based think-tank Centre for China and Globalisation, said the narrowing gap between newborns and deaths indicated that the capital city may see more deaths than newborns starting 2022 - which will mark a natural negative growth in population. Huang said it would impede the capital’s economic development.“Beijing’s figures indicated that China’s total population will soon start to decline, which may come before 2027,” Huang said. “A soon-to-decline population is predicted by demographers, which would allow India to replace China as the world’s most populous country, perhaps in 2022, if not this year.”That would be earlier than the prediction of a 2017 UN report, which had said India’s population will surpass China’s by 2024.

His ideas reflect the frailties that were uncovered last year by the pandemic, and he will make the case that economic growth would best come from taxing the rich to help the middle class and the poor.His speech will also provide an update on progress in combating the COVID-19 crisis he was elected to tame, showcasing hundreds of millions of vaccinations and relief checks delivered to help offset the devastation wrought by a virus that has killed more than 573,000 people in the United States. He will also champion his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, a staggering figure to be financed solely by higher taxes on corporations.Seizing an opportunity born of generational calamity, Biden has embraced momentous action over incremental progress, with the goal of making the economy fairer and stronger. But he will be forced to thread the needle between Republicans who cry government overreach and some Democrats who fear he won’t go big enough.The Democratic president's strategy is to sidestep the polarization and make his appeal directly to voters. His prime-time speech will underscore a trio of central campaign promises: to manage the deadly pandemic, to turn down the tension in Washington and to restore faith in government as an effective force for good."He is a big-government Democrat, and he has not been at all reluctant to propose big initiatives in a response to a national crisis," said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University presidential historian.No American politician has more familiarity with the presidential address to Congress than Biden. He spent three decades in the audience as a senator and another eight years seated behind President Barack Obama during the annual address when he was vice president.For the first time on Wednesday, a female vice president, Kamala Harris, will be seated behind the chief executive for the speech.Biden also knows that most of those seated before him have, like he did, looked at the president and envisioned themselves one day in his place. He has heard the memorable phrases and the long list of promises — often unmet — and seen the partisan reactions intensify as the years have hurried by.He chose to delay this speech, typically given in the afterglow of a presidential inaugural. In doing so, he gave himself the chance to not simply speak of the pain of the COVID-19 crisis but also to talk about tangible progress in beating it back.The setting will be unlike for any of his predecessors, with members of Congress spread out and socially distanced and many Republicans citing “scheduling conflicts” to explain their absence. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that Biden's presidency “can best be described as the Biden bait and switch.”“President Biden ran as a moderate, but I’m hard pressed to think of anything at all that he’s done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation," McConnell said.Yet the desire for swift action is born from political necessity. Biden understands that the time for passing his agenda could be perilously short given that president’s parties historically lose congressional seats in the midterm elections, less than two years away. The Democrats’ margins are already razor-thin.Biden will talk to Congress amid the start of a potentially booming recovery, one that could determine whether the U.S. economy can once again fire on all cylinders after a morale-crushing pandemic and a humbling financial crisis with shock waves that linger a dozen years later.In his first three months in office, Biden signed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill — passed without a single GOP vote — and has shepherded direct payments of $1,400 per person to more than 160 million households. Hundreds of billions of dollars in aid will soon arrive for state and local governments, enough money that overall U.S. growth this year could eclipse 6% — a level not seen since 1984. Administration officials are betting that it will be enough to bring back all 8.4 million jobs lost to the pandemic by next year.Biden's speech Wednesday is about how to sustain those gains once the debt-financed boost fades. Federal Reserve estimates suggest that the economy will slip to more modest 1.8% growth after at least two years of robust gains, potentially leaving the Biden era with some happy memories but few enduring legacies.New in his Wednesday speech is a “families” plan that could cement his legacy with $1.8 trillion worth of spending over 10 years.A significant amount of the proposal would ensure that eligible families receive at least $250 monthly per child through 2025, extending the enhanced tax credit that was part of Biden’s COVID-19 aid. There would be $200 billion for free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. Another $225 billion would pay for subsidized child care and invest in child care workers.A national paid family and medical leave program would be started at a cost of $225 billion. Another $200 billion would go to permanently reduce health insurance premiums for people who receive coverage through the Affordable Care Act.For $109 billion, people could attend community college tuition-free for two years. There would be $85 billion for Pell Grants to help more people afford higher education. Historically Black and tribal institutions would be eligible to receive $46 billion.Funding all of this would be a series of tax increases on the wealthy that would raise about $1.5 trillion over a decade.Biden wants to boost IRS enforcement and require disclosures by financial institutions, specifically targeting the rich. The White House estimates that would bring in $700 billion over 10 years. He would raise the top tax rate on the most affluent families from 37% to 39.6%. People earning in excess of $1 million a year would see their rate on capital gains — the profits from a sale of a stock or home — nearly double from 20% to 39.6%, which would mean the wealthiest Americans could no longer pay at a lower rate than many families who identify as middle class.The president has drawn a firm red line that no household earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes, a move that both broadened the definition of the middle class and clearly delineated just how extreme inequality has become.Economist Owen Zidar, whose research suggested that capital gains tax hikes could raise meaningful revenues, said the programs funded by the proceeds might allow poorer children to become inventors and entrepreneurs, positions that are increasingly reserved for the offspring of wealthy parents.“There are many missing Einsteins and Elon Musks,” Zidar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-pitch-sweeping-family-plan-in-speech-to-congress-101619603980273.html
28-04-2021||World||Indian-American NGO raises $4.7 million for Covid relief; to ship 2,184 oxygen concentrators||An Indian-American non-profit body has raised nearly $4.7 million through social media towards Covid-19 relief efforts in India as the country battles a severe second wave of the pandemic."This is a collective effort that can save lives, defeat hunger, assure distressed people, and help India in its decisive fight against Covid-19," Sewa International USA said.On Tuesday, Sewa collected a shipment of 2,184 oxygen concentrators to be sent to India.In less than 100 hours of launching the fund-raising campaign, more than 66,700 Indian-Americans came out to raise over $4.7 million for Covid-19 relief efforts in India, it said.Over the last few years, Sewa International USA has emerged as the top Indian-American charity organisation in the US."Right now, our top priority is to quickly acquire oxygen concentrators and ship them to India as it can save lives. We are also providing support to hospitals run by Sewa's partner organizations to extend their capacity to treat more coronavirus-infected patients," the organisation said.Sewa's volunteers are working on building a digital helpdesk to provide critical information such as ambulance service, hospital bed availability and blood and medicinal supplies to people, it added."As the pandemic is causing economic hardships by forcing partial lockdowns, we are planning to distribute over 10,000 essential item kits to families and assist more than 1,000 orphanages and senior care centres," Sewa said."Working closely with our partner organisations, we are also distributing food and medicines to the needy in multiple places," it added.American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (APPI), the largest ethnic medical organisation in the country, on Tuesday announced a nationwide campaign for medical oxygen, tele-consult and educational webinars to help combat Covid-19 in India."This is the time for immediate AAPI action. As doctors, we all share a visceral urge to do something about it," said Dr Sudhakar Jonnalgadda, AAPI president."We have located a source manufacturer that supplies oxygen concentrators, each of which can save several lives in India. The cost of each unit is around $500," he said."AAPI, with the collaboration of numerous members, has placed orders for securing and delivering 200 oxygen concentrators directly to hospitals in India with the help of SEWA International, a reliable non-profit organisation," Jonnalgadda said.The US India Chamber of Commerce DFW and the Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston – both from Texas – in partnership with the USICOC Foundation shipped out the first batch of 20 ventilators to the Indian Red Cross Society in Delhi to be disbursed to hospitals and field teams in hard-hit areas, a media statement said."It is our moral obligation to help India in every way that we can during this time of need. We will continue to provide support as long as it takes to bring the situation to normal," said Ashok Mago, founding chairman of the US India Chamber, who helped coordinate many of the necessary funds for the effort.Another next 30 ventilators are scheduled to ship out in the next few days.Jagdip Ahluwalia from the Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston, who was coordinating efforts from the Houston area, said members of the organisation are coordinating with hospitals, NGOs, medical schools and government bodies in India to make sure the equipment is getting to trained professionals, who can put it to immediate use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-ngo-raises-4-7-million-for-covid-relief-101619600099545.html
28-04-2021||World||China wants to improve genetics of its pigs so they produce more meat and eat less||China will work to improve the genetics of its hog herd and other livestock in the coming decade with the aim of breeding animals that produce more meat and -- at the same time - consume less grains.Sow herd productivity is about 30% lower than in developed countries and dairy cows produce only 80% of the milk than their peers in some leading markets, Shi Jianzhong, an official with the agriculture ministry’s National Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources Committee told reporters on Wednesday. China has to rely on overseas stock to produce white-feathered broiler chickens, he said.The drive to improve livestock genetics is part of China’s goal of relying less on imports to feed its massive and increasingly affluent population. However, the nation will continue to bring in animals from overseas to improve its domestic stock to catch up faster with advanced countries, said Chen Yaosheng, an official at the ministry’s National Pig Genetic Improvement Program.Millions of tons of feed grains will be saved and pressure on land will ease if hog quality can be improved to match that in advanced countries, said Sun Haoqin, another official on the livestock genetics committee. The move will also support China’s shift to industrialized hog and chicken farms, he said.China flew in 10,433 live swine worth $25 million in the first quarter, with the imports mainly coming from Denmark and the US, customs data show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-wants-to-improve-genetics-of-its-pigs-so-they-produce-more-meat-and-eat-less-101619601379569.html
28-04-2021||World||Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning sails between Japanese islands||Japan's Defense Ministry on Wednesday confirmed that a Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning after passing through waters between two Japanese islands returned to the East China Sea from the Pacific.The ministry said the Maritime Self-Defense Force confirmed that during the period from Monday to Tuesday the Liaoning, accompanied by five other vessels, sailed northward between Okinawa's main island and Miyakojima Island, and then entered the East China Sea, reported NHK World.Early in April, the fleet was seen sailing south in the same area and entering the Pacific.This is the second time that the Chinese aircraft carrier has passed between the two Japanese islands on a round trip.The Defense Ministry also said that, after entering the East China Sea, an early warning helicopter was viewed taking off from the Liaoning and coming around 50 to 100 kilometers to the northeast of Taisho Island, part of Japan's Senkaku Islands. This prompted the Air Self-Defense Force's aircraft to scramble.Japan controls the Senkaku islands. The Japanese government maintains the islands are an inherent part of Japan's territory. China and Taiwan claim them.The Defense Ministry said that the helicopter did not violated Japan's airspace. It added that the Chinese fleet did not violated Japan's territorial waters, reported NHK World.Meanwhile, Japan has welcomed the United Kingdom's plan to deploy a fleet led by its new flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth, to the Indo-Pacific region.Beijing announced earlier this month that the aircraft carrier group had conducted a naval exercise in the waters near Taiwan.Indo-Pacific region is largely viewed as an area comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea.China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and has overlapping territorial claims with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-aircraft-carrier-liaoning-sails-between-japanese-islands-101619601420874.html
28-04-2021||World||Where can you fly right now? India’s Covid outbreak stalls global travel rebound||The ferocious surge in new coronavirus cases that has turned India into the global pandemic hotspot has also reversed one of the airline industry’s biggest travel comebacks. Carriers in India had reached 87% of their pre-pandemic seat capacity through early April, based on a Bloomberg analysis of data from flight tracker OAG. That progress has now unraveled as the surge in infections led to a pullback in domestic flights, which make up the vast majority of the market.As of the start of this week, capacity had fallen to 71% of 2019 levels, a 16 percentage-point drop over three weeks, the data show. Further eroding demand is a move by nations including Singapore, Australia, the U.K. and the United Arab Emirates to impose restrictions on visitors from India. Using weekly OAG data, Bloomberg has built a flight tracker to monitor the pulse of the global air-travel comeback. The latest update shows continued progress in China, while plans to increase capacity in the U.S. and Europe haven't yet taken hold. With operators still canceling flights from India, the number of seats offered globally may have fallen slightly from last week.What’s Happening in Air Travel This WeekIndia’s expansive domestic network made it one of the world’s fastest-growing countries for aviation before the recent Covid-19 outbreak. Short-haul carriers such as IndiGo propelled India to the world’s third-largest market. And earlier on in the pandemic, the South Asian country of 1.4 billion people won plaudits for enforcing strict social distancing rules that lowered the infection rate. But now the country’s public health system is being overwhelmed by an aggressive surge in cases, with daily infections exceeding 300,000.As the outbreak overwhelms the nation’s hospitals and crematoriums,  an upturn in air travel won’t happen until the latest crisis is contained, said Rob Morris, the head of consultancy at U.K. aviation advisory firm Cirium.“It looks as though things will get worse for the Indian aviation industry before they get better,’’ Morris said. The Path AheadAmong major economies, only Thailand and Turkey have seen even bigger setbacks, though neither had made it back as far as India. With airlines still cancelling flights and countries throwing up more barriers, India’s market could plummet to as little as 25% of normal, says John Grant, chief analyst at OAG. Reacting to surging cases, Turkey imposed a three-week lockdown. Thailand, too, could be forced to tighten restrictions on businesses and travel as an outbreak that began from nightlife venues in Bangkok overwhelms hospitals and healthcare facilities.The reversal in India “highlights how fragile the recovery is and will be in the coming months as incidents like this occur elsewhere,’’ Grant said.  India’s troubles have already spilled over into connected markets. A blossoming trade in getaway flights to the Maldives has now faded. The same has happened with non-stop journeys that had been added by U.S. carriers such as United Airlines Holdings Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. earlier in the crisis.The U.S. airlines have been using the flights to replace a fraction of the international business they’ve lost to the pandemic. At the start of the outbreak last year, India suspended regular international travel rules that would typically see many long-distance passengers routed through connecting hubs such as Doha and Dubai.It’s not just U.S. airlines that had hoped to claw back some international business with the help of India. The three big Persian Gulf carriers — Dubai-based Emirates, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways in Doha — have wrestled for market share in India over the years.But in the wake of the latest outbreaks, the UAE -- home to Emirates and Etihad -- has halted incoming flights. Qatar, meanwhile has kept flying, consistent with its strategy of using the pandemic to gain market share, particularly from larger arch-rival Emirates.“It will frustrate their recoveries for sure, especially as these markets have a large proportion of local traffic and therefore were not requiring complex connecting travel requirements,’’ Grant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-can-you-fly-right-now-india-s-covid-outbreak-stalls-global-travel-rebound-101619600275168.html

Particularly the attention is on the oral for the world and of us because provides several advantages and one of them is that you don't need to go to the hospital to get the treatment of which is the case with all the injectables so far but you can get it home," Bourla told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday, as cited by The Hill."If all goes well, and we implement the same speed that we are, and if regulators do the same, and they are, I hope that by the end of the year," Bourla added.The only antiviral currently approved for use against the coronavirus is Remdesivir, which is manufactured by Gilead Sciences. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the drug full approval in October after it was granted emergency use authorization in May last year.He also said the medication could be "way more effective against the multiple variants" of the virus than current options adding that the mechanism of action, of the antiviral, is not expected to be subject to mutations, "particularly because it's not acting on the spike, as we all know, all the mutations that we are hearing right now are seeing this in the proteins of the spike.""This one doesn't work there so that allows us to believe that will be way more effective against the multiple variants. So, all good news.

Trudeau said on Tuesday, “It’s something the Canadians are extremely concerned about as we see the terrible and tragic images coming out of India. We know we have to be there for our friends.”It came after Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau spoke to India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday to offer Ottawa’s assistance during the escalating crisis. “We are there to support in any way we can, and those conversations are very much ongoing,” Trudeau said. Also, there is package of physical materials being worked on, which will include oxygen concentrators, ventilators and pharma products from Canada’s emergency stockpile as Ottawa has assured India during a dialogue between the governments of its solidarity and commitment to render all aid possible.Those conversations are continuing as Canada’s public services and procurement minister Anita Anand said she, along with Garneau and international development minister Karina Gould, were “coordinating to ensure that we are mounting as much assistance as possible”. Anand said she had spoken with Canada’s high commissioner in New Delhi, Nadir Patel, and his Indian counterpart in Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, to “ascertain the precise supplies that are needed in India and how best Canada can support the needs that India clearly has and that we clearly want to lend a hand with”.Gould meanwhile said, “Canada stands with the people of India as they go through these difficult times. This funding will help meet some of the most urgent medical needs like purchasing and distributing essential supplies as well as supporting vital blood and ambulance services.”As the Canadian government steps forward, community groups have been active in organising relief material and support for India. The Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce (ICCC) has started an awareness campaign to point donors to organisations so engaged. ICCC president Vijay Thomas issued an appeal to the chamber’s members and stakeholders, informing them of the medicines and medical equipment urgently needed in India. It has identified charitable organisations functioning in the Indo-Canada corridor.One group, Vraj Community Services, has announced a drive in collaboration with South Asian Health Network to send oxygen generators with a capacity over eight litres each for distribution through Indian partners and NGOs to hospitals in the worst-hit areas. ICCC members have contributed towards purchasing 100 such generators. TiE Toronto has sent 100 oxygen concentrators, due to reach India on Wednesday, for distribution to tier two and tier three cities. The Freedom from Poverty Trust is providing oxygen cylinders for free to those in Lucknow that can’t afford them. Its founder, Montreal-based Shivendra Dwivedi, said that working with their partner, Comprehensive Rural Health Project in Jamkhed, Maharashtra, they have converted a hospital being jointly run there into a dedicated Covid-19 facility and is treating 92 patients admitted there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sending-rs-60-crore-fiscal-support-to-india-for-pandemic-response-101619587296925.html

That's what's going to help to bring that kind of broad-based prosperity back... President Trump built the strongest economy our country has ever seen, and I am going to fight to bring it back," Greitens said.According to The Hill, former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel also mentioned Trump's a dozen times in a press release announcing his campaign to replace retiring Senator Rob Portman."Josh Mandel was proud to be the first statewide elected official in Ohio to support President Trump in 2016 when others were supporting John Kasich. After seeing the second sham impeachment take place this February, Josh was motivated to run for the U.S. Senate to continue to fight for President Trump's America First agenda," said Scott Guthrie, Mandel's campaign manager.Meanwhile, Former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken called on Representative Anthony Gonzalez, one of the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January, to resign.Trump remains the best fundraiser within the Republican Party. Several strategists said the average email solicitation with Trump's signature raises much more than an email without his name, The Hill reported.The ex-US president has so far endorsed eight Senators facing reelection next year, along with Brooks in Alabama and two candidates running for Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-republicans-embrace-trump-for-2022-senate-elections-101619585505780.html
28-04-2021||World||Kamala Harris takes on 'hard work' in 100 days as Vice President||When President Joe Biden named Kamala Harris as his running mate, there were whispers about her ambition — would a former rival be a loyal soldier to a president she so sharply criticized on the campaign trail?Fueling those whispers was their relationship — while cordial, it was initially not particularly close.But 100 days into Biden's term, things look very different. Harris has become one of the administration’s most prominent advocates for Biden's agenda, standing alongside him at most of his major announcements and building a relationship that aides say is closer than most presidents had with their seconds-in-command.Harris has taken on one of the administration’s toughest tasks — addressing the root causes of migration to the U.S. from Mexico and Central America. The problem has bedeviled presidents from both parties for years and has no easy solutions.Tina Flournoy, Harris' chief of staff, said the vice president has “taken it on with gusto."“She has said to me, ‘When you decide you’re going to run for office and your name is on the ballot, next to it are not two boxes that say, ‘easy work’ and ‘hard work,'" Flournoy said.Of the hard problems, Flournoy added: “Are we supposed to ignore them because they’re hard? Or are we supposed to really dig in and try to fix them?”The COVID-19 pandemic has been the administration’s greatest challenge during its first 100 days. The public health and economic crisis of historic proportions has forced the White House to work differently from Day One of Biden’s tenure.The pandemic sharply limited travel by the president and vice president, which has had at least one silver lining: Because Harris hasn’t been on the move as much as past vice presidents early on, she’s spent more time with Biden, helping to cement their relationship. The two have had lunch every Friday, and on a typical day may spend four to five hours in meetings together, which ensures that her voice is heard and her fingerprints are left on major policy decisions, aides say. They point to the expansion of the child tax credit and child care funding as examples of her priorities.Harris had a role in developing Biden's agenda and "also the strategy of selling it, both to the American people, and on the Hill,” Flournoy said.Aides say Harris has also shown enthusiasm for some less-glamorous aspects of the administration’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan as she’s been promoting it — such as water issues, with which she had experience during her time as a U.S. senator for California, broadband access and provisions expanding electric vehicle use.Being the nation’s first Black, South Asian and female vice president informs her office in ways both big and small. And she will have a prominent place behind Biden on Wednesday as he addresses a joint session of Congress for the first time.Harris has chosen to champion issues that have been top priorities for much of her career and reflect her own lived experience. She told aides on her first day in office that she wanted to focus on relief to small businesses. She’s also focused on policies that affect women and children, including Black maternal mortality. And she has homed in on the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and sluggish economy on women and people of color.Harris has decorated her office with small nods to her historic role: a bust of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, donated by her alma mater, Howard University, along with the shoulder bars from the first Black female brigade commander at the U.S. Naval Academy.Her support for the president and his agenda may have strengthened their relationship, but it's left some advocates wanting more from her on two major issues — criminal justice reform and immigration.On criminal justice reform — one of her campaign priorities — Harris has hardly been out front. While she’s spoken alongside Biden in response to recent mass shootings, and at an event announcing his executive orders on guns, the administration as a whole hasn’t made a significant public push on the issue.Andrea James, executive director and founder of the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women & Girls, said that considering Harris is “a woman of color, her history, her pride and speaking about her mom who was a brave and courageous woman and fought obstacles because of the color of her skin,” they expected to see more from her speaking out on the issue.Aides say Harris is making calls to Capitol Hill and working on the criminal justice issue behind the scenes.On immigration, Harris has been hammered from the left and right as she's taken on her new role addressing the root causes of migration at the southern border.While Republicans have criticized Biden and Harris as absent on the issue because they haven't visited the border yet, progressive immigration groups complain the administration hasn't done enough to push for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Lorella Praeli, president of Community Change Action, said Harris was a “true champion for immigrants" as a senator and it was important that she now “lean in and she help to carry this issue."Some of Harris’ allies have expressed concerns that the problem is so amorphous and intractable that there’s no clear solution, and that Harris will be judged harshly even if she makes progress.The concern arises in part from a desire to protect Harris’ political future. While Biden insists he plans on running for reelection, many political observers believe he’ll decide against it, clearing a path for Harris.Experts and advocates focused on immigration say it’s too early to judge the outcome of her work there. Harris has thus far had conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Guatemala, and is planning her first trip to the region in June.Dan Restrepo, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who’s been in meetings on the issue with Harris, said “she asks very good questions” and her early move to bring together experts on the migrant crisis “is a really encouraging sign.” He also pushed back against criticism that Harris doesn’t have the experience to tackle the issue.“I think the skill set that she brings to the table, as a successful politician and somebody who gets people, is probably the most important translatable skill,” he said.That human approach, aides say, shapes her approach to everything from policy to diplomacy.“She will emphasize that we need to speak directly with the American people, that she doesn’t want to just give rhetoric,” said Rohini Kosoglu, Harris' domestic policy adviser.When Harris is briefed before calling or meeting a foreign leader, she wants more than just the political topline, asking about the leader's hobbies and interests, ”so she has a real sense of the person,” Flournoy said. When she spoke with the Japanese prime minister earlier this month, she wanted to know about his love of baseball.And when she swears in new Cabinet members at her ceremonial office in the executive office building across from the White House, Flournoy says, Harris asks them to take a moment to be present, and tells them to think about “all the reasons you’re here and all the work you’re going to do."Then she brings them out on her balcony to look at the American flag flying high over the West Wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-takes-on-hard-work-in-100-days-as-vice-president-101619584094567.html
28-04-2021||World||Hope Biden asks Pfizer to allow India to develop its vaccines, says Congressman Ro Khanna||With millions of lives at stake amid a rapid spread of COVID-19, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna said he hoped President Joe Biden would call the Pfizer CEO to let India produce its vaccine at least for six months or a year.Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley in the US House of Representatives, has been an ardent supporter of the move by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver of COVID-19 vaccines."Allow India to develop that vaccine, and this is good in your own long-term interests. It's good for the United States and our interests with the role with India and the rest of the world," Khanna told the media.Major pharma companies like Pfizer and Moderna and organisations like the US Chambers of Commerce are opposing such a move.A day earlier, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai spoke with the CEOs of Pfizer and AstraZeneca regarding the TRIPS waiver, which is slated to come up before the WTO on May 5."I do know there are very senior people in the administration who are supportive of it. We are making the case to the White House. And my hope is that the President would at least call the Pfizer CEO and say, look, your long-term strategy in India, a huge market, just in your economic interest, at least waive it for six months or a year," Khanna said.Microsoft founder and eminent philanthropist Bill Gates in a media interview on Monday opposed the move.Asked about it, Khanna said, "I rarely think Bill Gates is wrong, but this is a case I hope he will engage. The point that Bill Gates made about manufacturing capacity being restricted is absolutely correct. But what I said is why not have a global fund, USD25 billion, to help with manufacturing capacity and then allow the vaccine recipes to be shared.""You're not going to have a lack of quality control. I think it is patronising to say that 100 other nations can't have a regulatory process to make sure that manufacturing is safe. They can and the World Health Organization can," he added."No one is asking Pfizer to manufacture these vaccines, no one is saying they need to do it for free. It's important to understand, they will get paid. They will be able to sell it. The reason they're not doing it would be pure greed," Khanna said.The United States government gave a USD2 billion guarantee to Pfizer to purchase vaccines."If it weren't for that, Pfizer would have never been able to do what they did. Our NIH gave the IP that allowed Moderna to develop the vaccine," he argued."What we're now saying is that they should share the vaccine recipe with over 100 countries who want to do the manufacturing. They're willing to do the manufacturing themselves, they need to have contract manufacturing. Pfizer would still get paid. Moderna would still get paid. But it is just wrong, morally wrong, strategically wrong for them not to share the vaccine recipe, which was developed with US taxpayer support," Khanna further said.He applauded Biden for committing to help India in its fight against the virus."But we also ultimately need to get vaccines to India. The president has said that he will release the AstraZeneca vaccine, which Americans are not going to use after it's deemed safe. But more important is Pfizer and Moderna need to license the vaccine recipe to allow India and other countries to manufacture it," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-biden-asks-pfizer-to-allow-india-to-develop-its-vaccines-says-congressman-ro-khanna-101619577044752.html

It's hard to take," Francois Legault, the premier of Quebec, told a news conference.The French-speaking province's chief public health officer Horacio Arruda said life-saving treatments did not work and the unidentified patient died of cerebral thrombosis after being vaccinated.But he cautioned that the death should not change the government's recommendations to use the vaccine for those over 45 years old."We knew about serious complications, there was one in 100,000 (doses administered). But we must remember that, to date, we have had more than 400,000 people who have been vaccinated with AstraZeneca," Quebec health minister Christian Dube added.As of last Friday, just over 1.1 million AstraZeneca doses had been administered nationwide.Only four other cases of blood clots associated with low platelets have been reported in the country, and each patient recovered.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received an AstraZeneca shot on Friday.On Tuesday, the Canadian leader said about 60 soldiers had been deployed to overwhelmed hospitals in Nova Scotia to help care for critical patients.The day before about 30 army nurses and health technicians were sent to reinforce hospital staff in Ontario, which is struggling with a new wave of infections led by variants.In Quebec, which has suffered the most Covid deaths of any region in the country, the latest data showed rates of infections were slowing, allowing the government to announce it was pushing the start of a nightly curfew in Montreal from 8 pm to 9:30 pm (0130 GMT) starting next Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-reports-first-death-linked-to-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101619574904979.html
28-04-2021||World||'It was rough': Pramila Jayapal reveals parents tested positive for Covid-19||Indian-American Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal has disclosed that both her parents, who live in India, were recently diagnosed with COVID-19 and hospitalised.Jayapal said her parents contracted the disease at the start of the current surge. They are now back home and recuperating, she added.The first-ever Indian-American Congresswoman who represents Seattle in the US House of Representatives was recently in India to meet her ailing parents."It was rough. I've got to say both my parents are there. They're 80 and 90 years old. They were both diagnosed with COVID. They both ended up in the hospital. My dad needed oxygen," she told the media on Tuesday."Now in retrospect, I'm almost glad -- it's a strange thing to say that it happened when it did, because they were at the beginning of the surge. I'm not sure they could have gotten into the hospital or gotten oxygen had they not been. They are thankfully home and recuperating," Jayapal said."They've made it through the roughest time. And I think the fact that they got the first dose of the vaccine four weeks before actually helped to limit their symptoms. But we saw it happening," the Indian-American Congresswoman said.Jayapal said she was there in India with her parents as the cases started ramping up."I'm talking to my parents every day and I'm hearing, just the fear that everyone has because this is so extreme, it's coming so quickly. We pushed very hard to make sure, and we're grateful to the (US) President (Joe Biden) for making sure that we can get those raw materials (for the manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines in India) over there," she said.Applauding Biden for his statement on India, Jayapal said those things are going to start happening right away.The CDC is also sending a team to assist India. "That is immediate because there are no hospital beds. I saw it just in my little area, that hospital was completely full," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-rough-pramila-jayapal-reveals-parents-tested-positive-for-covid19-101619570251749.html
28-04-2021||World||Elon Musk says US SEC is sometimes 'too close' to Wall Street hedge funds||Tesla Inc chief executive Elon Musk said on Tuesday the US Securities and Exchange Commission was an important watchdog for investors but questioned why it was not more proactive against the growth of listed blank-check companies."They have an important role to play in protecting the public from getting swindled, but are sometimes too close to Wall St hedge funds imo (in my opinion)," Musk said on Twitter https://bit.ly/3u4qnrC."Strange that they aren't taking more action on some of the SPACs (special purpose acquisition companies)," he added.Reuters reported earlier on Tuesday that the SEC is considering new guidance to rein in growth projections made by SPACs, or listed blank-check companies, including clarification of when they qualify for certain legal protections. That would extend an SEC crackdown on a deal frenzy in SPACs, which the regulator worries is putting investors at risk.Musk has had his own run-ins with the SEC. He reached a settlement with the regulator after he tweeted in August 2018 that he had "funding secured" to potentially take Tesla private in a $72 billion transaction. In reality, Musk was not close to acquiring funding.Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines, and Tesla lawyers agreed to vet some of Musk's tweets in advance.Musk was sued by a shareholder last month who accused him of violating his 2018 settlement with the SEC. The case is ongoing.Musk also tweeted earlier on Tuesday that he found the Federal Communications Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to be "fair & sensible" and that he agreed with them "99.9% of the time"."On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn't anticipate", he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-says-us-sec-is-sometimes-too-close-to-wall-street-hedge-funds-101619570025225.html
28-04-2021||World||US senators urge President Biden to impose more sanctions against Myanmar junta||A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Tuesday urged the Biden administration to slap more sanctions on the military junta in Myanmar, including choking revenues to a state energy company, in response to its coup and violent crackdown on protesters.Senators Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, and four others urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a letter to "explore new avenues to support the people of Burma in their ongoing struggle for democracy in the face of escalating crimes against humanity."They want the Biden administration to stop royalties flowing from businesses including U.S. energy major Chevron Corp to Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, or MOGE, an agency within the Energy Ministry. MOGE provides financial support to military leaders, including General Min Aung Hlaing, already under U.S. sanctions.MOGE is a partner in Yadana, a natural gas field in which Chevron has a 28.3% stake.Human rights groups have urged energy companies including Chevron and Total to cut ties to Myanmar after the military ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, detaining her and cracking down on protesters. More than 750 people have since been killed.Gas revenues from joint ventures involving companies like Total and Chevron are the most significant single source of foreign exchange revenue for the Myanmar government, generating cash payments of about $1.1 billion annually, the senators said.They proposed the ventures pay revenue into a trust to be held until Myanmar has a democratically elected government or to be used for humanitarian purposes, according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.A Chevron representative said any diversion of revenues or taxes owed to MOGE into an escrow account "could be considered a breach of contract and potentially put employees of the joint venture partners at undue risk of criminal prosecution."Total did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The State and Treasury departments did not immediately respond.Chevron paid around $50 million to Myanmar between 2014 and 2018, according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which works to increase transparency in international business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-urge-president-biden-to-impose-more-sanctions-against-myanmar-junta-101619569541569.html

28-04-2021||World||India's Covaxin found to neutralise '617' variant of Covid-19, says Dr Fauci||Covaxin, India’s home-grown COVID-19 vaccine, has been found to neutralise the 617 variant of the deadly virus, White House chief medical adviser and America's top pandemic expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said.Fauci was speaking to reporters during a conference call on Tuesday."This is something where we're still gaining data on a daily basis. But the most recent data, was looking at convalescent Sera of COVID-19 cases and people who received the vaccine used in India, the Covaxin. It was found to neutralise the 617 variant," he said."So, despite the real difficulty that we're seeing in India, vaccination could be a very, very important antidote against this," Fauci added.The New York Times on Tuesday said Covaxin works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that stud its surface.Developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research, Covaxin was approved for emergency use on January 3. Trial results later showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 78 per cent.Responding to a question, Dr Andy Slavitt, White House COVID-19 Response Senior Advisor, said that a strike team from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is headed over to India to help coordinate this response."We are making sure that we are locating some of the raw materials necessary to create more vaccines in India, which I think is going to be an important help there," he said."We stand with the country of India during this very trying and tragic surge. We are working to deploy resources and supplies, including therapeutics, rapid testing kits, ventilators, PPE, and raw materials, that are needed to manufacture vaccines in India, and the CDC, which has a long history of working with and in India on public health measures, will be deploying a strike team to the country to support the public health efforts there," Slavitt said.Given the strong portfolio of approved, highly effective and safe vaccines here in the United States, the administration is looking at options to share AstraZeneca vaccines with other countries as they become available.This should amount to around 60 million doses or so over the next two months, he added."The AstraZeneca vaccine is highly safe and effective, and approved in many parts of the world, and since it is not approved for use in the US, we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next few months," Slavitt said."We have sufficient supply of vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson to accommodate our needs in the US," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-covaxin-found-to-neutralise-617-variant-of-covid-19-says-dr-fauci-101619569155683.html
28-04-2021||World||UK government green lights 'self-driving' cars on motorways||The UK government on Wednesday became the first country to announce it will regulate the use of self-driving vehicles at slow speeds on motorways, with the first such cars possibly appearing on public roads as soon as this year.Britain's transport ministry said it was working on specific wording to update the country's highway code for the safe use of self-driving vehicle systems, starting with Automated Lane Keeping Systems (ALKS) - which use sensors and software to keep cars within a lane, allowing them to accelerate and brake without driver input.The government said the use of ALKS would be restricted to motorways, at speeds under 37 miles (60 km) per hour.The UK government wants to be at the forefront of rolling out autonomous driving technology and the transport ministry forecasts by 2035 around 40% of new UK cars could have self-driving capabilities, creating up to 38,000 new skilled jobs."The automotive industry welcomes this vital step to permit the use of automated vehicles on UK roads, which will put Britain in the vanguard of road safety and automotive technology," Mike Hawes, CEO of car industry lobby group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said in a statement.But insurance companies warn that Britain's goal of being a leader in adopting self-driving cars could backfire unless automakers and regulators spell out the current limitations of the technology available today.They say calling ALKS 'automated,' or using the synonymous term 'self-driving', will confuse British drivers into thinking the cars can drive themselves, causing accidents and risking a public backlash against the technology."Aside from the lack of technical capabilities, by calling ALKS automated our concern also is that the UK Government is contributing to the confusion and frequent misuse of assisted driving systems that have unfortunately already led to many tragic deaths," said Matthew Avery, research director at Thatcham Research, which has tested ALKS systems.The dangers of drivers apparently misunderstanding the limits of technology has been an issue in the United States, where regulators are reviewing about 20 crashes involving Tesla's driver assistance tools, such as its 'Autopilot' system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-green-lights-self-driving-cars-on-motorways-101619568508169.html

The higher risk comes from closer contact between passengers in the same rows clustering in the aisle as they stow their luggage.Delta adopted back-to-front boarding to “minimize contact with other customers,” according to its website, though the U.S. airline only boards 10 passengers at a time. The change was among several across the industry -- including blocking out middle seats --- to persuade passengers it is safe to get back on a plane.Scientists from institutions including the University of West Florida and Florida State University simulated 16,000 possible passenger movements for the study. “The new policies do not improve on the old ones in any situation,” they said. Delta’s media office didn’t reply to an email seeking comment.The risk of virus exposure could be reduced by stopping people using overhead storage bins, and by boarding passengers in window seats before those in aisle seats, according to the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-risk-greater-if-passengers-board-plane-back-to-front-finds-study-101619567574286.html
