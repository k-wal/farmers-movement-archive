He told reporters that he does not believe the White House has a public mandate to pursue the plan."I'm going to fight them every step of the way, because I think this is the wrong prescription for America," he said.Biden's infrastructure plan, unveiled on Wednesday, charts a course for dramatic change in the direction of the US economy and includes investments in traditional projects like roads and bridges along with climate change initiatives and human services like elder care."There's more money in that plan that the president laid out in Pittsburgh for electric cars than for roads and bridges. Let me say that again: more money for electric cars than roads and bridges," McConnell said.Biden has proposed funding the package by raising the tax rate on US corporations to 28% from 21% and making it harder for companies to use offshore tax shelters and other methods to reduce their tax burdens.McConnell warned that "massive tax increases" would harm the economy and said the package's spending level could run up the debt. The White House says the infrastructure proposal would more than pay for itself."My view about infrastructure is, we ought to build that which we can afford and not either whack the economy with major tax increases or run up the national debt," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/every-step-of-the-way-mcconnell-pledges-battle-over-biden-infrastructure-plan-101617300181797.html
01-04-2021||World||Allies raise alarm over health of hunger-striking Alexei Navalny||Supporters of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny are raising concerns about his decision to launch a hunger strike, saying they fear more damage to his already-fragile health.President Vladimir Putin's most prominent opponent announced the hunger strike on Wednesday to demand proper medical treatment in prison.The 44-year-old is serving two-and-a-half years on old fraud charges in a penal colony east of Moscow. He was arrested when he returned to Russia in January from Germany, where he had spent months recovering from a near-fatal poisoning he blames on the Kremlin.Navalny says he is suffering in prison from severe back pain and numbness in his legs and has only been given painkillers.On Thursday, his team said in a statement he had lost eight kilogrammes (18 pounds), even before he went on hunger strike and now weighs 85 kilogrammes.They said the weight loss was linked to sleep deprivation that Navalny called a form of "torture"."They are still not allowing a doctor to visit."His announcement of a hunger strike is no idle threat and they do not expect he will back down, they said."Navalny has always taken such a step as a hunger strike extremely seriously," spokesman Ruslan Shaveddinov told AFP."We are very concerned about his condition and that's why we are demanding immediate access to doctors."Navalny is still recovering from the poisoning last August, when he began howling in pain and collapsed on a flight from Siberia to Moscow, forcing the plane to make an emergency landing in the city of Omsk.He was treated for several days by local doctors and eventually flown to Berlin in an induced coma.'Very alarming'Western experts concluded he was poisoned with the Soviet-era nerve agent Novichok. Russian authorities have repeatedly denied any involvement.Navalny spent months recovering in Germany, going through physical therapy to re-learn how to walk and even lift a glass of water.True to usual form, Navalny initially made light of his recent ailments, but on Wednesday turned serious."I have the right to ask for a doctor and receive medicine... Jokes aside but this is already bothering me," he said.The prison service said Navalny is provided with "all the necessary medical assistance in accordance with his current medical condition".Shaveddinov said Navalny would not have taken the decision to go on hunger strike lightly."After a poisoning, no one knows what kind of reaction a body might have in this situation -- and this is very alarming," he said.Navalny's team declined to provide details as to how the hunger strike will be carried out, but it is an action his allies have experience with.His ally Lyubov Sobol spent 32 days drinking only liquids in the summer of 2019 after she and other opposition politicians were barred from standing in local elections.In 2015, Navalny's right-hand man Leonid Volkov and a group of activists in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk went on hunger strike after they were disqualified from local elections.That action ended after 12 days, when one of the group's members, opposition politician Sergei Boyko, was hospitalised.'Unbearable' situationRussia's most prominent political hunger striker in recent years was Oleg Sentsov, a Ukrainian filmmaker and outspoken critic of Moscow's annexation of his native Crimea in 2014.Arrested and jailed in 2015 on terrorism charges, Sentsov went on hunger strike in 2018 demanding that he and Ukrainian political prisoners in Russia be freed.He ended it after 145 days of subsisting on nutritional supplements -- and glucose drips near the end -- after prison officials announced they would force feed him to ensure his survival.Sentsov, who was eventually released in a 2019 prisoner swap, lost 20 kilogrammes during the strike.Russian law requires the prison service to force feed prisoners if they will not eat voluntarily.It does not specify how this should be done but rights activists have reported that prisoners are fed a "nutrient mixture" orally, rectally or through a tube.Navalny "is well aware that a hunger strike is a desperate step", an ally, economist Sergei Guriev, said on Twitter."Since he went on a hunger strike, it means that he believes that he has nothing to lose, that the situation is unbearable."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/allies-raise-alarm-over-health-of-hunger-striking-alexei-navalny-101617295998797.html
01-04-2021||World||Pakistan court allows commercial sale of Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine||A Pakistani court on Thursday ordered that a batch of the Russian Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine imported by a private company be immediately made available to the public for sale, according to a court document and officials.The government had argued that pricing issues should be settled first."Any restriction relating to sale of the COVID-19 vaccine at this stage would be against the public interest because of its undisputed urgent need due to the crisis faced by the country," a Sindh High Court judge said in an order on Thursday.Pakistan, largely reliant on the COVAX vaccine-sharing initiative, last month allowed private firms to import vaccines and agreed to exempt them from price caps, but later rescinded the exemption and said it would set maximum prices.The decision threw the government and pharmaceutical companies into dispute, and stalled the commercial sale of the vaccine.Thursday's court order was passed in a case brought last week by M/S AGP Ltd, which imported 50,000 doses of Sputnik V on March 17.A senior official of AGP told Reuters that the company had asked the court to allow it to sell the vaccine at a price of 12,268 Pakistani rupees ($80.54) for a pack of two doses of Sputnik V.It was not immediately clear if this would be the price it would be marketed at, which is much higher than the initial government proposed price of 8,449 Pakistani rupees ($55.47).AG Pharma had told the court it has cost the company $45 for a pack of two doses.The court said it would hold further hearings to determine pricing, but said the sale of the vaccines should start immediately and, once a fair price was determined, any monetary difference could be recovered from the company at a later stage.Pakistan is one of the first countries in the world to allow the commercial sale of Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-court-allows-commercial-sale-of-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-101617296226054.html

01-04-2021||World||Fox News takes on late-night comedy with right-leaning talk show||Fox News is entering the late-night talk-show wars.The Rupert Murdoch-controlled network is moving its in-house political satirist, Greg Gutfeld, over to an 11 p.m. weeknights slot where he can go joke-to-joke with other late-night hosts, including ABC’s Jimmy Kimmel, CBS’s Stephen Colbert and NBC’s Jimmy Fallon, who start about a half-hour later.The network, part of Murdoch’s Fox Corp., has been buying ad spots on those and other late-night programs to promote “Gutfeld!,” as the new show will be called. Fox News even placed a billboard across the street from the Los Angeles studio where Kimmel records his show, declaring, “Cancel culture just got cancelled!” The Gutfeld program premieres April 5.Fox executives are hoping he can do for late-night TV what the channel did in news: create a conservative alternative to the other middle-of-the-road or liberal-leaning networks. It’s certainly worked for Fox News, which has been the most-viewed cable news channel for 19 years running. Gutfeld, in an interview, said he sees the same scenario playing out.“They are covering the same turf. They are getting all their sustenance from the same buffet,” he said of his rivals. “That leaves a whole swath for me to pick apart.”$500 Million MarketAt stake is a slice of a late-night TV advertising market worth some $500 million a year, according to market researcher Kantar. But it’s about more than ad dollars for Fox News. For the first time in its history, the network is facing competition from even-more-conservative channels, Newsmax and One America News Network. Offering more unique programming may help it stand out.Fox Corp., which sold the bulk of its entertainment assets to Walt Disney Co. two years ago, is trying to broaden its offerings beyond political news. Its $6-a-month Fox Nation video streaming service, for example, features true-crime stories, Bible studies and reruns of “Duck Dynasty,” the reality show about a Louisiana bird-hunting clan.A satirical late-night chat show could potentially attract a younger audience to Fox News, particularly if Gutfeld can prove as adept at creating viral videos for social media as rivals such as Fallon, CBS’s James Corden and HBO’s John Oliver.Gutfeld, a 14-year veteran at Fox News, had been drawing a strong audience with his last program, “The Greg Gutfeld Show,” which aired at 10 p.m. New York time on Saturdays. It averaged 2.56 million total viewers a night last year, according to Nielsen data. That put it ahead of all the other late-night hosts but Colbert, who averaged 2.61 million.“The country is divided, almost in half,” said Steve Nason, research director at Parks Associates, a media consulting firm. “There’s certainly a place for other perspectives.”Odd RouteGutfeld, 56, has taken an odd route to becoming a conservative provocateur. He grew up in the San Francisco Bay area, where he majored in English at the University of California, Berkeley. He recalls campaigning for nuclear disarmament in high school and losing a debate on the topic his senior year.At college, however, a schoolmate turned him on to conservative publications such as the American Spectator and National Review.“I’d never seen them before and there’s actually funny stuff in there,” he recalled. “They’re well-written, witty pieces. And I thought, ‘I didn’t know this existed at all.’”He worked as a magazine editor, for titles such as Men’s Health and later the U.K. version of Maxim, the men’s lifestyle magazine, and contributed to the Huffington Post. But he also made appearances on Fox News, which led to him being hired for “Red Eye,” a very late-night show, in 2007.That satirical take on the day’s news ran at 3 a.m. weeknights. Gutfeld, who describes himself as a libertarian, often had liberal guests and sidekicks, as well as up-and-coming comedians such as Amy Schumer and Chelsea Handler.The new show will continue to feature his longtime sidekick Tyrus, a professional wrestler whose real name is George Murdoch, no relation. Gutfeld is beefing up his writing staff with stand-up comedians to help with the requirements of daily production.“I’ve always written my own stuff, so it’s going to be weird to adopt that prototypical setup of joke writers,” he said. He’ll rely more on taped segments to quicken the show and take some of the pressure off himself.“That’s always been my flaw,” he said. “My pacing has always been too skittery and high-strung, but that’s also my brain.”A rotating series of guests will sit in a campfire-like semicircle, including writers, politicians and even former CIA agents, according to Tom O’Connor, one of the producers. Skits will feature regular panelists Tom Shillue, playing Joe Biden, and Katherine Timpf, as press secretary Jennifer Psaki.‘The Five’Gutfeld is perhaps best known to the broader Fox News audience for his regular monologues on “The Five,” the network’s afternoon panel discussion show.Among his recent targets have been Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s interview that was critical of Harry’s family (“There’s nothing I like more than royal-on-royal action. It’s like a story with two Cuomos!”), and what he considers mainstream media’s coddling of Biden (“Hey, did you hear Joe has a Peloton, I got two sources to go on record!”).Then there’s the subject of alleged fraud in the November election, which he described in January as having had “more irregularities than at an Ex-Lax festival.”Gutfeld stands by that statement, but also concedes Biden is the duly elected president.“You can possess all of these thoughts at once,” he said. “There are irregularities, but Joe won.”Culture WarsGutfeld’s big target, other than rival media outlets, is the culture wars, and what he perceives as an overdose of political correctness. Topics he’s recently taken on include the backlash over Rachael Kirkconnell, a contestant on the ABC reality show “The Bachelor,” having attended an Old South-themed party.“Kirkconnell is White, currently trying to marry the Black male star,” Gutfeld said recently in a monologue. “Making her a pretty lame racist.”Conservative commentators such as Gutfeld can have a hard time as comedians because it requires poking fun at themselves and not being so sure about their beliefs, said Steve Kaplan, a comedy-writing coach and author of “The Hidden Tools of Comedy.”“A comic will find comedy wherever it is and exploit it, because first and foremost they’re trying to get laughs,” Kaplan said. “They look at the world as absurd. Fox wants to enrage people, get them angry.”Will Gutfeld make Donald Trump jokes?“I’ve made my fair share of them,” the host said. “I have a feeling Trump will be back on the turf doing something. And when that happens, we’ll be there.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fox-news-takes-on-late-night-comedy-with-right-leaning-talk-show-101617290582192.html
01-04-2021||World||US Covid-19 vaccine rollout analysis hampered by technology, state data reporting||When a dose of a Covid-19 vaccine leaves a US manufacturing plant, its path can be traced all the way to the hospital or clinic representative signing for the shipment at its destination. What happens next is not always clear.Federal agencies overseeing the rollout are relying on a tangled web of aging state vaccine registries complicated by state laws and practices.Data collection has improved since the national vaccination campaign began in December, with county-level reporting in most states. But gaps and tech issues remain that could compromise equitable distribution of doses, analysis of vaccine protection, and identification of pockets of vaccine hesitancy, experts said.It is a monumental task as the national vaccination campaign gathers steam with an average of 2.4 million shots going into arms each day and rising, and some 196 million doses distributed since December.As the vaccine rollout opens to all American adults, analysts will be watching whether the less advantaged lose out."Are we achieving our equity goals?" said Dr. William Moss, executive director of the International Vaccine Access Center at Johns Hopkins University. "That would be very hard to tease out at a federal level, given the variation in how states are reporting."The uncoordinated nature of data collection in Marin County, California, across the Golden Gate bridge from San Francisco, "makes it virtually impossible for me to have that global view that I need to be able to see who is getting vaccinated and who isn't," said Dr. Matt Willis, county public health officer.The US vaccine data system has two main parts: recently developed federal software from Palantir Technologies Inc that closely tracks distribution of doses, and a range of systems used by states that report into decade-old federal systems developed for limited tracking of child vaccinations."We know where every single dose was delivered; we know when it was delivered; we know who ordered it; we know who signed for it; we know who dropped it off at the location," said one person involved in tracking vaccine distribution. "Where we lose sight of it is when (the providers) take it."'IT'S NOT PERFECT'Matthew Ritchey, an epidemiologist and data expert at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said vaccine data collection has improved significantly since the beginning of the rollout. The CDC, which is leading the nation's vaccine data collection, now has a more detailed view of inoculations across the country."Does that mean perfect? No, it's not perfect. But the amount of information that we're collecting now on a daily basis is pretty astounding," he said, with most vaccinators reporting shots within the required 72 hours.Last week, the CDC also publicly released county level data for the first time since the rollout began. A Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF) report using the data found counties with high Black and Hispanic populations had lower vaccination rates than others, confirming what many health experts had feared.However, KFF was only able to analyze about 72% of the counties due to low quality or incomplete county-level data from a dozen states, including Colorado, Georgia, and Virginia.The CDC itself has a Texas-sized gap in its own data. The federal government is not receiving the same detailed information about vaccinations of the Lone Star state's 29 million residents that it's getting from other states, because Texas statutes prevent it from sending that data to the federal government. Instead, Texas is sending aggregate reports.Lynn Gibbs-Scharf, the CDC's co-lead for data monitoring and reporting for its Covid-19 vaccine taskforce, said the agency had no immediate plans to replace systems from the early and mid-2000s that were developed for tracking childhood vaccinations and repurposed for Covid-19."We want (the states) to have systems that can accommodate their unique needs for managing vaccination at the local level, but that conform to a standard that allows them to exchange data beyond their jurisdiction," Gibbs-Scharf said.Marin county's Willis sees much more to be done."It says a lot about how poorly the nation is equipped to manage the data challenges when we're having these problems in the Bay Area, with all our tech and informatics innovation. If anyone should be able to get this right, it's California," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-vaccine-rollout-analysis-hampered-by-technology-state-data-reporting-101617288274177.html

The lawsuit accused Menlo Park, California-based Facebook of violating the TCPA's restriction on using an automatic telephone dialing system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-bars-suit-against-facebook-under-anti-robocall-law-101617288259159.html

Citing the data compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), the rights organisation on Thursday said in a statement that the death toll of children has more than doubled in the past 12 days. The report suggests that the youngest victim of the violence was a seven-year-old girl.According to a BBC report, the seven-year-old girl was killed by police while she ran towards her father during a raid on their home. Among the dead is a 13-year-old boy who was reportedly shot in the head while trying to run away from the armed forces.A 14-year-old boy is believed to have been shot while he was inside or around his home in Mandalay. Save the Children expressed shock over the continued targeting of children despite repeated calls to protect them from harm.“This is a nightmare scenario unfolding. Innocent children have had their futures brutally and needlessly snatched away from them. Grieving families – among them young children who have seen siblings die – are suffering unimaginable loss and pain,” Save the Children said.“Children have witnessed violence and horror. It is clear that Myanmar is no longer a safe place for children,” it further added.The UN special envoy for Myanmar has warned about the possibility of civil war in the country "at an unprecedented scale". Christine Schraner Burgener urged the UN Security Council to consider "potentially significant action" to reverse the military coup and restore democracy. The reports of violence have sparked global outrage and countries like the US and the UK have announced sanctions against the coup leaders and companies linked to Myanmar’s military, the Tatmadaw.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-43-children-in-myanmar-killed-by-armed-forces-says-rights-group-101617284642524.html
01-04-2021||World||Suu Kyi faces new charge under Myanmar's secrets act; wireless internet suspended||Myanmar's deposed leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has been charged with breaking a colonial-era official secrets law, her lawyer said on Thursday, the most serious charge against the veteran opponent of military rule.Myanmar has been rocked by protests since the army overthrew Suu Kyi's elected government on Feb. 1 citing unsubstantiated claims of fraud in a November election that her party swept.In a new measure to stifle communication about the turmoil, the junta ordered internet service providers to shut down wireless broadband services until further notice, several telecoms sources said.Suu Kyi and other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) have been detained since the coup and the junta had earlier accused her of several minor offences including illegally importing six handheld radios and breaching coronavirus protocols.Her chief lawyer, Khin Maung Zaw, told Reuters by telephone that Suu Kyi, three of her deposed cabinet ministers and a detained Australian economic adviser, Sean Turnell, were charged a week ago in a Yangon court under the official secrets law, adding he learned of the new charge two days ago.A conviction under the law can carry a prison sentence of up to 14 years.A spokesman for the junta did not answer telephone calls seeking comment.Suu Kyi, who is 75 and won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991 for her efforts to bring democracy to Myanmar, appeared via video link for a hearing in connection with the earlier charges on Thursday. Another of her lawyers, Min Min Soe, said she appeared to be in good health."Amay Su and President U Win Myint are in good health," the lawyer said, referring to Suu Kyi by an affectionate term for mother. The president, a Suu Kyi ally, was also deposed and detained in the coup. He too faces various charges.Their lawyers have said the charges against both of them were trumped up.At least 538 civilians have been killed in protests against the coup, 141 of them on Saturday, the bloodiest day of the unrest, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.Protesters were back out in several places on Thursday and two more people were killed, according to media reports, as activists burned copies of a military-framed constitution and called for unity among all those opposed to army rule.One person was killed and five wounded when the security forces fired in the central town of Monywa, the Monywa Gazette reported.Security forces also opened fire in the second largest city of Mandalay killing one person, media reported. Shots rang out and black smoke drifted over Myanmar's ancient royal capital.Police and a spokesman for the military did not answer calls seeking comment.The suspension of wireless internet connections is likely to cripple communications about the protests in a country where very people few have access to fixed line connections.'NEW DAY'The coup has also triggered new clashes in Myanmar's old wars.At least 20 soldiers were killed and four military trucks destroyed in clashes with the Kachin Independence Army (KIA), one of Myanmar's most powerful rebel groups, DVB news reported.Reuters could not immediately verify the reports and a junta spokesman did not answers calls seeking comment on the clash.Myanmar military aircraft have started bombing positions of another group, the Karen National Union (KNU), for the first time in more than 20 years and thousands of villagers have fled from their homes, many into Thailand.The army takeover has led to calls for a united opposition among city-based democracy campaigners and ethnic minority forces battling in frontier regions.Ousted members of parliament, mostly from Suu Kyi's party, have vowed to set up a federal democracy in a bid to address a long-standing demand from minority groups for autonomy.They also announced the scrapping of the 2008 constitution drawn up by the military that enshrines its control over politics. The military has long rejected federalism, seeing itself as the central power holding the fractious country together.Social media posts showed copies of the constitution, real and symbolic, being burned at rallies and in homes."The new day begin here!" Dr Sasa, the international envoy for the ousted parliamentarians said on Twitter, referring to what for now is not a change that proponents can make.Britain's Next on Thursday joined a growing list of European clothing retailers suspending new production orders with factories in Myanmar in the wake of the coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suu-kyi-faces-new-charge-under-myanmar-s-secrets-act-wireless-internet-suspended-101617284596573.html
01-04-2021||World||Covid-19 pandemic slowdown led to record fall in EU carbon market emissions||Emissions regulated by Europe's carbon market fell by 14.4% in 2020, their biggest percentage decline yet, as pandemic restrictions stifled economic activity and grounded flights, official data examined by carbon analysts at Refinitiv showed.Around 45% of the European Union's output of greenhouse gases is regulated by the Emissions Trading System (ETS), the bloc's flagship instrument to tackle global warming by charging for the right to emit carbon dioxide (CO2).The Refinitiv analysts' interpretation of European Commission data found emissions covered by the ETS totalled 1.365 billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent (CO2e), down 14.4% on the previous year.The fall was the largest in percentage terms since the market was launched in 2005.The market does not cover emissions from agriculture or transport beyond the aviation sector."The substantial drop in emissions is the fallout from the pandemic with economic activity shrinking last year and renewables displacing fossil-fired power," Refinitiv analyst Ingvild Sorhus said.With international travel restricted, aviation sector emissions dived 58.4% to 25.8 million tonnes CO2e.After aviation, the heat and power sector, whose emissions totalled 632.8 million tonnes of CO2e, down 17.1% on 2019, registered the next steepest fall.Stationary emissions covered by the scheme, such as from power plants and factories, totalled 1.339 billion tonnes of CO2e, down 12.6% on the previous year, the data showed.The figures were in line with analysts forecasts and the benchmark price of carbon permits in the ETS was little changed on Thursday at around 42.50 euros a tonne.Carbon prices have been rising since the European Union agreed last year to toughen its climate targets, which will increase demand for permits to emit, and hit a record high of 43.77 euros/tonne last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-slowdown-led-to-record-fall-in-eu-carbon-market-emissions-101617283414793.html
01-04-2021||World||UK data shows good immune response in over 80s after 2-dose Pfizer Covid shot||Some 98% of 80 to 96 year-olds who had two doses of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine had a strong antibody immune response, adding to evidence that it can help protect those most at risk of severe or fatal Covid-19, UK data showed on Thursday.A real-world study of 100 elderly people in Britain also found that participants who had previously been infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus had a peak antibody response after just one dose of the Pfizer vaccine, and this response remained high after their second dose.Paul Moss and Helen Parry, respectively a professor and a clinical lecturer at Birmingham University who co-led the study, said the high levels of antibodies detected were very reassuring, particularly since the antibody response was strong right up to the oldest participants at age 96."We were surprised, and very pleased," Moss told reporters at a briefing about the findings. "But, of course, this does go with the excellent clinical protection that we're seeing with the vaccine - so it does correlate."Pfizer and its co-developer BioNTech said earlier on Thursday that updated clinical trial data showed their vaccine is around 91% effective at preventing Covid-19 cases.Moss's and Parry's UK study involved 100 people aged 80-96 who were living independently and not in care homes, and who received two doses of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine three weeks apart. They were immunised before a UK policy change to extend the gap between Covid-19 vaccine doses to up to 12 weeks.Immune measurements were taken two weeks after the second dose, the researchers said. The results have not been peer-reviewed by other scientists.In laboratory tests, the researchers found the SARS-CoV-2 virus was strongly neutralised in serum from blood samples taken from participants.When tested against a mutated version of the virus called P.1 that was first discovered in Brazil, the levels of neutralisation reduced 14-fold, Parry said, but still showed the shot "retains broad efficacy" against this variant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-data-shows-good-immune-response-in-over-80s-after-2-dose-pfizer-covid-shot-101617281096355.html

Losing a vote of confidence would delay the formation of a new coalition government and weaken his position as head of the conservative VVD party.The no-confidence vote was to take place later in the day, after Rutte appeared in parliament to explain why he had told reporters he had not discussed a political appointment for one lawmaker, when it later emerged that he had.Rutte denies having lied."I did not lie, I acted honourably and in good conscience", Rutte said in parliament.Talks on forming a new government were abruptly put on hold on March 25 when one of the chief negotiators unwittingly revealed a sensitive document to a news photographer as she rushed out of parliament after learning that she had tested positive for Covid-19.The document showed that negotiators were discussing a position "elsewhere" for MP Pieter Omtzigt, a prominent critic of Rutte's previous Cabinet, though Omtzigt's Christian Democrats were a coalition member.Rutte told reporters on March 25 he had not been the one to mention Omtzigt's position, but notes from talks given to parliament this week showed he had in fact mentioned it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-parliament-to-hold-no-confidence-vote-on-caretaker-pm-rutte-101617280358309.html
01-04-2021||World||China takes aim at ‘illegal’ club for foreign correspondents||China slammed a foreign correspondents’ club in the country as an “illegal organization” in a move that broadens its attack on journalists whose reports differ from the government’s official line.The Foreign Correspondents’ Club of China has no sense of right and wrong and lacks principles, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said at a regular press briefing Thursday in Beijing.“Fewer than half of foreign correspondents in China are members of the FCCC, and most of them are Western journalists from the U.S. and Europe,” she said. “Foreign journalists in China should feel lucky.”The FCCC declined to comment.While Beijing has long described the FCCC as illegal, the rebuke as a whole was harsher than in the past. China’s criticism of reporters from abroad has become more pointed under the rule of President Xi Jinping, especially as China hits back at Western criticism of its activities in Xinjiang.Spokespeople for the government now regularly criticize reporters during press briefings, saying they lack credibility or complaining about their use of the word “camps” in the far western region. The government insists they be called vocational education “centers.”Western governments including the U.S. accuse China of interning as many as 1 million Muslim Uyghurs in Xinjiang and forcing them to work. Beijing denies the allegations, saying it is fighting religious extremism and providing jobs.The BBC’s China correspondent John Sudworth recently left Beijing for Taipei after criticism from the government over recent coverage. The BBC News Press Team said in a statement that his reporting “exposed truths the Chinese authorities did not want the world to know.”The Communist Party-backed Global Times characterized Sudworth’s work as biased. “From stigmatizing China as being the origin of the novel coronavirus to claiming Xinjiang’s cotton was ‘tainted,’ Sudworth has participated in many of BBC’s notorious reports attacking China in recent years,” it said.Beijing last year kicked a slew of foreign reporters out of the country, saying most of the expulsions were in response to curbs the U.S. placed on Chinese reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-takes-aim-at-illegal-club-for-foreign-correspondents-101617280510603.html
01-04-2021||World||India AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot delay could be 'catastrophic' for Africa: Health official||India's temporary hold on major exports of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 shot will undermine Africa's vaccination plans, and could have a "catastrophic" impact if extended, the head of the continent's disease control body said on Thursday.India decided to delay big exports of the shots made in its territory by the Serum Institute of India (SII) to make sure it could meet local demand, two sources told Reuters last week.The hold "will definitely impact our ability to continuously vaccinate people," the director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, John Nkengasong, told a news conference in Addis Ababa.The African Union had planned to vaccinate 20%-30% of the continent's population by the end of the year he said. "If the vaccines are delayed we are unlikely to meet our target," he added.That AU target primarily relies on supplies from the global COVAX vaccine-sharing facility, through which 64 poorer countries including many in Africa are supposed to get doses from the SII. COVAX aims to provide enough shots for African countries to inoculate at least 20% of their populations."If the delay continues, I hope it’s a delay and not a ban, that would be catastrophic for meeting our vaccinations schedule," Nkengasong said.African countries have reported 4.25 million coronavirus infections and 112,000 related deaths, though experts have said the actual numbers could be higher.The AU has also been negotiating with manufacturers to help member states secure the additional doses they they will need to achieve 60% coverage.On Monday, Johnson & Johnson announced it would supply the AU with up to 400 million doses of its Covid-19 vaccine. Delivery of those doses is due to begin in the third quarter of this year and will continue through 2022.Those doses are separate from the GAVI/WHO-backed global COVAX facility.Nkengasong said on Thursday the AU has "pivoted" towards the J&J shot in part as a result of the delay in the delivery of AstraZeneca shots, and also because it is a single-dose shot.The J&J doses will begin to arrive in June or July, which will ease any shortage caused by the delay in the AstraZeneca doses, Nkengasong said. The gap until the arrival of the J&J doses is a concern, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-astrazeneca-covid-19-shot-delay-could-be-catastrophic-for-africa-health-official-101617278130309.html

01-04-2021||World||Chinese media warns against using ‘crude’ methods to vaccinate citizens||China’s vaccination drive is in the eye of huge media storm as the campaign is being pushed in some cases by “crude” methods including linking it to better grading for students and even banning those who do not agree to take the jab from entering public places. Wancheng township in the Hainan province, for example, had to apologise on Wednesday and withdraw an order, which said that those who did not take the vaccine would not be allowed to enter public places such as supermarkets and restaurants and could not use public transport, a state media report said.The individuals, the notice said, could be added to a blacklist as well.On Wednesday, in a rare admission, Xinhua Daily Telegraph, a media outlet affiliated to the Xinhua news agency, warned against using “simple, crude” methods to persuade people to vaccinate.“It is worth noting that in the process of advancing vaccination, there have been some simple and crude bad signs in a few places,” the opinion piece said even as it lauded China’s vaccination campaign.It said that in some instances schools had linked the performances of both students and teachers to the number of vaccinations carried out by the school.Criticising the “one size fits all” way of carrying out the vaccination drive, the article said in some cases the jabs were given to factory workers “ignoring special physical conditions”; and, at yet others, the normal production of enterprises was hampered to increase the number of vaccinations.“A high school in the southern city of Shenzhen required faculty members who didn’t get vaccinated by the end of March to provide a written report to the principal explaining why,” a person who received the notice told Reuters.These methods may not only pose a medical risk to the unvaccinated population but may even increase the resistance in the population, the Xinhua piece said.The opinion piece warned that the vaccination drive like the epidemic prevention and control work was also a “…major test of grass-roots governance capacity”.China carried out about 5.1 million vaccinations against Covid-19 on March 31, bringing the total number administered to 119.82 million, the national health commission said on Thursday.“China’s mass vaccination campaign has entered the fast track with its daily inoculations leaping from 1 million to nearly 3 million within a week. The Global Times has learnt China’s overall inoculation rate to surpass 10 million per day, putting it on target to administering vaccines to 40 percent of the population,” the tabloid Global Times said in an article in late March.China’s daily vaccine output has climbed to 5 million doses every day from 1.5 million in February.The Chinese government vaccination task force announced a week ago that China plans to speed up its universal, free-of-charge immunisation programme, expanding its coverage from people at higher risk for Covid-19 to the general public.A widespread concentrated vaccination drive is in the offing, it added.“Priorities will be given to people in key sectors, including medicine and health, traffic and education, and at key workplaces, such as supermarkets, large-sized enterprises and office buildings,” a report in the Xinhua said, quoting the task force.Vaccination has been kicked off among people aged above 60 in some regions, said the task force.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-media-warns-against-using-crude-methods-to-vaccinate-citizens-101617277377862.html
01-04-2021||World||Is UK coronavirus variant already dominant in US? All you need to know||The highly transmissible coronavirus variant first detected in the United Kingdom, B.1.1.7, may already be dominant across the United States, according to a CNN report. A recent study published in the journal Cell investigated the prevalence and dynamics of the variant of concern in the United States. While the variant was first detected in the US at the end of December 2020, the study revealed that several independent introductions in the country occurred in late November 2020, with community transmission spreading it to most states within months.The researchers estimated that the proportion of cases caused by B.1.1.7 was increasing at a rate of around 7.5% per day and doubling in frequency about every week and a half, suggesting that the variant would become dominant across the US states by March. "I think we are there," William Lee, the co-author of the study, was quoted by CNN as saying. However, he added that “it's hard to say for sure", given gaps and delays in the data.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 11,569 cases of Covid-19 caused by B.1.1.7 variant has been reported in the US as of March 30. However, the US health agency said that the cases do not represent the total number of the variant that may be circulating in the country but only such cases that have been found by analysing positive samples.The CDC has not revealed whether the variant is dominant across the United States but an early study by its own scientists had predicted that this would be the case by March. “The modeled trajectory of this variant in the US exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March,” the study published in January said.Citing the “most recent data”, CDC Director Dr Rochelle Walensky on Wednesday said at a briefing that B.1.1.7 is “about 26% of circulating virus right now”. Walensky apparently cited the preliminary data of samples collected in the two weeks leading up to March 13, which is in line with the data shared on CDC’s website, and since then, nearly two doubling periods have passed. A CDC spokesperson told CNN that "national prevalence estimates are inherently delayed by a few weeks."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/is-uk-coronavirus-variant-already-dominant-in-us-all-you-need-to-know-101617275663979.html
01-04-2021||World||Pfizer says its Covid-19 vaccine remains more than 91% effective after 6 months||Pfizer Inc.’s Covid-19 vaccine remained highly effective after six months, according to new long-term results that the company said could be used to seek an expansion of its regulatory status.Follow-up data from a final-stage trial of 46,307 people showed the vaccine was 91.3% effective in preventing symptomatic cases starting one week after the second dose through as long as six months. In the US alone, the efficacy rate was 92.6%, according to a report Thursday by Pfizer and its partner BioNTech SE.At the same time, the companies provided some of the first data on how their vaccine might handle the immune-evading B.1.351 variant that arose in South Africa. Nine of 800 trial participants in that country got sick with Covid, including six infected with B.1.351. However, all were in the placebo group, suggesting the shot retains efficacy against the variant.Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s Chief Executive Officer, said in the statement that the results “position us to submit a Biologics License Application to the U.S. FDA.”The vaccine has already secured an emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration, which means it’s only in effect until the emergency ends and it can be revoked or changed at any time. Formal approval is for the long term.Pfizer shares rose 0.5% in pre-market trading while BioNTech gained as much as 1.4%. Pfizer will soon share the data with regulators around the world and submit it for publication in a scientific journal, Pfizer spokeswoman Amy Rose said in an email.The six-month result is only slightly lower than the 95% efficacy rate that was originally found for the vaccine, based on much shorter term results. The two-shot vaccine also prevented all or nearly all severe cases of the disease over six months, depending on the exact definition used.The companies said that no new serious safety concerns were identified.The data was released in a joint company statement and hasn’t been independently reviewed and published in a scientific journal. Nonetheless, it provides an early reassuring sign that the vaccine’s strong efficacy seen in the short-term results will hold up and not fade away quickly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-its-covid-19-vaccine-remains-more-than-91-effective-after-6-months-101617276217135.html
01-04-2021||World||Suspect in attack on Asian American woman in NYC arrested||A parolee convicted of killing his mother nearly two decades ago was arrested on assault and hate crime charges in an attack on an Asian American woman in New York City, police said Wednesday.Police said Brandon Elliot, 38, is the man seen on surveillance video kicking and stomping the woman near Times Square on Monday. The woman was attacked in front of an apartment building.Two lobby workers witnessed the violence but no one intervened or called 911, police said. Their union said Wednesday they told a union representative that they waited until the attacker left because he had a knife and then flagged down a police car.Elliot, who is Black, faces charges of assault and attempted assault as hate crimes. He made an appearance in court via video Wednesday night, and was remanded into custody, with the next court date scheduled for Monday.Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. said Elliot faces up to 25 years in prison if convicted.The Legal Aid Society, which is representing him, said in a statement, “We strongly urge the public to reserve judgment until all the facts are presented in court."Elliot lived at a hotel that serves as a homeless shelter a few blocks from the attack scene, police said. He was taken into custody at the hotel around midnight. Tips from the public led to his apprehension, police said.Elliot was convicted of stabbing his mother to death in the Bronx in 2002, when he was 19. He was released from prison in 2019 and is on lifetime parole. The parole board had previously twice denied his release. His record also included an arrest for robbery in 2000.“For the life of me, I don’t understand why we are releasing or pushing people out of prison — not to give them second chances, but to put them into homeless facilities or shelters, or in this case a hotel — and expect good outcomes,” Police Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a news conference Wednesday. “We need real opportunities. We need real safety nets.”A law enforcement official identified the victim as 65-year-old Vilma Kari. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and did so on condition of anonymity. Kari’s daughter told The New York Times that she emigrated from the Philippines several decades ago.Kari, who was repeatedly kicked and stomped, suffered serious injuries including a fractured pelvis, the law enforcement official said. She was discharged from the hospital on Tuesday, a hospital spokesperson said. Kari has been speaking to police, Shea said.Philippine Ambassador to the U.S. Jose Manuel Romualdez said the victim is Filipina American.The country’s foreign secretary, Teodoro Locsin Jr., condemned the attack, writing on Twitter: “This is gravely noted and will influence Philippine foreign policy.” He didn’t elaborate how.The Philippines and United States are longtime treaty allies, but Philippine leader Rodrigo Duterte is a vocal critic of U.S. security policies who has moved to terminate a key agreement that allows largescale military exercises with U.S. forces in the Philippines.“I might as well say it, so no one on the other side can say, ‘We didn’t know you took racial brutality against Filipinos at all seriously.’ We do,” Locsin said.Kari was walking to church when police say Elliot kicked her in the stomach, knocked her to the ground, stomped on her face, shouted a curse and anti-Asian slurs and told her, “You don’t belong here” before casually walking away as onlookers watched. Shea called it a “completely unprovoked violent attack on an innocent, defenseless woman.”Monday’s attack, among the latest in a national spike in anti-Asian hate crimes, drew widespread condemnation and concerns about the failure of bystanders to intervene. New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio called the attack “absolutely disgusting and outrageous” and said it was “absolutely unacceptable” that witnesses didn’t help the woman.The attack happened just weeks after a mass shooting in Atlanta that left eight people dead, six of them women of Asian descent, and just a few days after a 65-year-old Asian American woman in the same midtown Manhattan neighborhood was threatened and heckled with anti-Asian slurs.The surge in violence has been linked in part to misplaced blame for the coronavirus pandemic and former President Donald Trump’s use of terms like “Chinese virus.”“This brave woman belongs here,” Vance said. “Asian American New Yorkers belong here. Everyone belongs here.”The late morning attack happened in front of a luxury apartment building in Hell’s Kitchen, west of Times Square. Two lobby workers, described by their union as doormen, were seen on video witnessing the attack but failing to help Kari. One of them was seen closing the building’s door as she was on the ground.The building’s management company said the workers were suspended pending an investigation. The workers’ union, SEIU 32BJ, initially said that they immediately called for help. A spokesperson clarified Wednesday that the workers waited until the assailant walked away to check on Kari and flag down a nearby patrol car.Residents of the building also defended the workers, saying in a letter Wednesday that a widely seen video clip focusing on the assault cut off before they could be seen giving the victim aid and alerting medics.Detective Michael Rodriguez said Wednesday that patrol officers driving by came upon the victim after she was assaulted.The Associated Press has requested the full video from the building’s management company. The company has not responded.This year in New York City, there have been 33 hate crimes with an Asian victim as of Sunday, police said. There were 11 such attacks by the same time last year. The NYPD last week said it was increasing patrols in Asian neighborhoods, including using undercover officers to prevent and disrupt attacks.Joo Han, the deputy director of the Asian American Federation, called the plainclothes patrols a “knee-jerk response” that ignored misgivings she said many people in Asian communities have about law enforcement.“That wasn’t something that was done in conversation with community leaders,” Han said. “That’s not something that we would have recommended. That’s not safe for a lot of folks who may not have status, who don’t have comfortable interactions with NYPD.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-hate-crime-suspect-in-attack-on-asian-american-woman-in-nyc-arrested-101617274486672.html
01-04-2021||World||Asian community pens letter of fear to Ohio's lieutenant governor||Dozens of Asian members of the suburb Ohio's lieutenant governor lives in penned a letter to him Wednesday, citing their concerns with his “Wuhan virus” tweet and their fears for the safety of their children."Lt. Governor Husted, your choice of words has only raised the anxiety and fear that Asians and Asian Americans in Upper Arlington are currently experiencing," the letter obtained by the local NBC affiliate read.“Our children have been targeted for bullying and abuse in the district well before the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, but that abuse has increased significantly in the last 14 months and has reached levels that have brought news media attention to our doorsteps," the letter continued. “Our children are the classmates, friends, and neighbors of your children.”The letter to the lieutenant governor was signed by nearly 70 members and families of the Asian community in Upper Arlington, a suburb of Columbus.It came in response to a March 26 tweet where Husted linked to an article in which Robert Redfield, the ex-director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said, without citing evidence, that he believed the virus originated in a lab in Wuhan.“So it appears it was the Wuhan Virus after all?” Husted tweeted Friday from his personal account.His intention with the tweet, Husted said in an interview with The Associated Press earlier on Wednesday, was to criticize the Chinese government.“I was just pointing out that this is an international crisis, in my opinion, that the Chinese government is responsible for and I wanted an independent investigation,” he said. “So I wasn’t trying to accomplish anything that the political left or political right thinks that I might have from that tweet other than to draw attention to the issue.”The claim that Covid-19 originated in a lab in Wuhan has been scrutinized in the past year by health officials, including the leading U.S. infectious disease specialist, Dr. Anthony Fauci.The claim was further muddied when a draft obtained by The AP on Monday and formally published Tuesday from the World Health Organization’s inquiry said it was “extremely unlikely” that the virus emerged accidentally from a Chinese laboratory and was likely spread from animals to humans.Some replies on the original post supported Husted for standing up to China. More numerous were critical replies from Twitter users who said such rhetoric feeds into hate and violence against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.The organization Stop AAPI Hate released a report last month that showed it received more than 3,800 reports in the U.S. of episodes ranging from shunning and verbal harassment to assault from March 2020 to Feb. 28 of this year. Many of the confrontations were linked to misconceptions around the virus.A gunman walked into three spas on March 16 in the Atlanta area, killing eight people, six of them Asian women, though police have yet to designate the shootings as a hate crime. The shock was still fresh when a man was caught on surveillance video Monday in New York City kicking an Asian American woman and stomping on her face while, police say, he shouted anti-Asian slurs.For Democratic State Sen. Tina Maharath, the first Asian American woman elected to the Ohio General Assembly, Husted's tweet was the second time that week she heard an elected official call the coronavirus that first emerged in Wuhan, China, the “Wuhan virus,” she said.Maharath said Husted and others are following the lead of former President Donald Trump, who sometimes used overtly racist terms to refer to the virus.“When you say those things, such as attach locations or ethnicities to the disease, it creates racial profiling, and then it turns into xenophobic behavior,” Maharath said. “And when leaders with that kind of power repeat those terms in confidence and double down on it, it leads to more hate crimes.”Two days before Husted's tweet, Republican Ohio Sen. Terry Johnson mentioned the “Wuhan virus” on the chamber floor.“We called it the Wuhan virus because that’s where it came from,” Johnson said. “We always called viruses by where they came from, but now we don’t even do that because of all this political correctness.”In the past century, international health experts have intentionally avoided naming diseases after the city or region of origin because of potential stigma. In 2015, the World Health Organization issued guidelines that discouraged the use of geographic locations, animals or groups of people in naming diseases.But Husted remained firm in his AP interview.“On Twitter, there were a lot of people who are from what I will call the cancel culture, who immediately assumed that there was a racial element to the tweet," Husted said, “which there wasn’t any.”His neighbors, however, believe Husted's words matter, regardless of intention, and offered an invitation to “meet personally to discuss the issues of violence and hatred towards Ohio’s Asian and Asian American citizens.”“As Lt. Governor, you are uniquely positioned to represent and protect the interests and safety of all Ohioans,” the letter stated. “As a resident of Upper Arlington, and our Lt. Governor, you are uniquely situated and have the power to take action to protect the families of our community. To protect all of our families.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asian-hate-crime-community-pens-letter-of-fear-to-ohio-s-lieutenant-governor-101617274239593.html
01-04-2021||World||Sunak says UK well placed to recover ‘strongly’ from pandemic||The UK economy is well placed to bounce back “strongly” from the pandemic, Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak said, citing a successful vaccination program and incentives to spur business investment.Revised data on Wednesday showed the U.K. economy shrank 9.8% in 2020, the most since the Great Frost of 1709. And while the economy is also forecast to shrink this quarter, the Bank of England sees it surging 14% in the year through the first quarter of 2022, an unprecedented pace in modern history.“I am confident that we’re in a good position to recover strongly,” Sunak said in an ITV interview due to be aired later on Wednesday, according to a transcript. “Businesses have about a hundred billion pounds ($138 billion) of excess cash that they’re sitting on,” and are “raring to go” as the country’s third coronavirus lockdown eases, he said.The U.K. has suffered one of the worst economic hits of any developed nation due to the pandemic, as well as one of the highest death rates. But Sunak pointed to one of the swiftest vaccination programs in the world as a reason for optimism, as well as the tax incentive for investment -- known as a super-deduction -- he announced in the budget this month.The super-deduction, which comes into effect on Thursday, means firms can reduce their tax bill by as much as 25 pence for every pound they invest in capital. The government estimates it will unlock 20 billion pounds of investment a year for the two years it’s in place.“What we’re seeing already is a lot of businesses responding to the super-deduction, accelerating capital plans,” Sunak said. “That’s what we want as we exit this pandemic and the economy reopens.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sunak-says-uk-well-placed-to-recover-strongly-from-pandemic-101617273784686.html
01-04-2021||World||Donald Trump-touted Hydroxychloroquine lives on as Covid therapy despite trial flops||Hydroxychloroquine, the antimalarial drug that former President Donald Trump touted as a “game changer” in the fight against Covid-19, is still being prescribed by physicians in the US though it has proven to be ineffective against the virus in clinical trials.Concern is growing that patients are at risk of harm because physicians continue to prescribe hydroxychloroquine over other potentially life-saving Covid treatments. In June, the Food and Drug Administration revoked the emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine “in light of ongoing serious cardiac adverse events and other serious side effects.” The potential benefits of the drug no longer outweigh the known and potential risks for the authorized use, the agency said in a statement.“I would say if it’s not malpractice then it’s certainly close,” said William Haseltine, a former Harvard Medical School professor and a pioneering HIV researcher who now chairs Access Health International, a health equity think tank. “It’s unfortunate. The patients that are receiving [hydroxychloroquine] are not receiving benefit. It’s not particularly toxic, although it is toxic in some cases for people with heart problems -- so it could harm those people.”Patients across the country are still seeking the drug and some doctors prescribe it off-label, meaning for unapproved purposes. Some physicians are convinced that hydroxychloroquine, in combination with other drugs, could help prevent mild Covid symptoms from worsening. From their perspective, it has been on the market for decades and has been used off-label in various ways by respected members of their field.While off-label prescribing is common and legal, trial after clinical trial has shown that treatment of Covid-19 with hydroxychloroquine shows no clinical benefit -- at any stage of the disease. The FDA declined to comment.Still PrescribingGeorge Smith, a family doctor who runs a solo practice in Covington, Georgia, said he has prescribed hydroxychloroquine to about 160 Covid-19 patients since the virus hit his community in March 2020. Many came to him because their own physicians wouldn’t treat them with the drug.He resigned from a job as a nursing home physician after the medical director refused to allow him to treat patients with hydroxychloroquine.“There have been so many people who have died from Covid needlessly because of government obstruction -- it’s a crime, it’s such a shame,” Smith said in a phone interview. “I look at it this way: I swore the Hippocratic oath when I finished medical school to treat my patients the best way I know how -- and so that’s what I’ve done. If they come and take my license, then they come and take my license. But I’m not going to let somebody die over some stupid government regulation.”The FDA authorized the emergency use of hydroxychloroquine in March 2020. A week later Trump endorsed the drug as a potential Covid-19 treatment and the government stockpiled millions of doses. After Trump promoted the drug in March, monthly prescriptions jumped 93% to 890,000.While demand for the drug has tailed off since then, it is still significantly higher than at the start of the pandemic -- in February 2021, there were 560,000 hydroxychloroquine prescriptions written, 22% higher than a year earlier. It’s difficult to predict how many of these were off-label, though researchers estimate that off-label versions make up between 12% and 38% of all prescriptions in the U.S, according to a recent report by the Congressional Research Service.The rush in 2020 led to shortages of the drug for patients with lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and other autoimmune diseases, for which hydroxychloroquine has proven to be an effective treatment. As a result, 18 states issued emergency restrictions that prohibited prescribing and dispensing of the drug for Covid-19 use. Other states didn’t go as far but most released guidance discouraging inappropriate prescriptions.As of March 2021, restrictions remain in place in only six of the 18 states. Mike Donnelly, a spokesperson for the Lupus Foundation of America, says the non-profit group has not heard of patients experiencing difficulties accessing hydroxychloroquine since last year. In March a World Health Organization panel warned that hydroxychloroquine should not be used to prevent infection with Covid-19.Patient RequestsA conservative non-profit group says patients still want the drug. The Association of American Physicians and Surgeons compiles a list of doctors who are willing to prescribe hydroxychloroquine. Jane Orient, the group’s executive director, says many patients use telehealth to get a doctor, and they can get their prescriptions filled at an out-of-state pharmacy if they don’t have a local pharmacist who wants to do so.“In our newsletter each month we ask our members to list themselves if they are willing to accept new patients for this purpose. Many physicians don’t want to be public about this because there are some concerns about complaints going to the medical board, which are, at best, a very stressful and expensive time-consuming hassle,” Orient said.The AAPS, which is also known for opposing federal vaccine mandates, filed a lawsuit against the government in June 2020 citing the “irrational interference by the FDA with timely access to hydroxychloroquine.” The group wants an injunction against the FDA’s decision in March 2020, which prohibits the use of the donated hydroxychloroquine except for already hospitalized patients.They’ve also created a 26-page, home-based Covid treatment guide for patients, which advises taking a combination of anti-viral medicines at the onset of symptoms.Peter McCullough, a professor of medicine at Texas A&M University’s College of Medicine and an AAPS member, considers himself a firm believer in using hydroxychloroquine in combination with other drugs to treat Covid patients. “The biggest mistake in people reporting and even in the scientific investigations is to try to declare or not declare whether hydroxychloroquine works -- that’s a fool’s errand because we use drugs in combination,” he said.He said he’s prescribed a multiple-drug regimen that includes hydroxychloroquine for about 100 high-risk Covid patients and advised “hundreds more” doctors who then went on to treat thousands more patients, he said.A few other drugs that have shown greater effectiveness against Covid-19 have since gained authorization, including Gilead Sciences Inc.’s remdesivir and the antibody cocktail from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that Trump touted after he was diagnosed with the disease. Ridgeback Biotherapeutics and Merck & Co. have partnered to develop an oral antiviral treatment, molnupiravir, and are encouraged by the findings so far.Myron Cohen, associate vice chancellor for global health and medical affairs at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine at Chapel Hill, says this illustrates a broader medical issue that is not unique to Covid-19 -- it’s hard to move people away from their own anecdotal evidence.“Hydroxychloroquine was just filling a vacuum,” Cohen said. “In the long run, health providers are going to accede to drugs that have been proven to work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-touted-hydroxychloroquine-lives-on-as-covid-therapy-despite-trial-flops-101617271657045.html

The West has demanded his release.The local prison service in Vladimir region where the IK-2 facility holding him is located told Reuters that the prison measures Navalny was subjected to were strictly legal and were the same as those used against other inmates."Correction facility officers strictly respect the right of all inmates to eight hours of uninterrupted sleep," it said late on Wednesday, adding that guards were required to patrol and visually check on inmates at night."These measures do not interfere with convicts resting," it added."...Navalny is being provided with all necessary medical care in accordance with his current medical conditions," it said.In a handwritten letter addressed to the governor of his prison which was posted to social media by his team on Wednesday, Navalny said daily requests for a doctor of his choice to examine him and for proper medicine had been ignored.Alexei Barinov, a doctor, told Reuters that Navalny's lawyers had asked him to treat Navalny and that they had requested the prison service either allow him into the prison or to let Navalny out to a clinic."We're waiting for a decision from the FSIN (prison service)," he said, adding that he was ready to go.Medical professionals on Sunday published an open letter demanding the 44-year-old politician get proper care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-prison-service-defends-treatment-of-hunger-striking-kremlin-critic-navalny-101617269671251.html
01-04-2021||World||South Korea mulls rapid coronavirus tests for home use||South Korea is reviewing whether to approve rapid coronavirus tests that can be taken at home and produce near-immediate results as another tool to fight the pandemic.Kwon Jun-wook, director of South Korea’s National Health Institute, said Thursday there’s a need to provide convenient and accessible tests that people can use regularly because the virus is often transmitted by people with no or mild symptoms.Health authorities had previously been reluctant to expand the use of rapid antigen tests and other forms of fast testing, which could produce results within 30 minutes but are less accurate than standard laboratory tests.However, Kwon said the country may need more tools as it has struggles to slow the spread of the virus following a devastating winter surge, with around 300 to 500 new cases still being reported every day.He said that real-time PCR tests, which involve health professionals administrating nasal and throat swabs and lab machines genetically analyzing the samples, would remain the country’s gold standard even if officials approve rapid tests for public use.South Korean officials also said Thursday that the country will issue a smartphone app this month that verifies a person has been vaccinated. While Prime Minister Chung Se-kyun raised the possibility that the app could be used as a vaccine passport, Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency officials said countries would first have to agree on an international standard for screening travelers for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-mulls-rapid-coronavirus-tests-for-home-use-101617267055878.html
01-04-2021||World||New portable test to diagnose Covid-19 quickly, track variants as well||Scientists have developed a new portable, pocket-sized test that can not only diagnose Covid-19 in minutes but also sequence the coronavirus to track the spread of mutations and variants.The test, dubbed NIRVANA, can simultaneously test for other viruses such as influenza that might be mistaken for the coronavirus, the researchers said."This is a virus detection and surveillance method that doesn't require an expensive infrastructure like other approaches," said Juan Carlos Izpisua Belmonte, a professor at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in the US."We can accomplish with one portable test the same thing that others are using two or three different tests, with different machines, to do," Belmonte said.The researchers noted that testing the population is key to stopping the spread of the virus.Also, tracking the spread of new SARS-CoV-2 variants -- some of which could respond differently to treatments or vaccines -- is critical, they said.The current standard approach to determine whether a nasal swab is positive for Covid-19 is to run a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test to detect genetic material from the SARS-CoV-2 virus.However, if the sample is negative, patients and clinicians don't get any information on what might be causing the coronavirus-like symptoms -- unless they run separate PCR tests, using different swab samples, for other viruses.Even if the sample is positive for SARS-CoV-2, they don't learn which Covid-19 variant a patient is infected with unless another set of tests is run, which require a large and expensive next-generation gene-sequencing machine.Mo Li, an assistant professor at King Abdullah University of Science and Technology in Saudi Arabia, wondered whether a gene-detection approach called isothermal recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) coupled with real-time nanopore sequencing might be more useful than the current Covid-19 testing approach.Unlike PCR, which cycles through lower and higher temperatures to separate DNA strands and copy them, RPA uses proteins -- rather than temperature changes -- to accomplish the same thing in only 20 minutes.The technology lets researchers copy longer stretches of DNA, and probe for multiple genes at the same time."We quickly realised that we could use this technique to not only detect SARS-CoV-2, but other viruses at the same time," said Li.The study, published in the journal Med, describes a small, portable device that can screen 96 samples at the same time using the RPA assay.The scientists designed NIRVANA to simultaneously test samples for Covid-19, influenza A, human adenovirus, and non-SARS-CoV-2 human coronavirus.The researchers noted that in just 15 minutes the device begins to report positive and negative results.Within three hours, the device finalises results on all 96 samples -- including the sequences of five regions of SARS-CoV-2 that are particularly prone to accumulate mutations leading to new variants such as the B.1.1.7 variant identified in the UK.The team tested NIRVANA on 10 samples known to be positive for SARS-CoV-2, 60 samples of unknown SARS-CoV-2 status, as well as samples of municipal wastewater harbouring the SARS-COV-2 virus and others.In all cases, the assay was able to correctly identify which viruses were present.The sequencing data also allowed them to narrow down the origin of SARS-CoV-2 in positive samples, differentiating strains from China and Europe for instance."The design of this assay is really flexible, so it's not just limited to the examples we've shown," said Li."We can easily adapt it to tackle another pathogen, even something new and emergent," he said.With the small size and portability of the NIRVANA workflow, it could be used for fast virus detection at schools, airports or ports, the researchers said.It also could be used to monitor wastewater or streams for the presence of new viruses, they said."The pandemic has provided two important lessons: first, test widely and quickly, and second, know your variants. Our NIRVANA method provides a promising solution to these two challenges not only for the current pandemic but also for possible future ones," said Belmonte.Market analysis would be required to determine whether the initial cost of commercialisation -- and the constant tweaks to the test needed to make sure it detected new variants or new viruses of interest -- are worth it, Belmonte added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-portable-test-to-diagnose-covid-19-quickly-track-variants-as-well-101617269358549.html

Since he did not have vinegar, his preferred treatment for sea animal stings, he poured cola over the affected area, which worked well to stop the stinging.The footage Karlson posted with the comment: "The angriest octopus in Geographe Bay!" was widely shared, but he said he felt apprehension but no animosity toward the animal."This was clearly the octopus's domain," he said."I am worried that people will view octopuses in a different light. They are amazing creatures that clearly have some strong emotions (just like us)!"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angriest-octopus-lashes-out-at-man-on-australia-beach-101617269220842.html
01-04-2021||World||'Familial terrorism': How personal ties link suicide bombings in Southeast Asia||As the rain teemed down and guests feasted on chicken curry, Muhammad Lukman married his burqa-clad bride in a late night ceremony at the home of Rizaldi, the head of their Islamic prayer group, on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi.Guests who attended the August wedding said the ceremony was held at 10 pm, deemed auspicious.This week, on Palm Sunday morning, the newlyweds strapped pressure cooker nail bombs to their chests and detonated them as they drove into the Sacred Heart of Jesus Cathedral in the provincial capital of Makassar.Their deaths followed the killing of their wedding host in January, shot by counter-terrorism forces.The millennial, newlywed bombers were the only fatalities in the cathedral attack, but the incident offers a view into the Islamic State's dangerous legacy in Southeast Asia, and the personal and family ties that bind religious extremists across the region.In Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation, pro-ISIS groups remain a threat two years after the ultra-radicals were defeated in Syria and Iraq, analysts say.The Makassar church bombing was the third such attack perpetrated by husband and wife suicide bombers from Indonesia in recent years.In May 2018, an Indonesian family of six, a husband and wife and their four children, detonated explosives at several churches in the Javanese city of Surabaya, part of a series of attacks that killed 28 people.Less than a year later, Ulfa Handayani Saleh and her husband Rullie Rian Zeke, both Indonesians, bombed a cathedral in Jolo, in the southern Philippines, killing 23 and injuring more than 100.Ulfa was the sister of Rizaldi, whose home was where the Makassar bombers were married."This is the unique legacy of ISIS promoting the rise of familial terrorism," said Noor Huda Ismail, a visiting fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies, "A number of Indonesians joined ISIS as family members."More than 1,100 Indonesians left the country to join ISIS, sometimes as whole families, including toddlers and infants, said Sidney Jones, director of the Jakarta-based Institute for Policy Analysis of Conflict (IPAC).In part, they were influenced by effective ISIS propaganda that idealised the concept of rearing children in a pure Islamic state, she said. Hundreds were deported or returned after ISIS was defeated in 2019.'DO WHAT YOU CAN'Police said the Makassar bombers were a couple who belonged to Jamaah Ansharut Daulah (JAD), an Islamic State-inspired group suspected of suicide attacks in Surabaya and elsewhere.Given the fragmented nature of JAD, Jones said it was instructive to examine the personal ties that reveal how extremists connect up across the region.The Makassar attack, said Jones, was likely part ISIS ideology fused with revenge for Rizaldi's death."What we are seeing is not only supporters of ISIS acting on their own in accordance with instructions earlier to do what you can wherever you can," she said, "But also doing it because of local drivers."Opening a kebab shop next to his house after he wed, neighbours say Lukman was quiet and religious, that his wife sold skin whitening products online, and everyone was surprised to learn they secretly harboured violent intentions."I was selling food at the market when someone said someone had blown themselves up. I said, 'So dumb. Why would anyone kill themselves? What for?' But I didn't realize it was my nephew,"Lukman's aunt, Sitti Rahma, 48, told Reuters, through tears.Police said the 26-year-old bomber left a farewell letter to his mother, in which he expressed his desire to die for his religious beliefs.On Wednesday, police shot dead a gun-wielding, 25-year-old woman who had attempted to attack the national police headquarters in Jakarta. Hours earlier she had posted a picture of the Islamic state flag on her Instagram account, police said.Seen as revenge for a string of arrests of suspected militants across the archipelago in recent days, the incident is another example of a global trend of women taking on more active militant roles.Since the Palm Sunday attack, Indonesian police have arrested at least 32 suspected extremists in Jakarta, Sulawesi, Java, and West Nusa Tenggara, raids that also uncovered more than 5 kilograms of explosives, including “Mother of Satan”, or triacetone triperoxide (TATP), a powerful but unstable mixture often used by Islamist militant groups."Despite being pushed back in the Middle East, ISIS networks in various countries are still active, including in Indonesia," said terrorism analyst Stanislaus Riyanta. "Their strength is diminished, but they have not died yet."Ismail, the analyst at the School of International Studies said: "You cannot deny the fact that there is still a virtual caliphate, which is now extremely hard to counter."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/familial-terrorism-how-personal-ties-link-suicide-bombings-in-southeast-asia-101617268230802.html
01-04-2021||World||Egypt may seek $1 billion in compensation for Suez Canal crisis||Egypt said it may seek around $1 billion in compensation after a giant container vessel blocked the Suez Canal for almost a week and roiled shipping markets.The figure is a rough estimate of losses linked to transit fees, damages incurred during the dredging and salvage efforts, the cost of the equipment, and labor, Suez Canal Authority chief executive Osama Rabie said late Wednesday to local television channel Sada Elbalad.He did not specify who the Canal Authority would seek compensation from.Also Watch: How ship which had blocked Suez Canal was finally freed; had Indian crew“This is the right of the country,” Rabie said, adding that the incident hurt Egypt’s reputation. “This country should get its due.”The 400-meter-long Ever Given ship ran aground on March 23 in the southern part of the canal and was freed on Monday.Taiwan’s Evergreen Marine Corp., the vessel’s charterer, said Thursday it’s not responsible for delays of any cargo it was transporting.The ship and its cargo, which Rabie said were worth $3.5 billion, is currently in the Great Bitter Lake, roughly halfway along the canal.Rabie said they could be held in Egypt if the matter of compensation went to court. Such a scenario is unlikely, he said, because Egypt has a long relationship with the ship owner.Evergreen’s agent in Egypt, Mohamed Bahaa, said he doubted there would be any financial dispute between his company and the canal authorities.“In 40 years now, not a single case of dispute has happened between SCA and Evergreen,” he said in an interview. “We all respect all the rules of the SCA.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-may-seek-1-billion-in-compensation-for-suez-canal-crisis-101617268018030.html
01-04-2021||World||Joe Biden signals continued Beijing tension over industrial policy||The Biden administration raised concern about some of the policy tools China is using to spur its economy, saying they crowd out international companies and will skew markets.“Made in China 2025,” a key 10-year plan released in 2015 and laying out Beijing’s industrial-policy aspirations, includes a wide array of state intervention and support that restricts and discriminates against foreign enterprises, the U.S. Trade Representative said in its 2021 estimate report on foreign-trade barriers released Wednesday.The administration’s views are consistent with those of the Trump and Obama presidencies.“Even if China fails to fully achieve the industrial policy goals set forth in Made in China 2025, it is still likely to create or exacerbate market distortions and create severe excess capacity in many of the targeted sectors,” the USTR said. “It is also likely to do long-lasting damage to U.S. interests, as China-backed companies increase their market share at the expense of U.S. companies operating in these sectors.”Beijing hit back at the report on Thursday, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying: the “U.S. side’s accusations on China’s industrial policies are groundless.”“Our policies follow market principles, with proper guidance by the government,” she added. “The policies apply to all companies in China, equally to Chinese and foreign companies.”The U.S. and China were embroiled in a trade war under President Donald Trump that continues to see tariffs applied on about $335 billion of Chinese goods annually. In the so-called phase one agreement last year, China promised to purchase more American products. Beijing missed its 2020 trade-deal targets as the global pandemic upended shipping and supply chains.At her confirmation hearing last month, Trade Representative Katherine Tai called on China to live up to the commitments in its trade pact with the U.S. She acknowledged that former officials have tried before to achieve structural changes in China’s economy and faced obstacles, saying the Biden administration needs to be “exploring all our options.”If China’s economy maintains its current growth trajectory, it will surpass the U.S. this decade to become the world’s largest.Beijing continues to provide substantial subsidies to its domestic industries, which have caused injury to U.S. industries, the USTR said. The U.S. is working with the European Union and Japan to identify further effective action and potential rules that could address problematic subsidies practices not currently covered by existing obligations, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-signals-continued-beijing-tension-over-industrial-policy-101617266905512.html

The military has long rejected the idea of a federal system, seeing itself as the central power vital to holding the fractious country together.Social media posts showed copies of the constitution, real and symbolic, being burned at rallies and in homes during what one activist called a "constitution bonfire ceremony"."The new day begin here!" Dr Sasa, the international envoy for the ousted parliamentarians said on Twitter, referring to what for now is a largely symbolic move.SOUTHEAST ASIAN MINISTER IN CHINAThe UN special envoy on Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgene, told the 15-member UN Security Council that the military was not capable of managing the country, and warned the situation on the ground would worsen.The council must consider "potentially significant action" to reverse the course of events as "a bloodbath is imminent", she said.The council has expressed concern and condemned violence against protesters, but dropped language calling the takeover a coup and threatening possible further action due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.At least 536 civilians have been killed in protests, 141 of them on Saturday, the bloodiest day of the unrest, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).The United States on Wednesday urged China, which has significant economic and strategic interests in Myanmar, to use its influence to hold to account those responsible for the coup.While Western countries have condemned the coup, China has been more cautious and the government's top diplomat Wang Yi called for stability during a meeting with his Singaporean counterpart on Wednesday.Wang said China welcomed and supported a long-standing principle of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) of not interfering in each other's internal affairs, even though there have been signs in recent weeks that adherence to the principle is wearing thin.Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines have all spoken out about the situation in Myanmar and Thailand issued its strongest comments on Thursday, saying it was "gravely troubled" by the violence and calling for an end to it and the release of detainees.In a sign of stepped-up shuttle diplomacy, the foreign ministers of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines are due to meet Wang in China this weekThe Myanmar military has traditionally been impervious to external pressure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-burn-military-s-constitution-as-un-envoy-warns-of-bloodbath-101617266905622.html

He acknowledged there are "moral complexities" around introducing such rules.The leader of the Liberal Democrats Ed Davey this week branded the use of Covid-19 passports within the United Kingdom as "illiberal" and "unworkable" and the plans are opposed by some lawmakers in Johnson's party.Britain has recorded 4.3 million cases of Covid-19 and a total death toll of more than 126,00 people, one of the highest rates in the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-opposition-leader-says-british-instinct-likely-to-oppose-covid-passports-101617262240587.html

"He wants to get his side out there."The insider said that the mention of Kate is his priority for wanting to speak out, as he's reportedly felt "very protective" over his wife since Meghan claimed Kate made her cry around the time of her wedding to Harry.As reported by Fox News, the royal would like to "clear the racial allegations," said the source.William previously responded to the claims made by his brother and sister-in-law in a public statement deemed "unusual" by royal expert Katie Nicholl.When confronted by reporters shortly after the interview aired, William said that the royals are "very much not a racist family."He added that, at the time, he had not yet spoken to Harry about the contents of the interview. Gayle King recently reported that the brothers have since spoken, but conversations were "not productive."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-william-struggling-not-to-share-his-story-meghan-interview-report-101617260016368.html

Every convict has the right (by law) to invite a specialist to examine and consult him. Even I have such a right and I'm innocent," Navalny wrote in the letter."I demand that a doctor be allowed to see me, and until this happens, I am declaring a hunger strike."Prison authorities, after examining Navalny last week, declared his condition to be stable and satisfactory. The Kremlin has declined to comment on his health, saying it is a matter for the federal penitentiary service.On Wednesday, the penitentiary service said Navalny was receiving all necessary treatment."The convict A. Navalny is provided with all the necessary medical aid in accordance with his current medical conditions," Interfax news agency cited the federal penitentiary service of the Vladimir region as saying in a statement.It also said that regular checks of prisoners during the night were carried out in line with the law and "do not hinder the rest of the convicts".POSSIBLE 'SEVERE CONSEQUENCES'Medical professionals on Sunday published an open letter demanding the 44-year-old politician get proper care."We fear for the worst. Leaving a patient in this condition ... may lead to severe consequences, including an irreversible, full or partial loss of lower limb functions," the letter said.Navalny has said that what started out as acute back pain spread to his right leg and then to his left leg. The only medicine he has received has been Ibuprofen tablets and cream, he has said. Some members of a local prisoner monitoring group have accused him of faking his condition."I don't want to lose both legs," Navalny wrote in the same letter. "It would not be fair. Everyone has two legs and I wouldn't have any."Navalny was jailed last month for two and a half years for parole violations that he called politically motivated. He was arrested as he returned to Russia from Germany in January, where he had been recovering from what doctors said was a nerve agent poisoning.The West, including the European Court of Human Rights, has demanded Russia release Navalny. Moscow, which has cast doubt over his poisoning, has called such appeals unacceptable interference in its internal affairs.Asked about the hunger strike, U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States continued to call on Russia to end Navalny's "politically motivated" detention.The Kremlin has cast Navalny as a Western-backed troublemaker on a mission to destabilise Russia with Putin's spokesman linking him to the CIA, something Navalny has denied.Navalny's allies have announced plans to stage what they hope will be the biggest anti-Kremlin street protest in modern Russian history this spring. The authorities have said such protests are illegal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-kremlin-critic-navalny-launches-hunger-strike-in-bid-for-medical-care-101617258710793.html

CBP said the girls remain in the agency's custody."I'm appalled by the way these smugglers viciously dropped innocent children from a 14-foot border barrier last night," chief patrol agent Gloria Chavez said in a statement.Chavez said US agents are working with Mexican authorities to identify those responsible."If not for the vigilance of our agents using mobile technology, these two tender-aged siblings would have been exposed to the harsh elements of desert environment for hours," Chavez said.The United States is facing an increase of migrant arrivals at the country's southern border, mostly Central Americans who say they are fleeing poverty and violence in their own countries.Recently, there has been an average of 500 unaccompanied children crossing each day.President Joe Biden's administration is facing growing pressure to confront the situation and criticisms about how the unaccompanied minors have been cared for while under US government custody.According to official statistics, the Department of Health and Human Services had 12,918 migrant children in their care as of Tuesday, while CBP was responsible for the care of another 5,285.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-girls-3-and-5-dropped-over-14-foot-high-us-mexico-border-wall-101617257227422.html

01-04-2021||World||Biden lets Trump era H-1B visa bans expire; Indian IT professionals to benefit||US President Joe Biden on Thursday let the ban on foreign workers visa, in particular H-1B, lapse as the notification issued by his predecessor Donald Trump expired, a move which is likely to benefit thousands of Indian IT professionals.Amidst a national lockdown and the Covid-19 crisis, Trump in June last year issued a proclamation that suspended entry to the US of applicants for several temporary or “non-immigrant” visa categories, including H-1B, arguing that these visas presented a risk to the US labour market during the economic recovery.On December 31, Trump extended the order to March 31, 2021, noting that an extension was warranted as the pandemic continued to disrupt American’s lives, and high levels of unemployment and job loss were still presenting serious economic challenges to workers across the US.Biden did not issue a fresh proclamation for the ban on H-1B visas to continue after March 31.He had promised to lift the suspension on H-1B visas, saying Trump’s immigration policies were cruel.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to employ foreign workers in specialty occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Technology companies depend on it to hire tens of thousands of employees each year from countries like India and China.The expiry of the Trump’s proclamation would now result in the issuing of H-1B visas by American diplomatic missions overseas that would result in US companies bringing in talented technology professionals inside the country.No new proclamation was issued by Biden till Wednesday mid-night, resulting in the automatic end to the ban on issuing of fresh H-1B visas.The Wall Street Journal reported that the White House will not renew a ban on H-1B and other work-based visas imposed last year in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that is set to expire on Wednesday.Meanwhile, a Republican Senator from Missouri on Wednesday urged Biden to issue a fresh proclamation to continue with the H-1B visa ban.“I write today to urge you to extend the freeze on temporary foreign worker entries into the United States that, without intervention, will expire today,” Senator Josh Hawley wrote in a letter to Biden.“The presidential proclamation suspending entry of certain temporary workers into the US has protected Americans suffering from the pandemic-induced economic crisis. With millions of struggling Americans out of work – and millions more desperate to make ends meet – now is not the time to open the floodgates to thousands of foreign workers competing with American workers for scarce jobs and resources,” he wrote.In his letter, Hawley wrote that the unemployment rate remains at 6.2 per cent – with nearly 10 million Americans out of work and looking for a job. The pandemic has been especially devastating for low-income and working class Americans, many of whom have borne the brunt of the crisis – and stand to lose the most from misguided policy decisions, he said.In periods of high unemployment, it makes no sense to allow a struggling labour market to be flooded with a wave of foreign competition, he said.“What makes even less sense is to willingly introduce further competition for the US workers at the same time that a disastrous illegal immigration crisis grows on our southern border. As at the border, failure to take meaningful action is, in itself, a policy decision with detrimental impacts for American workers.“I urge you to extend the temporary foreign worker entry suspension until the national unemployment rate has meaningfully declined, and until your administration has conducted a thorough review of non-immigrant visa programmes to ensure that American workers are fully and effectively protected from harm,” Hawley added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-lets-trump-era-h-1b-visa-bans-expire-indian-it-professionals-to-benefit-101617251675581.html

None of the attendees were from minority religions."As our faith leaders, you have been housing the homeless. You have been feeding the hungry," she said. "And over this last year in particular, it has stretched the resources that are not only financial and physical but spiritual. Yet you are unwavering."Harris urged faith leaders to encourage people to get the vaccine."As our faith-based leaders can help us to make sure that everyone, when it is their turn, gets a vaccine. And that is one of the first areas that I'd like to discuss with you," she said.Talking about the hate crimes, Harris underlined the importance of what faith leaders could do collectively and see the "moment of crisis" as an opportunity for coalition building.The vice president said she was doing work on the Northern Triangle."I know that a lot of you are working on this issue in many ways -- but to the extent that you have thoughts and experience about what we can do to address some of the root causes that cause people to flee their home"Because, as we all know, most people like being at home. They like being where they grew up. They like being in a place where they understand the culture -- it is part of their culture; they speak the language," she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-discusses-vaccination-hate-crime-with-faith-leaders-101617251681784.html

The National Football League said earlier this week it plans to play games beginning in early September at full capacity."Well, that's a decision they made. I think it's a mistake," Biden said of the Rangers filling their 40,300 seat stadium. "They should listen to Dr. [Anthony] Fauci, the scientists and the experts. But I think it's not responsible."Biden made his comments as part of an interview with US sports broadcaster ESPN which aired Wednesday night.He also emphasized the importance of wearing masks and continuing to follow safety and health restrictions to prevent the spread of the coronavirus which has killed over 550,000 Americans since the global pandemic started. Texas has seen almost 50,000 people die, which is more than Canada and Sweden combined."In terms of it being responsible [for stadiums to open at full capacity] -- you see what's happening in Europe now when they lifted the mandates. I don't know why we don't just follow the science and beat this," Biden said.The Washington Nationals said this week that five players would miss Thursday's season opener against the New York Mets because of Covid-19 protocols, including one undisclosed player who tested positive. The Nationals plan to open their stadium to 5,000 fans, at 12 percent capacity.When asked what he would tell athletes who are reluctant to get the vaccine, Biden remarked, "I'm president of the United States and I got vaccinated. I don't have an unimportant job. Would I take the vaccine if I thought it was going to hurt me? We have done incredible research on the vaccines and they have shown that they work. We have to get to the point where enough people have taken the vaccine so we diminish the possibility for (the virus) to spread."Tennis players Elina Svitolina and Aryna Sabalenka, who are in Florida this week competing in a WTA tournament, have said they are reluctant to get the vaccine because of various concerns, including how fast it was rolled out.Biden also addressed the anti-mask contingent, saying "Some people think they are being tough guys by not wearing masks, but guess what, they are just hurting themselves and other people."Biden also talked about the importance of pay equity between men and women and described First Lady Jill Biden as a die-hard Philadelphia sports fan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-sports-teams-need-to-follow-the-science-and-beat-this-pandemic-101617251341577.html
01-04-2021||World||California office building shooting kills 4, including child||A shooting at a Southern California office building on Wednesday killed four people, including a child, and injured a fifth person before police shot the suspect, police said.Shots were being fired as officers arrived at a two-story office building on Lincoln Avenue in Orange, southeast of Los Angeles, at about 5:30 pm, Lt. Jennifer Amat said.“An officer-involved shooting occurred" and the suspect was taken to a hospital, Amat said, but she didn't immediately know his condition.The shooting was on the second floor of the building, Amat said. Media reports said bodies could be seen on the building’s second-floor walkway and in a courtyard.Amat had no details about the confrontation, what may have sparked the attack or why a child may have been at the building at 202 W. Lincoln Ave. Signs outside indicated a handful of businesses were located there, including an insurance office, a financial consulting firm, a legal services business and a phone repair store.By 7 pm, the situation had been stabilized and there wasn’t any threat to the public, police said.In a tweet, Gov. Gavon Newsom called the killings “horrifying and heartbreaking.”“Our hearts are with the families impacted by this terrible tragedy tonight,” he wrote.Rep. Katie Porter, a California Democrat whose district includes the city of Orange, said on Twitter that she was “deeply saddened” by reports of the shooting. “I’m continuing to keep victims and their loved ones in my thoughts as we continue to learn more. My team and I will continue to monitor the situation closely.”A Facebook livestream, posted by a resident who lives near the office building, showed officers carrying a motionless person out and providing aid to someone else, the Orange County Register reported.The livestream also showed officers taking two handguns from someone who was lying on the ground and providing help to another person. Two other people were led away in handcuffs, the paper said.The killings were the latest mass shooting in the United States in the last two weeks. Ten people were killed in a Boulder, Colorado, supermarket last week and eight people were fatally shot – including six Asian women – in three Atlanta-area spas the week before that.Amat said the shooting was the worst in the city since December 1997, when a gunman armed with an assault rifle attacked a California Department of Transportation maintenance yard. Arturo Reyes Torres, 41, an equipment operator who had been fired six weeks earlier, killed four people and wounded others, including a police officer, before police killed him.The city of Orange is about 30 miles (48.28 kilometers) southeast of Los Angeles and home to about 140,000 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-in-orange-california-report-shooting-with-multiple-victims-fatalities-101617248859378.html
01-04-2021||World||'Myanmar faces possibility of major civil war': UN envoy||The UN special envoy for Myanmar has warned that the country faces the possibility of civil war "at an unprecedented scale" and urged the UN Security Council to consider "potentially significant action" to reverse the February 1 military coup and restore democracy.Christine Schraner Burgener didn't specify what action she considered significant, but she painted a dire picture of the military crackdown in her virtual briefing to the council obtained by The Associated Press in which she also warned that the country "is on the verge of spiralling into a failed state"."This could happen under our watch," she said on Wednesday, "and failure to prevent further escalation of atrocities will cost the world so much more in the longer term than investing now in prevention, especially by Myanmar's neighbours and the wider region".Schraner Burgener urged the council "to consider all available tools to take collective action" and do what the people of Myanmar deserve -- "prevent a multidimensional catastrophe in the heart of Asia".The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions.As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi's rise to power after 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country.In the virtual meeting, which was closed to outsiders, Schraner Burgener denounced the killing and arrest of unarmed protesters seeking to restore democracy. She cited figures from Myanmar's Assistance Association for Political Prisoners that as of Wednesday, some 2,729 people have been arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup and an estimated 536 have been killed.The Security Council adopted a presidential statement -- one step below a resolution -- on March 10 calling for a reversal of the coup, strongly condemning the violence against peaceful protesters and calling for "utmost restraint" by the military. It stressed the need to uphold "democratic institutions and processes" and called for the immediate release of detained government leaders, including Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.The statement is weaker than the initial draft circulated by the United Kingdom, which would have condemned the coup and threatened "possible measures under the UN Charter" -- UN language for sanctions -- "should the situation deteriorate further".Schraner Burgener told council members she fears that serious international crimes and violations of international law by the military "will become bloodier as the commander-in-chief seems determined to solidify his unlawful grip on power by force"."Mediation requires dialogue but Myanmar's military has shut its doors to most of the world," she said. "It appears the military would only engage when it feels they are able to contain the situation through repression and terror.""If we wait only for when they are ready to talk," Schraner Burgener warned that "a bloodbath is imminent."The UN envoy called on those with access to the military, known as the Tatmadaw, to let them know the damage to Myanmar's reputation and the threat it poses not only to its citizens but to the security of neighbouring countries."A robust international response requires a unified regional position, especially with neighbouring countries leveraging their influence towards stability in Myanmar," Schraner Burgener said, adding that she plans to visit the region, hopefully next week.Schraner Burgener said intensification of fighting in Kayin State has sent thousands fleeing to neighbouring Thailand and Conflict in Kachin State with the Kachin Independence Army near the Chinese border intensified "to its highest point this year".Armed ethnic groups on Myanmar's eastern and western borders are also increasingly speaking out against "the brutality of the military", she said.The opposition of ethnic armed groups to "the military's cruelty ... (is) increasing the possibility of civil war at an unprecedented scale", Schraner Burgener warned."Already vulnerable groups requiring humanitarian assistance including ethnic minorities and the Rohingya people will suffer most," she said, "but inevitably, the whole country is on the verge of spiralling into a failed state".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-faces-possibility-of-major-civil-war-un-envoy-101617243321165.html

The military has also accused her of bribery in two recent news conferences.Her lawyers say the charges were trumped up and dismissed the accusation of bribery as a joke.Suu Kyi was arrested on February 1, when Myanmar's military seized power. The military has justified the coup by saying that a November election won by Suu Kyi's party was fraudulent. The election commission said the vote was fair.The reimposition of military rule after a decade of tentative steps towards democracy has triggered unrelenting opposition.At least 521 civilians have been killed in protests, 141 of them on Saturday, the bloodiest day of the unrest, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP).The United Nations' special envoy for Myanmar has warned that the country faces the possibility of civil war "at an unprecedented scale". Christine Schraner Burgener urged the UN Security Council to consider "potentially significant action" to reverse the February 1 military coup and restore democracy."Failure to prevent further escalation of atrocities will cost the world so much more in the longer term than investing now in prevention, especially by Myanmar's neighbours and the wider region," she said at a virtual briefing, according to news agency The Associated Press.For five decades, Myanmar languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions.As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi's rise to power after 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aung-san-suu-kyi-expected-to-appear-before-myanmar-court-today-101617243381219.html

The restrictions would not be as tight as the province-wide lockdown that was imposed in December, the sources told CBC.Some regions, including the city of Toronto, are already operating under similar rules; Ford’s move would extend them to the entire province of 14.7 million people.Ontario joins a growing number of locations, including France and Italy, that are returning to strict limits on social interactions in an effort to slow the latest surge of the virus. While more vaccines are being made to interrupt the transmission of the pathogen, not every area has equal access. Novel variants are hastening the spread, and case rates are rising in many regions.Ontario added 2,333 new cases of Covid-19 on March 30, bringing its total case count to 349,903, according to Public Health Ontario. More than 17,000 residents have been hospitalized because of the disease, and 7,366 have died from it.The province, which imposed strict measures in December including temporarily closing schools, had begun to loosen in recent weeks. But cases resumed their rise as the novel variants of the virus spread.The biggest hot spot is Toronto, the country’s financial capital. More than half of the cases reported on Wednesday were in Toronto and Peel, a suburban region just west of the city. New daily cases in the province have more than doubled since the first week of March.Canada’s slow vaccine progess is compounding the problem: less than 2% of the population is fully vaccinated, as the government has had difficulty importing enough shots and the country has little vaccine manufacturing capacity of its own. While a number of U.S. states have now made the vaccine widely available to the adult population, Toronto’s city-run clinics are still focusing on getting the vaccine to residents 70 and older, in addition to health care staff and other categories of essential workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-ontario-to-be-put-under-lockdown-for-28-days-to-tackle-covid-19-spread-101617243252062.html

01-04-2021||World||Increased organ damage after discharge from hospital with Covid-19: Study||People discharged from hospital after covid-19 appear to have increased rates of organ damage ("multiorgan dysfunction") compared with similar individuals in the general population, finds a study.The study was published in The BMJ today.The increase in risk was not confined to the elderly and was not uniform across ethnic groups, prompting the researchers to suggest that the long-term burden of covid-19-related illness on hospitals and broader healthcare systems is likely to be substantial.Although covid-19 is most well known for causing serious respiratory problems, it can affect other organs and systems within the body, including the heart, kidneys, and liver.Several unexplained symptoms that continue for more than 12 weeks after covid-19 are said to be part of a post-covid syndrome (also known as "long covid"), but the long term pattern of organ damage after infection is still unclear.To investigate this, a team of UK researchers from the Office for National Statistics, University College London and the University of Leicester set out to compare rates of organ dysfunction in individuals with covid-19 several months after discharge from hospital with a matched control group from the general population.Their findings are based on 47,780 individuals (average age 65, 55% men) in a hospital in England with covid-19 who were discharged alive by 31 August 2020.Participants were matched with controls, based on personal characteristics and medical history. Health records were then used to track rates of hospital readmission (or any admission for controls), death from any cause, and diagnoses of respiratory, cardiovascular, metabolic, kidney, and liver diseases until 30 September 2020.Over an average follow-up of 140 days, nearly a third of individuals who were discharged from hospital after acute covid-19 were readmitted (14,060 of 47,780) and more than 1 in 10 (5,875) died after discharge.These events occurred at rates of 766 readmissions and 320 deaths per 1,000 person-years, which were four and eight times greater, respectively, than those in matched controls.Rates of respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes were also significantly raised in patients with covid-19, with 539, 66, and 29 new-onset diagnoses per 1,000 person-years, respectively (equivalent to 27, three, and 1.5 times greater than in matched controls).Differences in rates of multiorgan dysfunction between patients with covid-19 and matched controls were greater for individuals aged less than 70 than for those aged 70 or older, and in ethnic minority groups compared with the white population, with the largest differences seen for respiratory disease.Differences in disease rates between men and women were generally small.This was a large, well-designed study using 10 years of historical clinical records to exactly match individuals with covid-19 to controls. However, the findings are observational, and the authors cannot rule out the possibility that rates of diagnoses, in general, might have decreased indirectly because of the pandemic, particularly in people not admitted to hospital with covid-19."Our findings suggest that the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of post-covid syndrome requires integrated rather than organ or disease-specific approaches," they write.And they say urgent research is needed "to understand the risk factors for post-covid syndrome so that treatment can be targeted better to demographically and clinically at-risk populations."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/increased-organ-damage-after-discharge-from-hospital-with-covid-19-study-101617242164389.html

"It’s a once-in-a-generation investment in America unlike anything we’ve seen or done since we built the interstate highway system and the space race decades ago. In fact, it’s the largest American jobs investment since World War II. It will create millions of jobs, good-paying jobs.”White House officials say the spending would generate those jobs as the country shifts away from fossil fuels and combats the perils of climate change. It is also an effort to compete with the technology and public investments made by China, which has the world’s second-largest economy and is fast gaining on the United States’ dominant position.“I’m convinced that if we act now, in 50 years people are going to look back and say this is the moment when America won the future,” Biden said.The Democratic president’s infrastructure projects would be financed by higher corporate taxes — a trade-off that could lead to f ierce resistance from the business community and thwart attempts to work with Republican lawmakers. Biden hopes to pass an infrastructure plan by summer, which could mean relying solely on the slim Democratic majorities in the House and the Senate.The higher corporate taxes would aim to raise the necessary piles of money over 15 years and then reduce the deficit going forward. In doing so, Biden would undo the action by Trump and congressional Republicans to lift the corporate tax rate to 28% from the 21% rate set in a 2017 overhaul.“Ninety-one Fortune 500 Companies, including Amazon, pay not a single solitary penny in income tax,” Biden said.Wednesday's announcement will be followed in coming weeks by Biden pushing a companion bill of roughly equal size for investments in child care, family tax credits and other domestic programs. That nearly $2 trillion package would be paid for by tax hikes on wealthy individuals and families.“Wall Street didn’t build this country," Biden said. "You, the great middle class, built this country. And unions built the middle class.”Biden's choice of Pittsburgh for unveiling the plan carried important economic and political resonance. He not only won Pittsburgh and its surrounding county to help secure the presidency, but he launched his campaign there in 2019. The city famed for steel mills that powered America’s industrial rise has steadily pivoted toward technology and health care, drawing in college graduates in a sign of how economies can change.The White House says the largest chunk of the proposal includes $621 billion for roads, bridges, public transit, electric vehicle charging stations and other transportation infrastructure. The spending would push the country away from internal combustion engines that the auto industry views as an increasingly antiquated technology.An additional $111 billion would go to replace lead water pipes and upgrade sewers. Broadband internet would blanket the country for $100 billion. Separately, $100 billion would upgrade the power grid to deliver clean electricity. Homes would get retrofitted, schools modernized, workers trained and hospitals renovated under the plan, which also seeks to strengthen U.S. manufacturing.The new construction could keep the economy running hot, coming on the heels of Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package. Economists already estimate it could push growth above 6% this year.To keep companies from shifting profits overseas to avoid taxation, a 21% global minimum tax would be imposed. The tax code would also be updated so that companies could not merge with a foreign business and avoid taxes by moving their headquarters to a tax haven. And among other provisions, it would increase IRS audits of corporations.Biden appealed for Republicans and the business community to join him in negotiations on the bill, but the legislative prospects for Biden's twin proposals already appear to hinge on Democrats coming up with the votes on their own through the budget reconciliation process, which requires just a simple majority in the 50-50 Senate.“I’m going to bring Republicans into the Oval Office, listen to them, what they have to say and be open to other ideas," Biden said. "We’ll have a good faith negotiation. Any Republican who wants to help get this done. But we have to get it done.”Democratic leaders embraced Biden’s plan on Wednesday. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York said it would create millions of jobs.“I look forward to working with President Biden to pass a big, bold plan that will drive America forward for decades to come,” Schumer said at an event in Buffalo.But key GOP and business leaders were already panning the package.“It seems like President Biden has an insatiable appetite to spend more money and raise people’s taxes,” Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the GOP whip, said in an interview.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell dismissed Biden’s package as nothing more than a “Trojan horse” for tax hikes.The business community favors updating U.S. infrastructure but dislikes higher tax rates. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Executive Vice President and Chief Policy Officer Neil Bradley, said in a statement that “we applaud the Biden administration for making infrastructure a top priority. However, we believe the proposal is dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure.” The Business Roundtable, a group of CEOs, would rather have infrastructure funded with user fees such as tolls.Trump, in a statement, blasted his successor’s proposal, claiming it “would be among the largest self-inflicted economic wounds in history.”Infrastructure spending usually holds the promise of juicing economic growth, but by how much remains a subject of political debate. Commutes and shipping times could be shortened, while public health would be improved and construction jobs would bolster consumer spending.Standard & Poor’s chief U.S. economist, Beth Ann Bovino, estimated last year that a $2.1 trillion boost in infrastructure spending could add as much as $5.7 trillion in income to the entire economy over a decade. Those kinds of analyses have led liberal Democrats in Congress such as Washington Rep. Pramila Jayapal to conclude Tuesday, “The economic consensus is that infrastructure pays for itself over time.”But the Biden administration is taking a more cautious approach than some Democrats might like. After $1.9 trillion in pandemic aid and $4 trillion in relief last year, the administration is trying to avoid raising the national debt to levels that would trigger higher interest rates and make it harder to repay.Biden’s efforts may also be complicated by demands from a handful of Democratic lawmakers who say they cannot support the bill unless it addresses the $10,000 cap on individuals' state and local tax deductions put in place under Trump and a Republican-led Congress.With a narrow majority in the House, they could conceivably quash any bill that doesn’t significantly lift the cap or repeal it entirely.“I can only vote for a bill that has meaningful tax impact for my constituents if it addresses the SALT cap,” tweeted Rep. Tom Malinowski, D-N.J.“We say No SALT, no deal,” said Democratic Reps. Tom Suozzi of New York and Bill Pascrell and Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey in a joint statement.___Miller and Freking reported from Washington.

01-04-2021||World||France imposes 3rd lockdown amid rising Covid-19 cases||French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday announced that a 'limited lockdown' will be imposed across the nation to curb the spread of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), according to news agency AFP. All schools will remain closed as part of this phase of restrictions, he said.Macron, who has been severely criticised for going against the European trend in January and not imposing a third lockdown in his country even as the rising cases left hospitals in hotspot cities overwhelmed, addressed the nation on Wednesday and urged people to adopt a strategy "that aims to contain the epidemic without shutting ourselves in".Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"We gained precious weeks of liberty, weeks of learning for our children, we allowed hundreds of thousands of workers to keep their head above water, without losing control of the epidemic," he argued in favour of not locking down in January.Even as he ordered in his Wednesday address that schools be shut down, travel restrictions across France be imposed and non-essential shops around the country be closed for the next four weeks, he did not ask people to avoid socialising completely and gave a go ahead to them for travel between regions during the upcoming Easter holidays."From Saturday evening and for a period of four weeks, travel will be limited everywhere in France to a radius of 10 km from home for daily outings. During curfew hours from 7pm to 6am, or for trips exceeding 10 kilometres, a certificate will be required," he said in his televised address to the nation.Underlining the importance of the coronavirus vaccine, he credited it for an emerging way out of the pandemic. "We will do everything to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate! Without rest, without holidays. Saturday and Sunday just like in the week," he said.More than 53,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 in France were announced on Wednesday, but that number covered two days as no numbers were made public on Tuesday. The country also recorded 304 new deaths, bringing its total toll to 95,667.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-imposes-3rd-lockdown-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-101617237750120.html

Pfizer and its partner BioNTech said they planned to submit the data to regulators in the US and Europe as soon as possible, seeking to amend their vaccine authorisations to include the younger age group.In the study of 2,260 adolescents, the vaccine produced antibodies against Covid-19 that exceeded the level seen in vaccinated young adults, Pfizer and BioNTech said. All 18 cases of Covid in the study were in adolescents who were administered a placebo, the companies said.EU: No risk from AZ shotExperts probing links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots have found no specific risk factors, including age, the EU’s drug regulator said. The European Medicines Agency said its safety committee is expected to issue an “updated recommendation” on the vaccine next week.WHO nod for China jabsTwo Chinese jabs are safe and effective, WHO experts said after reviewing partial data. Experts at the WHO didn’t issue any advice on how to use the jabs, saying they’ll wait until a decision was taken on granting them emergency licences. The experts said the vaccines from Sinovac and Sinopharm “lacked data” for older age groups.Covid vaccine for animalsRussia has registered the world’s first Covid vaccine for animals, saying it’s needed for disrupting mutations. Russia said the vaccine has been tested on dogs, cats, mink and foxes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-says-its-jab-is-100-effective-on-younger-teens-101617225400501.html
01-04-2021||World||Under Biden, Trump-era H-1B ban set to expire||A temporary ban on H-1B visas, enacted by former president Donald Trump, is set to expire on Wednesday if President Joe Biden does not extend it, possibly ending yet another restriction on the non-immigrant work visa programme that scores of Indians use to work and live in the United States and go on to acquire citizenship.The ban was imposed on June 22 last year as part of an expanded and extended suspension of immigrant and non-immigrant visas — starting with Green Cards in April — to protect American jobs for Americans after millions were laid off due to the economic devastation caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.Trump had on December 31, 2020, extended the June proclamation — 10052 — temporarily banning H-1B for high-skilled foreign workers, H-2B for nonagricultural workers and services, L-1 for intra-company transfers and certain J-1 for research scholars and professors, till the end of March this year.The White House did not comment on whether the Biden administration will allow the ban to end. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which runs the H-1B programme, directed questions to the state department, which had not responded till this report was filed.On February 25 this year, President Biden lifted the Trump-era ban on Green Cards, which allows immigrants to live and work permanently in America and set them on course for citizenship, saying it “does not advance the interests of the United States … To the contrary, it harms the United States, including by preventing certain family members of United States citizens and lawful permanent residents from joining their families here”. He was, however, silent on the work visa ban.The H-1B work visa programme allows American companies to hire highly skilled foreign workers to make up for local shortage, which many critics contend saying there is enough local talent available but they are sidelined by less expensive workers from abroad. More than 70% of the 85,000 visas granted annually under the programme go to Indians hired from India or from those enrolled in US colleges.Tech firms such as Facebook, Google, Apple, Microsoft and Amazon rely on foreign talent to shore up domestic workforces, as have US subsidiaries of Indian IT services giants such as Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys and Wipro.Trump changed the selection process for H-1B visa by introducing a pre-registration stage, which came into effect this year, to prioritise H-1B petitions for the most qualified. He also sought to make H-1B visas less desirable for those seeking to use the programme to get permanent residency and eventually citizenship, by rescinding work authorisation — H-4EAD— for their spouses.The Biden administration doesn’t seem to be interested in pursuing many of these restrictions, as is clear from the cancellation of some of them. The plan to rescind H-4EAD, for instance, has been dropped.Stuart Anderson of the non-partisan National Foundation for American Policy, which closely tracks immigration, said that the two H-1B regulations remaining from the Trump administration are a department of labor wage rule and the department of homeland security rule to end the H-1B lottery and replace it with a system of awarding from highest to lowest salary when applications exceed the annual limit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/under-biden-trump-era-h-1b-ban-set-to-expire-101617219743453.html
01-04-2021||World||US Dollar’s share of global currency reserves sinks to lowest since 1995||The dollar’s share of global currency reserves dropped in the fourth quarter to around 59%, the lowest in 25 years, according to International Monetary Fund data.The slide came in a quarter when a gauge of the greenback fell the most since 2010, and amid questions about how long the dollar can maintain its status as the pre-eminent reserve currency. The Chinese renminbi is transforming into a force to be reckoned with in currency markets, with more yuan changing hands than ever before in London, the world’s leading foreign-exchange center.“This is a slow burn theme, but we are of the view that we’re eventually headed into a ‘multiple reserve currency’ framework over time,” Bipan Rai, a strategist at CIBC, said via email.In the fourth quarter, the euro’s share of official foreign-exchange reserves climbed to 21.2% from 20.5%, while the yuan’s rose to almost 2.3% from 2.1%. The renminbi accounted for 1.94% in the final three months of 2019.For Marc Chandler, chief market strategist at Bannockburn Global, the drop in the dollar’s share of global reserves is temporary and was driven by its slide against most currencies in the fourth quarter. He’s focusing on data that shows dollar holdings among central banks climbed to $7 trillion, a record, noting that the percentage changes are “distorted” by short-term valuation changes.“The 59% is a statistical noise generated by a combination of valuation and material changes” in demand for the euro in the fourth quarter, he said in an email. “The dollar’s recovery in Q1 21 will reverse the valuation adjustment and will see the dollar share of reserves increase.”With its rebound this year, the dollar is heading for its best quarterly performance in a year, up by 2.8%. The greenback is still the most dominant currency used, with data from the Bank for International Settlements showing it’s on one side of 88% of all trades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-dollar-s-share-of-global-currency-reserves-sinks-to-lowest-since-1995-101617218527935.html
01-04-2021||World||US businesses welcome Joe Biden's public works plan but disdain tax hikes||US business groups say they are thrilled that President Joe Biden is proposing massive new investment to upgrade crumbling US infrastructure, but they’ll be lobbying against raising the corporate tax rate to pay for it.The US Chamber of Commerce, Business Roundtable, and other business lobbies say they strongly oppose raising the corporate income tax rate to 28% from 21% to pay for the $2.25 trillion infrastructure plan that Biden is unveiling on Wednesday. They want to see a user-fee model for raising money for improvements.“We strongly oppose the general tax increases proposed by the administration, which will slow the economic recovery and make the US less competitive globally -- the exact opposite of the goals of the infrastructure plan,” Neil Bradley, executive vice president and chief policy officer of the US Chamber, said in a statement.The chamber plans to have its member companies engage directly with lawmakers to provide real-life examples of what an increase in the corporate tax rate would mean for their firms, such as not opening a new manufacturing facility, according to a person familiar with the chamber’s plans.The White House has said it welcomes other ideas, and the Chamber will be offering the program it’s long been advocating based on the user-pays concept that helped build the Interstate Highway system, said Ed Mortimer, the Chamber’s vice president of transportation and infrastructure.That includes raising federal fuel taxes one more time and transitioning to a tax on the number of miles traveled, as well as expanding federal lending and bonding programs as a way to encourage more investment by the private sector and state and local entities, he said.The chamber will also be seeking to recalibrate how the money is spent in the bill to focus more spending on roads, bridges and transit systems and less on items such as new electric-vehicle charging stations and other assets for the future, Mortimer said.“Today is the beginning of this debate, and we look forward to working with the administration and bipartisan members of Congress to get a bill that has desperately been needed enacted into law this year,” he said.The Business Roundtable, a lobbying group for chief executives, estimates that an investment of about $1 trillion to $1.5 trillion is necessary for US physical infrastructure. The group also opposes higher corporate taxes as the way to pay for it.“Business Roundtable has long supported user-fee models, which includes business paying its share, to provide sustainable support for infrastructure investment,” President and Chief Executive Joshua Bolten said in a statement. “Policymakers should avoid creating new barriers to job creation and economic growth, particularly during the recovery.”Raising the corporate tax rate for all businesses isn’t the answer because too many companies are currently paying little to no corporate income tax, while others pay full freight, said Michael Hanson of the Retail Industry Leaders Association. Closing tax loopholes or re-instituting some form of a minimum corporate tax is a better approach, he said in a statement.Americans for Tax Reform Foundation, a conservative-allied group headed by anti-tax activist Grover Norquist, plans to speak out against the higher tax rate and activate its network of coalitions in the states to oppose it, spokesman John Kartch said.A higher corporate tax rate will immediately result in higher utility bills as companies pass on the costs and decreased wages for workers. It will also hit small businesses organized as corporations at the worst possible time coming out of the coronavirus pandemic, Kartch said.“We’re going to make this very difficult for Democrats to take this vote,” he said.A new group led by Republican operatives including Marc Short, former Vice President Mike Pence’s chief of staff, also plans a campaign of as much as $50 million to target Democratic and possibly some Republican members of Congress who support the tax increase with ads in their districts.Conservative lawmakers and lobbyists are worried that the business community opposition to the proposed tax increases, which include a 21% minimum tax on global corporate earnings, won’t be as strong as the campaign to support the 2017 Republican tax overhaul that lowered the corporate rate, according to a conservative tax lobbyist who asked not to be named discussing the situation.The response from the business community to the tax increases is likely to be uneven, as some industries would be more affected than others, the person said.For example, technology companies are more likely to oppose the 15% minimum tax on book income in Biden’s plan, the person said -- especially a company like Amazon.com Inc, that’s both a tech company with research-and-development investment and a company that owns retailers like Whole Foods Market Inc with brick-and-mortar stores.While business groups say they don’t want a higher corporate tax to pay for infrastructure investment, companies will benefit from the new contracts and spending, said Ray LaHood, a Republican and former transportation secretary under President Barack Obama who promotes infrastructure funding through the Building America’s Future coalition.“Republicans don’t want to vote for any kind of tax,” LaHood said of Biden’s plan, which he predicted will be enacted in some form by August because of the support the president has right now. “Let’s see if business will come around.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-businesses-welcome-joe-biden-s-public-works-plan-but-disdain-tax-hikes-101617217997168.html
01-04-2021||World||Covid-19: France to close schools for 3 weeks, ban domestic travel for a month as cases surge||French President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday announced a three-week nationwide school closure and a month-long domestic travel ban, as the rapid spread of the virus ramped up pressure on hospitals.In a televised address to the nation, Macron said efforts are needed as “the epidemic is accelerating.”“We’re going to close nursery, elementary and high schools for three weeks,” he said, adding that a nationwide 7 p.m.- 6 a.m. curfew will be kept in place.“If we stay united in the coming weeks ... then we will see light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.Macron said restrictions already applying in the Paris region and others parts of north and eastern France will be extended to the whole country, for at least one month. Under these restrictions, people are allowed to go outside for leisure, but within a 10-kilometer (6 miles) radius from their homes — and without gathering. Also most non-essential shops are closed down.The move is a departure from the government’s policy in recent months, which has focused on regionalized restrictions. School closures in particular had been seen as a very last resort.A debate is scheduled in parliament Thursday that will address the virus situation and the new measures.“The key factor in our decision-making remains the situation in hospitals,” government spokesman Gabriel Attal said Wednesday after Macron hosted his weekly coronavirus strategy meeting and a Cabinet meeting.After Paris hospital officials warned they would have to start refusing needy patients for lack of space, he said, “One thing is clear: France will not refuse care for any sick patients. Choosing patients is not an option.”Previous nationwide lockdowns in March and October 2020 were announced by Macron in televised speeches.The total number of Covid-19 patients in intensive care in France surged past 5,000 on Tuesday, the first time in 11 months that the figure has been that high. Macron on Wednesday said numbers of hospital ICU beds will be increased “in the coming days” from the current 7,000 to 10,000.After an overnight shift at an ICU in the northern French city of Amiens, Dr. Pauline Caillard described growing numbers of patients and mounting strain on medical staff.“It is moving very fast," she said. “I hope we do not have to make choices” between patients.The renewed surge of infections has led to growing questions about Macron's virus strategies. With presidential elections scheduled for 2022, Macron is having to weigh both political and health considerations.An overnight nationwide curfew has been in place since January, and all France's restaurants, bars, gyms, cinemas and museums have been closed since October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-france-to-close-schools-for-3-weeks-ban-domestic-travel-for-a-month-as-cases-surge-101617217373604.html

The bloc declined to comment on Tuesday and Wednesday.Iran has repeatedly rejected accusations by the West of human rights abuses. The Iranian Embassy in Brussels was not immediately available for comment, nor were other Iranian officials.About 1,500 people were killed during less than two weeks of unrest that started on Nov. 15, 2019, according to a toll provided to Reuters by three Iranian interior ministry officials at the time. The United Nations said the total was at least 304.Iran has called the toll given by sources "fake news".On March 9, UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran, Javaid Rehman, presented a report saying Tehran used lethal force during the protests and chided it for failing to conduct a proper investigation or for failing to hold anyone accountable.Nuclear dealAsked why the bloc had taken so long to process its sanctions response, one EU diplomat involved in the preparations cited the need for strong evidence against those hit with the punitive measures.The bloc has also shied away from angering Iran in the hope of safeguarding a nuclear accord Tehran signed with world powers in 2015.The three diplomats said the sanctions were not linked to efforts to revive the nuclear deal, which the United States pulled out of but now seeks to re-join. That deal made it harder for Iran to amass the fissile material needed for a nuclear bomb -- a goal it has long denied -- in return for sanctions relief.After days of protests across Iran in November 2019, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued an order to crackdown on protesters, Reuters reported in December 2019. That order, confirmed by three sources close to the supreme leader's inner circle and a fourth official, set in motion the bloodiest crackdown on protesters since the Islamic Revolution in 1979.In a statement following publication of the Reuters article, a spokesman for Iran's Supreme National Security Council described the death toll figure as "fake news," according to semi-official Tasnim news agency.The United Nations has warned about a deterioration of human rights in Iran. Its March 9 report documented Iran's high death penalty rate, executions of juveniles, the use torture to coerce confessions and the lawful marriage of girls as young as 10 years old.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/diplomats-say-eu-to-sanction-iran-militia-police-state-entities-over-2019-protests-101617216292230.html
