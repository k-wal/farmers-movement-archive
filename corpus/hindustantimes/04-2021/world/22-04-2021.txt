A 3.8% tax on investment income that funds Obamacare would be kept in place, pushing the tax rate on returns on financial assets higher than the top rate on wage and salary income, they said.Stocks slid on news about the plan, with the S&P 500 Index down as much as 0.6% after climbing 0.2% earlier. The Nasdaq Composite fell 0.4% as of 1:15 p.m. after rising as much as 0.5%. Ten-year Treasury yields erased gains.The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor. Biden campaigned on equalizing the capital gains and income tax rates for wealthy individuals, saying it’s unfair that many of them pay lower rates than middle-class workers.The White House and Treasury Department didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Biden is expected to release the proposal next week as part of the tax increases to fund social spending in the forthcoming “American Families Plan.”For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%.Democrats have said current capital gains rates largely help top earners who get their income through investments rather than in the form of wages, resulting in lower tax rates for wealthy people than those they employ. Republicans argue that current capital gains rates encourage saving and promote future economic growth.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-propose-capital-gains-tax-as-high-as-43-4-for-wealthy-individuals-101619113482392.html

Ministers say any decision on declaring a genocide is up to the courts.So far the government has imposed sanctions on some Chinese officials and introduced rules to try to prevent goods linked to the region entering the supply chain, but a majority of lawmakers want ministers to go further.Beijing denies accusations of rights abuses in Xinjiang.Lawmakers backed a motion brought by Conservative lawmaker Nusrat Ghani stating Uighurs in Xinjiang were suffering crimes against humanity and genocide, and calling on government to use international law to bring it to an end.The support for the motion is non-binding, meaning it is up to the government to decide what action, if any, to take next.Britain's minister for Asia, Nigel Adams, again set out to parliament the government's position that any decision on describing the human rights abuses in Xinjiang as genocide would have to be taken by "competent" courts.Some lawmakers fear Britain risks falling out of step with allies over China after the Biden administration endorsed a determination by its predecessor that China had committed genocide in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-parliament-declares-genocide-in-china-s-xinjiang-raises-pressure-on-johnson-101619111135369.html
22-04-2021||World||Pregnant women with Covid-19 have higher risks: Study||A multi-country study suggests pregnant women who get Covid-19 have higher risks for death, intensive-care stays, preterm birth and other complications.Pregnancy causes various changes in the body that may make women vulnerable to harm from the coronavirus. Pregnant women can gain some protection by getting vaccinated; recent evidence suggests the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines are safe to use in pregnancy.The results were published on Thursday in the Journal of the American Medical Association Pediatrics, which echo smaller studies. The research involved women in 18 countries, including the United States, Central and South America, Europe, Asia and Africa. The study involved about 700 pregnant women with Covid-19 and 1,400 without it. It was sponsored by a research fund at the University of Oxford, there the lead authors work.On Wednesday, the preliminary results of a report of 35,000 U.S. women who received either the Moderna or Pfizer shots while pregnant showed their rates of miscarriage, premature births and other complications were comparable to those observed in published reports on pregnant women before the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pregnant-women-with-covid-19-have-higher-risks-study-101619111583374.html
22-04-2021||World||US House passes bill to make Washington, D.C., the 51st state||The US House of Representatives on Thursday narrowly voted, for the second time in less than a year, to make the District of Columbia the 51st state, sending it to the Senate where it faces stiff Republican opposition.By a vote of 216-208, the Democratic-controlled House approved the initiative with no Republican support.The population of Washington, D.C., is heavily Democratic. As a state, it likely would elect two Democratic senators, potentially altering the balance of power in the Senate, which now has 50 Democrats and 50 Republicans.Democrats, who have been advocating statehood for the capital of the United States for decades, hope to take advantage of last November's election of President Joe Biden as well as control of the Senate and House to admit a new state for the first time since 1959, the year Alaska and Hawaii joined the union.Democrats argued statehood would fix a centuries-old wrong of "more than 700,000 Americans citizens who pay federal taxes, who fight and die in wars, who serve on our juries and yet have no vote in the Senate or the House of Representatives," said Democratic Representative Jan Schakowsky. "That is the definition of taxation without representation."The new state would be named "Washington, Douglass Commonwealth" after George Washington, the first US president, and Frederick Douglass, a former enslaved person who became a famous abolitionist.Republicans, accusing Democrats of a "power grab" to advance a "far-left" agenda, are expected to block the bill in the Senate, where 60 of 100 members need to agree to advance most legislation."This is about government-run healthcare, a $93 trillion Green New Deal, packing the Supreme Court, higher taxes and a bigger, less efficient form of government," said Republican Representative Nancy Mace during a spirited House debate.The House first passed this bill last June by a vote of 232-180. Republicans, who controlled the Senate then, refused to act on it.Statehood would also give Washington at least one House member. Its population of around 700,000 is more than that of the states of Wyoming and Vermont. About half of its residents are Black.Currently, Washington, D.C., has only one member of Congress - a House "delegate" who is not allowed to vote on legislation.If the city became a state it would maintain its three electoral votes, which are used in the presidential election process. States' electoral votes are based on population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-passes-bill-to-make-washington-d-c-the-51st-state-101619111114359.html
22-04-2021||World||India to join search for missing Indonesian submarine||The Indian Navy on Thursday dispatched a deep submergence rescue vessel (DSRV) to help the Indonesian Navy with its search and rescue efforts for a submarine that went missing on April 21 with a crew of 53 personnel, the navy said. The Indonesian submarine Nanggala went missing north of Bali on Wednesday morning. India is the third country after Singapore and Malaysia to join the rescue effort, with the United States, Australia and France also making offers to help. “On 21 April, an alert was received by Indian Navy through International Submarine Escape and Rescue Liaison Office (ISMERLO), regarding the missing Indonesian submarine,” the Indian Navy said in a statement. The Indonesian Navy on Thursday said that the missing German-built submarine has enough oxygen for 72 hours during a power blackout.The Indian Navy’s DSRV system can locate a submarine up to 1,000 metres underwater using its modern side-scan sonar and remotely operated vehicle. “After the submarine is successfully located, another sub module of the DSRV --- the submarine rescue vehicle (SRV) --- mates with the submarine to rescue the trapped personnel. The SRV can also be used to provide emergency supplies to the submarine,” the statement added. India is among the few countries capable of undertaking search and rescue of a disabled submarine through a DSRV. Defence minister Rajnath Singh is in touch with his Indonesian counterpart. “Spoke to the Defence Minister of Indonesia, General Prabowo Subianto over the phone and shared my pain over the news of missing submarine Nanggala and its crew members. India is extending its full support to the ongoing Indonesian rescue efforts,” Singh tweeted on Thursday. The Indian DSRV, being ferried by offshore supply vessel Sabarmati, could take almost a week to reach the location, which is 2,500 nautical miles away, people familiar with the development said. India is looking at the possibility of using its air force for speedier assistance. Singh wrote on Twitter that he has tasked the Indian Air Force to examine the feasibility of induction of the DSRV intervention system by air. “Under the framework of comprehensive strategic partnership between India and Indonesia, Indian Navy and Indonesian Navy share a strong partnership of operational cooperation. The two navies have been exercising regularly in the past and have developed synergy and interoperability which is considered important for the present mission,” the navy statement said. The Indian Navy inducted its first DSRV in 2018 and the second one the following year. The vessels were delivered under a £193-million contract awarded to JFD, a Scotland-based leading underwater capability provider, in March 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-to-join-search-for-missing-indonesian-submarine-101619103353159.html
22-04-2021||World||US weighs global Covid-19 vaccine-expansion move opposed by drugmakers||The Biden administration is weighing an appeal from progressive Democrats to accelerate global access to Covid-19 vaccines by supporting a waiver of intellectual-property protections, a move opposed by big drugmakers.Lawmakers led by senators Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren last week called on President Joe Biden to back a proposal before the World Trade Organization that seeks a broad waiver from obligations on the protection of intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights and trade secrets.The aim is to ease rules regarding the production and export of vaccines and other critical medical goods needed to combat the Covid-19 virus.The lawmakers and allies including labor unions argue that supporting the plan -- backed by South Africa, India, and more than 50 other countries -- would save lives. The Trump administration blocked the proposal, first put forward in October. Failing to act on it would put drug company profits ahead of people, advocates say.​​U.S. Trade Representative Katherine Tai has indicated that the status quo isn’t an option, without committing to change or maintain the country’s stance at the WTO.In separate virtual meetings on April 13 with drugmakers and waiver-seeking groups, she said the administration wants to increase the production and distribution of vaccines. The next day at a WTO meeting, Tai said inequality in vaccine access is totally unacceptable and that the market has failed in meeting the health needs of developing countries, calling on nations to consider whether changes to the group’s rules might be needed.The U.S. isn’t the only country that has opposed a waiver; the European Union, U.K., Japan, Switzerland, Brazil and Norway also have resisted the push. The WTO is a consensus-based organization, meaning an objection from any one member can stop action. But waiver supporters argue that U.S. leadership on the issue could help to sway other holdouts.‘Critical’ Need“The waiver is critical to be able to increase global production of vaccines and treatments as soon as possible,” said Lori Wallach, director of the Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, one of the groups lobbying for the measure.Public Citizen is pushing for the U.S. to support the waiver at a WTO General Council meeting starting May 5 and says backers have collected more than 2 million petition signatures urging Biden to take the step.Nations already have the power to issue compulsory licenses -- allowing them to make the vaccine without the patent holder’s permission, for a fee -- for homegrown manufacturing.But the proposal would let countries obtain know-how and negotiate deals to produce vaccines elsewhere without facing trade blowback from the U.S. and European Union, where most of the drugmakers are based.Business groups say the waiver plan is ineffective. They argue that few countries have the capacity to produce more vaccines even if they knew the formulas. Also, there’s limited global supply of the materials needed, and building new factories with the necessary technology to produce the vaccines could take years, they say.The move also could weaken a priority of decades of U.S. trade negotiations: strong protection for intellectual property, which drugmakers and other industries say helps maintain the U.S. technological lead.While the U.S. government contributed funding for Covid-19 vaccines and helped develop some of the foundational technology, companies had already been investing in developing the mRNA technology in Moderna Inc. and Pfizer Inc.’s vaccines for years beforehand.Of the shots administered globally so far, 39% have gone to people in 27 wealthy nations that represent 11% of the world population. Countries making up the least-wealthy 11% have gotten about 2% of inoculations, according to an analysis of data in the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.“The top priority of the United States is saving lives and ending the pandemic in the United States and around the world,” Adam Hodge, a USTR spokesman, said in response to a Bloomberg News inquiry about the U.S. position on the waiver. “Along with our investments in Covax, we are working with our global partners to explore pragmatic and effective steps to surge the production and equitable distribution of vaccines.”India has placed limits on exports of vaccines made within its borders amid a record number of infections. South Africa has said a shortage of jabs is undermining plans to vaccinate two-thirds of its population this year, and has blamed in part drugmakers who object to the waiver proposal.The pharmaceutical companies say they are working to expand global capacity already, and argue that the fastest way for the U.S. to help developing countries is by giving them the stockpile of vaccines it already has, like tens of millions of doses of the jab developed by AstraZeneca Plc, which hasn’t been approved for U.S. use.Wealthy countries “are stockpiling or blocking the shipment of vaccine doses, impeding their global distribution, and choosing to vaccinate their low-risk populations before focusing on higher-risk patients abroad,” Michelle McMurry-Heath, president of the industry group Biotechnology Innovation Organization, or BIO, said in a letter to Tai this week.After PandemicDrugmakers worry about being forced to turn over research they would use for other medicines that could be critical to their future after the pandemic ends.“You would have a couple of years where a patent isn’t enforceable, and then it is again,” Hans Sauer, BIO’s deputy general counsel, said in an interview. “But you can’t do that for trade secrets and data on biologic materials. You can’t un-disclose a trade secret.”Republican Senator Thom Tillis wrote to Tai last week urging opposition to the waiver, saying it would be “disastrous” and put China and India in a position to demand the transfer of mRNA technology from the U.S., giving industries in those nations a free boost to compete against American companies and workers.Then there’s concern about safety and the possibility that a lack of regulation for production could lead to mistakes in the process, creating chaos and undermining confidence in immunization.While it’s no panacea, a waiver “moves things in the right direction,” said James Love, director of Knowledge Ecology International, which advises the UN and governments on health issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-weighs-global-covid-19-vaccine-expansion-move-opposed-by-drugmakers-101619100562351.html
22-04-2021||World||US jobless claims fall to 547,000, another pandemic low||The number of Americans applying for unemployment aid fell last week to 547,000, the lowest point since the pandemic struck and an encouraging sign that layoffs are slowing on the strength of an improving job market.The Labor Department said Thursday that applications declined 39,000 from a revised 586,000 a week earlier. Weekly jobless claims are down sharply from a peak of 900,000 in early January. At the same time, they're still far above the roughly 230,000 level that prevailed before the viral outbreak ripped through the economy in March of last year.“With 135 million Americans having received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccination and the economy opening up more each day, the number of job opportunities will continue to rise,” said James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, a European bank.About 17.4 million people were continuing to collect unemployment benefits in the week that ended April 3, up from 16.9 million in the previous week. Most of the increase occurred in two states, California and Texas, which process their claims every other week. In California, recipients of a federal program for the long-term unemployed jumped nearly 50%, a sign that the state likely processed a backlog of claims that had been filed earlier.Still, the number of ongoing recipients has declined by about 2.3 million from early March, when the figure was 19.7 million, evidence that more people are being hired. Some long-term unemployed may have also exhausted all their benefits.The overall job market has been making steady gains. Last month, the nation's employers added 916,000 jobs, the most since August, in a sign that a sustained recovery is taking hold. The unemployment rate fell from 6.2% to 6%, well below the pandemic peak of nearly 15%.The number of available jobs has also jumped in recent weeks, leading many employers to complain that they can't find enough workers despite still-high unemployment. Several factors may be keeping some of those out of work from searching for jobs. They include fears of contracting the virus, child care needs and the fact that a federal supplemental unemployment benefit of $300 a week, on top of state aid, means that some low-income workers can receive as much or more income from jobless benefits compared with their former job's pay.The weekly data on applications for jobless aid is generally seen as a rough measure of layoffs because only people who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own are eligible. But during the pandemic, the numbers have become a less reliable barometer.States have struggled to clear backlogs of unemployment applications, and suspected fraud has clouded the actual volume of job cuts. In addition, the supplemental federal jobless payment, on top of regular state unemployment aid, might have encouraged more people to apply for benefits.For now, the economy is showing steady signs of recovering. Sales at retail stores and restaurants soared 10% in March — the biggest increase since last May. Federal stimulus checks of $1,400 have been sent to most adults. And Americans who have kept their jobs have accumulated additional savings, part of which they will likely spend now that states and cities have loosened business restrictions and the virus wanes.Economic growth is accelerating so fast that the principal concerns surrounding the economy have shifted from a high unemployment rate and anemic spending to bottlenecks in company supply chains and the difficulty some businesses say they are having in finding enough workers.Those issues, in turn, have fed concerns that the Federal Reserve’s low-interest rate policies could fuel a spike in inflation. Last month, wholesale prices jumped 4.2% compared with a year earlier, the biggest 12-month increase in nearly a decade.Still, consumer prices are, so far, rising at a more restrained pace. They increased 2.6% in March from a year earlier, mostly because of a jump in gas prices. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, core inflation rose just 1.6% in the previous 12 months.Economists expect inflation to rise steadily in the coming months because prices fell about a year ago when the pandemic first hit and the economy largely shut down. That makes comparisons to price levels a year ago look particularly large.Fed Chair Jerome Powell says he expects that higher inflation to prove temporary and that supply bottlenecks will eventually clear as shipping picks up and factories produce more parts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fall-to-547-000-another-pandemic-low-101619100781316.html
22-04-2021||World||Europe takes steps to reopen as Covid-19 vaccinations ramp up||Western Europe is beginning to loosen restrictions to contain the coronavirus, offering relief for the pandemic-weary region as vaccination programs turn the corner.Italy will ease many restrictions on Monday, Greece will follow suit in early May, and Germany is mulling privileges for people who have been immunized. Later on Thursday, French Prime Minister Jean Castex will announce the next steps for the country amid plans to lift some restrictions on travel and outdoor dining.After a slow start to inoculation programs, Western Europe is starting to see progress in protecting its people against Covid-19, which has caused more than 640,000 deaths across the continent.As supplies increase, Germany may be in a position to lift vaccination prioritization by June, a step that would open access to all adults, according to Health Minister Jens Spahn.“If it’s earlier than that, then I will be pleased but we shouldn’t raise expectations,” Spahn said in a speech to the upper house of parliament on Thursday.As the pace of contagion slows in Italy, Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s government is restoring free travel between moderate-risk regions, and people can go to more at-risk areas under certain conditions, including a pass certifying vaccination. Bars and restaurants will also be allowed to open outdoor areas, according to the new rules.In France, curbs on inter-regional travel will be lifted on May 3, four weeks after they were announced by President Emmanuel Macron. But a curfew between 7 p.m. and 6 a.m. will remain in place, a government spokesman said ahead of Castex’s address.Greece will ease its main pandemic restrictions -- including allowing outdoor dining -- in early May, ahead of the country’s opening to international travel in the middle of the month, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said on Wednesday. Tourism is one of the country’s most important industries, accounting for about a fifth of the economy and more than a quarter of jobs.To accelerate immunizations, Greece will start administering unused doses of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine to people between 30 and 39 years old.To be sure, the situation remains tense. In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel secured passage of a controversial law on Thursday, which triggers tighter restrictions in virus hot spots, including nighttime curfews and closing schools and non-essential stores.While Germany’s contagion rate has stabilized in recent days, it’s still well-above levels the government has determined to be manageable and the number of patients in intensive-care facilities continues to rise.Vaccine progress also varies widely across the continent, casting doubt over the timing of reopening in some countries, especially in the east.While the island nation of Malta has already administered 67 doses per 100 adults, Bulgaria is only at 11 doses per 100. The average for the whole EU is 31.6, with countries including Hungary, Estonia and Denmark leading the push, and Latvia and Croatia among those lagging behind.“Without a doubt, there’s light at the end of the tunnel,” Merkel said in a speech on Thursday. “And it will get lighter in the summer, but we’re still stuck in the tunnel.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-takes-steps-to-reopen-as-covid-19-vaccinations-ramp-up-101619099769329.html
22-04-2021||World||Hong Kong journalist convicted for accessing public records||A Hong Kong journalist was found guilty on Thursday of making false statements in obtaining information for an investigation into an attack on anti-government protesters, in the latest blow to press freedom in the city as authorities continue their crackdown on dissent.Choy Yuk-ling, also known as Bao Choy, was arrested in November on charges of falsely declaring why she was obtaining license plate information from a publicly accessible database. She was attempting to track down the perpetrators of a violent attack by a mob of white-clad men on protesters in a subway station in 2019 for an investigative documentary for public broadcaster RTHK.Principal Magistrate Ivy Chui said the Road Traffic Ordinance only allows the public to obtain vehicle ownership records for transport or traffic-related matters, legal matters, or for vehicle purchases.She said Choy declared in her online application that she would use the information for “other traffic and transport related issues.” The application does not provide an option for journalistic research.Choy, a freelancer affiliated with RTHK, pleaded not guilty. She was convicted on two counts of making false statements and fined 6,000 Hong Kong dollars ($775).The documentary Choy was working on, titled “7.21 Who Owns the Truth,” also explored the behavior of Hong Kong police during last year’s anti-government protests. Police were accused of not intervening during the attack in the subway station in Yuen Long, a town in Hong Kong's New Territories.“Today is a very dark day for all journalists in Hong Kong,” Choy said after the verdict. “Today is not just a verdict or ruling on me personally but a ruling on journalism in Hong Kong and a ruling on all journalists in Hong Kong.”She described the outcome as “heartbreaking” and wiped away tears as she addressed reporters and her supporters.“The ruling of the court today is very harsh,” she said. “They interpreted the search of public data in the most narrow perspective which has restricted the free flow of information in Hong Kong.”She urged journalists to continue doing what they can to safeguard the values of a free press.Supporters chanted “Journalism is not a crime” and “Stand with Bao Choy” as they held up placards in support of her and freedom of the press.Chris Yeung, chairman of the Hong Kong Journalists Association, said Choy's use of a vehicle search to find out more about the attack demonstrates the media’s role as a watchdog.“The relentless efforts of journalists to find out the whole truth of the Yuen Long attacks could clarify who should hold responsibility for what in the incident. This is what the fourth power is about,” Yeung said after the verdict.“The government sent a reporter to the dock, she was found guilty and the fourth power is under threat. Press freedom in Hong Kong is dying,” he said.Media groups have expressed concern that the crackdown on freedoms in Hong Kong, including the implementation of a tough new national security law, could be used against journalists reporting on sensitive issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-journalist-convicted-for-accessing-public-records-101619096131455.html

Schools will close and return to online lessons if the virus incidence exceeds 165 cases per 100,000 residents.The law still needs the signature of President Frank-Walter Steinmeier before it can come into force. The changes will apply initially until June 30.Merkel drew up the law after some of Germany's 16 federal states refused to impose tough measures despite a surge in cases.Manuela Schwesig, premier of the northern state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, said the amendment did not go far enough. "This law has a serious design flaw. This law will not bring down infection figures," she told ZDF television.Germany reported a rise of 29,518 coronavirus cases on Thursday, bringing the total to 3.21 million. Some 80,893 people have died and doctors have warned that unless action is taken, intensive-care units may struggle to cope.The seven-day incidence rate rose slightly to 161.1 per 100,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/german-upper-house-backs-new-law-to-fight-third-coronavirus-wave-101619095650223.html
22-04-2021||World||Norway lends AstraZeneca vaccine doses to Sweden, Iceland||Norway will lend all of its 216,000 doses of AstraZeneca to neighboring Sweden and Iceland as long as its own government regulator has paused the use of the vaccine.On March 11, Norway followed Denmark in deciding to put on hold jabs by the British-Swedish company after reports of very rare blood clots.Health Minister Bent Hoeie said if the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine is resumed, “we will get back the doses we lend as soon as we request it.”The European Medicines Agency has said the benefits of being immunized against Covid-19 outweigh the very rare risks of developing the unusual clots with AstraZeneca.Hoie also said if the vaccine is taken out of the coronavirus vaccination program in non-European Union-member Norway, “the doses we have been given can be donated to other countries in collaboration with the EU.”Hoeie said Sweden will borrow 200,000 doses and Iceland 16,000 doses. The Norwegian doses expire in June and July.The Danes, who were the first to pull suspend use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, have not yet decided what will happen with their doses.Although the Norwegian Institute of Public Health has called for removing the AstraZeneca vaccine from Norway’s vaccination program, the government in Norway this month decided to wait, saying it "believes that we do not have a good enough basis for drawing a final conclusion.”Hoeie reiterated that experts in Norway would gauge the use of the AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccine before May 10. Both vaccines are made with the same technology.Norway started its vaccinations on Dec. 27 and 1.1 million people — out of a population of 5.3 million -- have so far been vaccinated. Norway uses the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/norway-lends-astrazeneca-vaccine-doses-to-sweden-iceland-101619094741300.html
22-04-2021||World||EU looks to pursue legal action against AstraZeneca for underdelivering doses||The European Commission is looking to launch legal action against AstraZeneca for underdelivering Covid-19 vaccine doses to the EU, hobbling the bloc's early rollout of jabs, diplomats said Thursday.The EU executive informed member state envoys of its plans on Wednesday, the diplomats told AFP, confirming information first published by the Politico website.They said any lawsuit against AstraZeneca would begin in a Belgian court -- the jurisdiction agreed under the commission's contract with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company.A commission spokesman, Eric Mamer, told journalists that "no decision has yet been taken".Another spokesman, Stefan De Keersmaecker, added: "As you know, AstraZeneca is not delivering the number of doses which have been agreed upon in the contract... This is one of the reasons why we keep our options open together with member states to take any further steps."One EU diplomat said the commission wants EU member states -- which also had a role in negotiating the vaccine contracts for the bloc -- to back the lawsuit and to say so by the end of this week."The problem is that the member states do not know the complaint" being formulated, the diplomat said. "It is a sensitive procedure and you do not want to further damage trust in the vaccine."Anther diplomat said that "not all member states are in agreement" on taking the company to court, stressing that their aim was simply to have AstraZeneca deliver the doses it had promised in its contract.AstraZeneca has so far delivered just 31 million of the 120 million doses it had promised. It has warned it will likewise provide just 70 million of the 180 million more meant to be delivered over the rest of this year.Public confidence in the AstraZeneca jab has taken a blow after the European Medicines Agency, the bloc's regulator, said it was likely linked to a very rare, but often fatal, form of blood clots affecting the brain.The EMA and the commission have not changed their stance on a general use of AstraZeneca, saying its benefits outweighed the risks, but several EU countries have restricted it to older citizens, aged over 50, 55 or 60.'Best efforts' AstraZeneca's French-Australian boss, Pascal Soriot, has argued that his company's contract with the EU binds it only to a "best reasonable efforts" clause.But the commission says the rest of the contract shows greater legal responsibility than that, and EU diplomats and lawmakers have pointed out that the company has largely delivered promised doses to Britain, where it is headquartered.A Brussels lawyer who has studied the AstraZeneca contract, Arnaud Jansen of the firm De Bandt, told AFP that, if any legal action was to go ahead, "it's a process that could take months" before a court rules on it||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-looks-to-pursue-legal-action-against-astrazeneca-for-underdelivering-doses-101619092268031.html
22-04-2021||World||China: We’re ready to provide outbreak-control help to India||China on Thursday said it was ready to provide outbreak prevention support and medical supplies to India as the country faces a vicious second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, putting its health infrastructure under severe strain.India reported 314,835 new coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours, the highest single-day tally recorded anywhere in the world since the pandemic started last year. India’s death toll from the disease rose 2,104 in the same time period.India’s tally of confirmed cases is now nearly 16 million, second only to America’s count of almost 32 million, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tracker. Responding to a query from Chinese state media on Thursday on the pandemic situation in India, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said Beijing was ready to help.“The Covid-19 epidemic is the common enemy of all mankind. The international community needs to unite as one to fight against the epidemic,” Wang said.“The Chinese side notes that the epidemic situation in India is severe and there is a temporary shortage of epidemic prevention and medical supplies. We are ready to provide necessary support and assistance to India so that they can control the epidemic,” Wang added.It could not be immediately ascertained if Beijing has officially extended the offer of help to New Delhi.HT learnt that while Indian private companies have been trying to source supplies from China, they have been hit by a sudden escalation of air freight costs over the last few days. Last year, India was among the countries to help Beijing with medical supplies during the time the Covid-19 outbreak was at its most severe in China.India had provided 15 tonnes of medical supplies comprising masks, gloves and emergency medical equipment at a cost of about ₹2.11 crore to China at that time.In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha in March last year, external affairs minister of state V Muraleedharan had said the medical supplies included 100,000 surgical masks, 500,000 pairs of surgical gloves, 4,000 N-95 masks, 75 infusion pumps, 30 enteral feeding pumps, and 21 defibrillators.The supplies, flown to China in an India Air Force C-17 flight, were handed over to a Hubei charity federation in the Chinese city of Wuhan, the first epicentre of the pandemic where the virus had emerged in December 2019.In February 2020, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to President Xi Jinping, extending New Delhi’s assistance to fight the outbreak.Soon after, China’s ambassador to India Sun Weidong had appreciated the support and solidarity that India had extended to China in its fight against the coronavirus.China had returned the favour in April, dispatching dozens of aircraft with Covid-related medical supplies when the first wave of the pandemic became severe in India.India-bound flights had taken off from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xi’an and Hong Kong, carrying 390 tonnes of medical supplies.Soon after, however, ties plunged to its worst in decades following military friction along the disputed border in eastern Ladakh. Nearly a year later, the two countries are still grappling to completely defuse the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-we-re-ready-to-provide-outbreak-control-help-to-india-101619089910441.html
22-04-2021||World||US pledges to halve its emissions by 2030 in renewed climate fight||The Biden administration on Thursday pledged to slash U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50%-52% from 2005 levels by 2030, a new target it hopes will spur other big emitter countries to raise their ambition to combat climate change.The goal, unveiled at the start of a two-day climate summit hosted by Democratic President Joe Biden, comes as the United States seeks to reclaim global leadership in the fight against global warming after former President Donald Trump withdrew the country from international efforts to cut emissions.It also marks an important milestone in Biden's broader plan to decarbonize the U.S. economy entirely by 2050 - an agenda he says can create millions of good-paying jobs but which many Republicans say they fear will damage the economy.The emissions cuts are expected to come from power plants, automobiles, and other sectors across the economy, but the White House did not set individual targets for those industries."It's an economy-wide goal. There are going to be multiple pathways to get there," one official told reporters on a conference call describing the plan.Sector-specific goals will be laid out later this year.How the United States intends to reach its climate goals will be crucial to cementing U.S. credibility on global warming, amid international concerns that America's commitment to a clean energy economy can shift drastically from one administration to the next.Biden's recently introduced $2 trillion infrastructure plan contains numerous measures that could deliver some of the emissions cuts needed this decade, including a clean energy standard to achieve net zero emissions in the power sector by 2035 and moves to electrify the vehicle fleet.But the measures need to be passed by Congress before becoming reality.Biden focused on restoring U.S. climate leadership during his campaign and in the first days of his presidency after Republican Trump, a climate change skeptic, removed the United States from the Paris agreement on global warming.The new administration has come under heavy pressure from environmental groups, some corporate leaders, the UN secretary general and foreign governments to set a target to cut emissions by at least 50% this decade to encourage other countries to set their own ambitious emissions goals.Biden will announce the number at the start of a climate summit on Thursday that will be attended by leaders from the world's biggest emitters, including China.World leaders aim to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, a threshold scientists say can prevent the worst impacts of climate change.One of the administration officials said with the new U.S. target, enhanced commitments from Japan and Canada, and prior targets from the European Union and Britain, countries accounting for more than half the world's economy were now committed to reductions to achieve the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal."When we close this summit on Friday, we will unmistakably communicate ... the U.S. is back," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pledges-to-halve-its-emissions-by-2030-in-renewed-climate-fight-101619086924257.html
22-04-2021||World||UK's Heathrow Airport refuses to allow extra flights from India amid Covid-19||Heathrow Airport in London, the UK's largest and busiest airport, has declined requests from at least four international aircraft carriers to land eight extra flights from India on Thursday, ahead of the coronavirus pandemic "red list" travel ban which comes into force from Friday.The airport said the decision to decline requests for additional flights was taken to ensure that the existing pressures on the border are not "exacerbated", resulting in long queues and crowds at passport control on arrival.India's addition to the travel "red list" was announced in the House of Commons earlier this week amid 103 cases recorded in the UK of a new variant of coronavirus first detected in India. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that the decision had been made after studying the data and on a “precautionary basis”."That means that anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen cannot enter the UK if they have been in India in the previous 10 days. UK and Irish residents and British citizens who have been in India in the 10 days before their arrival will need to complete hotel quarantine for 10 days from the time of arrival,” said Hancock.It has since triggered considerable confusion and panic as hundreds of Indian students and other UK-based British Indians scramble for return flights ahead of the Friday deadline. London-based family-owned travel agency, Tickets to India, is among the agents who have been working round the clock to try and sort out charter flights to carry Indian-origin passengers back to the UK."Hundreds of British nationals are still requesting seats but there is very little time to arrange a second charter before Friday," said the company, which was working on getting clearance for one Qatar Airways A350 to bring 300 passengers back before the cut-off time (4am local time) on Friday.The UK Civil Aviation Authority said it had received several applications for charter flight permits from India to the UK, but many have been declined or withdrawn as they did not meet the qualifying criteria."We are in a global health pandemic – people should not be travelling unless absolutely necessary," a UK government spokesperson said."Every essential check helps avoid the risk of importing dangerous variants of coronavirus which could put our vaccine rollout at risk," the spokesperson said.Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was forced to cancel his India visit due to the surging coronavirus cases in India, told a Downing Street briefing earlier this week that the so-called "Indian variant" is still a variant under investigation, not a "variant of concern" as Public Health England (PHE) and other authorities continue to investigate its transmissibility and any vaccine resistance.A briefing document drawn up by PHE officials shows that between March 25 and April 7, a total of 3,345 arrivals from India were registered in UK border travel data, being collected through compulsory passenger locator forms at the airport. Of the arrivals so far 161 – or 4.8 per cent – tested positive for COVID-19 after a PCR test.The travel ban means that those with valid residency rights returning to the UK after the deadline on Friday face the additional financial burden of compulsory hotel quarantine and tests costs, estimated at around 2,000 pounds per person.The National Indian Students and Alumni Union UK (NISAU-UK), a representative group for Indian students in the UK, has been working on trying to seek some reprieve for Indian students from the additional and unforeseen financial burden."Significant concern is being raised about the cost of quarantine as well as how the new restrictions impact student eligibility for the Graduate visa route for which they need to be in the country by particular dates,” said NISAU UK chair Sanam Arora.The Home Office had already extended the deadline period for the physical campus presence requirements for students to be able to apply for the new Graduate or post-study work visa until June-end and a further extension is reportedly being considered.Meanwhile, the government has indicated that students with valid visas but yet to collect their biometric residence permits (BRPs) would qualify for entry, subject to all the additional quarantine rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-heathrow-airport-refuses-to-allow-extra-flights-from-india-amid-covid19-101619086610131.html
22-04-2021||World||Singapore quarantines hundreds after dorm workers infected with coronavirus||Singapore has discovered more virus cases in a foreign worker dormitory that was within the epicenter for the Covid-19 outbreak in the country last year, raising concerns about reinfections as almost all the laborers had previously tested positive.To stop the potential spread at the Westlite Woodlands dorm, more than 1,100 people living in the same block as the infected workers were recalled from work and will be sent to a government quarantine facility for 14 days, according to a letter, signed by the dormitory’s manager to clients on Wednesday, that was seen by Bloomberg News.“The situation is still unfolding,” the dormitory’s operator, Centurion Corp. Ltd, said in a statement on Thursday, declining to provide further detail or confirmation on the number of residents who have tested positive for Covid-19. The firm confirmed the authenticity of the letter.Earlier in the week, the government said a 35-year-old Bangladeshi migrant worker staying at the dormitory tested positive for the virus, despite having received both doses of vaccine. This prompted the government to isolate and quarantine his close contacts at the dorm and workplace.In a statement from the manpower ministry on Thursday, it said one person under quarantine, who is a roommate of the 35-year-old worker, was found to be infected. Virus testing was then conducted on all residents at the dormitory as a precaution. So far, 17 recovered workers were tested positive, the health ministry said in its daily preliminary virus update.The health ministry, “together with an expert panel which comprises infectious diseases and microbiology experts, is investigating if they are re-infection cases,” it said Thursday.This development comes after many weeks of almost zero new cases among the laborers and thousands of them getting vaccinations. The dormitory, located on the far north side of Singapore, first reported a cluster of virus cases in April last year but this cluster was closed in October after no new cases were found there for 28 days.Reinfection ConcernsLast year, Singapore confined hundreds of thousands of workers to their dormitories to prevent an outbreak in their ranks from spreading across the island. Though Singapore has largely managed to control the pandemic, and has one of the fastest vaccination rates in Asia-Pacific, concerns of reinfection are growing as new virus variants emerge and global cases tick up.Singapore is reviewing border controls for travelers who recovered from the virus. The country and Hong Kong called off an announcement planned for Thursday on an air-travel bubble, according to people familiar with the matter, the second time in five months the highly anticipated arrangement for quarantine-free travel between the two financial hubs has run into obstacles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-quarantines-hundreds-after-dorm-workers-infected-with-coronavirus-101619083458182.html
22-04-2021||World||New Zealand says Five Eyes security alliance remains strong||New Zealand said Thursday it continues to have a close and productive relationship with the US and other security allies, despite resisting speaking out in unison with them against China on certain human rights issues.New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta discussed her reluctance to expand the role of the Five Eyes intelligence-sharing alliance to include stances on human rights. The alliance among New Zealand, the US, the UK, Australia and Canada dates to World War II.Some observers have speculated that the differing approaches have exposed cracks in the alliance and that New Zealand is not being tough enough with China.Last year, for instance, New Zealand declined to sign a joint declaration by the other Five Eyes members condemning China's national security legislation in Hong Kong. New Zealand did, however, separately express its concerns.Mahuta's comments Thursday came after she met with her Australian counterpart Marise Payne at the first high-level summit since the two countries opened a quarantine-free travel bubble this week. The meeting came ahead of a planned visit by Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison next month.Mahuta said New Zealand values the Five Eyes relationship and receives significant benefits from it. But she said Five Eyes was about security and intelligence.“And it's not necessary all the time on every issue to invoke Five Eyes as your first port-of-call in terms of creating a coalition of support around particular issues, in the human rights space, for example,” Mahuta said.Payne said that as liberal democracies, the Five Eyes partners shared many common values and approaches to international issues through an era of greater strategic competition in the region.She said countries would choose to address issues of concern in whichever forum they found appropriate, but that the respect among the Five Eyes partners remained “enduring and continuing."Payne said Australia continued to pursue cooperation with China when it was in Australia's interests.“But we also have to acknowledge that China's outlook, and the nature of China's external engagement, both in our region and the world, has changed in recent years.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-zealand-says-five-eyes-security-alliance-remains-strong-101619083133949.html
22-04-2021||World||Pakistan Taliban claim responsibility for deadly blast at Serena hotel||The Pakistan Taliban claimed responsibility Thursday for a deadly bomb blast at a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese ambassador in the southwest of the country, as officials raised the death toll to five.Beijing said it strongly condemned the attack, although the Taliban said Pakistan security officials were the target of the blast.The bomb was placed in a car parked at the Serena hotel -- part of a five-star chain popular with diplomats -- and detonated late Wednesday in the city of Quetta, capital of Balochistan province.Pakistan is fighting several low-level insurgencies in the impoverished province waged by Islamist, separatist and sectarian groups."The suicide bomber hit the security officials exactly as it was planned," the spokesperson for Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) said in a statement.Police said the blast came from an improvised explosive device, and security officials and hotel staff were among those killed.Describing the blast as a "terrorist attack", China's foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said in Beijing that the Chinese delegation was not present when the bomb detonated.Gu Wenliang, agriculture commissioner at China's embassy in Pakistan, told the Chinese newspaper Global Times that the bomb had detonated 10 minutes before their expected return."I was walking through the car park when I heard a sudden loud sound and the earth shook under my feet," said Khuda Baksh, a guard at the hotel."Everyone was running for their lives before I lost consciousness", he told AFP.For years the TTP unleashed deadly attacks on urban centres across Pakistan from their bases along the Afghan border, where they provided shelter to an array of global jihadist groups including Al Qaeda.But a massive military offensive launched in 2014 largely destroyed the group's command and control structure, dramatically reducing insurgent violence throughout Pakistan.'Full alert'Wednesday's attack comes after extremist-linked violence has largely reduced in recent years."We will not allow this monster to re-emerge," tweeted Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan."We are on full alert and keeping an eye on all internal and external threats."Analysts warn, however, that Pakistan has yet to tackle the root causes of extremism.Balochistan is Pakistan's largest and poorest province despite being rich in natural resources.Resentment has been fuelled by billions of dollars of Chinese money flowing into the region through the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) -- a key part of China's Belt and Road Initiative -- which locals say gave them little benefit as most new jobs went to outsiders.In 2019 gunmen stormed a luxury hotel overlooking a flagship CPEC project -- the deep-water seaport in Gwadar that gives China strategic access to the Arabian Sea -- killing at least eight people.And in June, Baloch insurgents targeted the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which is partly owned by Chinese companies.Both attacks were claimed by the Balochistan Liberation Army.Wednesday's blast also comes after the radical anti-blasphemy Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) held a week of violent protests calling for the French ambassador to be kicked out of the country.The TLP has waged a campaign for months after President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of a satirical magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed -- an act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.The TTP, though not ideologically linked to the TLP, published a statement earlier this week supporting the group's protests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-taliban-claim-responsibility-for-deadly-blast-at-serena-hotel-101619083038963.html
22-04-2021||World||'Poisoned mutual trust': China tells Australia after it scraps BRI deal||China on Thursday said Australia's sudden scrapping of a Belt and Road Initiative deal risked "serious harm" to relations and warned of retaliatory actions, but Canberra insisted it would not be bullied.The federal government pulled the deal with Victoria state late Wednesday in a move justified by the defence minister as necessary to prevent Australia hosting a giant infrastructure scheme "used for propaganda".Australia overruled the state's decision to join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) -- the flagship of President Xi Jinping's geostrategic vision for the Asia-Pacific region -- by saying the agreement was inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy.As relations nosedive -- following spats over the origins of the coronavirus and Canberra's blocking of Chinese telecoms giant Huawei -- Defence Minister Peter Dutton said Canberra was "worried" about local governments entering into such agreements with Beijing."We can't allow these sort of compacts... to pop up because they're used for propaganda reasons and we're just not going to allow that to happen," he told local radio.Dutton said the government's problem was not with the Chinese people but rather "the values or virtues or the outlook of the Chinese Communist Party".Australia last year enacted new powers -- widely seen as targeting China -- that allow it to scrap any agreements between state authorities and foreign countries deemed to threaten the national interest.Canberra's first target was the BRI, a vast network of investments that critics say is cover for Beijing to create geopolitical and financial leverage.Prime Minister Scott Morrison said the decision "followed through" on his government's pledge to ensure Australia had a consistent foreign policy which strives for a "world that seeks a balance in favour of freedom".The schism between Australia and its largest export market widened on Thursday as Beijing railed at the abrupt cancellation and warned it would damage trust between the two countries.The move "has poisoned mutual trust... and seriously harms China-Australia relations", said foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin at a briefing in Beijing."China reserves the right to take further action in response to this."Earlier, Dutton said he would be "very disappointed" if China retaliated but retorted that Australia "won't be bullied by anyone"."We are going to stand up for what we believe in and that's exactly what we've done here," he said.'Fraying relations'The BRI is the showpiece of Xi's vision for Asia, a lattice of ports, train tracks, economic zones and other infrastructure investments to tether the continent and beyond tighter into China's commercial orbit.It was unclear if the Victoria state deal had "any projects that were in the pipeline or whether any investments had been pledged", Peter Cai, a specialist on Australia-China relations at the Lowy Institute, told AFP.But Canberra's bold move is an indicator "of how fraying foreign relations or political instability can affect China's global infrastructure push", he said.China has already slapped tariffs on more than a dozen Australian industries, including wine, barley and coal, in what many see as punishment for Canberra's increasingly assertive stance against its largest trading partner.Australia infuriated China by calling for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic, banning controversial telecoms giant Huawei from building Australia's 5G network and tightening foreign investment laws for corporations.Other agreements between foreign powers and local governments are still under consideration, and Canberra could yet target the presence of Chinese government-backed Confucius Institutes at Australia's public universities.Critics say the institutes, which have been the subject of controversy on some campuses, promote the Communist Party's self-serving version of Chinese culture and history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/poisoned-mutual-trust-china-tells-australia-after-it-scraps-bri-deal-101619082210328.html

22-04-2021||World||French president Macron's job is on the line and these are main contenders||In exactly 12 months time, the French will start the process of deciding whether they want to keep Emmanuel Macron as president, or dismiss him.The 43-year-old former investment banker-turned-president has been bruised by his government’s handling of the coronavirus pandemic, rallies against police violence and strikes against his pension reform, as well protests by the Yellow Vests movement that demands greater economic equality. And then, there’s a perception he’s arrogant and aloof.Even so, Macron’s approval rating is around 40% in recent surveys. He can count on a strong base of loyal voters and with the left- and right-wing parties in disarray and bickering over who will represent them in April 2022, he’s almost certain to make it to the second round of the election —  probably finding himself again facing off with far-right leader Marine Le Pen.It’s a crowded and moving field, though, so don’t rule out a surprise. After all, a year before Macron was elected, few would have bet on him.Here’s a look at some of the candidates who’ve already entered the race:The Populist: Marine Le PenThe National Rally leader believes her third attempt to win France’s top job will be the lucky one.In the decade since taking over the party from her father, Le Pen has been working hard to move it to the mainstream. She made it to the second round in the previous presidential ballot in 2017, but suffered a crushing defeat when progressives rallied around Macron to keep her out of the Elysee.As Le Pen, 52, stages her come back, she’s been tapping into anger over economic inequality and the dominance of Paris over the regions. She’s also lashed out at Macron for not having closed borders early enough to prevent the arrival of Covid-19 variants, as well as for the slow start to France’s vaccination campaign.Le Pen says she’s learned from her mistakes. To broaden her appeal, she’s abandoned her pledge to take France out of the EU and condemned racism. And she’s embarked on a public relations campaign, appearing regularly on TV and radio to sell her new image to more voters. The gap is narrowing between Le Pen and Macron. Yet, she’s still perceived by a majority of French as “aggressive” and “worrying,” according to a recent poll.What could help her? Massive abstention from left-wing voters who backed Macron in 2017. Second round polls show a much tighter margin between the president and Le Pen than before, with progressives reluctant to step in rescue him again after his tack to the right on issues ranging from taxation to immigration and Islam.The Old-School Left Winger: Jean-Luc MelenchonThe leader of the far-left France Unbowed party is running for the third time as well, after winning 20% of the vote in the first round of the 2017 election.Melenchon, 69, says the health crisis demanded a change in tactics so he’s no longer calling on people to create chaos and disobey — or as he says, he wants to move on “from the period of sound and fury.” He says he has dusted off his program and sought new ideas from key supporters, who tend to be highly-educated with lower revenue.Melenchon’s policy positions are firmly anchored to the left of the mainstream Socialist Party. He’s a staunch critic of the EU as it is and defends protectionism as well as strong social benefits. He advocates boosting public debt, which he says will eventually not be repaid by the state, and wants to cancel debt owned by the European Central Bank.A Melenchon win would likely be just as market adverse as a Le Pen win. His path to power includes uniting with the Green Party — it had a strong showing in last year’s city elections and its leaders have agreed they must forge an alliance with the left to contest the presidential ballot.The Blue Collar Conservative: Xavier BertrandThe president of the working class, northern region of Hauts-de-France left the conservative Les Republicains party after a hardliner was elected to its helm. He’s currently an independent.Often described as compatible with centrists, the 56-year-old former Minister for Labor, Employment, and Health in Nicolas Sarkozy’s government had been talking about throwing his hat in the ring for more than a year before finally saying that given the current political climate, it was “his duty” to run.He’s coming up with strong-handed proposals on security and terrorism, including lowering the age of penal responsibility to 15 years old, in a bid to win the backing of Les Republicains.One recent survey had Bertrand running third in the first round. He’ll need to win upcoming regional elections to show he stands a chance to get the top job.The Green-Friendly Socialist: Anne HidalgoIn 2014, the Spanish-born Socialist became the first woman to lead the French capital’s city hall, a political springboard for the late president Jacques Chirac. She began her tenure with a baptism of fire — a deadly attack by jihadists on the Paris offices of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo followed months later by an even worse assault on venues including the Bataclan concert hall. Her handling of the crises earned praise from world leaders including Barack Obama.When a fire partially destroyed Notre-Dame Cathedral in June 2019, Hidalgo was still mayor, she’d go on to win a second term about a year later. She has overseen the city’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic and led a successful bid for the 2024 Summer Olympic Games.Hidalgo, 61, is regularly criticized by opponents for the dirtiness of some areas of Paris as well as her push to progressively ban cars from the city center, while some voters see her as part of a Parisian elite that doesn’t have a good grasp on what happens outside the capital. She has yet to reach the 10% voting intention threshold in polls.Still, Macron advisers reckon she’s a serious threat. Her tough measures on vehicles are in-line with demands by the Green Party, meaning she could potentially unite with them, and/or eventually attract the votes of social democrats who backed the president in 2017. The Former Wing Man: Edouard PhilippePhilippe, 50, hasn’t said he’s running, but he’s included here because, according to polls, he’s France’s most popular politician —  or, as he puts it, the “least unpopular.”Philippe was heading France as prime minister when the Yellow Vests protests and strikes against Macron’s planned pension reform emerged. He handled the beginning of the Covid pandemic, and pushed to keep the country under lockdown. He was replaced with Jean Castex last July, just as his popularity was climbing and he was threatening to steal his boss’s thunder with his poised, down-to-earth style.Now mayor of the northern, working-class town of Le Havre, Philippe has been raising his profile while out promoting his upcoming book, “Impressions and Clear Lines,” a chronicle of his experiences as prime minister that he co-wrote with a former adviser.Philippe’s always been loyal to Macron and makes a point of remaining ambiguous on his election plans. He could emerge as a replacement for the president’s La Republic En Marche movement should his popularity plummet.The Dark HorsesThe list of potential other candidates is endless and on the right includes figures like Bruno Retailleau, president of the Republican group in the Senate; former industry minister Arnaud Montebourg and Philippe Juvin, the right-wing mayor of the northern city Garenne-Colombes who rose to prominence during the pandemic as head of emergency services at the Georges-Pompidou hospital in Paris.Depending on the outcome of the regional elections, and whether Les Republicains decides to hold a primary, other candidates could include the party’s president of the Senate Gerard Larcher or Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who despite being featured in a lot of international press coverage, remains unknown to many in France, including those outside elite circles and the Brussels bubble.The Greens haven’t picked a candidate yet. The field includes Yannick Jadot, a member of European Parliament, the mayor of Grenoble, Eric Piolle and economist Sandrine Rousseau. Their problem is that all parties are talking about the climate and ecology now, even Le Pen’s nationalists. They contend they’re the original while others are pale copies, but they’re being upstaged and the debate is moving on to other issues, such as religion and the economy. Still, the Greens have the potential to rally a large part of the left and Macron’s lieutenants have been on the attack, well aware that just across the Rhine, a German and more centrist version is running neck-and-neck with the incumbent government, five months before an election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-president-macron-s-job-is-on-the-line-and-these-are-main-contenders-101619071893290.html

The 283-page bill, crafted by the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is designed to counter China's economic and geopolitical power.Under Section 136 of the Bill, which deals with how the US will support independent media and counter disinformation, it says the US Agency for Global media shall increase funding for Radio Free Asia's Mandarin, Tibetan, Uyghur and Cantonese language services. It also said how China spends extensively on influence operations, even in western countries. For example, China spent $500,0000,000 on an advertising campaign to attract cable viewers in Australia, it said.Also Read: PLA steps up drive to recruit Tibetans"The United States and European nations share serious concerns with the repressions being supported and executed by the government of China in Tibet, Hong Kong and Xinjiang, the Bill said adding that the government should continue implementing measures to address China's specific abuses in these regions and should build joint mechanisms and programmes to prevent the export of China's authoritarian governance model to countries around the world," the Bill, unveiled early in April, says.When the US will conduct an annual review on the presence of Chinese companies in US capital markets, it will see whether the company has contributed to the repression of religious and ethnic minorities within China, including Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region or Tibet Autonomous Regions, the Bill mentions.In its regional strategies to counter the People's Republic of China, the United States lists Tibetan Buddhists among whom the US wants to promote the values of democracy and human rights.The Bill also backs the resumption of normal relations with Taiwan, considered as a rebel province by China. Section 212 of the Bill says it is the policy of the United States to recognise Taiwan as a vital part of the United States Ino-pacific strategy. The policy is aimed at advancing the security of Taiwan and its democracy as key elements for the continued peace and stability of the greater Indo-Pacific region etc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-us-bill-to-counter-china-includes-policies-for-tibet-xinjiang-101619066870279.html
22-04-2021||World||Samsung boss Lee Jae-yong on trial over 'manipulated' takeover of group||The jailed de facto leader of the giant Samsung group went on trial Thursday over a stock manipulation case that effectively puts South Korea's system of conglomerate control in the dock.Samsung -- whose flagship subsidiary is among the world's biggest smartphone and computer chip makers -- is by far the largest of the family-controlled empires known as chaebols that dominate business in South Korea, the world's 12th-largest economy.Chaebol families often have only a small ownership stake in their empires, but maintain control through complex webs of cross-shareholdings between units.Lee Jae-yong, the vice-chairman of Samsung Electronics and the grandson of the group's founder, is accused of stock manipulation, breach of trust and other offences when two other subsidiaries, Samsung C&T and Cheil Industries, merged in 2015.Lee -- who had emergency surgery for appendicitis last month, delaying the proceedings -- looked gaunt in court, reports said, and wore a dark suit with a white shirt.Lee was the largest shareholder in Cheil Industries, and critics say Samsung sought to artificially lower the price of C&T to give him a bigger stake in the merged entity -- a key part of the Samsung structure -- consolidating his grip on the conglomerate ahead of his father's death last year.His lawyers have previously said that everything he did in connection with the merger was legal.Lee is already serving a two-and-a-half year prison sentence for bribery, embezzlement and other offences in connection with the corruption scandal that brought down ex-South Korean president Park Geun-hye.Samsung is crucial to South Korea's economic health, and is active in sectors ranging from construction to healthcare to insurance.But Vladimir Tikhonov, professor of Korean Studies at the University of Oslo, told AFP: "The most problematic aspect is the attempted continuation of the unchallenged dynastic rule over a company which is responsible over 20 percent of South Korea's GDP."Samsung's main stakeholders are its shareowners, including the minor ones, its workers and South Korean society as a whole," he said."It is too big to be a dynastic property."Lee's father, Samsung chairman Lee Kun-hee, died in October, leaving his heirs a vast fortune and an inheritance tax bill of around 13 trillion won ($11.7 billion), with the first instalment due by the end of this month.Lee apologised last May for some governance issues at the group, pledging to ensure "there will be no more controversy over the succession" and that he would not allow his children to take over from him at the firm.Presidential pardonsIn the past, some chaebol leaders convicted of various offences have subsequently received presidential pardons in recognition of their economic roles.Some scholars have said a leadership vacuum could hamper Samsung Electronics' decision-making on future large-scale investments, which have been key to its global rise.And a business grouping whose members include the leaders of the second-biggest chaebol Hyundai Motor and steel firm POSCO, ranked sixth, last week called for a special pardon for Lee, saying his absence would bring "adverse effects to the South Korean economy and industry as a whole".Seoul's finance minister Hong Nam-ki said he had passed the proposal to "those with authority", implying the presidential Blue House.Despite Lee's absence, Samsung Electronics has flagged a leap of 44.2 percent in first-quarter operating profits, with robust sales of smartphones and the coronavirus-driven working from home boosting demand for devices powered by its chips.A pardon for Lee would not be justified, Tikhonov said."The company's bureaucracy is fully capable of meeting day-to-day challenges even with the head boss being out of office," he said."We need to establish a precedent of the rule of the law equally applied to everybody, regardless of the size of their fortune. The pardon won't be conducive to this socially important goal."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/samsung-boss-lee-jae-yong-on-trial-over-manipulated-takeover-of-group-101619065702305.html
22-04-2021||World||Encrypted chat app Signal alleges flaws in Cellebrite equipment||Encrypted chat app Signal suggested in a blog post published on Wednesday that products sold to law enforcement from Israeli surveillance provider Cellebrite can easily be sabotaged.Cellebrite DI Ltd, which specializes in helping law enforcement and intelligence agencies copy call logs, texts, photos and other data off of smartphones, has repeatedly come under fire for past sales to authoritarian governments, including Russia and China.Signal, a privacy-focused app eager to show the lengths it goes to protect users' conversations, clashed with Cellebrite last year when the Israeli company said its equipment was upgraded to allow law enforcement to scoop up Signal messages from devices in their possession.Signal creator and CEO Moxie Marlinspike said in his blog post on Wednesday he had come into possession of a bag of Cellebrite equipment and examined the gear inside.He was "surprised to find that very little care seems to have been given to Cellebrite's own software security," Marlinspike said, noting it would be easy to add a specially crafted file onto a phone that would derail Cellebrite's functionality.In a statement, Cellebrite did not directly address Marlinspike's claim but said that the company's employees "continually audit and update our software in order to equip our customers with the best digital intelligence solutions available."Elsewhere in his blog post, Marlinspike alleged he had found snippets of code from Apple Inc inside Cellebrite's software, something he said "might present a legal risk for Cellebrite and its users" if it was done without authorization.Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Signal's allegations come as Cellebrite prepares to go public through a merger with a blank-check firm, valuing the equity of the combined company at around $2.4 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/encrypted-chat-app-signal-alleges-flaws-in-cellebrite-equipment-101619061421630.html
22-04-2021||World||NASA's Perseverance Mars rover extracts first oxygen from Red Planet||The growing list of "firsts" for Perseverance, NASA's newest six-wheeled robot on the Martian surface, includes converting some of the Red Planet's thin, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere into oxygen.In a press release, NASA said that a toaster-size, experimental instrument aboard Perseverance called the Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) accomplished the task. The test took place April 20, the 60th Martian day, or sol, since the mission landed on February 18."While the technology demonstration is just getting started, it could pave the way for science fiction to become science fact - isolating and storing oxygen on Mars to help power rockets that could lift astronauts off the planet's surface. Such devices also might one day provide breathable air for astronauts themselves. MOXIE is an exploration technology investigation - as is the Mars Environmental Dynamics Analyzer (MEDA) weather station - and is sponsored by NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) and Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate," NASA said."This is a critical first step at converting carbon dioxide to oxygen on Mars," said Jim Reuter, associate administrator for STMD. "MOXIE has more work to do, but the results from this technology demonstration are full of promise as we move toward our goal of one day seeing humans on Mars. Oxygen isn't just the stuff we breathe. Rocket propellant depends on oxygen, and future explorers will depend on producing propellant on Mars to make the trip home."For rockets or astronauts, oxygen is key, said MOXIE's principal investigator, Michael Hecht of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Haystack Observatory.To burn its fuel, a rocket must have more oxygen by weight. Getting four astronauts off the Martian surface on a future mission would require approximately 15,000 pounds (seven metric tons) of rocket fuel and 55,000 pounds (25 metric tons) of oxygen. In contrast, astronauts living and working on Mars would require far less oxygen to breathe. "The astronauts who spend a year on the surface will maybe use one metric ton between them," Hecht said.Hauling 25 metric tons of oxygen from Earth to Mars would be an arduous task. Transporting a one-ton oxygen converter - a larger, more powerful descendant of MOXIE that could produce those 25 tons - would be far more economical and practical.Mars' atmosphere is 96 per cent carbon dioxide. MOXIE works by separating oxygen atoms from carbon dioxide molecules, which are made up of one carbon atom and two oxygen atoms. A waste product, carbon monoxide, is emitted into the Martian atmosphere.The conversion process requires high levels of heat to reach a temperature of approximately 1,470 degrees Fahrenheit (800 Celsius). To accommodate this, the MOXIE unit is made with heat-tolerant materials. These include 3D-printed nickel alloy parts, which heat and cool the gases flowing through it, and a lightweight aerogel that helps hold in the heat. A thin gold coating on the outside of MOXIE reflects infrared heat, keeping it from radiating outward and potentially damaging other parts of Perseverance.In this first operation, MOXIE's oxygen production was quite modest - about five grams, equivalent to about 10 minutes worth of breathable oxygen for an astronaut. MOXIE is designed to generate up to 10 grams of oxygen per hour.This technology demonstration was designed to ensure the instrument survived the launch from Earth, a nearly seven-month journey through deep space, and touchdown with Perseverance on February 18. MOXIE is expected to extract oxygen at least nine more times over the course of a Martian year (nearly two years on Earth).These oxygen-production runs will come in three phases. The first phase will check out and characterise the instrument's function, while the second phase will run the instrument in varying atmospheric conditions, such as different times of day and seasons. In the third phase, Hecht said, "we'll push the envelope" - trying new operating modes, or introducing "new wrinkles, such as a run where we compare operations at three or more different temperatures.""MOXIE isn't just the first instrument to produce oxygen on another world," said Trudy Kortes, director of technology demonstrations within STMD. It's the first technology of its kind that will help future missions "live off the land," using elements of another world's environment, also known as in-situ resource utilisation."It's taking regolith, the substance you find on the ground, and putting it through a processing plant, making it into a large structure, or taking carbon dioxide - the bulk of the atmosphere - and converting it into oxygen," she said. "This process allows us to convert these abundant materials into useable things: propellant, breathable air, or, combined with hydrogen, water."A key objective of Perseverance's mission on Mars is astrobiology, including the search for signs of ancient microbial life. The rover will characterise the planet's geology and past climate, pave the way for human exploration of the Red Planet, and be the first mission to collect and cache Martian rock and regolith (broken rock and dust), according to NASA.The Mars 2020 Perseverance mission is part of NASA's Moon to Mars exploration approach, which includes Artemis missions to the Moon that will help prepare for human exploration of the Red Planet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-perseverance-mars-rover-extracts-first-oxygen-from-red-planet-101619058640738.html

This means anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen cannot enter the UK if they've been in India in the previous 10 days," Hancock had told parliament.Heathrow Airport's refusal to allow extra flights from India was reported earlier by the BBC, with the airport adding that it turned down the requests from airlines because of concerns about queues at passport control.The airport also told Reuters it did not want to exacerbate existing pressures at the border by allowing more passengers to fly in.India now faces a coronavirus "storm" overwhelming its health system, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a national address on Tuesday, with the world's second-most populous nation reporting 295,041 new coronavirus infections on Wednesday - the biggest daily rise reported in any country - stretching its hospitals to breaking point.India's 2,023 deaths in one day were also its highest in the pandemic.At least 24 COVID-19 patients in western India died on Wednesday when the oxygen supply to their ventilators ran out, amid a nationwide shortage of the gas and a surge in infections.Health experts said India had let its guard down when the virus seemed to be under control during the winter, allowing big gatherings such as weddings and festivals.Modi is himself facing criticism for addressing packed political rallies for local elections and allowing a religious festival to go ahead where millions gathered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heathrow-airport-rejects-requests-for-extra-flights-from-india-101619058797557.html
22-04-2021||World||Iran provides 'lethal' support to Yemen's Houthis, says US official||Iran's support for Yemen's Houthi movement is "quite significant and it's lethal," US special envoy on Yemen Tim Lenderking said on Wednesday, as he called a battle for Yemen's gas-rich Marib region the single biggest threat to peace efforts.Lenderking told US lawmakers that Iran supports the Houthis in several ways including through training, providing lethal support and helping them "fine tune" their drone and missile programs."Unfortunately all of this is working to very strong effects as we see more and more attacks on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia - and potentially other countries - more accuracy and more lethality. So this is a great concern to us," Lenderking told a House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee hearing."Iran's support to the Houthis is quite significant, and it's lethal," Lenderking said.A Saudi Arabia-led military coalition intervened in Yemen in 2015 after the Iran-aligned Houthi group ousted the country's government from the capital Sanaa. The Houthis have said they are fighting a corrupt system."We would welcome Iran playing a constructive role if they are willing to do so. We have not seen any indication of that," Lenderking said.Iran has denied supporting the Houthis. A spokesman for Iran's mission to the United Nations in New York dismissed Lenderking's remarks as unsubstantiated claims against Iran."Iran has, time and again called for a peaceful settlement of the conflict in Yemen," the Iranian spokesman said. "In contrast, the US has been providing the deadliest weapons to those who are using them to kill innocent men, women and children on a daily basis."US President Joe Biden said in February that Washington was ending all American support for the Saudi-led offensive operations in Yemen, including relevant arms sales.Since taking office in January, Biden has made Yemen a priority and appointed Lenderking to help revive stalled UN efforts to end a conflict widely seen as a proxy war between rivals Saudi Arabia and Iran."What I see is continued aiding and abetting an army of Houthis by the Iranians so that they can continue attacking Saudi Arabia, and unfortunately those attacks have risen quite strongly in the last couple of months," Lenderking told a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing later on Wednesday.The United States should "leave the matter of finding a resolution to the senseless conflict in the capable hands of the regional countries," the Iranian UN mission spokesman said.Fighting has intensified in recent days as the Houthis push their offensive to take Marib, which if successful would strengthen the movement's hand in any future political negotiations."This offensive is the single biggest threat to peace efforts and is also having devastating humanitarian consequences. If we do not stop the fighting in Marib now, it will trigger a wave of even greater fighting and instability," Lenderking said.There are about 70,000 US citizens living in neighbouring Saudi Arabia, Lenderking said, and "it is our greatest fear that Americans will be killed in a Houthi attack."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-provides-lethal-support-to-yemen-s-houthis-says-us-official-101619058033763.html

Lisa Murkowski joined with Democrats in support of President Joe Biden's Justice Department nominee.Vice President Kamala Harris was on hand for a procedural vote Wednesday morning in case she was needed for a possible 50-50 tie, but her vote wasn't necessary after Murkowski, a moderate Republican from Alaska, broke with her Republican colleagues to back Gupta.Murkowski explained her support for Gupta on the Senate floor, saying she was troubled by some of Gupta's statements but decided to back her confirmation following a lengthy conversation with the nominee, CNN reported."I asked her point-blank, 'Why do you want this? Is this worth it?' Because this has clearly been very hard on her as a nominee," Murkowski said. "And she paused and reflected a moment, and just spoke to how she feels called to serve in a very personal way that I thought was impactful.""I am going to give the benefit of the doubt to a woman who I believe has demonstrated throughout her professional career to be deeply, deeply committed to matters of justice," she added.Gupta has served in Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under the Obama administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-confirms-vanita-gupta-as-associate-attorney-general-101619053963829.html

The official spoke after a second round of talks in Vienna this past week in which the US and Iran didn’t meet directly but negotiated through their European, Russian and Chinese partners.The official’s comments appeared intended to counter speculation of an impending deal after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said the talks are 60%-70% complete and the two sides could soon resuscitate the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which limited the scope of Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for the easing of economic sanctions.President Donald Trump pulled out of the nuclear accord in 2018 -- calling it the “worst deal ever” -- and ramped up restrictions on the Islamic Republic, including on oil sales. Iran responded later by enriching uranium beyond agreed-upon limits, but insisting it remained a party to the nuclear accord.The US declined to say which sanctions the Biden administration is prepared to lift, while making clear that terror-related restrictions imposed late in the Trump administration would likely be one target.The official also said the two sides had made some progress in the talks and acknowledged that the U.S. was open to different types of sequencing under which both nations would return to compliance with the deal.In the past, President Joe Biden and his team have argued that the US would come back into compliance only after Iran did.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-talks-with-iran-on-nuke-deal-progressed-saw-modest-progress-101619050069742.html

Police said rescuers transported victims to nearby hospitals. Footage on Pakistan news channels showed burning cars.Hours after the attack, the Pakistani Taliban in a statement claimed responsibility, saying it was a suicide attack. The Pakistani Taliban, or Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, is a separate insurgent group from the Afghan Taliban.Senior police official Azhar Akram said officers were trying to determine whether the bomb was planted in a vehicle that was parked in the hotel’s parking lot. He provided no further details, saying police were still investigating. Other security officials said the bomb exploded minutes after a car entered the parking lot, and authorities were investigating to determine whether it was a suicide attack.Wasim Beg, a spokesperson at the provincial health department, said four people died and 12 were wounded in the bombing.It was unclear who was behind the attack. Southwestern Baluchistan province is the scene of a long-running insurgency by secessionist groups like the Baluchistan Liberation Front and the Baluchistan Liberation Army. They have for decades staged attacks to press their demands for independence. The Pakistani Taliban and Islamic State group also have a presence there.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attack in the provincial capital.Pakistan’s Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed quickly blamed neighboring India for the hotel bombing, although he provided no evidence to back up the allegation. He told a Pakistani Geo news channel that Pakistan had only one enemy and it was neighboring India, which he alleged was behind the bombing. Ahmed said they had received intelligence about possible attacks in the capital, Islamabad and elsewhere and the information had been shared with relevant authorities to beef up securityLiaquat Shahwani, a provincial government spokesman, called the attack an act of terrorism. “Terrorists want to disrupt peace in Baluchistan. Those who don't want to see progress and prosperity in the Baluchistan province are responsible for this act of terrorism."Jam Kamal Khan, chief minister in Baluchistan, took to Twitter to condemn the bombing. Pakistan Information Minister Fawad Chaudhry said authorities were investigating and a statement would be issued later.Baluchistan’s Home Minister Ziaullah Langove said Chinese Ambassador Nong Rong was staying at the hotel at the time of the bombing but it was unclear what the motive was behind the attack. He said no guests were hurt but that a police officer was among four people who died in the attack.The hotel is frequented by foreigners as it is the city's only luxury hotel and is considered safe.Arbab Kamran Kasi, a doctor at Quetta's main hospital, said about a dozen wounded were being brought their and they declared an emergency at the hospital to handle victims.The bombing in Quetta came hours after Pakistan and neighboring Iran opened a new border crossing point in Baluchistan to improve trade and economic relations. Baluchistan shares a border with Iran and Afghanistan.The Pakistani Taliban have been targeting the military and civilians across the country since 2001, when this Islamic nation joined the U.S.-led war on terror following the Sept. 11 attack in the United States. Since then, the insurgents have declared war on the government of Pakistan and have carried out numerous attacks. Pakistan’s militant groups are often interlinked with those across the border in Afghanistan.Pakistan has nearly completed a fence along the border with Afghanistan, which Islamabad says is necessary to prevent militant attacks from both sides. Pakistan and neighboring Afghanistan often accuse each other of turning a blind eye to Islamic militants operating along the porous frontier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-at-pakistan-hotel-hosting-china-official-kills-4-101619050559460.html

This is "an incredible achievement for the nation."Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBiden called the 200 million shots in 100 days a "goal unmatched in the world or in prior mass vaccination efforts in American history.""The progress we've made has been stunning," he said.Announcing a tax break to encourage businesses to give all employees a day off for vaccinations, Biden said the country was still "on track" to being able to celebrate the July 4th Independence Day holiday in relative normality.But he warned that rising infection rates in parts of the country showed that it was too early to declare victory."If we let up now and stop being vigilant, this virus will erase the progress," he said.While the United States leads the world in reported Covid-19 deaths, it has also raced ahead in the vaccination stakes, outperforming some major European countries and neighboring Canada.Biden came into office on January 20 initially vowing to get 100 million shots administered in his first 100 days. On March 25, with vaccination deliveries far ahead of their targets, he doubled the goal.Starting in May, all states will be required to lift restrictions on eligibility for access to the free shots. Many have already done that.Dampening the celebratory mood in the White House is a surge of infection rates in parts of the country, including the state of Michigan.Death rates, however, remain down nationwide as a result of the high vaccination rate among the elderly and improved care.\||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-gives-200-million-covid-vaccine-doses-joe-biden-hails-stunning-achievement-101619050053804.html
22-04-2021||World||Indonesian navy search for submarine with 53 aboard||Indonesian navy ships on Thursday scoured a patch of ocean off the coast of Bali searching for a submarine with 53 crew aboard after losing contact with the vessel during military exercises.The German-built KRI Nanggala 402 was scheduled to do live torpedo exercises when it asked for permission to dive early Wednesday morning, authorities said."After permission was given according to the procedure, the submarine lost contact and could not be reached," the defence ministry said.A helicopter looking for the missing vessel spotted an oil spill in waters where the submarine was thought to have submerged, it added.The navy said it has not pinpointed the submarine's location but narrowed the search down based on the spill.The oil "could indicate damage on the body" of the submarine, navy spokesman Julius Widjojono told MetroTV.Two warships and some 400 personnel were sent out to hunt for the sub, while a third vessel was deployed from the capital Jakarta.The navy also sent out an international distress signal and "several countries have responded and are ready to help including Singapore, Australia and India," the defence ministry said.There were 53 crew aboard the vessel, which was believed to be in waters about 700 metres (2,300 feet) deep.Indonesia, which has been moving to upgrade its military equipment in recent years, has five German and South Korean-built submarines in its fleet.The 1,300-tonne KRI Nanggala 402 was built in 1978, according to a government website.The vessel is a Type 209 diesel-electric attack submarine that has served in more than a dozen navies around the world, including Greece, India, Argentina and Turkey, over the past half century."It's a classic submarine," French navy vice admiral Antoine Beaussant told AFP.It had a safety descent level of 250 metres, and "if it went down to rest at 700 metres the likelihood is it would have broken up," he said.Submarine disastersWhile the Southeast Asian archipelago has not previously suffered a major submarine disaster, other countries have been struck by accidents in the past.Among them was the 2000 sinking of the Kursk, the pride of Russia's Northern Fleet.The submarine was on manoeuvres in the Barents Sea on August 12, 2000 when it sank with the loss of all 118 aboard. An inquiry found a torpedo had exploded, detonating all the others.Most crew died instantly but some survived for several days -- with a few keeping heart-breaking diaries written in blood to their loved ones -- before suffocating.Seventy Chinese naval officers and crew were killed, apparently suffocated, in an accident on a Ming-class submarine conducting exercises in 2003.In 2008, 20 people were killed by poisonous gas when a fire extinguishing system was accidentally activated on a Russian submarine being tested in the Sea of Japan.In 2018, authorities found the wreckage of an Argentine submarine that had gone missing a year earlier with 44 sailors aboard.Crushed from an implosion, the ARA San Juan was located at a depth of more than 900 metres (3,000 feet) in an area of undersea craters and canyons 400 kilometres (250 miles) off the coast of Argentina.In 2019, a French submarine that had gone missing in the Mediterranean more than 50 years earlier was found.The diesel-electric Minerve submarine was lost off France's southern coast with 52 sailors on board on January 27, 1968.Experts believe that the disaster was caused by a problem with the Minerve's rudder, a collision with another boat, the explosion of a missile or torpedo, or a fault with its oxygen supply systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-navy-search-for-submarine-with-53-aboard-101619049160903.html
22-04-2021||World||India urges US to lift ban on export of key products||Indian officials have raised with their US counterparts the impact of a wartime production law on the supply of raw materials needed by Indian manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines and the two sides are working together to find appropriate solutions.The matter was taken up by India’s ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu soon after the Defense Production Act was invoked by President Joe Biden on February 5 to boost domestic vaccine production. External affairs minister S Jaishankar raised it with secretary of state Antony Blinken when they spoke on Monday, people familiar with developments said.Serum Institute of India (SII), the world’s largest manufacturer of vaccines, too took up the matter with the US administration in February, and the firm’s CEO Adar Poonawalla requested Biden through a tweet on April 16 “to lift the embargo of raw material exports out of the U.S”.The US side has promised to “give the matter due consideration” and to work with India to “find appropriate solutions”, according to the people cited above.The curbs put in place by the US administration – the American side insists there is no “explicit export ban” – have affected the supplies of more than 35 crucial items needed by Indian vaccine manufacturers such as SII and Biological E. SII officials have said the raw materials are needed for making the Novavax dose and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield in India).SII chief executive Adar Poonawalla told CNBC-TV18 on Wednesday that Covishield production is not likely to be hit, but its Novavax production is likely to be hampered.SII currently manufactures about 170 million doses of both vaccines a month and reports have suggested that production could be hit if the US curbs continue for a few more weeks. Besides scaling up production to meet India’s needs, SII and Biological E are expected to face problems in meeting contracts signed with other countries.The Oxford vaccine, locally produced in India, is one of the two vaccines that are currently being administered in the country. The Novavax shot will be eligible to get clearance in India after approval from a major foreign country; it has not been authorised by the US, the UK, EU and Japan so far.Participating in an online discussion on Monday, Jaishankar referred to the matter indirectly when he said he was “pushing other countries, particularly some big countries, [to] please keep the raw materials flowing for vaccines to be made in India”. He also highlighted the crucial role of global supply chains in the manufacture of vaccines while responding to a question on criticism of India’s vaccine exports. “Can I, on one hand, go round the world and say, guys, keep your supply chain flowing towards me, and by the way... I am asking you for raw material but I am not going to give you the vaccine?” he asked.The raw materials affected by the US curbs include reagents, plastic tubing material, nano-filters and bioreactor bags, and the steps taken by the Biden administration ensure that American manufacturers get priority for these items.The people cited above said it is also not easy to switch to suppliers in other countries because all raw materials and equipment used in making vaccines have to be approved by regulators. “For instance, approvals granted earlier wouldn’t cover raw materials from a new supplier,” said one of the people.American sellers of the raw materials are obligated to meet the contractual requirements of American buyers before anyone else, including Indian buyers, who have told to expect delayed deliveries, according to people familiar with these discussions.Former president Donald Trump, too, had involved the 1950 law in August last year to scale up production of medical supplies.Now that the US has administered at least one dose to half its population and built up a sizable stockpile of vaccines, its raw material needs may be tapering off, which would allow American suppliers to resume deliveries.Asked about the bottleneck in raw material supplies, White House spokesperson Jen Psaki spoke about discussions at the WTO on Monday. “We are...working with WTO members on a global response to Covid. That includes a number of components, whether it’s $4 billion committed to COVAX, or discussions about how we can aid and assist countries that need help the most,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-urges-us-to-lift-ban-on-export-of-key-products-101619039449573.html

We are committed to maintaining peace and stability in the border areas and we are firmly determined to safeguard our territorial sovereignty and security,” he said.“Recently the two sides have maintained communications through diplomatic and military channels. On the basis of disengagement in the Galwan Valley and the Pangong Tso regions, the two sides exchanged in depth and in a candid manner, opinions on resolving the remaining issue in the Western section of the boundary,” he added.“We hope India will meet China half-way and will focus on the bigger picture of long term development of bilateral relations, put the boundary at an appropriate position and work to bring relations back to the track of steady and sound development,” Wang said.India, he said, should take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border and work to bring bilateral relations back on the tracks of sound and steady development.“We hope that the Indian side will abide by two militaries agreements and two sides consensus and take concrete measures to safeguard peace and tranquility along the border,” he said.India and China have held multiple rounds of diplomatic and military dialogues to resolve the ongoing tension at the border, the worst in decades, which saw soldiers dying on both sides for the first time since 1975.The latest meeting of senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held on April 9 ended without any forward movement on disengagement at other friction points such as Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, though the two sides agreed to maintain stability on the ground and avoid any new incidents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/put-border-dispute-at-appropriate-position-china-tells-india-101619033265569.html

And where it will be - we will determine that ourselves,” he added.Putin also denounced Western silence on Belarus strongman Alexander Lukashenko’s claim that his security services had thwarted an alleged US plot to assassinate him.“Everyone pretends that nothing is happening at all,” Putin said in his address, referring to the West.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dont-cross-the-red-line-with-russia-putin-s-stern-message-to-the-west-101619030112512.html
22-04-2021||World||WSJ: US may ease sanctions on Iran||The US government has made it known that it is exploring the idea of lifting some of the economic sanctions imposed on Iran while nuclear talks between the two countries are underway, according to a Wall Street Journal report.The reported development is an important milestone in the ongoing negotiations between the two countries, whose officials have been indirectly holding discussions in Vienna.Talks are taking place as part of an international push to bring the US back into the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal while also persuading Tehran to scale back its ambitious nuclear programme.European parties to the Iran deal have said they have seen progress in the first two rounds of negotiations to revive the 2015 accord, but cautioned that there were still major hurdles to overcome. The negotiations will pick up again next week.Iran and world powers - Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - have been meeting in Vienna since early April to hammer out steps that must be taken, touching on US sanctions and Tehran’s breaches of the deal’s limits on its uranium enrichment capacity.A US delegation is in a separate location in Vienna, enabling the powers to shuttle between both sides.“We welcome the constructive discussions that have taken place in Vienna, and the positive participation by all sides so far,” diplomats from France, Britain and Germany, known as the E3, told reporters. “We have made some progress but there is still a way to go.” Under the accord, Iran agreed to curb its nuclear work in return for the lifting of US-backed sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wsj-us-may-ease-sanctions-on-iran-101619029717869.html
