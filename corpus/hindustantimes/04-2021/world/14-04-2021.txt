He said Floyd's heart disease included high blood pressure and narrowing of the arteries.“All of those combined to cause Mr. Floyd’s death,” he said on the second day of the defense case.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson is trying to prove that the 19-year Minneapolis police veteran did what he was trained to do and that Floyd died because of his illegal drug use and underlying health problems.Prosecutors say Floyd died because Chauvin’s knee was pressed against Floyd’s neck or neck area for 9 1/2 minutes as the 46-year-old Black man lay pinned to the pavement on his stomach last May, his hands cuffed behind his back.Nelson asked Fowler about Floyd’s narrowed arteries, enlarged heart, use of methamphetamine, the stress of the situation he was in, his high blood pressure and other factors. Fowler said all of them could have caused Floyd’s heart to work harder and led it to suddenly stop.Previous witnesses have noted that a sudden heart rhythm problem does not necessarily produce visible signs on autopsy but can be inferred from circumstances such as a victim suddenly clutching one's chest and collapsing.Nelson questioned Fowler extensively about carbon monoxide, which displaces oxygen in the bloodstream of people who breathe it in. Fowler said it could have contributed to oxygen depletion in Floyd, noting that he was facing the tailpipe end of a vehicle. But there is no way to know for sure because, he acknowledged, Floyd's blood was never tested for carbon monoxide.Nelson similarly tried to introduce another possible explanation on Tuesday when he raised questions about excited delirium, or what a witness described as a potentially lethal condition that can include agitation, incoherent speech and extraordinary strength.Several top Minneapolis police officials, including the police chief, have testified that Chauvin used excessive force and violated his training. And a number of medical experts called by prosecutors have said Floyd died from a lack of oxygen because the way he was restrained restricted his breathing.Fowler said the prone position alone does not affect a person’s ability to breathe -- testimony that contradicts other witnesses who said the position Floyd was in, with his hands cuffed behind his back, was inherently dangerous.He also testified that Chauvin's knee was not applied with enough pressure to cause any bruises or scrapes on Floyd's neck or back. He further said that Chauvin’s knee on Floyd was “nowhere close to his airway,” and that Floyd's speaking and groaning showed that his airway was still open.And he said Floyd that did not complain of visual changes or other symptoms consistent with hypoxia, or insufficient oxygen to the brain, and that he was coherent until shortly before he suddenly stopped moving.“The bottom line is, moving air in and out, and speaking and making noise is very good evidence that the airway was not closed,” Fowler said.Fowler handled a case similar to Floyd’s in Maryland in 2018, when a 19-year-old Black man, Anton Black, died after three officers and a civilian pinned him for more than five minutes as they handcuffed him and shackled his legs.The family brought a federal lawsuit that included Fowler, whose autopsy found that the stress of the struggle probably contributed to Black’s death but found no evidence that restraint directly caused it. It also found no evidence of asphyxia.Chauvin, a 45-year-old white man, is on trial on charges of murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death after his arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market. The video of his slow-motion death as he gasped that he couldn't breathe touched off worldwide protests, violence and a furious examination of racism and policing in the US.The defense hasn’t said whether Chauvin will take the stand.Testifying could open him up to devastating cross-examination, with prosecutors replaying the video and forcing Chauvin, one freeze-frame moment at a time, to explain why he kept pressing down on Floyd.But taking the stand could also give the jury the opportunity to see and hear any remorse or sympathy Chauvin might feel. He would be able to take off the Covid-19 mask that he has to wear while seated at the defense table.The only time Chauvin has been heard publicly defending himself was when the jury listened to body-camera footage from the scene. After an ambulance had taken Floyd away, Chauvin told a bystander: “We gotta control this guy ’cause he’s a sizable guy ... and it looks like he’s probably on something.”Earlier Wednesday, Judge Peter Cahill turned down a defense request to acquit Chauvin, rejecting claims that prosecutors failed to prove Chauvin’s actions killed Floyd. Requests for an acquittal are routinely made midway through a trial and are usually denied.The defense began its case on Tuesday with Nelson going straight to the question at the center of the trial — whether Chauvin's actions were reasonable.Police officers are allowed certain latitude to use force. Legal experts say a key issue for the jury will be whether the officer's actions were reasonable in those specific circumstances.A use-of-force expert for the defense, Barry Brodd, testified Tuesday that Chauvin was justified in keeping Floyd pinned to the pavement, saying Floyd kept on struggling.Brodd, a former Santa Rosa, California, police officer, also said the bystanders yelling at police to get off Floyd complicated the situation for Chauvin and the others by causing them to wonder whether the crowd was becoming a threat, too.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expert-blames-george-floyd-s-death-on-heart-rhythm-problem-101618421806759.html

The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan respects the US decision and we will work with our US partners to ensure a smooth transition," Ghani tweeted."Afghanistan's proud security and defense forces are fully capable of defending its people and country, which they have been doing all along, and for which the Afghan nation will forever remain grateful."Biden officially announced Wednesday the unconditional withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, where they have spent two decades in a bloody, largely fruitless battle against the Taliban. Administration officials have said he wants the withdrawal completed by September 11, 2021.US intelligence warned this week that the government in Kabul "will struggle" to hold the "confident" Taliban off if the coalition withdraws.Many Afghans -- especially women, who have been largely shut out of peace talks between the insurgents and Kabul -- have long feared a return to the Taliban's repressive Islamist regime if the US withdraws.Analysts also fear a descent into civil war if Kabul is left to face the Taliban alone. The United Nations documented "extraordinary" violence against civilians in a new report Wednesday, and said "urgent" action was needed by all parties to stop the fighting.Dubbed the "forever war," the US military onslaught in Afghanistan began in response to the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks against the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/afghan-president-says-spoke-with-biden-about-us-forces-withdrawal-in-september-101618420602308.html

The charge carries a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.The announcement came a day after Potter resigned from the Brooklyn Center Police Department, where she had served for 26 years. Police Chief Tim Gannon also resigned Tuesday.Gannon had released Potter’s body camera video the day after the Sunday shooting. It showed her approaching Wright as he stood outside of his car as another officer was arresting him for an outstanding warrant. Police said he was pulled over for having expired registration tags.As Wright struggles with police, Potter is hearing shouting “I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” before firing a single shot from her handgun.Gannon has said he believed Potter mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. However, protesters and Wright’s family members say there’s no excuse for the shooting and it shows how the justice system is tilted against Blacks, noting Wright was stopped for expired car registration and ended up dead.The charging decision was announced as the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin progresses. George Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-cop-who-fatally-shot-black-motorist-to-be-charged-with-manslaughter-101618417846240.html
14-04-2021||World||Users could soon hide 'like' counts on Instagram, Facebook||The tiny red hearts that appear under Instagram photos of kids, kittens and sandwiches can be a source of stress for many users, an insidious way of measuring self worth and popularity.Now Facebook says it's going to test out — again — an option for users to hide those “like” counts to see if it can reduce the pressure of being on social media. Instagram, which Facebook owns, will soon allow a small group of random users to decide whether or not they want to see the number of likes their posts and those of others receive.The social media giant says it’s also exploring the feature for Facebook. Comments will still be available for people who chose to hide likes — they just won't see whether it was 2, 20 or 20,000 people who liked their posts.Instagram began hiding likes in 2019. While many users welcomed the feature, others, including some influencers, worried it might take away from the social media experience. At the time, the platform didn't give users a choice to hide or unhide the like counts.“Some people found this beneficial but some still wanted to see like counts so they could track what’s popular," the company said in a statement. In March of this year, a bug caused like counts to disappear for some Instagram uses for a couple of hours, prompting questions about whether the company would soon relaunch the feature.The company stressed that this is still a small test and that it expects “more to share" before long.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/users-could-soon-hide-like-counts-on-instagram-facebook-101618416486236.html

It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.Ahead of the arrival of the U.S. warships, the Russian navy on Wednesday began a drill in the Black Sea that rehearsed firing at surface and air targets. The drill came a day after NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg called on Moscow to end its troop build-up.In Ukraine, armed forces rehearsed repelling a tank and infantry attack near the border of Russian-annexed Crimea while its defence minister, Andrii Taran, told European parliamentarians in Brussels that Russia was preparing to potentially store nuclear weapons in Crimea.Taran provided no evidence for his assertion but said Russia was massing 110,000 troops on Ukraine's border in 56 battalion-sized tactical groups, citing Kyiv's latest intelligence.Clashes in eastern UkraineFighting has increased in recent weeks in eastern Ukraine, where government forces have battled Russian-backed separatists in a seven-year conflict that Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people.U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who held talks in Brussels with Stoltenberg ahead of a video conference of all 30 NATO allies, said the alliance would "address Russia's aggressive actions in and around Ukraine", without elaborating.Russia's relations with the United States slumped to a new post-Cold War low last month after U.S. President Joe Biden said he thought Vladimir Putin was a "killer".In a phone call with Putin on Tuesday, Biden proposed holding a summit between the estranged leaders to tackle a raft of issues, including reducing tensions over Ukraine.The Kremlin on Wednesday said it was too early to talk about such a summit in tangible terms and that holding such a meeting was contingent on Washington's future behaviour, in what looked like a thinly veiled reference to potential U.S. sanctions.Russia has regularly accused NATO of destabilising Europe by bolstering its troops in the Baltic countries and Poland - all members of the Atlantic alliance - in the wake of Moscow's annexation of Crimea.NATO has denied a claim by Russian Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that the alliance was deploying 40,000 troops and 15,000 pieces of military equipment near Russia's borders, mainly in the Black Sea and the Baltic regions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-ukraine-hold-military-drills-nato-criticises-russian-troop-buildup-101618416471317.html
14-04-2021||World||British PM Boris Johnson reduces duration of India visit over Covid-19 crisis||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India this month will be shorter than the originally planned trip of four to five days and won’t include stopovers in Mumbai and Pune because of the Covid-19 situation, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. Johnson is expected to begin the visit on April 26 and the itinerary will only include stopovers in cities such as New Delhi and Bengaluru that are linked to key meetings or important announcements and signing of memorandums of understanding (MoUs), the people said on condition of anonymity. Though both countries have confirmed Johnson’s visit in April, neither side has formally announced the dates or his itinerary. The visit has been described as part of the UK government’s tilt towards the Indo-Pacific under a comprehensive revamp of foreign and security policies in order to unlock new opportunities across the region. “The trip will be shorter and more business-oriented and involve fewer cities. The cities in the itinerary will be linked to key meetings and announcements and MoUs,” said one of the people cited above. The events will be a mix of in-person meetings, such as Johnson’s talks with his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, and virtual meetings, the people said. Some events linked to the visit will be fully digital affairs, they added. An unnamed spokesperson for Johnson was cited by Reuters as saying on Wednesday that the prime minister had reduced the length of his trip to India because of the Covid-19 situation in the country. The spokesperson added Johnson would meet Modi. “We’ve been in close contact with the Indian government about the PM’s upcoming visit in light of the Covid situation in India. As a result of these discussions the prime minister has made the decision to reduce the length of the visit,” the spokesperson told reporters. “This programme will be focused on high level discussions with the Indian government and Indian business leaders,” the spokesperson said, adding the bulk of the programme will take place on April 26. It was earlier expected that Johnson’s visit would last four to five days and include stopovers in New Delhi, Mumbai, Pune, Bengaluru and Chennai. This is the second time a planned visit to India by Johnson has been hit by the Covid-19 crisis. In January, Johnson was scheduled to be the chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations but called off the visit to remain in Britain to focus on his government’s response to a new Coronavirus variant that had spread rapidly. The UK subsequently announced Johnson would travel to India at the end of April when it unveiled an integrated review of defence, development and foreign policy in March. Modi is expected to attend the G7 Summit, which will be held in Cornwall during June 11-13, as a special guest of Johnson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-reduces-duration-of-india-visit-over-covid-19-crisis-101618415392712.html

According to a South China Morning Post report, the convicted man, identified by his surname Huang, abducted and murdered a stranger to cremate him in place of another deceased to circumvent burial regulations.Burial is prohibited in many parts of China, including Shanwei city of Guangdong province where the incident took place. In 2017, a wealthy family hired Huang to provide them with a substitute body for cremation as they wanted a traditional burial for the deceased family member who died from cancer, as per court documents cited in media reports.The family assumed that Huang would look for another dead body but he killed someone to fulfil the deal. The convict spotted a man, Lin Shaoren, with Down’ syndrome, picking litter from the street and convinced him to get into a car. He then gave alcohol to the victim and put him into a coffin after he passed out, Huang told the court.Days later, Huang passed on the coffin to the family in exchange for 107,000 yuan ($16,300), of which 17,000 yuan went to a middleman who has since passed away. The family cremated the coffin pretending it to be their own dead relative and buried the relative’s actual body secretly in a traditional manner, per reports.The victim was listed as a missing person and it took two years for the police to uncover the crime and track down the suspect using surveillance footage. Huang was given a suspended death sentence in September 2020 and it was upheld by the Guangdong Higher People's Court in December 2020. The case gained public attention last week after local media did a feature on the victim’s family.Local authorities in China have been pushing for cremations to save land and discourage extravagant burial ceremonies. But traditional burial remains popular and the case reveals the lengths some families go to get around the ban. Citing data from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, SCMP reported that only about 52 per cent of those who died in 2019 were cremated that year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-man-killed-stranger-with-down-syndrome-to-sell-his-body-for-cremation-101618411802024.html

The White House released the excerpts before the afternoon address when he intends to detail his timeline for a U.S. troop withdrawal.His plan is to pull out all the American forces — numbering 2,500 now — by this Sept. 11, according to U.S. officials, marking the 20th anniversary of the deadliest terrorist attacks against America, which were coordinated from Afghanistan. The drawdown would begin by May 1, defying the deadline for full withdrawal under a peace agreement the Trump administration reached with the Taliban last year.“We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result,” Biden says in the speech excerpts. “I am now the fourth American president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans. Two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility to a fifth.”While Biden’s decision keeps U.S. forces in Afghanistan four months longer than initially planned, it sets a firm end to two decades of war that killed more than 2,200 U.S. troops, wounded 20,000, and cost as much as $1 trillion.Biden says he consulted with allies, military leaders, lawmakers and Vice President Kamala Harris to help make his decision to withdraw all U.S. troops by Sept. 11, two decades after the deadliest attack on American soil.He is emphasizing that his administration will continue to support peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban and assist international efforts to train the Afghan military.“It is time to end America’s longest war,” Biden says. “It is time for American troops to come home.”He also is trying to make the case that it is time to pay more attention to greater geopolitical challenges. In the early part of his presidency, Biden has spotlighted the growing economic competition with China and malign actions by Russia targeting the United States.“Rather than return to war with the Taliban, we have to focus on the challenges that will determine our standing and reach today and into the years to come,” Biden says, according to the excerpts.After his speech, Biden intends to visit Section 60 of Arlington National Cemetery to honor the sacrifice of those who died in recent American conflicts.A senior administration official said the September withdrawal date was an absolute deadline that won't be affected by security conditions in Afghanistan.The conflict largely crippled al-Qaida and led to the death of Osama bin Laden, the architect of the Sept. 11 attacks. But an American withdrawal also risks many of the gains made in democracy, women's rights and governance, while ensuring that the Taliban, who provided al-Qaida's haven, remain strong and in control of large swaths of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/time-to-end-america-s-longest-war-biden-on-afghanistan-101618414324213.html
14-04-2021||World||EU to get 50 million Pfizer doses early as Denmark scraps AstraZeneca||The EU said Wednesday it would get 50 million Pfizer vaccine doses earlier than expected, as rival drugmaker AstraZeneca faced a fresh setback after Denmark banned its use over blood clot links.The news comes after Johnson & Johnson said it would delay its European rollout, a major hit for the continent's beleaguered immunisation campaign as several countries battle rising caseloads.The vaccine setbacks threaten to dampen hopes that immunisations will allow countries to emerge from the pandemic that has now killed close to three million people and ravaged the global economy.But it was not all bad news in Europe, which will soon receive 50 million doses of the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine initially expected at the end of this year.The doses will now be delivered in the second quarter of this year, and will start arriving as soon as this month.EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said "there are still many factors that can disrupt the planned delivery schedules of vaccines", referring to the J&J delay."It is therefore important to act swiftly, anticipate and adjust whenever it is possible."More than 820 million doses of vaccine have now been administered globally, but with demand far outstripping supply, countries are scrambling to secure much-needed jabs.The race to secure vaccines has sparked diplomatic rows, notably between the European Union and the UK after the bloc accused London of hoarding jabs.But Australia has also accused the EU of falling short on promised jabs. Canberra's trade minister will travel to Europe this week for talks with his counterparts in Germany, France and Brussels about vaccine exports.- 'Third wave is upon us' - Johnson & Johnson said it would put off its European deliveries over reports of rare blood clots among people who had received the shot.US health regulators also recommended pausing its use after six reported cases of clots -- among more than 6.8 million J&J doses administered in the US.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said Wednesday it would make a recommendation on the safety of the J&J jab next week after evaluating clot links.AstraZeneca has faced similar setbacks, with many countries now limiting its use to older people following isolated cases blood clots among younger populations, some fatal.Denmark said Wednesday it would stop using it altogether -- a European first -- despite assurances from the EMA and the World Health Organization that side effects far outweigh possible risks.The melee over vaccines comes as several countries, from Germany to India to Turkey, battle a worrying spike in cases.In some places, it is no longer just the elderly who are crowding into overrun hospitals.German doctors said they are treating an increasing number of young people as new variants sweep the country."The third wave is clearly upon us," said Thomas Marx, the medical director at the Bavarian hospital in Freising.Most Covid patients are now between 40 and 60, and are badly hit by the virus, he told AFP."They often have to be intubated and then face a long fight with the virus."- River Ganges infections - In India more than 1,000 people tested positive for the virus after bathing in the River Ganges for the world's biggest religious festival.A huge crowd of worshippers packed the river's banks to take a dip in the waters as part of a bathing ritual -- despite soaring virus cases in the country."Our faith is the biggest thing for us. It is because of that strong belief that so many people have come here to take a dip in Ganga," Siddharth Chakrapani, a member of one of the Kumbh Mela organising committees, told AFP."They believe that Maa (mother) Ganga will save them from this pandemic."In Turkey officials imposed new restrictions including a tougher overnight curfew, while in Bangladesh police patrolled the capital as a strict nationwide lockdown was rolled out.Europe passed a million Covid deaths this week, with many countries from France to Italy and Spain still facing some form of virus restrictions after the continent's sputtering vaccine rollout.But in Belgium, cafes and restaurants got the greenlight to open their terraces from May 8 after a slight easing of cases there. Swiss officials also announced that bars and restaurants and some leisure facilities could reopen next Monday.In Japan, a spike in Covid cases forced a section of the Tokyo Olympics torch relay to be pulled from public roads, fuelling fears about whether the postponed Games should go ahead with just 100 days to go before the scheduled opening.International Olympic Committee vice president John Coates said Wednesday cancellation is "certainly not" on the table."The Tokyo Games will be the light at the end of the tunnel," he told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-to-get-50-million-pfizer-doses-early-as-denmark-scraps-astrazeneca-101618412505344.html
14-04-2021||World||Russian President Vladimir Putin gets 2nd dose of Covid-19 vaccine||Russian President Vladimir Putin said Wednesday he got his second Covid-19 vaccine shot, three weeks after getting the first dose.The Russian leader announced getting the jab, which was kept out of the public eye, at a session of the Russian Geographical Society, in which he took part via video link.“Right now, before entering this hall, I have also gotten the second jab. I hope everything will be fine. I don't even hope as much as I'm sure of it,” Putin said.The president told reporters after the event that he didn't experience any adverse effects after the second shot. “As you see, everything is normal, no side effects,” Putin said, adding that doctors told him he developed "a good immune response" after the first shot.Putin got his first coronavirus shot on March 23, also out of sight of the cameras, and the Kremlin wouldn't reveal which of the three vaccines currently approved for use in Russia the president has taken.The Russian leader's vaccination comes several months after widespread immunization against Covid-19 started in Russia — a delay that puzzled many, with some critics arguing that it was contributing to the already existing public hesitancy about the vaccine.Russian authorities have given regulatory approval to three domestically developed shots — Sputnik V, EpiVacCorona and CoviVac. All three received authorization before completing advanced trials experts say are necessary to ensure their safety and effectiveness in line with established scientific protocol.However, a study published in February in the British medical journal the Lancet showed that Sputnik V is 91% effective and appears to prevent inoculated individuals from becoming severely ill with Covid-19, although it's still unclear whether the vaccine can prevent the spread of the disease. No data on efficacy of the two other vaccines have been released.Russia has been actively marketing Sputnik V abroad, despite the comparatively slow rollout at home and limited production capacities. Dozens of countries have approved the use of Sputnik V, and many signed deals with the Russian Direct Investment Fund that bankrolled the vaccine to get shipments of the shot.A February poll by Russia's top independent pollster, Levada Center, showed that 62% of Russians were reluctant to get vaccinated with Sputnik V.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-president-vladimir-putin-gets-2nd-dose-of-covid-19-vaccine-101618411556582.html

14-04-2021||World||Facebook, Starbucks, other US companies unite for voting rights||Hundreds of U.S. corporations and executives signed on to a new statement calling for a defense of Americans’ voting rights, the latest united backlash against state initiatives that could restrict voters’ access to the polls.In a full page advertisement that ran Wednesday in the New York Times, the signatories called for “all Americans to join us in taking a nonpartisan stand for this most basic and fundamental right.”“We all should feel a responsibility to defend the right to vote and to oppose any discriminatory legislation or measures that restrict or prevent any eligible voter from having an equal and fair opportunity to cast a ballot,” the statement read.The letter stopped short of specific actions, such as halting donations to candidates that support restrictions on voter access or pausing investments in states that act upon such proposals.Signatories span big tech companies like Facebook Inc., consumer companies including Starbucks Corp. and Target Corp., and financial firms, among others. Michael Bloomberg, founder and majority owner of Bloomberg News parent company Bloomberg LP, also signed as an individual.The push by Corporate America comes as a number of state legislatures move to limit voting access, with some curbs already passed. A new law in Georgia last month requires voters to provide a state-issued identification card when requesting an absentee ballot and limits drop boxes, among other restrictions, with Texas, Arizona and Florida discussing their own restrictions.“The freedom to vote is a huge priority for the public, consumers and employees,” Mike Ward, co-founder of the Civic Alliance, which assisted in the initiative, said in an interview. “Businesses are leading because they have their fingers on pulse of their key stakeholders and they know that the freedom to vote and health of democracy is a top priority.”The statement shows the movement is gaining traction. It was Black CEOs who originally condemned restrictions and began to push for action, including Kenneth Chenault, the former chief at American Express Co., and Kenneth Frazier, the CEO of Merck & Co. Wednesday’s statement also includes nonprofits, foundations, law firms and celebrities, from Leo DiCaprio to Larry David.Critics of the new voting restrictions say the changes are aimed chiefly at limiting participation of Americans of color. And while in the past, many companies tried to stay out of political disputes for fear of drawing a partisan backlash, customers are increasingly demanding their favorite brands take a stance on issues that matter to them, from sustainability to inclusion.“There is a budding realization from business leaders: Society expects more from them. They cannot do and will not do business as usual,” Meredith Sumpter, CEO of the Council for Inclusive Capitalism, said in an interview. “They are exploring a new frontier of leadership as CEOs in a very divided America."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-starbucks-other-us-companies-unite-for-voting-rights-101618403933233.html

It listed the risk of blood clots, hemorrhaging and a low number of blood platelets.Given that the pandemic has been kept reasonably well in check in Denmark, the authority said it was deemed acceptable to take Astra out of the country’s vaccine program, which it estimates will delay overall immunization by about three weeks.Denmark was one of the first countries to suspend the vaccine on March 11 after reports of blood clots. At the time, the Danish Health Authority called the decision a precautionary move and reiterated its view that Astra’s vaccine was “effective and safe.”Both European and British drug regulators have said they found a link between Astra’s vaccine and blood clots, but said benefits still outweigh the risks. Most Western European countries have limited their use of the company’s vaccine to the elderly, while in Eastern Europe, Astra has largely been reinstated with no limitations.Denmark’s Scandinavian neighbor, Norway, which has also kept Astra on hold since last month, is due to announce its decision on Thursday.Danish authorities said that people who have already received a first Astra shot will be offered their second jab from another producer, such as Pfizer Inc./BioNTech SE or Moderna Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/denmark-becomes-first-in-eu-to-drop-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101618403545249.html
14-04-2021||World||AstraZeneca, J&J blood clot scare: What do we know about treatment, causal link with Covid-19 shots||The United States has paused the use of Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after six recipients experienced a rare and severe type of blood clot. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Tuesday said that the vaccinated individuals experienced cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST) along with low levels of blood platelets.This comes a week after the United Kingdom suspended the use of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine for adults under 30s over similar concerns. A scientific review by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) concluded that the evidence of a link between the events of blood clots and AstraZeneca’s vaccine was stronger but more work is still needed.“No effective medicine or vaccine is without risk. We continually monitor safety during widespread use of any vaccine. This is to ensure vaccines are performing as expected, to identify any new side effects that may arise, and to ensure the benefits continue to outweigh the risks,” Dr June Raine, MHRA chief executive, said at a briefing.One common link between the vaccines developed by AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson is that both are built with adenoviruses, a replication-deficient chimpanzee viral vector based on a weakened version of a common cold virus. Two teams of researchers have speculated about a possible mechanism behind the casual link in their papers published in the New England Journal of Medicine.Both teams suggest that the development of serious blood clots along with falling levels of blood platelets is an immune response that resembles a rare reaction, called heparin induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), to the drug heparin, an anticoagulant. The first research paper described 11 blood clot cases in Austria and Germany, of which nine of them women, with a median age of 36 years.All 11 patients tested positive for antibodies against platelet factor 4 (PF4), which are also triggered by heparin induced thrombocytopenia. However, none of the patients had received heparin before their symptoms. “Whether these antibodies are autoantibodies against PF4 induced by the strong inflammatory stimulus of vaccination or antibodies induced by the vaccine that cross-react with PF4 and platelets requires further study,” the researchers wrote.Also Read | AstraZeneca Covid shot: Are blood clot events more common in women recipients?In the second study, researchers in Norway described a similar pattern in five healthcare workers after receiving the first dose of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine. Four of the patients had a major cerebral haemorrhage and three died. All of them had high levels of PF4 antibodies with no previous exposure to heparin.Both sets of researchers have suggested treatment with intravenous immune globulin and non-heparin blood thinners. The National Health Service (NHS) of the UK has also authorised the use of intravenous immunoglobulin, which is in short supply according to UK media reports, to treat such cases.However, Peter English, former editor of Vaccines in Practice, said that these papers do not tackle causality since the small sample size do not have the statistical power to prove causality.“They may turn out to be useful...for clinicians treating patients with clotting disorders, and for regulators and others in deciding the safest way to proceed once causality has been confirmed—if it ever is,” The BMJ, a weekly peer-reviewed medical trade journal, quoted English as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-j-j-blood-clot-scare-what-do-we-know-about-causal-link-treatment-101618402177279.html

14-04-2021||World||US Prez Joe Biden rushes to protect the power grid as hacking threats grow||A White House plan to rapidly shore up the security of the US power grid will begin with a 100-day sprint, but take years more to transform utilities’ ability to fight off hackers, according to details of a draft version of the plan confirmed by two people.The plan is the policy equivalent of a high-wire act: it provides incentives for electric companies to dramatically change the way they protect themselves against cyber-attacks while trying to avoid political tripwires that have stalled previous efforts, the details suggest.Among its core tenets, the Biden administration’s so-called “action plan” will incentivize power utilities to install sophisticated new monitoring equipment to more quickly detect hackers, and to share that information widely with the US government.It will ask utilities to identify critical sites which, if attacked, could have an outsized impact across the grid, according to a six-page draft of the plan, which was drawn up by the National Security Council and described in detail to Bloomberg News. And it will expand a partially classified Energy Department program to identify flaws in grid components that could be exploited by the country’s cyber-adversaries, including Russia, Iran and China.The plan marks the first step in a broad push to protect utilities from cyber-attacks that could leave millions without power, water or gas. A final version of the plan could be released as soon as this week, according to a person familiar with the timing.“It makes sense in a plan like this to start with grid operations,” said Christopher Painter, who was the highest ranking cyber official in the State Department during the Obama administration.“Everything goes down if you don’t have power: the financial sector, refineries, water. The grid underlies the rest of the country’s critical infrastructure,” Painter, now with the Global Commission on the Stability of Cyberspace, added.Experts say initiatives to enhance the security of the US electrical grid are years behind better-known efforts to improve the security of data centers and corporate computer systems. At the same time, hackers from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are launching increasingly aggressive attacks on US power companies, hoping to pre-position malware that could leave US cities and towns in the dark.The recent weather-related outages in Texas, while not the result of a cyber-attack, were a stark demonstration of the potential for devastation. People froze in their homes, struggled to access drinkable water and lost communications because their mobile phones couldn’t charge as grid operators struggled for days to restore power.Read more: Biden to Tap Former NSA Officials to Top Cybersecurity RolesThe White House plan lays out the need for a broad effort to secure the highly specialized computers used not just by electric companies, but also municipal water utilities, gas pipeline operators and others.Two people familiar with the administration’s thinking said power companies were chosen to begin with because they already have a strong record of working with the US government on security threats. While private companies are usually loath to share computer network data widely with the government, some power companies already do so as part of existing pilot programs, one of the people said.Participation IncentivesThe White House plan, which is voluntary, lays out a series of possible incentives to get power companies to sign on, a less politically precarious route than mandating their participation through regulation.Smaller utilities such as rural co-ops may get government funding to cover the cost of new security equipment and software, for example. The government will explore whether participation could be covered under the Safety Act, which provides liability protection for anti-terrorism products and services, according to the plan -- although it’s far from clear that services provided by an electric utility would qualify.Many of the details around budgets and incentives will be worked out later, through a process coordinated by the National Security Council and others, according to the draft.Utilities’ decisions to participate will hinge on how those details eventually get resolved, cybersecurity experts said. For example, the plan addresses long-standing concerns over sharing details about cyber-attacks automatically with the government by prohibiting “sensitive data” from being collected or stored outside the utilities.But the plan doesn’t yet define what counts as sensitive data, and it makes clear that any data collected must be widely sharable across the federal government.The plan will also expand the role of an Energy Department program that scans grid equipment for flaws or hidden components that hackers could use to attack utilities. Aspects of that program, known as CyTRICS, are classified because they involve efforts by foreign intelligence agencies to intentionally weaken grid technology, according to a person familiar with it. (CyTRICS stands for Cyber Testing for Resilient Industrial Control Systems.)While utilities have supported similar efforts in the past, the creation of an approved vendor list could increase costs for equipment manufacturers that would be required to make their products more secure -- a proposal likley to draw resistence from US and foreign manufacturers, one person familiar with the industry said.Turf WarsIn order to succeed, the plan will have to overcome challenges that have derailed earlier efforts, including interagency turf wars and questions over how much of a role U.S. intelligence agencies should have in protecting the country’s critical infrastructure.The power sector effort will be led by the Energy Department rather than the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, or CISA, part of the Department of Homeland Security, according to the summary.That could raise concerns about CISA losing its existing authorities and possibly ceding the program entirely to the Energy Department, according to current and former DHS officials, as well as an aide on the House Homeland Security Committee. That panel approved a bipartisan bill in March to solidify CISA’s lead role in protecting the country’s industrial control systems (H.R. 1833).“The risk you take in not having CISA do everything is that information doesn’t get where it needs to be,” according to Suzanne Spaulding, who led CISA’s predecessor, the National Protection and Programs Directorate, under the Obama administration and now works at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.As the White House plan was quietly circulated to officials recently, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas reiterated what he believed was CISA’s primary role in a policy speech in late March.After lauding the administration’s cybersecurity plans, he added, “As some have said, the government needs a quarterback on its cybersecurity team. CISA is that quarterback.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-rushes-to-protect-the-power-grid-as-hacking-threats-grow-101618396014349.html

A senior NATO diplomat told Reuters that no ally was expected to oppose U.S. President Joe Biden's formal announcement, expected later on Wednesday, for a complete U.S. withdrawal of troops by Sept. 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-forces-will-leave-together-from-afghanistan-says-blinken-101618393801140.html
14-04-2021||World||TikTok founder's $60 billion fortune lands him among world's richest people||Just last year, the world’s most valuable startup, ByteDance Ltd., was being squeezed from all sides.The Trump administration wanted the Chinese firm, which owns the ubiquitous TikTok video-sharing platform, to get rid of assets. Beijing was cracking down on tech businesses, and India blacklisted some of its social-media apps.For all the obstacles, ByteDance kept growing. Now its founder, 38-year-old Zhang Yiming, is among the world’s richest people -- a distinction that lately has carried increased risks in China.Shares of the company trade in the private market at a valuation of more than $250 billion, people familiar with the dealings have said. At that level, Zhang, who owns about a quarter of ByteDance, could be worth more than $60 billion, placing him alongside Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s Pony Ma, bottled-water king Zhong Shanshan and members of the Walton and Koch families in the US, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.ByteDance, famous for its short-video apps and news aggregator Toutiao, more than doubled revenue last year after expanding beyond its core advertising business into areas such as e-commerce and online gaming. It’s now weighing options for the initial public offering of some businesses.“Zhang is someone who’s known for thinking long-term and not easily dissuaded by short-term setbacks,” said Ma Rui, partner at venture-capital firm Synaptic Ventures. “He is set on building an enduring, global business.”Surging ValuationDuring its last fundraising round, ByteDance reached a $180 billion valuation, a person with knowledge of the matter said. That’s up from $20 billion about three years ago, according to CB Insights. But in the private market, some investors recently were asking for the equivalent of a $350 billion valuation to part with their shares, people familiar have said. The company’s value for private-equity investors is approaching $400 billion, the South China Morning Post reported. That would mean an even bigger fortune for Zhang.ByteDance representatives didn’t respond to requests for comment.It’s a tough time to be wealthy in China as the government seeks to rein in the country’s most powerful corporations and their billionaire founders. Just ask Jack Ma: After opening an antitrust probe, regulators fined Alibaba a record $2.8 billion and the central bank ordered an overhaul of his Ant Group Co. fintech empire so it’d be supervised more like a bank. On Tuesday, China ordered 34 internet companies to rectify their anti-competitive practices in the coming month.While ByteDance hasn’t been singled out as a target, its dominance in social media and war chest for deal-making are sensitive areas the government is looking into.“There are no more silly games in the US with Trump and potential bans or forced asset sales,” said Kirk Boodry, founder of investment research firm Redex Holdings. “But the pressure on tech-share prices and China in particular might make $250 billion a tough sell,” he added, referring to ByteDance’s value in private transactions.Born in the southern Chinese city of Longyan, Zhang, the only son of civil servants, studied programming at Tianjin’s Nankai University, where he built a following on the school’s online forum by fixing classmates’ computers. He joined Microsoft Corp. for a brief stint after graduating, later calling the job so boring he often “worked half of the day and read books in the other half,” according to an interview with Chinese media. He went on to develop several ventures, including a real estate search portal.His breakthrough came in 2012, when working in a four-bedroom apartment in Beijing he created ByteDance’s first hit -- a joke-sharing app later shut down by censors. It then turned to news aggregation before winning over more than 1 billion global users with its short-video platforms TikTok and Chinese twin app, Douyin. In the process, it attracted big-name investors such as SoftBank Group Corp., Sequoia Capital and proprietary-trading firm Susquehanna International Group, making it a rarity among Chinese internet startups that usually get absorbed into the wider ecosystems of Tencent and Alibaba Group Holding Ltd.Novel ConceptOne of Zhang’s earliest supporters, Susquehanna has become ByteDance’s largest outside backer with a 15% stake, according to a Wall Street Journal story in October. The initial bet was made at the start of 2012, when ByteDance’s news app Toutiao was just a concept that Zhang had drawn up on napkins, according to a 2016 blog post by Joan Wang, who led that investment for Susquehanna’s Chinese venture-capital unit.With TikTok facing scrutiny in the US and India, Zhang has put more effort into ByteDance’s nascent and fast-growing Chinese businesses, which range from gaming to education to e-commerce. That helped it increase sales to about $35 billion last year and operating profit to $7 billion, a person familiar with the results said.Investors are eyeing the IPO of some of ByteDance’s businesses after Chinese competitor Kuaishou Technology raised $5.4 billion in February in the biggest internet listing since Uber Technologies Inc., with its market value now nearing $140 billion. Last month, ByteDance hired former Xiaomi Corp. executive Chew Shou Zi as its chief financial officer, filling a long vacant position that will be crucial for its eventual market offering.But for Zhang, it’s not all about immediate payoffs. The affable founder is known for his business philosophy of “delaying satisfactions” as he puts the focus on long-term growth -- a message he stressed again during his spiel to employees at the company’s ninth anniversary celebration last month.“Keep an ordinary mind, that’s something that sounds easy but important to do,” he said. “Put in the plainest words, when hungry, eat, when tired, sleep.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tiktok-founder-s-60-billion-fortune-lands-him-among-world-s-richest-people-101618387083605.html
14-04-2021||World||Kremlin says will 'study' US proposal for Putin-Biden summit||The Kremlin said Wednesday it will consider US President Joe Biden's proposal to hold a meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin.In a phone call on Tuesday, Biden proposed that the two leaders hold a summit "in the near future" that would come at a time of heightened tensions between the former Cold War rivals."It is early to talk about this meeting in terms of specifics. This is a new proposal and it will be studied," Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.He added that there is still no set agenda for the summit, but said that "without a doubt bilateral ties are important" in areas of mutual interest.Tensions between Moscow and Washington have escalated in recent weeks, with Russia building up its troops on the border with Ukraine, where government forces have been fighting pro-Russian separatists since the annexation of Crimea in 2014.The United States and its allies have called on Moscow to withdraw its forces."We consider the concerns of anyone -- including the United States -- regarding the movement of our armed forces on Russian territory to be unfounded," Peskov said.The Kremlin has repeatedly denied its involvement in the long-simmering conflict and rejected claims that it props up the separatist forces.Ties were already strained after Washington demanded the release of jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny and slapped sanctions on Moscow over his poisoning in August last year.Peskov, however, said that Navalny was not discussed in the Putin-Biden call.A Kremlin statement on Tuesday said that the two leaders discussed Ukraine as well as the Iranian nuclear programme, Afghanistan peace talks and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-says-will-study-us-proposal-for-putin-biden-summit-101618393233674.html
14-04-2021||World||Egypt seizes Suez ship ‘Ever Given’ pending $900 million compensation||Egypt seized a giant container vessel that blocked the Suez Canal last month as talks continued over the more than $900 million in compensation sought by authorities.A court in the city of Ismailia granted a seizure request regarding the Ever Given vessel at the behest of the Suez Canal Authority, state-run Ahram Gate reported Tuesday on its website.Egypt’s move underscores the legal complications following the container vessel’s grounding on March 23, which closed the canal for almost a week and roiled shipping markets. Logjams are expected to continue in the coming weeks at major ports such as Singapore and Rotterdam because of disruptions to schedules, according to supply-chain data provider project44.The Suez Canal Authority’s chief executive officer, Osama Rabie, told an Egyptian TV channel late Tuesday that negotiations with the ship’s owners and insurers were taking longer than anticipated, especially given the vessel and its containers were undamaged.The ship’s insurer for third-party losses, the U.K. P&I Club, said in a statement on Tuesday that the Ever Given’s owner -- Japan-based Shoei Kisen Kaisha Ltd. -- received a claim for $916 million.“Despite the magnitude of the claim which was largely unsupported, the owners and their insurers have been negotiating in good faith with the SCA,” the statement said. “On 12 April, a carefully considered and generous offer was made to the SCA to settle their claim. We are disappointed by the SCA’s subsequent decision to arrest the vessel today.”The U.K. P&I Club also said it was “disappointed at comments by the SCA that the ship will be held in Egypt until compensation is paid, and that her crew will be unable to leave the vessel during this time.”Loss of FeesThe SCA has said compensation is needed to cover losses of transit fees, damage to the waterway during the dredging and salvage efforts, and the cost of equipment and labor. It has calculated that it missed out on about $15 million of transit fees each day.The U.K. P&I Club said the claim included a $300 million salvage bonus and another $300 million for loss of reputation.“The claim presented by the SCA also does not include the professional salvor’s claim for their salvage services which owners and their hull underwriters expect to receive separately,” the U.K. P&I Club said. “The grounding resulted in no pollution and no reported injuries. The vessel was re-floated after six days and the Suez Canal promptly resumed their commercial operations.”Negotiations will continue, it said. The SCA didn’t respond to requests for comment.The SCA’S CEO, speaking to Egypt’s Mehwar TV channel, said the owners and insurers “didn’t say when or what they’ll pay” and hadn’t mentioned specific figures.“We sent them a figure, they said we want a breakdown,” Rabie said. “We sent the breakdown, they said we want a detailed one. We sent them a detailed breakdown, but so far nothing.”Rabie stressed again that seizing the Ever Given is a legal procedure that would be lifted as soon as there’s payment.A spokesman for Shoei Kisen Kaisha declined to comment on compensation while discussions with the SCA are underway. The company said the crew is still on board the ship, which is now in the Great Bitter Lake, about halfway along the canal.The charterer, Taiwan’s Evergreen Marine Corp., said in an email it hadn’t received any information from the ship’s owner about a court order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypt-seizes-suez-ship-ever-given-pending-900-million-compensation-101618393228237.html

He added that Kerry is visiting at the invitation of Ministry of Ecology and Environment. The environmental ministry said in a statement that the two will discuss China-US climate cooperation, this year’s UN Climate Change Conference and other issues.The meetings come after a rocky encounter between top US and Chinese foreign policy officials in Alaska last month that had the two sides trading insults and lectures. It may be a sign that despite significant differences between the world’s two biggest emitters on trade and foreign policy issues, they will be able to find common ground in the battle against climate change.The US is seeking to regain its position as a global climate leader after former president Donald Trump implemented pro-fossil fuel policies and turned away from efforts to limit US greenhouse-gas production. Kerry, an ex-secretary of state, has been criss-crossing the globe to encourage other nations to step up their efforts, and the US is considering a pledge to cut its greenhouse-gas emissions by 50% or more by the end of the decade.Biden has invited 40 world leaders to the climate summit, representing 17 of the biggest economies as well as smaller nations that will be among the first to feel the catastrophic impact of climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-john-kerry-s-visit-to-china-on-climate-will-be-first-by-biden-team-101618392728803.html

But a source revealed that the 'Suits' alum wanted to "support" Harry at the funeral following the couple's bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey.A source close to the Duchess of Sussex told E! News that Meghan would have attended Prince Philip's funeral were she not too far along in her pregnancy.The source said, "Meghan wishes she could have flown to the U.K. to support her husband but has been advised not to due to her pregnancy.""She would have put all the family tension aside to be there with Harry," the insider continued, before adding that the couple "are still not on amazing terms with the family."But Harry's trip to the UK comes at an opportune time, according to the source, as it's allowed him and Prince William to continue "working on their relationship" after an apparent fallout.The insider further said, "Harry wants to make sure Meghan and the baby are healthy and not involved in stressful situations," such as the very public funeral of Queen Elizabeth II's husband.Though Meghan and Harry want to make amends with the royal family, the insider said, "They have been focused on their new roots in Montecito and the pregnancy," which comes after the Duchess of Sussex suffered a miscarriage last July.This week saw Harry's return to his home country and their marital home at Frogmore Cottage, where the Prince is quarantining ahead of the Duke's funeral.Due to the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic, only 30 people are allowed to attend Prince Philip's funeral services at St. George's Chapel on the grounds of Windsor Castle this Saturday. A Buckingham Palace spokesperson said Philip's family members, including his children and grandchildren, are expected to be in attendance.Though many people will miss the Duke of Edinburgh, none are as mournful as the Queen, according to Prince Andrew. Last weekend, the royal told reporters that his mother is "feeling it probably more than everybody else."Prince Andrew shared, "She's contemplating, is the way I would put it. She described it as having left a huge void in her life, but we, the family, the ones that are closer, are rallying around to make sure we are there to support her."Buckingham Palace had announced on Friday that Philip, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, died "peacefully" at Windsor Castle at the age of 99.Philip became the queen's consort, or official companion, after her father, King George VI, suddenly passed in 1952. He was the longest-serving British consort over his 73-year marriage to the queen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/meghan-markle-wanted-to-support-harry-at-prince-philip-s-funeral-report-101618391434069.html

This would also create resilience within the system in the event of a shortfall in availability of any of the vaccines in use," he said.Six new arms of the trial will each recruit 175 candidates, adding a further 1,050 volunteers into the programme and the research will take place across eight sites in the UK.Researchers will be looking for adverse reactions and the immune system responses to these new combinations of vaccines. The trial is not designed to show if the vaccines are effective at preventing disease and the University of Oxford has said the intent of the study is to show that mixing is not substantially worse than not mixing.The Com-Cov study remit reads: “The purpose of this trial is to see how well people’s immune systems respond when their second ‘boost’ dose is a different type of vaccine to their first “prime” dose.“We will also be looking at how common vaccine reactions, such as fever, are after such ‘mixed’ schedules. This is important, as being able to use different vaccines in this way creates a more flexible immunisation programme; potentially allowing more people to be immunised more quickly.”The researchers said they are enrolling people from all ethnicities and would particularly welcome participants from ethnic minority communities, considered among the higher-risk groups affected by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-expands-covid-19-mix-and-match-vaccine-trial-101618391174945.html

He stopped on his route to do a drug deal, before veering into the emergency lane of the freeway in Kew and ploughing his 19-tonne prime mover into officers and their stationary vehicles on April 22 last year, The Age newspaper reported.Constable Lynette Taylor, senior constable Kevin King and constables Glen Humphris and Josh Prestney died at the scene, The Guardian reported.Singh was jailed for 22 years, with a non-parole period of 18 year and six months, the report said.Justice Paul Coghlan said the crash had “shocked the public conscience” and described footage of the incident as chilling.“The grief of those close to the victims is profound and life-changing,” Coghlan told the court.“Such grief is heightened by the sudden and unnecessary nature of the deaths. We can only hope ... as time goes by, some amelioration of their suffering can come about.”He was "actively psychotic" as he claimed he had seen a witch before killing the officers in the crash.The officers had pulled over Porsche driver Richard Pusey for allegedly speeding at the time. Multiple CCTV cameras showed footage of Singh "repeatedly drifting" into the emergency lane of the freeway before the crash, 9news.com reported.Singh's reckless driving was observed by other motorists, with one witness saying: "He's going to...kill someone."Singh was an ice user who, investigators estimate, had rested only five of the 72 hours before the crash and spent much of those three days dealing and using drugs with associates when not driving, The Age reported.The heartbroken families of the four fallen police officers say "no amount of punishment" can ease the grief they feel over losing their loved ones, it said.Assistant Commissioner Glenn Weir said police would commemorate the anniversary in services next week and one later this year that would be open to the public given the “overwhelming” support shown to the force from the community.The tragedy, he said, was a reminder of the daily risks police faced performing their duties. “That’s not lost on us,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianorigin-truck-driver-jailed-for-22-years-for-killing-4-australian-police-101618390964042.html
14-04-2021||World||Biden says pause on Johnson & Johnson shots shows govt putting safety 1st||President Joe Biden's Covid-19 vaccination campaign hit a snag when federal regulators recommended a “pause” in administering Johnson & Johnson shots.But the White House portrayed the action as important validation of his measured approach throughout the rollout.Biden declared Tuesday that even with a temporary loss of J&J's one-shot vaccine, there is a huge supply of Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, enough that "is basically 100 per cent unquestionable, for every single, solitary American.”Perhaps more concerning than any worry about supply, however, is the potential blow to public confidence in all of the vaccines, as polls suggest potentially tens of millions of Americans are hesitant to get the shots that public health experts say are necessary for the nation to emerge from the pandemic.The pause actually should have the opposite effect, boosting confidence that the government is putting safety first, Biden and top health officials said at a White House briefing.The advisory by the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — citing a need to investigate reports of rare but potentially dangerous blood clots — was “testimony to how seriously we take safety," said Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation's top infectious disease expert.In the opening months of his presidency, Biden has put top priority on a robust response to the virus that has killed 559,000 Americans, with a vaccine campaign in which nearly 50 per cent of adults have received at least one shot.His actions have received generally strong reviews, and hesitancy toward taking the vaccine has gradually declined as inoculations have increased. With three vaccines in use in the U.S. and plenty of supply in the pipeline, Biden actually has received some criticism for not sharing more vaccines with other nations. The president said Tuesday's action proved the wisdom of his approach.“My message to the American people on the vaccine is, I told you all," Biden told reporters after the announcement, adding that he “made sure we have 600 million doses” just from Pfizer and Moderna in the pipeline.The Johnson & Johnson pause, which regulators say they hope to resolve within days, comes on the heels of production issues at the Baltimore plant that produces the J& J vaccine.The White House, which got only about 12 hours' notice that some sort of announcement was coming and did not have any advance warning about the substance of the FDA and CDC's action, moved swiftly to minimise concerns about its impact.Aides recognised that they had to portray the decision as ensuring the “gold standard” of safety, to avoid feeding into vaccine hesitancy.“I think it's a very strong argument for safety actually,” Fauci said.White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients added that the pause by the agencies “should reassure the American public that they will be very diligent and conservative about how they approach the vaccines.”They argued the pause proved the prudence of Biden's cautious approach to promises around vaccine supply and delivery, as well as his administration's reluctance to make commitments to share excess vaccine with the world because of concerns about potential setbacks such as this.“They're clearly trying to reassure people there will be supply, and it will be safe,” said former White House communications director Jennifer Palmieri.“You don't want this to have happened, but in terms of what are your tools when it does, they used their best ones — the president, the most senior person who has credibility and the top experts — to do it.”Due to supply issues, the J&J shot reflects just a small share of doses being administered, though it had been one of the most promising vaccines given its ease of administration and distribution. Zients said the U.S. still expects to take delivery of enough doses of the other two approved vaccines for every adult American to get their shots by the end of May.Moderna and Pfizer this week are delivering 28 million doses to the federal government — enough to exceed even the current 3 million shot-per-day pace.Zients acknowledged that some states may have been caught off guard by Tuesday's announcement but said that reflected the speed with which officials moved to address the safety concerns. He added it was proof of Biden's commitment to “follow the science” in responding to the pandemic.“We want the science agencies to lead with science,” Zients said, saying no one at the White House was involved in the decision to call for the pause. “There's no reason for us to be involved in any of the scientific decisions, we bring nothing to the table.”The agencies said Tuesday they were investigating unusual clots that occurred in six women, of the more than 7.2 million adults who've received the shot. One of the patients died and another remains hospitalised in serious condition.Officials said the delay had as much to do with educating physicians about the unique way the clots have to be treated as their desire to study the exceedingly rare side effect. The usual treatment, with the blood thinner heparin, could lead to dangerous patient outcomes, they said.Fauci, speaking at the White House, advised those who had recently gotten J&J shots not to “get an anxiety reaction, because remember it's less than one in a million.” He added, “However, having said that, pay attention” to potential symptoms of the clot including severe headaches, abdominal or leg pain, and shortness of breath.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-pause-on-johnson-johnson-shots-shows-govt-putting-safety-1st-101618389468024.html

"I am for an orderly withdrawal and that is why I assume that we (NATO) will agree to that today."NATO defence and foreign ministers will hold a video conference Wednesday after the US said it was planning to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of the September 11 suicide hijackings this year.A US official said on Tuesday that President Joe Biden had reached the conclusion to end Washington's two-decade involvement in Afghanistan by late this year.The US has some 2,500 troops in Afghanistan as part of a 9,600-strong NATO mission in the country.NATO allies including Germany had been waiting for Biden to decide whether the US would stick to a May 1 deadline to withdraw under a deal struck between the administration of former US leader Donald Trump and the Taliban.Kramp-Karrenbauer said it was now important "for us in NATO to synchronise our planning with the US planning". She did not give a precise date when German troops would withdrawal from the strife-racked country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nato-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-likely-in-september-german-minister-101618389912201.html

14-04-2021||World||Queen returns to royal duties after husband Prince Philip death||Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II has returned to royal duties four days after her husband Prince Philip – the Duke of Edinburgh's death on April 9.The 94-year-old monarch hosted an audience with Earl Peel for his retirement as he formally stepped down as Lord Chamberlain, in charge of organising royal ceremonies. During a private event held at Windsor Castle on Tuesday, the Queen accepted her former royal aide's wand and office insignia."Earl Peel had an audience of The Queen today, delivered up his Wand and Insignia of Office as Lord Chamberlain and the Badge of Chancellor of the Royal Victorian Order and took leave upon relinquishing his appointment as Lord Chamberlain, when Her Majesty invested him with the Royal Victorian Chain," read the details in the Court Circular, a daily list of the official events attended by the Queen and the royal family.While the UK's national mourning after the passing of Prince Philip last Friday will run until the morning after his funeral at St George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle on Saturday, the royal family is observing two weeks of mourning.A royal official said members of the family would continue to undertake engagements "appropriate to the circumstances".Over the weekend, Prince Andrew – the Queen’s son, said his father’s death had left a “huge void” in his mother’s life.Earl Peel would have overseen the funeral arrangements – referred to as Operation Forth Bridge – before handing responsibility to his successor a week before his death.Former MI5 spy chief Baron Parker has been in place as the new Lord Chamberlain since April 1 and will be in overall charge of Saturday's funeral.Coronavirus lockdown measures mean only 30 people are able to attend the Royal Ceremonial event, which will include the Queen’s close family. Inside the chapel, the royal family will wear face masks and keep to social distancing rules.Under the plans released by Buckingham Palace, the Duke of Edinburgh’s coffin will be carried to the chapel on a specially-modified Land Rover, which he helped to design.His eldest son, Prince Charles – the Prince of Wales – and members of the royal family will take part in the procession on foot, immediately behind the coffin, together with staff from Prince Philip's household.Prince Harry has flown in from the US for his grandfather’s funeral. He, and older brother Prince William, had released their tribute statements reflecting on the late Duke’s service as the longest-serving monarch’s consort in British history.William said the Duke's "century of life was defined by service – to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family"."Like many of you who have lost a loved one or grandparent over the pain of this past year, he was my grandpa: master of the barbecue, legend of banter, and cheeky right 'til the end," said Harry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-returns-to-royal-duties-after-husband-prince-philip-death-101618389012948.html

If followed, we can keep our daily activities moving. There is a rumour that the government is planning to impose lockdown very soon; the government doesn't want to impose lockdown but we should take reference of other countries, mainly in Europe - the developed ones had to impose lockdown with the surge in cases in order to get protected from the first and second wave of infection. We want other measures to be adopted from now so that we don't have to impose lockdown through our awareness and keep the condition under our control," Prime Minister Oli said.Cases of Covid-19 have been increasing in recent days in Nepal by about 100 each day. Till Wednesday morning a total of 2,321,670 tests using the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) method had been carried out.Nepal currently hosts active cases of 3,608 with the total number of infections standing at 280,984. A total of 274,318 people have recovered while 3,058 people have succumbed to the virus.Prime Minister Oli claimed that the government was able to make extraordinary achievements in the past year despite the adverse situation created by the Covid-19 pandemic.In his address to the nation on Wednesday, Oli said that his government was able to raise hope among people at a time when there was huge pessimism.He also claimed that the government was able to maintain the rapid pace of development by building five kilometres of blacktopped road each day and 12 houses a day on average. He also announced increasing the elderly allowances from the new fiscal year."Talking about the railways, we have brought two rails in Janakpur and would operationalise it within this month," Oli said.He further said that the government's move to introduce a social security scheme was part of its achievement. He said that over six million people have already become part of this scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-pm-oli-warns-of-lockdown-if-coronavirus-cases-surge-101618387900578.html
14-04-2021||World||'Prime suspect' arrested in 1996 disappearance of college student Kristin Smart||Paul Flores was the last person seen with Kristin Smart before she vanished from a college campus on California’s scenic Central Coast nearly 25 years ago and suspicion has followed him ever since.He went from being a “person of interest” to a “suspect” to “the prime suspect.”Investigators never had enough evidence to charge him with a crime related to her disappearance until Tuesday when Flores was arrested on suspicion of murder in Smart's death. His father, Ruben Flores, was arrested as an accessory to the crime.San Luis Obispo County Sheriff Ian Parkinson said arrests came after a search of the elder Flores' home last month using ground-penetrating radar and cadaver dogs turned up new evidence linked to Smart's killing, though her body has not yet been located.“Until we return Kristin to (her family) this is not over," Parkinson said.Smart, 19, of Stockton, was last seen May 25, 1996, while returning to her dorm at California Polytechnic State University campus in San Luis Obispo after an off-campus party. Flores, a fellow freshman at the school at the time, had offered to walk her home.Smart’s family issued a statement saying it was a bittersweet day they had long waited for and a first step toward bringing their daughter home.“While Kristin’s loving spirit will always live in our hearts, our life without her hugs, laughs and smiles is a heartache that never abates,” they said. “The knowledge that a father and son, despite our desperate pleas for help, could have withheld this horrible secret for nearly 25 years, denying us the chance to lay our daughter to rest, is an unrelenting and unforgiving pain.”Flores, 44, was arrested at his home in the San Pedro area of Los Angeles and taken to a police car in handcuffs wearing pajama bottoms and a surf T-shirt. His father, Ruben Flores, 80, was arrested at his Arroyo Grande home — about 15 miles (24 kilometers) south of the university — where sheriff’s investigators conducted a new search for evidence.Paul Flores has been under suspicion almost from the start, but the case picked up steam in the past couple years after Parkinson ordered a thorough review of the evidence and a fulltime cold case detective was hired.New witnesses came forward and warrants allowed investigators to intercept and monitor Paul Flores' phone and text messages and search his own home, along with those of his mother, father and sister that turned up new evidence, Parkinson said. He declined to offer more details because search warrants are sealed.Parkinson also credited the podcast “Your Own Backyard" for giving the case renewed widespread attention that led to a key witness coming forward.The podcast's creator, Chris Lambert, was a musician who grew up in the area and was intrigued by a billboard offering a $75,000 reward for information leading to Smart.“Driving past that billboard was a periodic reminder that, oh yeah, they still haven’t found that girl,” Lambert said in a video posted on the podcast website. ”It's different when somebody goes missing in your own backyard."Parkinson held his news conference on the university campus, gesturing over his shoulder to the place nearby where Smart was last seen alive with Flores. He acknowledged missteps by law enforcement hampered the investigation.Smart wasn’t reported missing until three days after she was last seen. A dorm mate at the time said police were initially reluctant to take a missing persons report because it was Memorial Day weekend and she might have left the campus.Smart’s family said in their statement that “an indifference and lack of resolve we experienced early on set the course for many years.”The Smart family filed a $40 million lawsuit in 1996 against Paul Flores and added the the university for allegedly not protecting their daughter. The case has been stayed awaiting a criminal case outcome, a family spokesman said.The case was originally handled by Cal Poly police and the district attorney’s office. Sheriff’s investigators didn’t get involved until a month later.“There really is no hiding the fact that there was mistakes made early on and it made it much more difficult,” Parkinson said. “You know that first 48 hours is pretty critical in a missing person or a homicide.”Parkinson likened the case to a puzzle where missing pieces are located, leading to new evidence and locations to search that then revealed other information."It’s a very slow process to find each of those little pieces,” he said.They served over 40 search warrants at 16 locations over the years, collected nearly 200 new items of evidence and used modern DNA techniques to test more than three dozen older pieces of evidence. So much evidence was compiled that it would fill three terabytes on a computer hard drive, he said.Paul Flores has remained mum through the years, invoking his Fifth Amendment right to not answer questions before a grand jury and in a deposition for the lawsuit brought against him.Flores had nothing to say when arrested, Parkinson said.He was held without bail. His lawyer, Robert Sanger, declined to comment.Ruben Flores was being held on $250,000 bail. His lawyer, Harold Mesick, didn't immediately return an email message seeking comment from The Associated Press but he told the Los Angeles Times that his client was “absolutely innocent.”After Flores was arrested at his Arroyo Grande home, investigators executed a new search warrant. A coroner's tent was set up outside and radar was used to search the grounds. The sound of power saws and drills whined in the background as they searched under a large deck and in the garage.The mayor of Arroyo Grande said the arrests had brought a sense of relief to the city of about 18,000 people that sits just inland from the scenic Central Coast.“The disappearance of Kristin Smart has weighed heavily on the hearts of the people of Arroyo Grande all this time,” Mayor Caren Ray Russom said. “She was never forgotten here, and many, many of us have closely followed this case for decades. ... I sincerely hope that these arrests will result in justice and closure for the Smart family.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prime-suspect-arrested-in-1996-disappearance-of-college-student-kristin-smart-101618386752054.html

The health agencies in the US said Tuesday they were investigating unusual clots in these patients who've received the Johnson & Johnson shot. One of the patients died and another remains hospitalised in serious condition, AP reported.Following the recommendation of US agencies, South Africa also temporarily suspended the use of Johnson & Johnson vaccines citing concerns about rare and severe blood clotting side effects.More than 289,000 people have received the Johnson & Johnson inoculations in South Africa and no adverse blood clotting side effects have been recorded as a result of the vaccine, health minister Zweli Mkhize was quoted as saying by Bloomberg.Meanwhile, health agencies in Italy and Canada are also considering changing the immunisation plan. Italy's AIFA could discuss the possibility of using Johnson & Johnson's (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine only for people over the age of 60, the head of the medicines agency reportedly told a paper on Wednesday, according to Reuters."We'll see what it's best use will be. We could discuss the possibility of reserving these (J&J) doses to people over the age of 60 since (blood clot) cases are again concentrated under the age of 50," AIFA director Nicola Magrini told Il Corriere della Sera newspaper in an interview.Canada too said that it in talks with the pharma firm over the blood clot reports. Canada’s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said a surge in virus variants could threaten progress made so far, Reuters reported.Similar concerns were raised for AstraZeneca Plc Covid-19 shot after three people, who took the vaccine, were hospitalised in Norway with complaints of blood clots, bleeding and low platelet counts last month. AstraZeneca later said that a review of at least 17 million individuals suggested that the vaccine was safe for use and that that the blood clotting events were not related to the shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nations-mull-pause-on-johnson-johnson-covid-19-vaccine-over-blood-clot-reports-101618385297950.html
14-04-2021||World||French Senate clears controversial “separatism bill”||Lawmakers in the French parliament’s upper house this week approved a tougher version of a controversial bill that the government says aims to safeguard France from radical Islamists but which critics fear could be anti-Islamic, according to local media reports. After two weeks of intense debate, lawmakers voted 208-109 to reportedly clear the new version of the bill titled “Supporting respect for the principles of the Republic”. A commission made up of seven MPs of France’s National Assembly, which is the lower house, and seven senators will now try to come to an agreement on the final text of the bill in order to take it forward, according to Le Figaro newspaper. The National Assembly will have the final say in signing the bill into law. The earlier version of the bill - widely referred to as “separatism bill” - was first approved by the lower house back in February. The government maintains the bill is intended to crack down on hate speech and actions by religious figures and organisations that are seen as subverting core values of the French republic. It allows the government to close religious organisations and places of worship if they are found to air “theories or ideas” that “provoke hate or violence”, according to reports. Many critics, however, see the new law as perhaps xenophobic and part of French President Emmanuel Macron’s tilt towards the far-right ahead of next year’s elections, especially since a controversial remark he had made in the aftermath of several terror attacks in France last year. “Islam is a religion that is in crisis all over the world,” he had said, drawing fierce criticism at home and abroad. The bill comes in the backdrop of France suffering a number of Islamist terror attacks last year. Among the prominent ones were the beheading of Samuel Paty, a teacher, who had allegedly showed his pupils cartoons of Prophet Muhammad in October; a knife assault outside the former offices of the satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, also in October; and the deadly stabbings at a church in Nice in September. The text of the bill doesn’t mention Islam in order to avoid stigmatising Muslims. France is home to an estimated 5.7 million Muslims. The conservative-controlled Senate backed a series of amendments to the bill with the objective to make the text tougher, including voting to ban hijabs for minors and reinforcing “neutrality” at universities. The Senate also passed last-minute amendments, tabled by interior minister Gérald Darmanin on behalf of the president, which allow a prefecture to oppose the opening of a school “for reasons drawn from France’s international relations or the defence of its sovereignty”, according to Le Figaro. This comes after a recent controversy around the construction of a Muslim school in Albertville, southeastern France, by the Turkish Islamic association Millî Görüş, which has refused to sign the charter of principles of Islam in France, the newspaper reported. Bruno Retailleau, a right-wing senator and president of The Republicans group in the upper house, has urged the National Assembly to pass this tougher version of the bill. “The Senate has largely rewritten the separatism law to make it tougher and to target radical Islam. The French are waiting for these strong measures, the majority of the National Assembly must free itself from the government and take account for these measures themselves,” Retailleau tweeted on Tuesday. Marie-Pierre de la Gontrie of the Socialist Party, meanwhile, said she was opposed to the bill, arguing that the right-wing has transformed it “into an electoral leaflet”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-senate-clears-controversial-separatism-bill-101618382624936.html
14-04-2021||World||Japan's Toshiba president steps down amid acquisition talks||The president of Toshiba Corp. stepped down Wednesday, a week after the the Japanese technology and manufacturing conglomerate said it was studying an acquisition proposal from a global fund where he previously worked.Nobuaki Kurumatani tendered his resignation at a board meeting, and the board accepted, effective Wednesday, Tokyo-based Toshiba said in a statement.Kurumatani headed the Japan operations of CVC Capital Partners, which proposed the acquisition last week, before taking his post as chief executive of Toshiba in 2018.Some questions had been raised, both within and outside the Tokyo-based company, about Kurumatani leading the board discussions on the acquisition.The CVC deal is estimated to be worth 2 trillion yen ($18 billion) and will turn Toshiba private. Toshiba said it was giving it “careful consideration.”Trading in the company's shares was suspended when the news hit last week. Shares of Toshiba, whose sprawling business includes making elevators and railways, shot up on the CVC news, and have been trading at nearly 5,000 yen ($46).CVC is a European private equity firm, based in Luxembourg, which has committed nearly $162 billion in funds, managing more than 300 investors. It has declined to comment on the acquisition proposal or the president's resignation.But speculation has been growing other funds may offer better prices.Kurumatani will be replaced as chief executive and president by his predecessor, Satoshi Tsunakawa, who remains on the board, first as COO and currently chairman, Toshiba said.Tsunakawa oversaw some of the recent financial challenges at Toshiba. Before becoming CEO, in his previous stint from 2016, he had headed Toshiba's medical systems business, now a group company of Japanese camera and equipment maker Canon.Toshiba, founded in 1875, was long revered as one of Japan's respected brands, developing the nation's first radar and microwaves, electric rice cookers and laptop computers.It also invented flash memory, the ubiquitous computer chips that store and retain data for digital cameras, cell phones and other gadgets. Toshiba no longer makes laptops, and it has sold its computer chips division.The company's fortunes began to crumble over its heavy investment in nuclear power. After the March 2011 nuclear disaster in Fukushima, costs of the business ballooned because of growing safety concerns. Some nations are turning toward sustainable energy.Toshiba also had massive losses from the nuclear power operations of US manufacturer Westinghouse, which Toshiba acquired in 2006 and which filed for bankruptcy protection in 2017.In Japan, Toshiba is decommissioning nuclear plants, including the one in Fukushima, where the tsunami 10 years ago set off multiple reactor meltdowns.In 2015, Toshiba acknowledged it had been systematically falsifying its books since 2008, as managers tried to meet overly ambitious targets. An outside investigation found it had inflated profits and hid massive expenses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japans-toshiba-president-steps-down-amid-acquisition-talks-101618373262547.html

This enormous build-up that they've made militarily ... to take aggressive action, but we don't know their intentions obviously," the official said.Russia has regularly accused NATO of destabilizing Europe with its troop reinforcements in the Baltics and Poland since the annexation of Crimea.BIDEN'S GOALS FOR SUMMITBiden also reaffirmed a goal to build "a stable and predictable relationship" with Russia and said a meeting in the coming months could address "the full range of issues" facing the two world powers, the statement said.The Kremlin said in its account of the call that Biden told Putin he wanted to normalize relations and to cooperate on arms control, Iran's nuclear program, Afghanistan and climate change. It confirmed Biden had proposed a high level meeting but did not indicate how the Russian leader responded.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken echoed the White House message during talks on the crisis in Brussels with NATO leaders and Ukraine's foreign minister.Blinken also said he would discuss Kyiv's ambitions to one day join NATO - although France and Germany have long worried that bringing the former Soviet republic into the Western alliance would antagonize Russia."The United States is our adversary and does everything it can to undermine Russia's position on the world stage," Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies on Tuesday.His remarks suggest that the diplomatic niceties which the old Cold War enemies have generally sought to observe in recent decades is fraying, and that Russia would robustly push back against what it regards as unacceptable U.S. interference in its geographical sphere of influence.Andrew Weiss, a Russia analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, said Biden's exchange with Putin reflected U.S. concern about Ukraine and a desire to work with Russia where they may have common interests."There's an urgent need to send a signal directly to Putin that what Russia is doing in and around Ukraine is dangerous and destabilizing, even as other parts of the administration try not to foreclose cooperation on issues such as the Iran nuclear deal, Afghanistan, climate change and strategic stability."US WARSHIPSTwo US warships are due to arrive in the Black Sea this week in response to what US and NATO officials say is the largest massing of Russian forces - with thousands of combat-ready troops - since Moscow seized Crimea from Ukraine."We warn the United States that it will be better for them to stay far away from Crimea and our Black Sea coast," Ryabkov said. "It will be for their own good. He called the U.S. deployment a provocation designed to test Russian nerves.Blinken met Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba in Brussels after Group of Seven foreign ministers condemned what they said was the unexplained rise in Russian troop numbers.Echoing NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, who met Kuleba earlier, Blinken said Moscow's military actions on Ukraine's doorstep were "very provocative"."Russia must end this military build-up in and around Ukraine, stop its provocations and de-escalate immediately," Stoltenberg said at a news conference with Kuleba.Kyiv has welcomed the show of Western support, but it falls short of Ukraine's desire for full membership of NATO.Kuleba said Kyiv wanted a diplomatic solution, though he also appealed for further economic sanctions against Moscow and more military assistance to Ukraine.Separately, two diplomats said Stoltenberg would chair a video conference with allied defense and foreign ministers on Wednesday. Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin were to be present at NATO headquarters to brief the other 29 allies on Ukraine, as well as on Afghanistan, the diplomats said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-proposes-summit-with-vladimir-putin-after-russia-calls-us-adversary-over-ukraine-101618368058785.html
14-04-2021||World||Biden sends unofficial US delegation to Taiwan||President Joe Biden sent an unofficial delegation of former US officials to Taiwan on Wednesday in a signal of support for the democratic island as it faces increasingly hostile moves by China.Taipei said former senator Christopher Dodd and former deputy secretaries of state Richard Armitage and James Steinberg would land in the capital on Wednesday afternoon."Once again this visit demonstrates the firm relationship between Taiwan and the United States," said presidential office spokesman Xavier Chang."It is strong as a rock."Taiwan's 23 million people live under the constant threat of invasion by authoritarian Beijing, which claims the island as its own and has vowed to one day seize it.It uses diplomatic, economic and military pressure to keep Taiwan isolated on the world stage and bristles whenever countries send delegations or maintain contacts with Taiwan.Over the past year, Beijing's sabre-rattling has increased considerably with Chinese fighter jets and nuclear-capable bombers breaching Taiwan's air defence zone on a near-daily basis.A record 25 Chinese military jets and bombers breached Taiwan's defence zone on Monday.Washington has diplomatically recognised Beijing over Taiwan since 1979.But it maintains relations with Taipei and is bound by an act of Congress to sell the island defensive weapons. It also opposes any attempt by China to change Taiwan's future by force.This week's delegation comes on the 42nd anniversary of that legislation -- the Taiwan Relations Act -- which Biden signed when he was a young senator.It also comes after the State Department said on Friday it was issuing new guidelines allowing US officials to meet more easily with Taiwanese counterparts.Biden's predecessor Donald Trump ramped up contacts and visits to Taiwan by US officials as relations between Washington and Beijing plunged over a host of issues.Biden has made clear he wishes to cooperate with China on common causes such as climate change.But concerns about China under President Xi Jinping have become a rare bipartisan issue in Washington and Biden has maintained a tough line with Beijing over its human rights record and threats towards Taiwan.US climate envoy John Kerry will visit China later this week in the first trip there by the Biden administration, seeking to raise global ambitions despite soaring tensions with Beijing on other fronts."We have big disagreements with China on some key issues, absolutely. But climate has to stand alone," Kerry told CNN.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-sends-unofficial-us-delegation-to-taiwan-101618366704798.html

14-04-2021||World||Brazil Senate pushes forward with probe of Prez Bolsonaro's Covid-19 response||Brazil's Senate on Tuesday launched a probe into President Jair Bolsonaro's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic.The congressional investigation, known by its Portuguese acronym as a CPI, can result in a number of actions, including the referral of possible wrongdoing to law enforcement. In practice, the inquiry is a political headache for Bolsonaro, who is already facing record disapproval amid Brazil's worst coronavirus wave.Senate leader Rodrigo Pacheco said on Tuesday that a congressional inquiry into the federal response to the pandemic would be combined with a probe into how federal resources were distributed to states. Some Bolsonaro-aligned lawmakers had pushed for an inquiry to probe how states and municipalities have handled the pandemic, though Pacheco argued such a move could infringe on the jurisdiction of state assemblies.The Covid-19 pandemic is pushing Brazil's medical system to the limit in many parts of the country, partly due to the so-called P1 variant, which many medical experts believe is particularly infectious and deadly.Some 3,808 Brazilians died of Covid-19 on Tuesday alone, according to Health Ministry data, bringing the total death toll to over 358,000, the second highest in the world behind the United States.Moreover, victims are getting younger with over 50% of intensive care beds occupied by patients under 40 years old, according to a study published over the weekend by the Brazilian Association of Intensive Medicine.Bolsonaro has drawn widespread criticism for his approach to the coronavirus, which he has described as a "little flu." He has repeatedly ignored calls of health experts to wear masks and railed against the use of lockdown measures.Angered by attempts to have him investigated, Bolsonaro has blasted lawmakers. A Supreme Court judge ruled last week that enough senators had backed an inquiry into the government's pandemic response to launch the probe despite stalling by Senate leadership.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-senate-pushes-forward-with-probe-of-prez-bolsonaro-s-covid-19-response-101618364630291.html

India-China border “tensions remain high, despite some force pullbacks this year”, the report said, adding: “China’s occupation since May 2020 of contested border areas is the most serious escalation in decades and led to the first lethal border clash between the two countries since 1975.”As of mid-February, “after multiple rounds of talks, both sides were pulling back forces and equipment from some sites along the disputed border”, the report added on the India-China conflict.The US has followed the border conflict closely and condemned China’s aggression in strong terms. It has also expedited certain military supplies requisitioned by India.About others in India’s neighbourhood, the report said that the Myanmar military’s February seizure of power, detention of state counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, and declaration of a one-year state of emergency “marked a break in that country’s democratic transition and ushered in new societal instability and widespread popular protests”.For Afghanistan, which has become America’s longest war, the report said: “We assess that prospects for a peace deal will remain low during the next year. The Taliban is likely to make gains on the battlefield, and the Afghan Government will struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the coalition withdraws support”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indiapakistan-crises-likely-to-intensify-china-tensions-still-high-us-intel-101618362034731.html
14-04-2021||World||Cop, police chief resign 2 days after Black motorist's death in Minneapolis||A white police officer who fatally shot a Black man during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb resigned Tuesday, as did the city's police chief — moves that the mayor said he hoped would help heal the community and lead to reconciliation after two nights of protests and unrest.The resignations from Officer Kim Potter and Police Chief Tim Gannon came two days after the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center. Potter, a 26-year veteran, had been on administrative leave following Sunday’s shooting, which happened as the Minneapolis area was already on edge over the trial of an officer charged in George Floyd’s death.Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott said at a news conference that the city had been moving toward firing Potter when she resigned. Elliott said he hoped her resignation would “bring some calm to the community,” but that he would keep working toward “full accountability under the law.”“We have to make sure that justice is served, justice is done. Daunte Wright deserves that. His family deserves that,” Elliott said.A decision on whether prosecutors will charge Potter could come as soon as Wednesday. Meanwhile, the cities of Brooklyn Center, Minneapolis and St. Paul imposed 10 p.m. curfews.More than 1,000 protesters gathered again Tuesday at Brooklyn Center's heavily guarded police headquarters, now ringed by concrete barriers and a tall metal fence, and where police in riot gear and National Guard soldiers stood watch. “Murderapolis” was scrawled with black spray paint on a concrete barrier. The group also marched to the Minneapolis office of the FBI, a couple blocks away.“Daunte Wright! Say his name!” the crowd chanted. “No justice, no peace! Prosecute the police!”Gannon has said he believed Potter mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. She can be heard on her body camera video shouting “Taser! Taser!” However, protesters and Wright's family members say there's no excuse for the shooting and it shows how the justice system is tilted against Blacks, noting Wright was stopped for an expired car registration and ended up dead.Activists who attended the mayor's news conference called for sweeping changes to the Brooklyn Center Police Department and sharply criticized the acting police chief, Tony Gruenig, for not yet having a plan.Elliott said the department has about 49 police officers, none of whom live in Brooklyn Center. He said he didn't have information on racial diversity at hand but that “we have very few people of color in our department.”The modest suburb just north of Minneapolis has seen its demographics shift dramatically in recent years. In 2000, more than 70% of the city was white. Today, a majority of residents are Black, Asian or Hispanic.After stopping Wright for the expired license plates, police tried to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. The warrant was for his failure to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June.Body camera footage released Monday shows Wright struggling with police when Potter shouts, “I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel.After firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away, and Potter says, “Holy (expletive)! I shot him.”Wright died of a gunshot wound to the chest, according to the medical examiner.Protests began within hours.In her one-paragraph letter of resignation, Potter said, “I have loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community to the best of my ability, but I believe it is in the best interest of the community, the department, and my fellow officers if I resign immediately."Wright’s father, Aubrey Wright, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” that he rejects the explanation that Potter mistook her gun for her Taser.“I lost my son. He’s never coming back. I can’t accept that. A mistake? That doesn’t even sound right. This officer has been on the force for 26 years. I can’t accept that,” he said.Chyna Whitaker, mother of Daunte’s son, said at a news conference that she felt police “stole my son’s dad from him.”The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association said in a statement Tuesday that “no conclusions should be made until the investigation is complete.”Prosecutors in Hennepin County, where the shooting occurred, said they have referred the case to nearby Washington County — a practice county attorneys in the Minneapolis area adopted last year in handling police deadly force cases. Washington County Attorney Pete Orput told WCCO-AM that he had received information on the case from state investigators and hoped to have a charging decision on Wednesday. Orput did not immediately respond to a message from The Associated Press.Elliott, the mayor, called for the governor to move the case to the attorney general to prosecute.Asked to comment, John Stiles, spokesman for the attorney general’s office, said the attorney general has confidence in Orput’s review of the case.Ben Crump, the Wright family's attorney, spoke outside the Minneapolis courthouse where a fired police officer is on trial in Floyd’s death. Crump compared Wright’s death to that of Floyd, who was pinned down by police when they tried to arrest him for allegedly passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market last May.Daunte Wright “was not a threat to them,” Crump said. “Was it the best decision? No. But young people don’t always make the best decisions. As his mother said, he was scared.”Potter has experience with investigations into police shootings. She was the police union president and one of the first officers to respond after Brooklyn Center police fatally shot a man who allegedly tried to stab an officer with a knife in 2019, according to a report from the Hennepin County Attorney's Office.After medics arrived, she told the two officers who shot the man to get into separate squad cars, turn off their body cameras, and not to speak to each other. She accompanied two other officers involved in the shooting while investigators interviewed them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/cop-police-chief-resign-2-days-after-black-motorist-s-death-in-minneapolis-101618361831606.html
14-04-2021||World||Johnson & Johnson’s blood-clot pause to educate doctors, monitor Covid-19 cases: Official||US health officials urged a pause on the use of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine due to dangerous blood-clotting to give them time to educate doctors on how to treat the exceedingly rare disorder and to “look in all the nooks and crannies” for other cases.That’s the message from Peter Marks, a top official at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, after six women between the ages of 18 and 48 developed severe blood clots in the brain days after getting the one-shot vaccine and federal officials called for a temporary halt in its use. J&J decided to delay rollout of the immunization in Europe and pause all of its Covid-19 vaccine trials.At least one woman died, and a second was in critical condition, out of almost 7 million Americans who received the shot as of Monday, officials said. The normal treatment for clots, the blood-thinner heparin, could make the disorder worse, or even kill a patient, health officials said Tuesday.“Everyone knew it could cause a hit to vaccine confidence,” said Marks, the head of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, speaking Tuesday at an American Medical Association webinar. Though the cases “could just be a statistical aberration,” the health authorities sought to exercise an abundance of caution, he said.The safety signals, he said, were seen between 6 and 13 days after vaccination and were identified by the FDA through a government-run vaccine adverse event reporting system. The clots are called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare condition that develops in conjunction with low levels of blood platelets.At a briefing earlier in the day, Anne Schuchat, principal deputy director at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said those vaccinated a month ago are at low risk, but people who got it in the last couple of weeks should be on the lookout for headache, leg pain, abdominal pain and shortness of breath.“We expect it to be a matter of days for this pause,” the FDA’s Janet Woodcock said at the briefing.J&J’s decision to pause vaccinations in its Covid-focused clinical trials was also designed to allow it time to update guidance for investigators and participants, the company said in a statement Wednesday evening.6.8 Million DosesMore than 6.8 million doses of the single-shot J&J vaccine have been administered in the US through Monday. Jeff Zients, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, said the delay won’t have a significant impact on the Biden administration’s vaccination plans.Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. and CVS Health Corp., which have been administering the shot in drugstores, both said they would pause immediately.A number of states on Tuesday also said they would follow the recommendation. New York plans to immunize people who were supposed to receive J&J’s shot with Pfizer’s vaccine at state-run mass vaccination sites. Virginia said it will reschedule appointments.Shereef Elnahal, the CEO of University Hospital and former commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health, said he’s awaiting further information as to whether younger women or another sub-population are more susceptible to the extremely rare disorder, and whether or not it was caused by the vaccine or mere coincidence.“We are in a limbo period where we just don’t know enough to present all the facts to the community,” Elnahal said in an interview.“This is a vaccine that is very effective for what matters most, preventing hospitalization and death,” he added, noting that if the FDA extended a universal, indefinite pause, it would limit the tools at the health-system’s disposal to curb the pandemic.Crucial JunctureThe decision comes at a crucial juncture in the U.S. vaccination effort, which has gained speed in recent weeks at the same time a worsening outbreak driven by coronavirus variants grips the upper Midwest. It could boost vaccine hesitancy in the U.S. and heighten worry about vaccines globally after similar issues caused delays with AstraZeneca Plc’s shot.Schuchat emphasized at the briefing that the clotting events with low platelet counts are not being seen with Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE vaccine and the Moderna Inc. shot.J&J shares closed down 1.3% at $159.48 in New York trading.No definitive cause for the disorder has yet been determined, according to Marks, who said it was very similar to blood clotting incidents seen with the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine. It may be tied to an immune response after vaccination that leads to an activation of platelets and clotting, he said.The J&J shot has been popular due to its single dose while the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines require two doses spaced several weeks apart. Many of the J&J doses in the U.S. have been targeted to harder-to-reach populations through the federal government’s distribution program that works through pharmacies, federally qualified health centers and other locations.“We are recommending a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution,” the CDC and the FDA said in a joint statement Tuesday. The CDC will convene a meeting Wednesday of its Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices to review the cases and assess their potential significance.The FDA will review the CDC assessment as it also investigates these cases, according to the statement.Still, “the potential complications with some of these blood clots is statistically much, much lower than the number of blood clots that we see on an annual basis in this country,” said Mario Ramirez, an emergency medicine physician who served as acting director of the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of Global Affairs Office of Pandemic and Emerging Threats under the Obama Administration.“We need to just take a deep breath and give investigators a chance to look at what the data says before we can draw any conclusions,” Ramirez said in an interview with Bloomberg Radio.European RolloutJ&J has recently begun shipments to the European Union. The bloc’s drugs regulator, the European Medicines Agency, didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. J&J said in a statement that it’s decided to delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe.The EMA said Friday that it is assessing blood clots in people who received the J&J vaccine, after four serious cases of unusual clots accompanied by low blood platelets, one of which was fatal, emerged.On Friday afternoon, FDA spokesperson Abby Capobianco said in an emailed statement that the agency hadn’t found a causal relationship between the J&J vaccine and the six cases of thromboembolic events, and was continuing its assessment of the cases“Our analysis of the data will inform the potential need for regulatory action,” she said. The agency had shared information with the EMA, which became “the basis” of the EU probe, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-s-blood-clot-pause-to-educate-doctors-monitor-covid-19-cases-official-101618359777875.html
14-04-2021||World||Another power crisis looms over Texas as grid faces Crunch again||Texas is again facing a possible power-grid emergency, less than 60 days after widespread blackouts left millions without light and heat for days during a deep winter freeze.The grid operator is asking for conservation and warned it could declare an emergency to bring more power plants online after a mild cold front failed to reduce demand as expected at the same time that 25% of generators are offline for repairs. Wholesale electricity prices jumped as high as 10,000% in some parts of the state.“We don’t anticipate having any outages,” said Bill Magness, Chief Executive Officer of the Electric Reliability Council of Texas. “But it is a day we are seeing tight conditions on the grid.”The warning comes just two months after Texas suffered from catastrophic blackouts during a winter storm that knocked out nearly half of the state’s generation capacity. State lawmakers are now scrambling to put in place a series of market reforms designed to avoid a repeat of the calamity that left more than 100 people dead.Officials at the grid operator, known as Ercot, stressed that Tuesday’s conditions are not a repeat of the February crisis.“This is not an extended winter storm that is going to last five days,” Ercot Vice President of Grid Planning and Operations Woody Rickerson told reporters. “This is a shorter event.”Blackouts would only occur if reserve power supplies fell below 1,000 megawatts from more than 3,0000 now. That’s unlikely, Rickerson said. He acknowledged that Ercot didn’t correctly forecast solar and wind production Tuesday, resulting in the supply tightness. At the same time, the grid operator expected milder weather to reduce demand across Texas but when cooler air stalled in one part of the state, temperatures -- and consumption -- remained higher than expected in large cities including San Antonio and Houston.Many power plants schedule annual maintenance for this time of year, when demand is expected to be lower due to lower temperatures. A few plants were also offline to make repairs related to the February storm, Rickerson said.The average spot on-peak electricity at Ercot’s North Hub jumped more than 10,000% to $1,975.96 a megawatt-hour as of 4 p.m, according to grid data compiled by Genscape. Prices are capped at $2,000 a megawatt hour, after regulators suspended the previous $9,000 cap following the energy crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-power-crisis-looms-over-texas-as-grid-faces-crunch-again-101618359085199.html
14-04-2021||World||Minnesota police chief, officer Kim Potter quit days after Daunte Wright's death||A white Minnesota police officer who fatally shot a Black man during a traffic stop in a Minneapolis suburb and the city's chief of police resigned Tuesday.Officer Kim Potter and Police Chief Tim Gannon both resigned two days after the death of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center. Potter, a 26-year veteran, had been on administrative leave following Sunday’s shooting.Gannon has said he believed Potter mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. She can be heard on her body camera video shouting “Taser! Taser!”“Whenever, through the line of duty, someone kills another human being, there must be accountability,” Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott told the “Today” show earlier Tuesday.Activists and some residents say Wright was racially profiled, and his death has sparked two days of clashes between police and protesters. The shooting happened as the Minneapolis area was already on edge over the trial of the first of four police officers in George Floyd’s death.Wright was shot as police were trying to arrest him on an outstanding warrant.“I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” the officer is heard shouting on her body cam footage released Monday. She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel.After firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away, and the officer is heard saying, “Holy (expletive)! I shot him.”The pressure built Tuesday to fire the suburban Minneapolis police officer who killed a 20-year-old Black man during an altercation after a traffic stop, a shooting authorities said was a tragic mistake but that family members of Daunte Wright and others pointed to as yet the latest example of a broken criminal justice system.Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott called the shooting in his city “deeply tragic” and said the officer should be fired. Elliott, the city's first Black mayor, announced Monday night that the City Council had fired the city manager and voted to give the mayor's office “command authority” over the police force.“We’re going to do everything we can to ensure that justice is done and our communities are made whole,” Elliott said.The city’s police chief has said he believes the officer, identified as 26-year-veteran Kim Potter, mistakenly grabbed her gun when she was going for her Taser. The officer, who is white, can be heard on her body camera video shouting “Taser! Taser!”Wright’s father, Aubrey Wright, told ABC’s “Good Morning America” on Tuesday that he rejects that explanation.“I lost my son. He’s never coming back. I can’t accept that. A mistake? That doesn’t even sound right. This officer has been on the force for 26 years. I can’t accept that,” he said.Wright's family planned to speak again Tuesday alongside the family of George Floyd at the courthouse where the trial is being held for a former Minneapolis police officer charged in his death. Protests erupted for a second night following Sunday's shooting, heightening anxiety in an area already on edge as the Derek Chauvin trial progresses. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck.Chauvin and three other officers were fired the day after Floyd's death. Potter was placed on administrative leave while the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigates Wright's death.The Minnesota Police and Peace Officers Association, the police union, issued a statement Tuesday saying “no conclusions should be made until the investigation is complete.”Police Chief Tim Gannon on Monday would not say whether Potter would be fired, saying she was entitled to due process.“I think we can watch the video and ascertain whether she will be returning,” the chief said.The advent of social media and body cameras has forced police departments to move much quickly than in the past, said Alex Piquero, chairman of the University of Miami’s sociology department. However, he said that before the Brooklyn Center Police Department fires the officer, it will likely review all evidence, including any other body camera footage and testimony from other officers, so that the dismissal is less vulnerable to any court challenge.“We don’t know why she reached for her firearm instead of her Taser,” Piquero said.Body camera footage Gannon released less than 24 hours after the shooting shows three officers around a stopped car, which authorities said was pulled over because it had expired registration tags. When one officer attempts to handcuff Wright, a second officer tells him he’s being arrested on a warrant. That’s when the struggle begins.Potter can be heard saying: “I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!” She draws her weapon after the man breaks free from police outside his car and gets back behind the wheel. After firing a single shot from her handgun, the car speeds away and the officer is heard saying, “Holy (expletive)!

The site was rocked by a quake followed by a tsunami a decade ago.The US found itself alone backing Japan’s plan to release the water from the Daiichi plant into the Pacific Ocean, with American partners South Korea and Taiwan joining China in criticising the move.The US said the approach appeared to be in line with global standards while the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) said it would help ensure the plan is carried out “without an adverse impact on human health and the environment”.“Disposing of the treated water is an unavoidable issue for decommissioning the Fukushima nuclear power plant,” Japan PM Yoshihide Suga said.The Chinese foreign ministry urged the US to treat Tokyo’s decision according to facts, and not according to the country. Foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the discharge of the water will impact the marine environment.“International authorities and experts have clearly pointed out that the discharge of tritium-contaminated wastewater from the Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean will affect the marine environment and the public health of neighbouring countries,” Zhao said.He added that the existing treated wastewater contains other radionuclides and needs to be further purified and treated.The ministry quoted an IAEA report that says “if the wastewater containing tritium from the nuclear plant is discharged into the sea, it will affect the marine environment and people’s health of neighbouring countries”.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-concerned-over-japan-s-decision-to-release-fukushima-wastewater-into-sea-101618319681951.html
