23-04-2021||World||France, EU, Australia extend support, solidarity to India amid Covid-19 surge||France, Australia and the European Union (EU) on Friday offered support and solidarity to India as it grappled with a massive surge in Coronavirus infections that has stretched medical facilities across the country and resulted in shortages of oxygen and medicines. French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain tweeted a message from President Emmanuel Macron about providing support for India’s Covid-19 response, while cooperation on pandemic-related issues figured in a virtual meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and European Commission executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager. “I want to send a message of solidarity to the Indian people, facing a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. France is with you in this struggle, which spares no-one. We stand ready to provide our support,” Macron was quoted as saying by the French envoy. Though the meeting between Jaishankar and Vestager largely focused on preparations for the virtual India-EU Summit next month, the two leaders also discussed India’s Covid-19 response. “Appreciated the support offered by EU on Covid-19 challenges currently faced by India. Confident that EU will help strengthen our capabilities at this critical juncture,” Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting. European Council President Charles Michel too said in a tweet that the EU “stands in solidarity with Indian people amidst [the] resurgent #COVID19 pandemic”. He added the fight against the virus is a “common fight” and said the EU would discuss its support and cooperation at the India-EU Summit on May 8. Australian foreign minister Marise Payne extended solidarity to India “as it tackles this latest Covid-19 outbreak” and said in a tweet: “India’s generosity and leadership in providing vaccines to our region is appreciated. We will continue to work together closely to respond to this global crisis.” Meanwhile, China on Friday said it was holding talks with India on sending assistance to New Delhi to fight the surge in Coronavirus cases, a day after offering to help with support. “Based on the needs [of the] Indian side, we stand ready to offer support and assistance. We are now holding communications with the Indian side,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing. He didn’t give details of the assistance China intended to provide. India on Friday recorded the world’s highest daily tally of coronavirus cases for the second day in a row, with daily deaths too recording a jump. With 3,32,730 new cases, India’s total caseload crossed 16 million, and the official death toll rose by 2,263 to touch 186,920, according to health ministry data. As the cases surged, Canada announced it would temporarily bar passenger flights from India and Pakistan for 30 days as part of stricter measures to combat the spread of the Coronavirus. The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acted after prominent opposition politicians complained Ottawa hasn’t done enough to combat a third wave of infections in Canada. The ban will not affect cargo flights. Canada’s health minister Patty Hajdu said while Indian citizens accounted for 20% of all international arrivals, they represented more than 50% of positive tests conducted by Canadian authorities. “By eliminating direct travel from these countries, public health experts will have the time to evaluate the ongoing epidemiology of that region and to reassess the situation,” she said. France imposed a 10-day quarantine requirement for travellers from India, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and South Africa, while Indonesia on Friday announced a ban on all travellers from India that will come into force on April 25. “The government has decided to stop granting visas to foreign nationals who live in or have visited India in the past 14 days,” economic affairs minister Airlangga Hartarto, who heads Indonesia’s Covid-19 handling and economic recovery committee, told a news conference. Australia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, the US, Britain and New Zealand have imposed travel restrictions on India or issued advisories against travelling to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-eu-australia-extend-support-solidarity-to-india-amid-covid-19-surge-101619195576928.html
23-04-2021||World||Among Covid-19 survivors, an increased risk of death and serious illness: Study||Researchers have said people who have survived the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), including those who were not hospitalised, have an increased risk of death in the six months after their diagnosis. The research by experts at the Washington University School of Medicine in the US, published in the Nature journal on Thursday, also reveals the massive burden the coronavirus disease may place on the world's population in the coming years, they said."Our study demonstrates that up to six months after diagnosis, the risk of death following even a mild case of Covid-19 is not trivial and increases with disease severity. Physicians must be vigilant in evaluating people who have had Covid-19. These patients will need integrated, multidisciplinary care," senior author Ziyad Al-Aly, an assistant professor of medicine at Washington University School of Medicine, said.The researchers, after their study which involved more than 87,000 patients and nearly five million control patients, have also catalogued the numerous diseases associated with Covid-19, providing an overview of the long-term complications of the deadly disease. They confirmed that despite being initially a respiratory virus, long Covid-19 can affect nearly every organ system in the body.Also read | UK variant could be behind current Covid-19 surge in Delhi, says NCDC chiefThe researchers were able to calculate the potential scale of the problems first seen from anecdotal accounts and smaller studies that hinted at the wide-ranging side effects of surviving Covid-19 patients. These side effects include breathing problems, irregular heart rhythms, mental health issues and hair loss, they said. "This study differs from others that have looked at long Covid-19 because, rather than focusing on just the neurologic or cardiovascular complications, for example, we took a broad view and used the vast databases of the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to comprehensively catalogue all diseases that may be attributable to Covid-19," said Al-Aly.The researchers showed that Covid-19 survivors—after surviving the initial infection—beyond the first 30 days of illness had an almost 60 per cent increased risk of death over the following six months compared to the general population. The researchers noted that at the six-month mark, excess deaths among all Covid-19 survivors were estimated at eight people per 1000 patients. They said that among patients who were ill enough to be hospitalised with Covid-19 and who survived beyond the first 30 days of illness, there were 29 excess deaths per 1000 patients over the following six months.Also read | Tedros denounces Covid vaccine inequity as COVAX sharing scheme marks first year"These later deaths due to long-term complications of the infection are not necessarily recorded as deaths due to Covid-19. As far as total pandemic death toll, these numbers suggest that the deaths we are counting due to the immediate viral infection are only the tip of the iceberg," Al-Aly said.The researchers analysed data from the national health-care databases of the US department of veterans affairs—including 73,435 Veterans Health Administration (VHA) patients with confirmed Covid-19 but who were not hospitalised. Almost 5 million VHA patients, who did not have a Covid-19 diagnosis and were not hospitalised during this period, were included for comparison. The veterans were primarily or almost 88 per cent men but the large sample size meant that the study still included 8880 women with confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease.Also read | UK infections drop following Covid-19 vaccinations: ReportThe researchers said they analysed VHA data to conduct a separate analysis of 13,654 patients hospitalised with Covid-19 compared with 13,997 patients hospitalised with seasonal flu to help understand the long-term effects of more severe bout of the coronavirus disease. All patients survived at least 30 days after hospital admission and the analysis included six months of follow-up data.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/among-covid-19-survivors-an-increased-risk-of-death-and-serious-illness-study-101619190920916.html
23-04-2021||World||India in talks to end impasse on import of vaccine raw materials from US||The United States is committed to inoculating Americans “first and foremost”, the Biden administration has said defending restrictions on the export of raw materials for Covid-19 vaccines that could potentially slow down production of vaccines in India at a time when it is witnessing a deadly second wave.India has taken up the issue with the US at a high level and discussions are ongoing. India’s external affairs Minister S Jaishankar has spoken with his US counterpart Antony Blinken, foreign secretary Harsh Shringla has discussed it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman and ambassador Taranjit Singh Sandhu has raised it with the White House. Americans have promised to “give the matter due consideration” and work with India to “find appropriate solutions”, according to people familiar with these developments.Along with other high-income countries, the United States has also refused to back a proposal from India and South Africa allowing the World Trade Organization to grant a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights on Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and technologies to make them freely available around the world.“The United States first and foremost is engaged in an ambitious and effective and, so far, successful effort to vaccinate the American people,” State Department Spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Thursday when asked about the export restrictions on raw materials that is causing slowdown in the production of vaccines in India.The spokesperson went on to say that Americans need to be inoculated first having been hit the hardest by the pandemic. And, then he argued that it is “not only in our interest to see Americans vaccinated; it’s in the interests of the rest of the world to see Americans vaccinated”.Under the Defense Production Act (DPA), a war-time law that President Joe Biden invoked in February, American supplies of raw materials for Covid-19 vaccines are prioritised for American buyers to ramp up US availability of vaccines, which, in turn, has resulted in massive delays in shipments ordered by outside buyers, such as Indian vaccine maker Serum Institute of India (SII). Its owner-CEO Adar Poonawalla publicly raised the issue in a tweet, urging the US president to “lift the embargo”.US officials have insisted there is no explicit ban on the export of these raw materials. But, supplies of an estimated 35 categories of items needed by Indian makers of Covid-19 vaccines, are held up under the Defense Priorities and Allocations System Program (DPAS) of the DPA.These raw materials include reagents, plastic tubing material, nano-filters and bioreactor bags, which SII has said, are needed for making Novavax and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines (later is called Covishield in India).Price also sought to defend the US restrictions by pointing to commitments made by the Biden administration to COVAX, the WHO-led initiative to ensure free and equitable access to vaccines by every country and part funding of a Quad initiative under which India will manufacture up to 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by 2022-end for distribution in Indo-Pacific countries. Part of the funding will come from Japan, the third member of the group, and Australia, the fourth member, will take care of last-mile distribution. The US has announced an arrangement with neighbours Canada and Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-in-talks-to-end-impasse-on-import-of-vaccine-raw-materials-from-us-101619192276808.html
23-04-2021||World||Bitcoin sinks below $50,000 as cryptos stumble over Biden tax plans||Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies suffered hefty losses on Friday on concern that U.S. President Joe Biden's plan to raise capital gains taxes will curb investment in digital assets.The selloff came after reports that the Biden administration is planning a raft of proposed changes to the U.S. tax code, including a plan to nearly double taxes on capital gains to 39.6% for people earning more than $1 million.Bitcoin, the biggest and most popular cryptocurrency, slumped 5% to $48,8867, falling below the $50,000 mark for the first time since early March, while smaller rivals Ether and XRP fell around 7%.The tax plans jolted markets, prompting investors to book profits in stocks and other risk assets, which have rallied massively on hopes of a solid economic recovery. Levies on investment gains were reported to be in line for record increases."Bitcoin headed South today after President Biden signalled that he wanted to raise capital gains tax in the US," said Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst, Asia Pacific, at OANDA. "Now whether that happens or not, many bitcoin investors are probably sitting on some substantial capital gains if they stayed the course over the past year.""I firmly believe that developed market regulation and/or taxation remain the crypto markets' Achilles Heel," he added.Bitcoin is on track for a 15% loss on the week, though it is still up 65% since the start of the year. Ether dropped more than 10% on the day to as low as $2,107, a day after climbing to a record $2,645.97.But while social media lit up with posts about the plan hurting cryptocurrencies, and individual investors complaining about losses, some traders and analysts said declines are likely to be temporary."I don't think Biden's taxes plans will have a big impact on bitcoin," said Ruud Feltkamp, CEO at automated crypto trading bot Cryptohopper. "Bitcoin has only gone up for a long time, it is only natural to see a consolidation. Traders are simply cashing in on winnings."Others also remained bullish on bitcoin's long term prospects, but noted it might take time before prices start increasing again."There are reasons to believe the overall trend will remain bullish unless the price drops below $40k," said Ulrik Lykke, executive director at crypto hedge fund ARK36. "At the moment, we are not convinced that the trend will reverse into a bear market but we acknowledge it may take some time before the demand overtakes the supply again in the medium to short term."Shares of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase also fell around 4% to $282 in U.S. pre-market trading, marking the lowest level since its listing earlier this month. The listing had driven bitcoin prices to $65,000, before pulling back 25% in the following days."The Coinbase listing – the ultimate poacher-turned-gamekeeper moment - might have been the high watermark for Bitcoin," said Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Markets.com.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bitcoin-sinks-below-50-000-as-cryptos-stumble-over-biden-tax-plans-101619184240338.html

I wasn't given any medications....Thanks to you, now I have been examined by a concilium of civilian doctors twice.”Navalny said he would start “coming out of the hunger strike” on Friday and the process of ending it will take 24 days.The 44-year-old politician, who was arrested earlier this year and is serving a 2 ½-year sentence, began the hunger strike on March 31 to protest prison authorities' refusal to let his doctors visit after he developed severe back pain and numbness in his legs.Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs, but Navalny said he received effectively no treatment.On Wednesday night, another round of mass protests demanding his freedom swept across Russia. A top aide said Wednesday night's protests seemed to have brought a compromise from Russian authorities on getting Navalny the medical help he had demanded when launching the hunger strike.Navalny, who is President Vladimir Putin's most well-known critic, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russians-navalny-to-end-prison-hunger-strike-on-24th-day-101619181515578.html

We are now holding communications with the Indian side,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said to a question on the pandemic situation in India.Zhao did not give details of what kind of assistance China was willing to extend to India.Zhao said China and the Chinese people were with India in its fight against the pandemic. “For the recently deteriorating epidemic situation in India we send our sincere sympathies. The Chinese government and the people firmly support the Indian government and their people in their fight,” Zhao added. “We believe the Indian people will surely conquer the epidemic at an early date.”Earlier in the day, the foreign ministry told the Hindustan Times that it was willing to talk to India about its specific needs in fighting pandemic.The spike in Covid-19 cases has put medical infrastructure under severe strain with hospitals in parts of India running out of essential medical supplies including oxygen.Responding to a query from Hindustan Times about what kind of assistance Beijing was ready to offer to New Delhi, the Chinese foreign ministry said it was ready to talk to India about what it needs. “China is willing to communicate (on) specific matters with India according to its needs,” the ministry said in a one-line statement in Mandarin to HT earlier on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/holding-communications-with-india-on-pandemic-help-china-101619174756124.html
23-04-2021||World||Indonesian submarine lost at sea with less than a day's oxygen left. US joins search||Rescue teams from several countries were battling against time on Friday to find a missing Indonesian Navy submarine lost in the Bali Sea with 53 crew, which would be rapidly running out of oxygen if not already crushed by water pressure.Search helicopters and more navy ships left Bali and a naval base in Java at first light heading to the area where contact was lost with the 44-year-old KRI Nanggala-402 on Wednesday as it prepared to conduct a torpedo drill."The main priority is the safety of the 53 crew members," President Joko Widodo said late on Thursday.Indonesia's navy said it was investigating whether the submarine lost power during a dive and could not carry out emergency procedures as it descended to a depth of 600-700 metres, well beyond its survivable limits.An object with "high magnetic force" had been spotted "floating" at a depth of 50-100 metres, Indonesian Navy Chief of Staff Yudo Margono said, and an aerial search had earlier spotted an oil spill near the submarine's last location.If the submarine was still intact, officials said it would only have enough air to last about another 15 hours until early Saturday morning.The diesel-electric powered submarine could withstand a depth of up to 500 metres (1,640 ft) but anything more could be fatal, Navy spokesman Julius Widjojono said. The Bali Sea can reach depths of more than 1,500 metres.One of the people on board the boat was the commander of the Indonesian submarine fleet, Harry Setiawan.An Indonesian defence expert said the crew could still be found alive."But if the submarine is in a 700-metre sea trough, it will be difficult for them to survive because underwater pressure will cause cracks and ruptures of the steel hull," Connie Rahakundini Bakrie said.Distraught relatives await newsThe submarine joined the Indonesian fleet in 1981, according to the defence ministry, and underwent a refit in South Korea completed in 2012. It was said to be in good condition."I hope that they will be found alive," said Berda Asmara, the wife of crew member Guntur Ari Prasetyo, 39, who has sailed on the Nanggala for 10 years."We had a video call. He told me that he would go sailing and asked me to pray for him," she said of the last time they spoke.Australia, India, Malaysia, Singapore and the United States have sent specialised ships or aircraft in response to Indonesian requests for assistance.The US Defence Department is sending "airborne assets" to assist in the submarine search, a Pentagon spokesman said.Two Australian Navy ships were heading for the search area including a frigate with special sonar capabilities, the defence department said.Indonesia operates five submarines - two German-built Type 209s including Nanggala and three newer South Korean vessels.It has been seeking to modernise its defence capabilities but some of its equipment is old and there have been fatal accidents in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-submarine-lost-in-sea-with-less-than-a-day-s-oxygen-left-us-joins-search-101619172192490.html
23-04-2021||World||SpaceX launches 3rd crew in under year, fly on reused Falcon 9 rocket||SpaceX launched four astronauts toward orbit Friday using a recycled rocket and capsule, the third crew flight in less than a year for Elon Musk’s rapidly expanding company.The astronauts from the U.S., Japan and France should reach the International Space Station early Saturday morning, following a 23-hour ride in the same Dragon capsule used by SpaceX’s debut crew last May. They’ll spend six months at the orbiting lab.It was the first time SpaceX reused a capsule and rocket to launch astronauts for NASA, after years of proving the capability on station supply runs. The rocket was used last November on the company’s second astronaut flight.Embracing the trend, spacecraft commander Shane Kimbrough and his crew weeks ago wrote their initials in the rocket’s soot, hoping to start a tradition.For NASA astronaut Megan McArthur, it was a bit of deja vu. She launched in the same seat in the same capsule as her husband, Bob Behnken, did during SpaceX’s first crew flight. This time it was Behnken and their 7-year-old son waving goodbye. McArthur blew kisses and offered virtual hugs.Also flying SpaceX on Friday: Japan’s Akihiko Hoshide and France’s Thomas Pesquet, the first European to launch in a commercial crew capsule.A masked Musk met briefly with the astronauts at NASA’s Kennedy Space Center before they boarded white gull-winged Teslas from his electric car company. The astronauts’ spouses and children huddled around the cars for one last “love you” before the caravan pulled away and headed to the pad in the predawn darkness.Despite the early hour, spectators lined surrounding roads to watch the Falcon take flight an hour before sunrise. Liftoff was delayed a day to take advantage of better weather along the East Coast in case of a launch abort and emergency splashdown.NASA limited the number of launch guests because of Covid-19, but SpaceX’s next private passengers made the cut. Tech billionaire Jared Isaacman, who’s bought a three-day flight, watched the Falcon soar with the three people who will accompany him. Their capsule is still at the space station and due back on Earth with four astronauts next Wednesday. It will be refurbished in time for a September liftoff.For Friday’s automated flight, SpaceX replaced some valves and thermal shielding, and installed new parachutes on the capsule, named Endeavour after NASA’s retired space shuttle. Otherwise, the spacecraft is the same vehicle that flew before.“We’re thrilled to have a crew on Endeavour once again," SpaceX Launch Control radioed minutes before liftoff.The first-stage booster aimed for a touchdown on an ocean platform nine minutes after liftoff.Rapid reusability is critical to Musk’s effort to open space to everyone, land NASA’s next moonwalkers and, his loftiest goal by far, build a city on Mars.Musk will go a long way toward achieving that first objective with the private flight in September. It will be followed in October by SpaceX’s fourth crew launch for NASA.SpaceX picked up the station slack for NASA after the space agency’s shuttles retired in 2011, starting with supply runs the following year. The big draw was last year’s return of astronaut launches to Florida. “It’s awesome to have this regular cadence again,” said Kennedy’s director Robert Cabana, a former shuttle commander.Boeing, NASA’s other contracted crew transporter, isn’t expected to start launching NASA astronauts until early next year. First, it needs to repeat a test flight of an empty Starliner capsule, possibly in late summer, to make up for its software-plagued debut in December 2019.Last week, SpaceX beat out two other companies, including Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, to land astronauts on the moon for NASA in three or more years. They’ll descend to the lunar surface in Starship, the shiny, bullet-shaped rocketship that Musk is testing in the skies over Texas, with fiery, explosive results.“It’s a great time to be here, and we’re very excited,” the European Space Agency’s Frank De Winne, an astronaut turned manager, said shortly before liftoff. The space station eventually will come to an end, he noted, but the partnership will continue amid hopes of “European astronauts one day walking on the surface of the moon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/spacex-launches-3rd-crew-in-under-year-fly-on-reused-falcon-9-rocket-101619172088756.html
23-04-2021||World||Pakistan faces third Covid-19 wave. Low oxygen chokes Islamabad hospitals||Crisis looms large over major hospitals in Pakistan as they approach saturation due to rising Covid-19 cases. Pakistan is reeling under the third wave of coronavirus. The country has reported new 144 fatalities due to coronavirus, raising the total death tally to 16,842 on Friday. So far, 784,108 cases have been reported in Pakistan.The situation in Islamabad seems to be particularly precarious as the largest medical facility here, the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (PIMS), is struggling with low oxygen pressure amidst a tidal wave of Covid-19 patients, Geo reported.According to the latest data by the National Command and Operation Centre on its official web portal, 5,870 new coronavirus cases have been recorded in Pakistan, Geo News reported.At least 53,818 coronavirus tests were conducted across the country in the last 24 hours, out of which 5,870 came back positive.A critical situation was reported at PIMS on April 18, when ventilators reserved for coronavirus patients started sounding alarms.The ventilator alarms are triggered when the pressure of oxygen being supplied to a patient drops below the required level. On that day, it dropped from 100% to 70%.The incident caused panic at the facility as there were five patients on ventilators at the time in the coronavirus intensive care ward. At the time, there were 147 patients occupying the 183 beds allocated for Covid-19 patients at the hospital. A separate 30 patients were in the hospital's emergency ward.The situation was serious as most of the patients affected were dependent on 'high flow oxygen' for survival -- a medical condition where they need more oxygen in comparison to ordinary patients as they suffer from acute breathing difficulties.When contacted, Joint Executive Director PIMS Dr Minhaj-us-Siraj told Geo News that the drop in oxygen pressure was mainly attributable to the sharp increase in the number of coronavirus patients at the hospital and the need to continuously supply oxygen to them.The PIMS administration explained that the health facility's storage tank is in fact full of oxygen. The real issue is to maintain oxygen pressure as the oxygen supply lines running through the hospital are in excessive use owing to an unprecedented number of patients needing oxygen for life support.Among the hospitals catering to the capital city, the Federal Government and Social Security hospitals do not have proper arrangements for high flow oxygen beds, according to the health ministry.There is no ventilator available for Covid-19 patients at these facilities either.Recently, Pakistan Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar expressed concerns as Oxygen supply capacity in the country is now under stress and hospitals are filling up.Global covid cases exceeding 750,000 per day and deaths more than 13,000. We are seeing some of the worst numbers since covid started. Our neighbourhood in severe crises... Need for safety precautions greater than ever," Pakistan Minister for Planning, Development and Special Initiatives Asad Umar tweeted."Hospital fill up continuing to grow. Critical care patients now above 4500, which is 30% higher than the peak in June last year. Oxygen supply capacity in the country is now under stress. Sop compliance remains low. We are making a huge mistake by not following sop's," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-faces-third-covid-19-wave-low-oxygen-chokes-islamabad-hospitals-101619170172690.html

More than 3 million people have died in the pandemic.COVAX, which has shipped 40.5 million doses to 118 countries so far, aims to secure 2 billion doses by the end of 2021.On Thursday, COVAX, co-run by the Gavi Vaccine Alliance and WHO, said it was seeking to bolster its supplies of vaccines for poor countries from new manufacturers as it aims to mitigate supply problems of the AstraZeneca vaccine from India, its main shot so far."Low-income countries test less than 5% as much as high-income countries, and the majority of countries still have trouble accessing sufficient oxygen and dexamethasone," Tedros said. He was referring to an inexpensive steroid found to help patients suffering severe Covid-19, the only WHO-approved treatment for the disease.India reported the world's highest daily tally of coronavirus cases for a second day on Friday, surpassing 330,000 new cases, as it struggles with a health system overwhelmed by patients and plagued by accidents and lack of medical oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tedros-denounces-covid-vaccine-inequity-as-covax-sharing-scheme-marks-first-year-101619168203732.html

He will invite further collaboration with the private sector to counter the risk.“Without action it is increasingly clear that the key technologies on which we will rely for our future prosperity and security won’t be shaped and controlled by the West; we are now facing a moment of reckoning,” Fleming will say, according to extracts of his speech released by his office. “In the natural world, during a period of rapid change, the only option is to adapt. And it’s the same for us.”Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said in a briefing Friday in Beijing that the remarks are groundless and unreasonable. “The U.S., U.K. and others are the true empires of hacking,” he said.The U.K. should develop sovereign technologies in key areas like quantum, developing cryptographic technologies to protect sensitive information, Fleming will say. The country should also work with allies to build cyber defenses, according to the remarks.The U.K. characterizes Russia and China as different types of threat. In November, Ken McCallum, Director General of MI5 -- the U.K.’s homeland security branch -- said that while Russia might provide “bursts of bad weather” espionage activity by Chinese spies is “changing the climate”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-spy-chief-warns-of-china-russia-threats-to-web-freedom-101619168381717.html

23-04-2021||World||More than 100 Europe-bound migrants feared dead in shipwreck off Libyan coast||More than 100 Europe-bound migrants are feared dead in a shipwreck off the Libyan Mediterranean coast, independent rescue groups said.SOS Mediterranee, which operates the rescue vessel Ocean Viking, said late Thursday that the wreck of a rubber boat, which was initially carrying around 130 people, was spotted in the Mediterranean Sea northeast of the Libyan capital, Tripoli. The aid vessel did not find any survivors but could see at least ten bodies near the wreck, the group added in a statement.“We are heartbroken. We think of the lives that have been lost and of the families who might never have certainty as to what happened to their loved ones,” read the statement.In the years since the 2011 NATO-backed uprising that ousted and killed longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi, war-torn Libya has emerged as the dominant transit point for migrants fleeing war and poverty in Africa and the Middle East. Smugglers often pack desperate families into ill-equipped rubber boats that stall and founder along the perilous Central Mediterranean route.The European humanitarian organization added that more than 350 people have drowned in the sea so far this year, not counting the victims of this latest shipwreck.“States abandon their responsibility to coordinate Search and Rescue operations, leaving private actors and civil society to fill the deadly void they leave behind,” added the statement.Alarm Phone, a crisis hotline for migrants in distress in the Mediterranean, said in another statement that it had been in contact with the boast in distress for nearly ten hours before it capsized. Alarm Phone added that it had notified European and Libyan authorities of the GPS position of the boat but only non-state rescue groups actively searched for it.“The people could have been rescued but all authorities knowingly left them to die at sea,” they said in the statement.Alarm phone accused European authorities of refusing to coordinate a search operation, and instead laid full responsibility on the Libyan coastguard, who also declined to launch a rescue operation.In recent years, the European Union has partnered with Libya’s coast guard and other local groups to stem such dangerous sea crossings. Rights groups, however, say those policies leave migrants at the mercy of armed groups or confined in squalid detention centres rife with abuses.“These are the human consequences of policies which fail to uphold international law and the most basic of humanitarian imperatives,” tweeted Eugenio Ambrosi, Chief of Staff for the International Organization for Migration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/more-than-100-europe-bound-migrants-feared-dead-in-shipwreck-off-libyan-coast-101619167251916.html

France is with you in this struggle, which spares no one. We stand ready to provide our support," French Ambassador Emmanuel Lenin tweeted Macron's message on Friday.India has reported 3,32,730 new Covid-19 cases on Friday with 2,263 fatalities in the last 24 hours, as per the Union health ministry. The country's caseload has topped 1.62 crores. The death toll due to infection stands at 1,86,920.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in an address to the nation Tuesday evening, called the second Covid wave a "toofan" (storm) that has swept the country.The worsening Covid-19 situation has seen a surge in the demand for medical oxygen and beds for the Covid-19 patients and many states are reporting an acute shortage in essential medical supplies.Availability of oxygen is a key element in the treatment of certain medical conditions in the Covid-19 infection.With the Covid-19 situation worsening, many countries have imposed travel restrictions on travellers from India.France on Wednesday announced that it will impose a 10-day quarantine for travellers arriving from India in the coming days to prevent the spread of a Covid-19 variant found in India.The UAE has banned travel from India for 10 days from Sunday. Passengers who have transited through India in the last 14 days are also not permitted to board from any other point to the UAE, the Gulf News reported.Recently, the United Kingdom added India to its travel "red list" on a precautionary basis after reporting 103 cases of a coronavirus variant first identified in India. The Russian Embassy's visa section temporarily ceased its operations until further notice due to India's Covid-19 situation, it announced on Monday.As Covid-19 cases soar, the United States has also issued a 'Level 4 (Very High)' warning for potential travellers to India asking them to "avoid all travel" to the country even if they are fully vaccinated.Hong Kong on Tuesday announced the suspension of all flights connecting with India for 14 days amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the region. The authorities have also suspended flights from Pakistan and the Philippines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-pledges-solidarity-with-india-amid-covid-19-surge-101619157291071.html
23-04-2021||World||UK infections drop following Covid-19 vaccinations: Report||Covid-19 infections in adults of all ages fell by 65% after a first dose of AstraZeneca or Pfizer vaccine in UK research, which scientists said showed the real-world impact of the nation's immunisation campaign against the pandemic.Crucially, the research was conducted at a time when a new and more infectious variant of the coronavirus, called B1.1.7, was dominant in Britain, but still found vaccination was just as effective in elderly people and those with underlying health conditions as it was in the young and healthy."These real-world findings are extremely promising," health minister James Bethell said in a statement as the data were published. He said they showed Britain's COVID-19 vaccination programme - one of the world's fastest - was having a "significant impact".The data come from two studies that are part of the COVID-19 Infection Survey - a collaboration between Oxford University, the government's health department, and the Office of National Statistics. Both studies were published online as preprints on Friday and have not yet been peer-reviewed.The researchers analysed more than 1.6 million test results from nose and throat swabs taken from 373,402 study participants between Dec. 1, 2020 and April 3, 2021.They found that 21 days after a single dose of either the AstraZeneca or Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - with no second dose - rates of all new COVID-19 infections had dropped by 65%.This included a drop in symptomatic infections by 74% and a drop in infections with no reported symptoms by 57%.Reductions in overall infections and in symptomatic infections, were even greater after a second dose - 70% and 90% respectively - the study found, and were similar to effects in people who had previously had a COVID-19 infection.The second study looked at levels of antibodies to the SARS-CoV-2 virus to see how they changed after one dose of either vaccine, and after two Pfizer doses.Results showed that antibody responses to a single dose of either vaccine were slightly lower in older people, but high across all ages after two Pfizer doses.More than 33 million people in Britain have received a first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with more than 10 million having had two doses, official data showed on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-infections-drop-following-covid-19-vaccinations-report-101619155021740.html
23-04-2021||World||Ready to support India in its fight against Covid-19: China||China on Friday said it was willing to talk to India about what it needs to fight the massive surge in coronavirus cases, a day after offering to help New Delhi with necessary support and help.India reported 314,835 new coronavirus cases on Thursday (for the preceding 24 hours), the highest single-day tally recorded anywhere in the world since the pandemic started last year.India’s death toll from the disease rose 2,104 in the same time period.The spike in Covid-19 cases has put medical infrastructure under severe strain with hospitals in parts of India running out of essential medical supplies including oxygen.Responding to a query from Hindustan Times about what kind of assistance Beijing was ready to offer to New Delhi, the Chinese foreign ministry said it was ready to talk to India about what it needs. “China is willing to communicate (on) specific matters with India according to its needs,” the ministry said in a one-line statement in Mandarin to HT.It could not be ascertained if Beijing had officially conveyed to New Delhi its intention to extend help in fighting the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India.On Thursday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin had said that Beijing was aware that the epidemic in India had become severe, and that there was a temporary shortage of necessary materials for epidemic prevention.Wang was responding to a question from Chinese official media at the regular ministry briefing about what action China was taking in view of the spreading epidemic in India. “China is willing to provide the necessary support and help,” Wang had said, without giving details of what such assistance might consist of.“The novel coronavirus is a common enemy of all mankind, and the global community needs to unite as one to fight against epidemics,” he told the briefing.Last year, India was among the countries to help Beijing with medical supplies during the time when the Covid-19 outbreak was at its most severe in China.India had provided 15 tonnes of medical supplies comprising masks, gloves, and emergency medical equipment at a cost of about ₹2.11 crore to China at the time.In a written reply to a question in the Lok Sabha in March, 2020, external affairs minister of state V Muraleedharan had said the medical supplies included one lakh surgical masks, five lakh pairs of surgical gloves, 75 pieces of infusion pumps, 30 pieces of enteral feeding pumps, 21 pieces of defibrillator and 4,000 pieces of N-95 masks.The supplies, flown to China in an India Air Force’s C-17 special flight, were handed over to the Hubei charity federation in the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the first epicentre of the pandemic where the virus had emerged in early December, 2019.In February, 2020, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had written to President Xi Jinping extending India’s assistance to fight the coronavirus outbreak.Speaking at a press conference soon after, Chinese ambassador to India, Sun Weidong had appreciated the support and solidarity that India had extended to China in its fight against the novel coronavirus.China had returned the favour in April, dispatching dozens of aircraft with Covid-19-related medical supplies when the first wave of the pandemic became severe in India.India-bound flights had taken off from Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Xi’an and Hong Kong, carrying 390 tonnes of medical supplies including RT-PCR test kits, Rapid Antibody test kits and personal protection equipment.Soon after, however, ties between India and China had plunged to its worst in decades following military friction along the disputed border in eastern Ladakh.Nearly a year later, the two countries are still grappling to completely defuse the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ready-to-support-india-in-its-fight-against-covid-19-china-101619151355004.html
23-04-2021||World||Death by Zoom: Covid-19-hit Indonesia orders death penalties online||Indonesia has sentenced scores of prisoners to death over Zoom and other video apps during the pandemic in what critics say is an "inhumane" insult to those facing the firing squad.The Southeast Asian nation turned to virtual court hearings as Covid-19 restrictions shut down most in-person trials, including murder and drug trafficking cases, which can carry the death penalty.Since early last year, almost 100 inmates have been condemned to die in Indonesia by judges they could only see on a television monitor, according to Amnesty International.The Muslim-majority nation has some of the world's toughest drug laws and both Indonesian and foreign traffickers have been executed, including the masterminds of Australia's Bali Nine heroin gang.This month, 13 members of a trafficking ring, including three Iranians and a Pakistani, learned via video that they would be shot for smuggling 400 kilograms (880 pounds) of methamphetamine into Indonesia.And on Wednesday a Jakarta court sentenced six Islamist militants to death using a video app over their role in a 2018 prison riot that left five members of Indonesia's counter-terror squad dead."Virtual hearings degrade the rights of defendants facing death sentences -- it's about someone's life and death," said Amnesty International Indonesia director Usman Hamid."The death penalty has always been a cruel punishment. But this online trend adds to the injustice and inhumanity," he added.'Clear disadvantage'Indonesia has pressed on with the virtual hearings even as the number of executions and death sentences dropped globally last year, with Covid-19 disrupting many criminal proceedings, Amnesty said in its annual capital punishment report this week.Virtual hearings leave defendants unable to fully participate in cases that are sometimes interrupted in countries with poor internet connections, including Indonesia, critics say."Virtual platforms... can expose the defendant to significant violations of their fair trial rights and impinge on the quality of the defence," NGO Harm Reduction International said in a recent report on the death penalty for drug offences.Lawyers have complained about being unable to consult with clients due to virus restrictions.And families of the accused have sometimes been barred from accessing hearings that would normally be open to the public."These virtual hearings present a clear disadvantage for defendants," said Indonesian lawyer Dedi Setiadi.Setiadi, who defended several men sentenced to die in the methamphetamine case this month, said he would appeal their case on the grounds that virtual hearings were unfair.Relatives of the defendants were not given full access, the lawyer said.Death penalty cases are often reduced to long jail terms in Indonesia and an in-person trial might have brought about a less severe verdict, according to Setiadi, who described his clients as low-level players in the smuggling ring."The verdict could have been different if the judges had talked directly with the defendants and seen their expressions," he said."A Zoom hearing is less personal."'Heaviest sentence possible'Indonesia's supreme court, which ordered online hearings during the pandemic, did not reply to requests for comment.But the country's judicial commission told AFP that it has asked the top court to consider returning to in-person trials for serious offences, including capital cases.Indonesia appears to be an outlier in holding virtual trials for death penalty cases, although reliable data can be hard to come by in some nations that impose executions.Neighbouring Singapore, which executes convicted murderers and drug traffickers, has sentenced at least one person to hang via video since the global health crisis began.There are nearly 500 people, including scores of foreigners, awaiting execution in Indonesia, where condemned prisoners are marched to a jungle clearing, tied to a stake and shot.Indonesia has not carried out executions for several years. But its courts have continued to sentence defendants to death on the back of strong public backing for the ultimate punishment -- support that may have been bolstered by the pandemic."Advocates think that these criminals are continuing to commit crimes even during a time of crisis when everyone is suffering," Amnesty's Hamid said."So they must be given the heaviest sentence possible."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/death-by-zoom-covid-19-hit-indonesia-orders-death-penalties-online-101619149248767.html
23-04-2021||World||Covid: Japan to issue 'short, powerful' emergency for Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, Hyogo||Japan will declare "short and powerful" states of emergency for Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures, a cabinet minister said on Friday, as the country struggles to contain a resurgent pandemic just three months ahead of the Olympics.Under a new state of emergency for April 25 to May 11, the government will require restaurants, bars, and karaoke parlours serving alcohol to close, and big sporting events to be held without spectators, Economy Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said.Breaching the restrictions will in some cases carry penalties under a recently revised law, he said."We absolutely have to limit the movement of people, and we have to do it decisively," said Nishimura, speaking at the start of a meeting with a panel of experts to discuss the proposed measures."We need powerful, short and focused measures," he said, asking people to remember the lockdowns of last spring and stay at home.Nishimura later told reporters the panel had approved the government's plan. The new restrictions are expected to be formally approved later on Friday and announced by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga at an 8 p.m. (1100 GMT) news conference.Department stores and other retailers larger than 1,000 square metres will need to close while companies will be asked to make greater allowances for people to work-from-home.The state of emergency - a third round for Japan that would also include Kyoto and Hyogo - would last through the "Golden Week" holidays and cover nearly a quarter of the population, in a further hit to the tourism and services industries.Japan has so far avoided an explosive spread of the pandemic that has crippled many countries. There have been a total of about 550,000 cases and 9,761 deaths, which is significantly lower than the numbers seen in other large economies.But the latest rise in infections has stoked alarm with an explosive surge in the mutant variant and a critical shortage of hospital beds in some regions, while Japan's vaccination drive remains sluggish.Organisers of the Tokyo Motor Show on Thursday cancelled the marquee event for this year, in a move likely to raise more questions about the government's insistence that the Tokyo Olympics will go ahead this summer. Tokyo 2020 organisers said on the same day that a policeman who worked with the torch relay had tested positive for the virus, in a first for the event.Tokyo reported 861 new cases on Thursday, the most since Jan. 29, which was during the third wave of the pandemic and a previous state of emergency.Several other prefectures remain in a "quasi-emergency" state of targeted infection controls, and Nishimura said the duration would also be extended to May 11 for some.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-japan-to-issue-short-powerful-emergency-for-tokyo-osaka-kyoto-hyogo-101619147877883.html
23-04-2021||World||Intel PC chip sales grow but profit outlook dims due to manufacturing costs||Intel Corp on Thursday raised its annual sales outlook on booming demand for personal computers, but its second-quarter profit forecast fell short of analyst expectations as the company spends heavily to get its manufacturing operations back on track and catch up to rivals with faster chips.Intel shares were down 3.1% to $60.60 in after-hours trading after the results. The company also missed first-quarter expectations in its closely watched data center chip unit.Intel fumbled new manufacturing technology in recent years, causing it to fall behind rivals such as Advanced Micro Devices Inc and Nvidia Corp in the race to make faster, smaller chips. Patrick Gelsinger, who returned to Intel as its chief executive earlier this year, said the chipmaker has begun to resolve its manufacturing problems, and in March announced a major expansion plan to build new factories in the United States and Europe.Intel, which is one of the few remaining companies in the processor chip industry that both designs and manufactures its own chips, has said it has been able to beat out rivals during a global chip shortage by operating its own factories. But the company said shortfalls of other third-party components needed to build complete computers could hold back its sales this year.Intel said its PC chip business had sales of $10.6 billion in the first quarter, ahead of analyst expectations of $10.17 billion, according to data from FactSet.Gelsinger told Reuters following the release of Intel's earnings that the company exceeded PC chip expectations in part because it was able to finish in its own factories so-called organic substrates, which are materials used to package delicate silicon chips into tougher housings so they can tolerate being put onto circuit boards.Gelsinger said the changes helped Intel mitigate a global shortage of the substrate materials and "generate millions of units of more supply.""We were able to satisfy our customer commitments, as we expect that we'll be able to do through the rest of the year," Gelsinger said. "If we are able to gain more leverage in our supply chain, which we have lots of tools to go do, I expect we'll both have beat our guidance for the year and gain more market share for the year."But Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, said he expects PC "momentum to wane" as COVID-19 vaccines roll out around the world and workers return to offices.Intel said it expects 2021 adjusted revenue and profits of $72.5 billion and $4.60 per share, above analyst estimates of $72.32 billion and $4.58 per share, according to Refinitiv data.The chipmaker forecast second-quarter adjusted revenue and profits of $17.8 billion and $1.05 per share, with sales above analyst estimates of $17.59 billion but profits below estimates $1.09 per share, according to Refinitiv data.Intel Chief Financial Officer George Davis told Reuters that the lower profits were because the company was investing in ramping up its new 10-nanometer and 7-nanonmeter manufacturing technologies.But Kinngai Chan, senior research analyst at Summit Insights Group, said Intel's margins are taking a hit in part because it cannot raise prices for new products to recoup manufacturing costs as it did in the past because rivals like AMD have more competitive products.Demand for both personal computers and cloud computing services from data centers has surged during the pandemic as many businesses shifted to working from home, trends that analysts expect to continue into this year. Intel's data center chip business had $5.6 billion in first-quarter sales, below FactSet estimates of $5.89 billion.Intel said adjusted sales and earnings for the first quarter ended March 27 were $18.6 billion and $1.39 per share, higher than analyst estimates of $17.89 billion and $1.15 per share, according to Refinitiv data.Intel's non-adjusted results include a $2.18 billion judgment won by VLSI Technology LLC in a patent trial in March. Gelsinger said the company is appealing that verdict and pressing for changes to U.S. patent laws."We need fundamental patent reform. So not only are we going to be aggressive in our appeal, we're also going to be even more aggressive and driving a patent reform. This is a topic that I've brought up in my multiple conversations with White House officials this year," Gelsinger said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/intel-pc-chip-sales-grow-but-profit-outlook-dims-due-to-manufacturing-costs-101619145270956.html

The Reverend Al Sharpton will deliver the eulogy, as he did at Floyd's funeral last year.On Tuesday a Minneapolis jury convicted Derek Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the police force, on all three counts of murder and manslaughter for killing Floyd by pressing his knee into his neck for more than nine minutes last May.While Chauvin's conviction brought a measure of satisfaction to people calling for an end to brutality and racism in policing, to many Wright's death served as a reminder of the risks facing Black people during encounters with police.Police video of the shooting shows multiple officers attempting to arrest Wright for an outstanding warrant and an ensuing scuffle. The video then shows Kimberly Potter threatening to stun Wright with her Taser before firing her handgun. She can be heard saying she shot him a few moments later. Before resigning, former Police Chief Tim Gannon said Potter mistakenly used her gun instead of her Taser.Potter, who also resigned after the incident, has been charged with second-degree manslaughter. Potter has not entered a plea and her lawyer, Earl Gray, has not commented about the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daunte-wright-funeral-after-milestone-police-verdict-minneapolis-lays-to-rest-another-black-man-101619145297364.html
23-04-2021||World||'You get away with it now, but...': Greta Thunberg blasts politicians over climate crisis||Environmental campaigner Greta Thunberg assailed powerful politicians on Thursday for "ignoring" climate change, as she demanded an end to fossil fuel subsidies and implored the current generation of leaders to take the crisis more seriously.Speaking as world leaders gathered at a climate summit hosted by US President Joe Biden, the 18-year-old Thunberg warned that powerful interests and lawmakers were contributing to the "destruction" of living conditions around the globe."How long do you honestly believe people in power like you will get away with it?" the Swedish activist told US lawmakers at a House of Representatives committee hearing."How long do you think you can continue ignoring the climate crisis, the global aspect of equity and historic emissions without being held accountable?" she asked."You get away with it now, but sooner or later people are going to realize what you have been doing all this time."Thunberg, the world's foremost young climate activist, has addressed members of the US Congress before, at a hearing in 2019.But Thursday's remarks coincided with Biden's Earth Day Climate Summit, in which he committed to aggressive new goals for reducing emissions.As leaders like China's President Xi Jinping, Russia's Vladimir Putin and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi expressed commitments to reduce emissions, Thunberg said global action still fell far short of where it should be."It is the year 2021. The fact we are still having this discussion and even more that we are still subsidizing fossil fuels directly or indirectly using taxpayer money is a disgrace," she said."It is proof that we have not understood the climate emergency at all."She also directly accused the current generation of politicians of "giving up without even trying," adding: "Well, I'm here to tell you that unlike you, my generation will not give up without a fight."Thunberg in particular criticized the continued use of fossil fuel subsidies, which in the United States have been on the books for more than 100 years, even though Washington committed in 2009 to bringing them to an end.She also showed her willingness to confront -- and even mock -- world leaders.When British Prime Minister Boris Johnson addressed the summit, he said it was vital to think of the climate change fight as a challenge to boost growth and jobs, not merely as "some expensive politically correct green act of bunny hugging."Thunberg promptly changed her Twitter bio to a two-word description: "Bunny hugger."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/you-get-away-with-it-now-but-greta-thunberg-blasts-politicians-over-climate-crisis-101619143592232.html
23-04-2021||World||WHO experts want AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine clot data from outside Europe||The World Health Organization's vaccine advisors called Thursday for more data on the incidence of blood clots in people who received the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine outside Europe.The WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on Immunisation updated their guidance on the use of AstraZeneca's coronavirus jab, rewriting the section on precautions in light of data from Europe on clotting."WHO continues to support the conclusion that the benefits of these vaccines outweigh the risks," the UN agency stressed in a statement.On April 7, SAGE said a link between AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jabs and blood clots was plausible but unconfirmed, underlining that reported occurrences were "very rare".In light of evidence emerging from ongoing vaccination programmes, they have updated their recommendations on the AstraZeneca jab, which is being deployed in 157 territories according to an AFP count.SAGE said most clotting cases were reported in Britain and the European Union, with very few cases noted in other countries.They said it was unknown whether there was a risk of clotting from the second dose of the vaccine, while recommending that those who suffered blood clots after their first injection should not be given the second dose of the two-shot vaccine.'Very rare syndrome'"A very rare syndrome of blood clotting combined with low platelet counts, described as thrombosis with thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS), has been reported around four to 20 days following vaccination," the new guidance says."A causal relationship between the vaccine and TTS is considered plausible although the biological mechanism for this syndrome is still being investigated."Most of these cases were reported from the UK and the EU. There is considerable geographic variation with regards to the reported incidence, with very few cases reported from non-European countries, despite extensive use of the vaccine."An estimation of the risk outside Europe needs further data collection and analysis."The vaccine currently forms the backbone of the Covax scheme, which ensures that poorer countries can access doses, with donors covering the cost.Covax has so far shipped more than 40.5 million Covid-19 vaccine doses to 118 participating territories.The SAGE guidance said that data from Britain, dated March 31, suggested the risk of TTS was approximately one case per 250,000 vaccinated adults, while the rate in the EU was estimated at one in 100,000.It said current data from Europe suggested that the risk might be higher in younger adults compared with older adults."No specific risk factors have yet been identified," it said.Incidence by region, age, sexWhilst stressing that the benefit of vaccination against Covid-19 "far outweighs" the risks, the assessment may differ between countries."Countries should consider their epidemiological situation, individual and population-level risks, availability of other vaccines, and alternate options for risk mitigation," the guidance said."The benefit-risk ratio is greatest in older age groups."It is currently unknown whether there is a risk of TTS following the second dose."The safety surveillance and monitoring section was also rewritten,recommending research into serious adverse events including cerebral venous sinus thrombosis and thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia.It also called for research into the incidence of TTS by region, age and sex.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-experts-want-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-clot-data-from-outside-europe-101619137637265.html
23-04-2021||World||Owner calls 911 after couple intrude into Florida mansion to conduct wedding||A Florida couple who planned their wedding at a multimillion-dollar mansion near Miami thought they could get hitched without a hitch until one tiny detail got in the way: the owner was home and had no idea about their party.Courtney Wilson and Shenita Jones, referring to themselves as "the Royal Couple," invited friends and family to the "dream home and estate," which includes a tennis court, pool and theater, plus nine bedrooms and 15 bathrooms, the local Sun Sentinel newspaper reported Wednesday.With the $5.7 million mansion up for sale, Wilson, the groom, visited it several times, taking photos and pretending to be interested in buying it.Assuming no one lived at the vacant home, he invited guests to his wedding and related festivities, which included a red-carpet cocktail on Saturday afternoon and a breakfast on Sunday morning, the paper reported.Owner Nathan Finkel, who lives elsewhere on the property, was therefore up for a surprise when the groom and another person arrived Saturday morning ready to set up."I have people trespassing on my property," an irritated Finkel told a 911 dispatcher, according to the paper. "And they keep harassing me, calling me. They say they're having a wedding here and it's God's message."I don't know what's going on. All I want is (for) it to stop.

23-04-2021||World||NASA's Mars helicopter soars higher, longer on 2nd flight||NASA's little Mars helicopter aced its second test flight Thursday, soaring even higher and longer than before.The 4-pound (1.8-kilogram) chopper, named Ingenuity, hovered longer and also flew side to side this time, according to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. It achieved the intended altitude of 16 feet (5 meters) and even accelerated sideways 7 feet (2 meters).This hop lasted 52 seconds, 13 seconds longer than the first one.“Go big or go home!” JPL tweeted in announcing the Earth Day news.Also Read: NASA's Perseverance Mars rover extracts first oxygen from Red PlanetThe success came just three days after Ingenuity made the first powered flight by an aircraft on another planet. The helicopter carried a bit of wing fabric from the Wright Flyer that made similar history at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 1903.Flight controllers had to wait four hours before learning Thursday's outcome. Like it did during Monday's 10-foot-high (3-meter-high) hop, the helicopter sent back a black and white photo showing its shadow against the dusty, rock-strewn surface now known as Wright Brothers Field.“It sounds simple, but there are many unknowns regarding how to fly a helicopter on Mars," Ingenuity's chief pilot, Havard Grip, said from JPL in a statement. “That's why we're here — to make these unknowns known.”One of the challenges is the planet's extremely thin atmosphere — 1% that of Earth's.NASA plans up to three more test flights in the next 1 1/2 weeks, venturing higher each time with more complicated acrobatics. Ingenuity hitched a ride to Mars on the rover Perseverance, which photographed the proceedings from more than 200 feet (64 meters) away. The rover team allotted one month for the $85 million tech demo; The clock started ticking when Ingenuity was released from Perseverance's belly on April 3.“We have two flights of Mars under our belts, which means that there is still a lot to learn during this month of Ingenuity," chief engineer Bob Balaram said in a statement.Perseverance and Ingenuity arrived at Mars in mid-February, landing in an ancient river delta following a 6 1/2-month flight.Once Ingenuity's flights are complete, Perseverance will set off on its journey to find any signs of past microscopic life. A robotic geologist, the rover will collect core samples of the most enticing rocks and set them aside for pickup by a future spacecraft a decade from now.In another first, an experiment on the rover successfully converted Mars' carbon-dioxide-rich atmosphere into pure oxygen this week. Five grams of oxygen was produced, according to NASA, the equivalent of 10 minutes of breathing for an astronaut. Large-scale production at Mars could yield oxygen not only for air, but also rocket fuel. More tests are planned over the next two years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-mars-helicopter-soars-higher-longer-on-2nd-flight-101619137314924.html
23-04-2021||World||Alexei Navalny's doctors urge him to end hunger strike 'immediately'||Imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny said in an emotional message from behind bars Thursday that he felt “pride and hope” after learning from his lawyer about the mass protests demanding his freedom that swept across Russia the previous night.Meanwhile, Navalny's doctors urged him to “immediately” end a prison hunger strike now in its fourth week “to save his life and health.” And a top aide said Wednesday night’s protests seemed to have brought a compromise from Russian authorities on getting Navalny the medical help he had demanded when launching the hunger strike.In an Instagram post Thursday, Navalny called people who turned out to protest in his support “the salvation of Russia."The 44-year-old who is President Vladimir Putin's most well-known critic said he hadn't known “what was really happening” outside the prison because he only has access to one TV channel, but his lawyer visited him Thursday and brought him up to speed. “And, I will sincerely say, two feelings are raging inside me: pride and hope.”“People are marching in the street. It means they know and understand everything," said Navalny. "They won't give up their future, the future of their children, their country. Yes, it will be difficult and dark for some time. But those pulling Russia back historically are doomed. There are more of us in any case.”Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject.Soon after, a court found that the politician’s stay in Germany violated the terms of his suspended sentence for a 2014 embezzlement conviction and ordered him to serve 2 1/2 years in prison.The mass street protests in support of Navalny — which authorities had declared unlawful — swept dozens of cities and smaller towns across Russia. The largest crowds were seen in Moscow, where thousands marched down the city center amid a heavy police presence.Yet unlike on past occasions, officers in riot gear didn't interfere with the rally in the Russian capital, allowing crowds to swarm streets and squares for hours. According to OVD-Info, a rights group that monitors political arrests, police detained only 31 people in Moscow, which usually accounts for the vast majority of arrests across the country.But overall, OVD-Info tallied more than 1,900 arrests Wednesday night, with more than 800 in St. Petersburg. While some violent detentions, with police using stun guns, were reported in St. Petersburg, in many cities the demonstrations went on without clashes with law enforcement.Leonid Volkov, Navalny's top strategist and chief of staff, noted in the YouTube live stream that the number of arrests was significantly lower than during the nationwide protests in January after Navalny was arrested.Independent political analyst Abbas Gallyamov believes the turnout at Wednesday's protests indicates that the harsh Russian crackdown on previous demonstrations hasn't scared off Navalny's supporters.Hundreds were jailed after the January demonstrations and Navalny allies were slapped with criminal charges for allegedly violating coronavirus restrictions.Navalny’s aides and associates in different Russian regions, in the meantime, were targeted with detentions and raids both before and after Wednesday's protests. Many were jailed, and one was reportedly brutally beaten by police who came to search his apartment.Gallyamov said this indicated a change of tactics for the authorities, from sweeping crackdowns on all demonstrators to targeting suspected protest leaders.Last week, Russian authorities took the pressure on Navalny’s allies and supporters to a new level, with the Moscow prosecutor’s office petitioning a court to label as his Foundation for Fighting Corruption and his network of regional offices as extremist groups. Human rights activists say such a move would paralyze their activities and expose their members and donors to prison sentences of up to 10 years.Navalny began the hunger strike to protest prison authorities’ refusal to let his doctors visit after he developed severe back pain and numbness in his legs. Officials insisted Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs. But Navalny's doctors said last week that the politician could be near death, as his test results showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicated impaired kidneys.Navalny was transferred Sunday from a penal colony east of Moscow to the hospital ward of another prison in Vladimir, a city 180 kilometers (110 miles) east of the capital.On Thursday, Navalny's personal physician Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva released a letter she signed with four other doctors, urging him to end his hunger strike.The letter revealed that Navalny was taken to a regular hospital Tuesday in Vladimir, where he underwent tests and was examined by specialists “in accordance” with requests from his doctors. It said they were given the results of those tests through Navalny’s lawyers and family on Thursday.Navalny’s doctors said they would continue to insist on access to their patient — his chief demand in launching his hunger strike — but urged him “to immediately stop the hunger strike in order to save life and health,” saying that they consider being examined by “civilian,” non-prison doctors and undergoing “objective tests” enough to end the strike.Volkov in a tweet Thursday said the pressure Navalny’s supporters put on the authorities, first by calling a demonstration and then by making it happen, helped achieve this result.“As soon as the protest was announced, Alexei was taken for a multidisciplinary medical exam to a civilian hospital in Vladimir, and had a large amount of tests. As soon as the protest happened, today, all of a sudden, we were given all the test results.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-s-doctors-urge-him-to-end-hunger-strike-immediately-101619136921431.html
23-04-2021||World||UNSC expresses 'deep concern' about human rights in Ethiopia's Tigray||The UN Security Council expressed concern Thursday about humanitarian conditions and human rights in Ethiopia's Tigray region, marking the council's first collective comment on the conflict that has raged in the region for six months.The statement made no mention of Eritrean soldiers in Tigray, though UN humanitarian chief Mark Lowcock and Amnesty International said last week that the troops remain weeks after Ethiopia said they would leave. US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters Wednesday that “we haven’t seen any evidence that Eritrean troops are withdrawing from Tigray."In November, political tensions between Ethiopian President Abiy Ahmed’s government and Tigray leaders exploded into war. Eritrea teamed up with neighboring Ethiopia in the conflict. Thousands of people have been killed.The United States has alleged ethnic cleansing in the western part of Tigray, a claim that Ethiopian authorities dismiss as unfounded. The term refers to forcing a population from a region through expulsions and other violence, often including killings and rapes.Ethiopia has said that life in Tigray is returning to normal.Lowcock, meanwhile, told the council last week that some 4.5 million of Tigray's 6 million need humanitarian aid and that “there is no doubt that sexual violence is being used in this conflict as a weapon of war." He cited alarmingly numerous reports of rape and other sexual attacks, mainly by men wearing the uniforms of various forces.In Thursday's statement, the council conveyed “deep concern about allegations of human rights violations and abuses, including reports of sexual violence.” It welcomed an agreement by the UN and an Ethiopian rights agency to conduct a joint investigation into reported abuses.The council also acknowledged Ethiopia’s humanitarian efforts but called for a bigger response, unfettered humanitarian access to everyone in need and “a restoration of normalcy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unsc-expresses-deep-concern-about-human-rights-in-ethiopia-s-tigray-101619136520916.html

It did not detail whether the attack caused casualties.The rockets struck areas known to contain Iraqi security forces. One hit close to a central prison, the second near an academy of the elite Counter-Terrorism Service, and a third near the headquarters of the Rapid Response regiment.No one claimed responsibility for the attacks. US officials have previously blamed Iran-backed militia groups.It is the latest in a string of rocket attacks that have primarily targeted American installations in Iraq in recent weeks. On Sunday, multiple rockets hit an Iraqi airbase just north of Baghdad, wounding two Iraqi security personnel.Last month, a base in western Iraq housing US-led coalition troops and contractors was hit by 10 rockets.

On this #EarthDay, I am proud that science is back in the White House," Harris wrote in a tweet on Thursday."No nation or region is immune to climate change. So as a global community, it is imperative that we act quickly and together to confront this crisis," she added.Earlier in the day, US President Joe Biden announced that the United States would cut its greenhouse gas emissions by half by 2030 as part of the country's efforts to combat climate change.Biden also urged world leaders to significantly accelerate their own plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or risk a disastrous collective failure to stop catastrophic climate change.Every year on April 22, Earth Day marks the anniversary of the birth of the modern environmental movement since 1970.The fight for a clean environment continues with increasing urgency, as the ravages of climate change become more and more apparent every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/proud-that-science-is-back-in-white-house-says-kamala-harris-on-world-earth-day-101619136208407.html
23-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Canada suspends flights from India, Pakistan for 30 days||Canada on Thursday said it is banning all flights from India and Pakistan for 30 days due to the growing wave of COVID-19 cases in that region.Transport Minister Omar Alghabra said the ban would start late Thursday, speaking hours after India reported a global record of more than 314,000 new infections in the previous 24-hours. Cargo flights from India and Pakistan will continue.Health Minister Patty Hajdu said half the people who are testing positive for the coronavirus after arriving in Canada by airplane came from India. Flights from India account for about one fifth of the country's air traffic.There also a disproportionate higher number of positive cases among those travelling on flights from Pakistan, she said.“It makes sense to pause travel from that region while our scientists and researchers better understand the variants of interest," Hajdu said.There are than 1 million people who live in Canada who have Indian descent. There are 100,000 Canadians who have Pakistani ancestry.Canada does not have any direct flights from Brazil where cases are also surging.Vaccinations have ramped up in Canada, but health experts say more-contagious variants and a failure to take the right measures against the virus have led to a third wave of infections in Ontario. The premiers of Ontario and Quebec asked the federal government to further restrict people from entering.Ontario Premier Doug Ford, meanwhile, apologized Thursday for a failed attempt to close playgrounds and allow police to stop and question people who were not in their homes — measures that created a backlash from police forces, health officials and the public.The leader of Canada’s most populous province, in his first public appearance since announcing the restrictions, said his government had moved too fast with the measures."They left a lot of people angry and upset. I know we got it wrong. I know we made a mistake and for that I’m sorry and sincerely apologize,” said Ford, who appeared to choke back tears at one point.But Ford said he won’t resign despite widespread calls for him to do so.He also suggested his government will offer province-paid paid sick leave for Covid-19 patients, but announced no details. The lack of such a program has led to widespread complaints.The pandemic restrictions Ford's government announced last Friday immediately ran into opposition. Police departments insisted they wouldn’t use new powers to randomly stop pedestrians or motorists and doctors complained the rules focused on outdoor activities like playgrounds and golf rather than more dangerous indoor settings.Restaurants, gyms and classrooms across the province already had been closed. Most nonessential workers are working from home.On Saturday, Ford retracted the ban on playgrounds, though outdoor recreation activities such as golf remain forbidden in Ontario, the only jurisdiction in North America that now bans it.Ontario has been reporting more than 4,000 new cases a day in recent days.Ford himself is isolating after a staff member tested positive.“Doug Ford knows he's spiraling and that Ontario voters have lost confidence in his ability to manage this emergency. But "Sorry, folks" won't cut it," Opposition Liberal leader Steven Del Duca tweeted. “His cold hearted refusal to introduce paid sick days for more than a year has already cost lives.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-suspends-flights-from-india-pakistan-for-30-days-101619135502307.html
23-04-2021||World||Covid-19 hits a new peak, infects climber on Everest||Norwegian climber hoping to summit Everest has confirmed that he has tested positive for Covid-19, in a blow to Nepal’s hopes for a bumper mountaineering season on the world’s highest peak.The pandemic wiped out last year’s season, but Nepal has eased quarantine rules in an effort to attract more climbers despite the difficulties of treating them if they contract the deadly disease.“My diagnosis is Covid-19,” Erlend Ness told AFP in a Facebook message. “I’m doing ok now... The hospital is taking care (of me).” Ness was evacuated from the slopes by helicopter and taken to a hospital in Kathmandu after spending time at Everest base camp. Norwegian broadcaster NRK, which interviewed him, reported that a sherpa in his party has also tested positive.“I really hope that none of the others get infected... high up in the mountains. It is impossible to evacuate people with a helicopter when they’re above 8,000 metres,” Ness told NRK. Breathing is already difficult at high altitudes, so any outbreak of disease among climbers presents urgent health risks.“The plan was to get fast high up in the mountains to make sure that we wouldn’t get infected... I’ve been unlucky and I could have done more by myself when it comes to sanitary precautions,” Ness added.One hospital in Kathmandu confirmed it had taken in patients from Everest who had contracted the coronavirus disease but couldn’t give a number.“I can’t share the details, but some evacuated from Everest have tested positive,” Prativa Pandey, the medical director at Kathmandu’s CIWEC Hospital, told AFP. But Mira Acharya, a spokesperson for Nepal’s tourism department, said it has so far not received any reports of Covid-19 among climbers.Dawa Steven Sherpa of Asian Trekking said everyone at base camp was concerned. Nepal issued 377 permits this year to climb the mountain, and the final number is expected to exceed 381 handed out in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hits-a-new-peak-infects-climber-on-everest-101619118525759.html
23-04-2021||World||Russia set to pull troops back from Ukraine border||Russia said it will begin pulling thousands of troops back from areas near the Ukrainian border starting on Friday, in a step that could calm tensions with the West that have surged in recent weeks.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy welcomed the move, saying in a tweet it “reduces tension”.The military units will return to their bases by May 1, Russian defence minister Sergei Shoigu said on Thursday in Crimea, where he’s on a visit to review manoeuvres.“The goals of these surprise checks were fulfilled completely. The forces showed their ability to reliably defend the country,” he told commanders, announcing the end of the operation. “The military activity of Nato in this region has significantly increased.”Western officials say Russia moved as many as 100,000 troops, as well as tanks, warplanes and other equipment, to areas near the border with Ukraine in recent weeks, the largest such build-up in years. The US and its European allies called on the Kremlin to pull the forces back, but Moscow said it’s free to deploy its military wherever needed on its territory.‘Moscow got its message across’“Moscow thinks that it got its message across,” said Fyodor Lukyanov, head of the Council on Foreign and Defence Policy, which advises the Kremlin. “There’s been some de-escalation and now the confrontation has returned to the political and diplomatic sphere.”There was no immediate sign the withdrawal would take place as announced and Russia has changed plans in the past. The defence ministry said it would leave the tanks and other equipment of one of the major units in the area near the border ahead of exercises planned for the fall.Amid the crisis, US President Joe Biden called Vladimir Putin to appeal to the Russian leader to reduce tensions, offering the prospect of a summit meeting.Russia denied its build-up was a threat to Ukraine, but the Kremlin had charged the government in Kiev with planning an assault on Donbas separatist regions in the east of the country that are backed by Moscow. The Ukrainian government rejected those claims and accused Moscow of planning a military incursion of its own.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-set-to-pull-troops-back-from-ukraine-border-101619118412395.html
23-04-2021||World||Pak Taliban behind blast in Quetta||The Pakistani Taliban has claimed responsibility for Wednesday night’s deadly suicide blast at a luxury hotel hosting the Chinese ambassador in the southwest of the country, as the death toll went up to five.A bomber detonated the explosives while inside a vehicle in the car park of Serena Hotel - part of a five-star chain popular with diplomats and aid agencies - in the city of Quetta, capital of Balochistan province, police and the interior ministry said.Pakistan is fighting several low-level insurgencies in the impoverished province, waged by Islamist, separatist and sectarian groups.“The suicide bomber hit the security officials exactly as it was planned,” the spokesperson for Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) said in a statement.The country’s interior minister confirmed a suicide bomber had carried out the attack and pinned the blame on a “foreign hand”. “Our agencies will fight the efforts that are being made in the neighbouring country to reorganise the TTP,” said interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed.Pakistan routinely accuses India of using insurgent groups, including in Afghanistan, as proxy forces to wage an ongoing shadow war between the arch rivals.China was among the first countries to react following the explosion, saying it strongly condemned the attack, although the Taliban said Pakistan security officials were the target of the blast.Describing the blast as a “terrorist attack”, China’s foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin confirmed in Beijing that a Chinese delegation was not present when the bomb detonated. Gu Wenliang, agriculture commissioner at China’s embassy in Pakistan, told Chinese newspaper Global Times that the bomb had detonated 10 minutes before their expected return.“I was walking through the car park when I heard a sudden loud sound and the earth shook under my feet,” said Khuda Baksh, a guard at the hotel. “Everyone was running for their lives before I lost consciousness.”For years, the TTP unleashed deadly attacks on urban centres across Pakistan from their bases along the Afghan border, where they provided shelter to an array of global jihadist groups including al-Qaeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-taliban-behind-blast-in-quetta-101619118259564.html
23-04-2021||World||EU looks to sue AstraZeneca over jab||The European Commission is looking to launch legal action against AstraZeneca for under-delivering Covid-19 vaccine doses to the EU, hobbling the bloc’s early roll-out of jabs, diplomats said on Thursday.The EU executive informed member state envoys of its plans on Wednesday, the diplomats told AFP, confirming information first published by the Politico website.They said any lawsuit against AstraZeneca would begin in a Belgian court - the jurisdiction agreed under the commission’s contract with the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company.A European Commission spokesman, Eric Mamer, told journalists that “no decision has yet been taken”. Another spokesman, Stefan De Keersmaecker, added, “As you know, AstraZeneca is not delivering the number of doses which have been agreed upon in the contract... This is one of the reasons why we keep our options open together with member states to take any further steps.”AstraZeneca has so far delivered 31 million of the 120 million doses it had promised. It has warned it will likewise provide just 70 million of the 180 million more meant to be delivered over the rest of this year.US weekly jobless claims fall to one-year lowThe number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits last week dropped to a one-year low, suggesting layoffs were subsiding and strengthening expectations for another month of job growth in April.But the labour market recovery has a long way to go, with the report from the labour department showing at least 17.4mn people were collecting unemployment checks in early April.Initial claims for unemployment benefits decreased 39,000 to a seasonally adjusted 547,000 for the week ended April 17, the lowest since mid-March 2020.Pressure on US to lift IPR protections on vaccinesThe Biden administration is weighing an appeal from progressive Democrats to accelerate global access to Covid-19 vaccines by supporting a waiver of IPR protections, a move opposed by big drugmakers.Lawmakers last week called on President Joe Biden to back a proposal before the WTO that seeks a broad waiver from obligations on the protection of IP rights. The lawmakers and allies including labour unions argue that the plan - backed by India, South Africa, and more than 50 other countries - would save more lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-looks-to-sue-astrazeneca-over-jab-101619118096210.html
