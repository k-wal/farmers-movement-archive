"President Biden has made it clear and I've made it clear: none of the other issues we have with China -- and there are issues -- is held hostage to or is engaged in a trade for what we need to do on climate."Sino-U.S. relations have been strained in recent years by disagreements about trade, China's treatment of its Uighur minority, as well as China's actions in Taiwan and Hong Kong.China has pledged to become carbon neutral by 2060 while U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is expected to announce a new target for reducing emissions at a global climate summit on April 22.Kerry will take part in a climate dialogue for the Middle East and North Africa hosted by Abu Dhabi on Sunday. The UAE said the dialogue would focus on national and regional preparations ahead of a United Nations climate summit to be held in Glasgow in November.Kerry said the countries would discuss how to reduce a reliance on coal, as well as how to "raise ambitions" on climate change ahead of November's conference."I think the next generations are screaming at us to fulfill our promise," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hopeful-it-can-work-with-china-to-tackle-climate-change-says-john-kerry-101617470797285.html

In Bristol, southwest England, demonstrations have turned violent with officers and a police station bombarded with bricks and glass bottles and police vehicles set on fire.Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticised what he described as "disgraceful attacks" on officers, but protesters have accused police of using heavy-handed tactics.Days of protests by Extinction Rebellion, which paralysed parts of London in early 2019, fuelled calls from some politicians for the police to be given the tougher powers to prevent excessive disruption.Demonstrations had not been permitted while a coronavirus lockdown was in place, but restrictions were eased this week, meaning the rallies could go ahead providing they were "COVID secure".In London, police warned, "enforcement action will be taken, if needed, in the interests of public health". Some senior officers have said the "kill the bill" tag was deliberately provocative as "the bill" is a nickname in Britain for the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-join-kill-the-bill-rallies-across-uk-against-proposed-protest-law-101617470540180.html
03-04-2021||World||Noah Green, US Capitol attacker, was a supporter of ‘Nation of Islam’. Here's all you need to know||US law enforcement officials identified the suspect who attacked Capitol police officers as Noah Green, a 25-year-old who described himself as a follower of the 'Nation of Islam'. Green recently posted on his Facebook account, which has now been taken down by the social media network, that he had been unemployed and facing fear, hunger, and loss of wealth. The messages were captured by the SITE Intelligence Group, which monitors jihadist media and tracks online activity.“To be honest these past few years have been tough, and these past few months have been tougher,” he wrote. “I have been tried with some of the biggest, unimaginable tests in my life. I am currently now unemployed after I left my job partly due to afflictions, but ultimately, in search of a spiritual journey,” the post read.In another Facebook post, Green said he believed that the founder of Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan, was “the Messiah”. “I consider him my spiritual father. Without his guidance, his word, and his teachings that I’ve picked up on along the way, I would’ve been unable to continue,” he wrote.Anti-hate organization ADL has described Farrakhan as an anti-Semite who has been railing against Jews, white people and the LGBT community for more than 30 years. Farrakhan’s speeches draw thousands of attendees, which, according to ADL, gives him the dubious distinction of being quite possibly America’s most popular anti-Semite.Also Read | Officer killed in attack outside Capitol identified as an 18-year veteranGreen had also reportedly called the US government “#1 enemy of Black people!" in one of his Instagram posts. Facebook confirmed to Business Insider in an email statement that the social media network has removed Green’s account.“We have designated the incident under our Dangerous Individuals and Organizations policy, which means we have removed the suspect's accounts from Facebook and Instagram, and are removing any content that praises, supports, or represents the attack or the suspect," a Facebook spokesperson was quoted by the Insider as saying.According to a Washington Post report, Green blamed his former roommates and teammates of the Christopher Newport University football team for drugging him with Xanax. Green’s brother, Brendan told the Post that Noah had recently called him asking for help, saying he was “in a really bad situation and in really bad shape.”Following the deadly attack, law enforcement officials had said that the incident did not appear to be linked to terrorism. However, Ria Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, said that Greene's social media presence suggests he might have been very troubled, but terrorism should not be ruled out.1) Appears 25 year old #Capitol attack suspect Noah Greene (who died in hospital) was in some sort of desperation in life. A March 17 post on his FB claims he had been unemployed, facing "fear, hunger, loss of wealth." Claimed he left job in part to seek "a spiritual journey." pic.twitter.com/5efy9s4VCY||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/noah-green-us-capitol-attacker-was-a-supporter-of-nation-of-islam-101617468479317.html
03-04-2021||World||Signs of unease emerging between China, Pakistan over future of CPEC: Report||Amid lack of progress on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), subtle signs of unease have emerged between the two countries over the future direction and funding of mega projects, under increasing scrutiny of media and the public.According to a report published in Modern Diplomacy, the outcome of recent meetings between the two countries reveals significant scaling down of Pakistan's expectations regarding the inclusion of more projects under CPEC phase II.Fabien Baussart in an opinion piece for Modern Diplomacy said "While the country has for long portrayed USD 6.8 billion Main Line-I project to be the main artery of the Pakistan Railways and tried to convince China for financing the project, the Chinese side has tried to avoid any commitment for funding."Pakistan has unable to secure any favourable consideration including the concessionary loan at an interest rate of one per cent, said Baussart while adding that China is only willing to offer a mix of commercial and concessional loans to fund the rail project backed by suitable guarantees by Pakistan."Although it is the largest among the lot, ML-1 is not the only project facing significant delays. According to Pak CPEC Authority, so far, 17 projects worth USD 13 billion have been completed while another 21 projects having an estimated cost of USD 12 billion are under implementation," the report said.Baussart further argued that despite high publicity, hardly any Chinese investors are showing interest in setting up of units in the Special Economic Zones being established as part of industrial cooperation under CPEC.The report further said the hype created by Islamabad through projecting CPEC as a panacea for all problems is losing steam."The project not only lacks clear direction to steer through but continues to struggle due to absence of coordination among various executing agencies. The realization is gradually dawning upon various government agencies that Pakistan's economy has failed to achieve any real benefit from the CPEC," the report said.Adding to that, the Senate Special Committee on CPEC informed the upper house of parliament earlier this month that the Pakistan planning, development and special initiatives ministry does not have the capacity to coordinate and manage projects like CPEC.The committee stated in a report that the ministry clearly lacks vision and critical thinking as an institution, adding that several lapses in the project due to mismanagement and lack of strategic planning were pointed out in the last two-and-a-half years, The Express Tribune reported.In 2015, China announced an economic project in Pakistan worth USD 46 billion. With the CPEC, Beijing aims to expand its influence in Pakistan and across Central and South Asia in order to counter the influence of the United States and India.The CPEC would link Pakistan's southern Gwadar port (626 kilometres west of Karachi) in Balochistan on the Arabian Sea to China's western Xinjiang region. It also includes plans to create road, rail, and oil pipeline links to improve connectivity between China and the Middle East.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/signs-of-unease-emerging-between-china-pakistan-over-future-of-cpec-report-101617465302652.html

03-04-2021||World||Covid-19 vaccine passport efforts draw opposition from GOP lawmakers||Vaccine passports being developed to verify Covid-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine have become the latest flash point in America’s perpetual political wars, with Republicans portraying them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private health choices.They currently exist in only one state — a limited government partnership in New York with a private company — but that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers in a handful of states from rushing out legislative proposals to ban their use.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The argument over whether passports are a sensible response to the pandemic or governmental overreach echoes the bitter disputes over the past year about masks, shutdown orders and even the vaccines themselves.Vaccine passports are typically an app with a code that verifies whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for Covid-19. They are in use in Israel and under development in parts of Europe, seen as a way to safely help rebuild the pandemic- devastated travel industry.They are intended to allow businesses to more safely open up as the vaccine drive gains momentum, and they mirror measures already in place for schools and overseas travel that require proof of immunization against various diseases.But lawmakers around the country are already taking a stand against the idea. GOP senators in Pennsylvania are drawing up legislation that would prohibit vaccine passports, also known as health certificates or travel passes, from being used to bar people from routine activities.“We have constitutional rights and health privacy laws for a reason,” said Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican. “They should not cease to exist in a time of crisis. These passports may start with COVID-19, but where will they end?”Benninghoff said this week his concern was “using taxpayer money to generate a system that will now be, possibly, in the hands of mega-tech organizations who’ve already had problems with getting hacked and security issues.”A Democratic colleague, Rep. Chris Rabb of Philadelphia, sees value in vaccine passports if they are implemented carefully.“There’s a role for using technology and other means to confirm people’s statuses,” Rabb said. “But we do have concerns around privacy, surveillance and inequitable access.”Republican legislators in other states have also been drafting proposals to ban or limit them. A bill introduced in the Arkansas Legislature on Wednesday would prevent government officials from requiring vaccine passports for any reason, and would ban their use as a condition of “entry, travel, education, employment or services.”The sponsor, Republican state Sen. Trent Garner, called vaccine passports “just another example of the Biden administration using COVID-19 to put regulations or restrictions on everyday Americans.”President Joe Biden's administration has largely taken a hands-off approach on vaccine passports.At a news conference this week, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he considered them a project for the private sector, not the government.He said the government is considering federal guidelines to steer the process surrounding vaccine passports. Among its concerns: Not everyone who would need a passport has a smartphone; passports should be free and in multiple languages; and private health information must be protected."There will be organizations that want to use these. There will be organizations that don’t want to use these,” said Dr. Brian Anderson of Mitre, which operates federally funded research centers and is part of a coalition working to develop standards for vaccine certifications to make their use easier across vendors.Anderson noted the Vaccination Credential Initiative is not making recommendations on how — or even if — organizations choose to use the certifications.In Montana, GOP lawmakers this week voted along party lines to advance a pair of bills that would ban discrimination based on vaccine status or possession of an immunity passport, and to prohibit using vaccine status or passports to obtain certain benefits and services.And a freshman Republican state lawmaker in Ohio spoke out about the concept, saying more restrictions or mandates are not the answer to every Covid-19 problem.“Ohioans are encouraged to take the COVID-19 vaccine for the health and well-being of themselves and others,” Rep. Al Cutrona said. “However, a vaccine should not be mandated or required by our government for our people to integrate back to a sense of normalcy.”Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday issued an executive order that said no governmental entity can issue a vaccine passport, and businesses in that state can't require them. He said he expected the Legislature to pass a similar law.His order said requiring "so-called Covid-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life — such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant, or going to a movie theater — would create two classes of citizens.”US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, a newly elected member who has embraced and promoted a range of far-right political positions, told her supporters on Facebook earlier this week that “something called a vaccine passport” was a form of “corporate communism” and part of a Democratic effort to control people’s lives.And a GOP lawmaker in Louisiana has teed up a bill to keep the state from including any vaccination information on the Louisiana driver’s license or to make issuance of a driver’s license subject to vaccine status.In New York, a government-sponsored vaccine passport called the Excelsior Pass is being introduced. A smartphone app, it shows whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for Covid-19.Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted the idea as letting an event venue usher, for example, use their own smartphone to scan a concertgoer’s code.New York officials have not released specific details about how the app will work, access someone’s vaccination or testing status or protect a user’s name, date of birth or the location where their code was scanned. The app’s privacy policy says data will be “maintained in a secure manner” and won’t be used for sales or marketing purposes or shared with a third party. But some privacy experts say the public needs more specifics to ensure its information is protected.Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at the Urban Justice Center, a New York–based civil rights and privacy group, warned the Excelsior Pass creates a new layer of surveillance without sufficient details about how it collects data or protects privacy."We basically only have screenshots of the user interface and not much more,” Cahn said of Excelsior Pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-passport-efforts-draw-opposition-from-gop-lawmakers-101617461948282.html
03-04-2021||World||Matt Gaetz sex probe suddenly threatens a speedy Washington rise||Compared with most congressional newbies, it didn't take Rep. Matt Gaetz long. Phone calls from the president. Rides aboard Air Force One. Hundreds of television appearances. A darling in conservative circles.Yet barely four years after arriving in Washington as a little-known Republican state legislator from Florida’s Panhandle, the 38-year-old unblushing defender of Donald Trump is facing a possible abrupt end to his once promising career because of a federal sex-trafficking investigation.The overwhelming reaction of Gaetz's GOP colleagues — a deafening silence. That reflects the resentments he's sparked during his breakneck rise as one of the party's celebrities and the challenge he faces to retain his seat.Government agents are investigating if Gaetz had sex with a 17-year-old and other underage girls and violated federal sex trafficking laws, people familiar with the probe have told the AP. No charges have been filed, and Gaetz has denied the allegations.But with new, damaging details emerging regularly, Gaetz's political arc is beginning to resemble the myth of Icarus, who plunged to earth after ignoring warnings that his waxen wings would melt if he flew too close to the sun.The coming days will test the crisis management skills of one of the most visible members of Congress' younger generation, who critics say care more about promoting their own brand than serious legislating.“They're here for notoriety and to perform to their base, and anything else that may come is secondary,” said Doug Heye, a Trump critic and former top GOP congressional aide. “And if you boo him that's great too, as long as you're watching.”David Bossie, president of Citizens United, which backs conservative causes and candidates, countered that Gaetz "has been a conservative warrior, working every day to make America great again and fight for President Trump’s agenda.”Gaetz's congressional Twitter account is topped with a photo of himself taking a selfie with Trump, apparently on Air Force One. On his personal Twitter account, Gaetz describes himself as “Florida man. Fiancé. Firebrand. America First." He became engaged at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida in December.Gaetz is quick with a quote and looks little older than a college student. And by his own account, he's hardly led a prudish lifestyle while battling for conservative causes.In his 2020 autobiographical book, “Firebrand,” Gaetz praised Trump as someone “who doesn’t care for puritanical grandstanding or moralistic preening." He added, "If politicians’ family lives aren’t what really matter to the voters, maybe that’s a good thing. I’m a representative, not a monk.”Chris Latvala, a former GOP colleague in the Florida legislature, suggests that while there, Gaetz went too far. On Friday, Latvala revived a 2020 tweet in which he accused Gaetz of creating a “game where members of the FL House got 'points' for sleeping with aides, interns, lobbyists, and married legislators.”Latvala wrote Friday, “ I am just sorry that this guy may have victimized others, including possibly minors before others came forward to verify it.”The game was also described by two other Florida Republicans, who spoke on condition of anonymity to reveal what was a private matter. Gaetz has denied knowing about it.The son of Don Gaetz, a wealthy businessman and one-time Florida state Senate president, Matt Gaetz came to Congress after six years of building his conservative credentials in the state House with pro-gun and other legislation.Just months after Gaetz arrived in Washington in 2017, when Trump's presidency also began, special counsel Robert Mueller began investigating Russia's influence in Trump's election.Gaetz sprang into action to defend Trump, filing one resolution asserting investigative wrongdoing aimed at making Mueller resign, and essentially never stopped. His persistence was noted by Trump, who began calling the young lawmaker.The day before a House hearing on the Russia investigation in 2019, Gaetz tweeted at former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, who'd turned on Trump and was about to testify, asking, “Do your wife & father-in-law know about your girlfriends?" The House Ethics Committee formally admonished Gaetz for the tweet, which some saw as an attempt at intimidation, and he apologized.Gaetz was highly visible again months later when the House began its impeachment investigation over Trump's efforts to pressure Ukraine to provide political dirt on Democrat Joe Biden, who would eventually defeat Trump in the election.Most notably, Gaetz led a cluster of House Republicans who barged past Capitol Police officers into a secure basement meeting room where House Intelligence Committee members were questioning witnesses. They caused a delay of several hours that had little impact on the probe but garnered press attention.Gaetz was grabbing the spotlight in other ways, too. He brought a white nationalist who questioned the Holocaust as his guest to Trump's 2018 State of the Union address, later claiming ignorance of the man's views.In March 2020 as the pandemic was taking hold, Gaetz wore a gas mask on the House floor. Critics accused him of downplaying COVID-19, as Trump repeatedly did, but Gaetz asserted he was calling attention to lawmakers' vulnerability to the disease.All the while, his visibility was growing. Gaetz has made 346 weekday cable news appearances since August 2017, according to Media Matters, a liberal group that monitors conservative media activity.That makes Gaetz second in Congress only to Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a fellow Trump ally and ubiquitous TV presence.Through it all, Gaetz has shown no hesitation to criticize fellow Republicans.In a 2020 tweet, he accused Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, R-N.C., of “screwing all Americans" by dumping stock using insider information as the coronavirus pandemic was starting. The Justice Department investigated Burr but brought no charges.In Gaetz's book, in a first chapter called “Sex and Money,” he wrote that when he arrived in Congress, he asked current House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., for a seat on the Armed Services Committee. Gaetz wrote that “to my shock," McCarthy suggested he contribute $75,000 to the House GOP's campaign committee — a donation Gaetz wrote he actually doubled.This past January, Gaetz helped spearhead an effort to depose Rep. Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., from her post as No. 3 House GOP leader after she was among 10 Republicans to vote for Trump's second impeachment.Gaetz even traveled to a campaign event in Wyoming, where he urged voters to oppose her 2022 reelection and accused her of ignoring “the will of the people.” Days later, Cheney was reelected to her leadership post.All of that helped alienate him from many Republicans, several GOP lawmakers and aides said.Among his only defenders this week has been Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who tweeted, “Take it from me rumors and headlines don’t equal truth." Greene has become a pariah even among some Republicans for showing support for false and violent sentiments.Having a deep well of support among colleagues can help a beleaguered lawmakers retain their seat should party leaders begin viewing them as a liability. Ominously, McCarthy has called the charges against Gaetz “serious."Gaetz has reportedly had inconclusive discussions with Newsmax, a small pro-Trump television outlet, about working for it or another network. A person close to Newsmax said Friday the network has no plans to hire him as a talent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/matt-gaetz-sex-probe-suddenly-threatens-a-speedy-washington-rise-101617461320380.html
03-04-2021||World||Births among endangered North Atlantic right whales highest since 2015||North Atlantic right whales gave birth over the winter in greater numbers than scientists have seen since 2015, an encouraging sign for researchers who became alarmed three years ago when the critically endangered species produced no known offspring at all.Survey teams spotted 17 newborn right whale calves swimming with their mothers offshore between Florida and North Carolina from December through March. One of those calves soon died after being hit a boat, a reminder of the high death rate for right whales that experts fear is outpacing births.The overall calf count equals the combined total for the previous three years. That includes the dismal 2018 calving season, when scientists saw zero right whale births for the first time in three decades. Still, researchers say greater numbers are needed in the coming years for North Atlantic right whales to rebound from an estimated population that's dwindled to about 360.“What we are seeing is what we hope will be the beginning of an upward climb in calving that’s going to continue for the next few years,” said Clay George, a wildlife biologist who oversees right whale surveys for the Georgia Department of Natural Resources. “They need to be producing about two dozen calves per year for the population to stabilize and continue to grow again.”Right whales migrate each winter to the warmer Atlantic waters off the Southeastern U.S. to give birth. Trained spotters fly over the coastline almost daily during the calving season, scanning the water for mothers with newborns.Survey flights over Georgia and Florida ended Wednesday on the last day of March, typically the season's end. Spotters will monitor waters off the Carolinas through April 15, hoping to pick up any overlooked newborns as the whales head north to their feeding grounds.This season's calf count matches the 17 births recorded in 2015. Right whale experts consider that number fairly average, considering the record is 39 births confirmed in 2009.Scientists suspect a calving slump in recent years may have been caused by a shortage of zooplankton to feed right whales in the Gulf of Maine and the Bay of Fundy off Nova Scotia. They say the uptick in births this season could be a result of whales being healthier after shifting to waters with more abundant food sources.“It's a somewhat hopeful sign that they are starting to adjust to this new regime where females are in good enough condition to give birth,” said Philip Hamilton, a right whale researched at the New England Aquarium in Boston.Regardless, conservationists worry that right whales are dying — largely from manmade causes — at a faster rate than they can reproduce.Since 2017, scientists have confirmed 34 right whale deaths in waters of the U.S. and Canada — with the leading causes being entanglement in fishing gear and collisions with boats and ships. Considering additional whales were documented in the same period with serious injuries they were unlikely to survive, researchers fear the real death toll could be at least 49.That would exceed the 39 right whale births recorded since 2017.“If we reduced or eliminated the human-caused death rate, their birth rate would be fine,” Hamilton said. "The onus should not be on them to reproduce at a rate that can sustain the rate at which we kill them. The onus should be in us to stop killing.”The federal government is expected to finalize new rules soon aimed at decreasing the number of right whales tangled up in fishing gear used to catch lobster and crabs in the Northeast. Proposals to reduce vertical fishing lines in the water and modify seasonal restricted areas have been met with heated debate. Fishermen say the proposed rules could put them out of businesses, while conservation groups insist they aren't strict enough.The National Marine Fisheries Service received more than 170,000 public comments on the proposed rules after a report was issued Dec. 31, said agency spokeswoman Allison Garrett. She said final rules should be published this summer.Garrett said the fisheries service is also considering adjustments to federal rules that since 2008 have imposed speed limits on larger vessels in certain Atlantic waters during seasonal periods when right whales are frequently seen. An agency report in January found mariners' compliance with the speed rules have improved overall, but still lagged below 25% for large commercial vessels at four ports in the Southeast.“We’ve long known from the survival estimates that more right whales are dying than those we see,” said George, the whale survey coordinator for Georgia. “They need to be producing a lot more calves. But the big issue is we’ve got to significantly reduce the number than are being entangled in fishing ropes and struck by boats."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/births-among-endangered-north-atlantic-right-whales-highest-since-2015-101617458002228.html
03-04-2021||World||Amazon acknowledges issue of drivers urinating in bottles, apologises to US lawmaker for scoring 'own goal'||Amazon.com Inc has apologized to U.S. Representative Mark Pocan, admitting to scoring an "own goal" in its initial denial of his suggestion that its drivers were sometimes forced to urinate in bottles during their delivery rounds."We know that drivers can and do have trouble finding restrooms because of traffic or sometimes rural routes, and this has been especially the case during Covid when many public restrooms have been closed," the company said in a blog post.Its admission came a week after the Democrat criticised Amazon's working conditions, saying in a tweet: "Paying workers $15/hr doesn't make you a 'progressive workplace' when you union-bust & make workers urinate in water bottles."Amazon initially issued a denial, saying in a tweet: "You don't really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us." But it subsequently walked back those comments.1/2 You don’t really believe the peeing in bottles thing, do you? If that were true, nobody would work for us. The truth is that we have over a million incredible employees around the world who are proud of what they do, and have great wages and health care from day one."This was an own goal, we're unhappy about it, and we owe an apology to Representative Pocan," Amazon said in its blog post, adding that its previous response only referred to staff at its warehouses or fulfillment centers.The company said the issue was industry-wide and it would look for solutions, without specifying what these might be. Amazon's apology comes at a time when workers at an Alabama warehouse are waiting for a vote count that could result in the online retailer's first unionized facility in the United States and mark a watershed moment for organized labor.Amazon has long discouraged attempts among its more than 800,000 U.S. employees to organize. Allegations by many workers of a grueling or unsafe workplace have turned unionizing the company into a key goal for the U.S. labor movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-admits-issue-of-drivers-urinating-in-bottles-apologises-to-us-lawmaker-101617456327267.html
03-04-2021||World||Aiming big, Biden is looking to restore faith in government||As President Joe Biden preaches patience but acts with urgency, his vision of the powers of the Oval Office is quickly taking shape, modelled after Democratic predecessors who dramatically expanded the reach of government to confront generational crises.In a recent meeting with historians and in private conversations with advisers, Biden looked to the examples set by Presidents Franklin D Roosevelt and Lyndon Johnson as he aims to use the levers of executive authority to create opportunities and break down barriers.Unlike Roosevelt and Johnson, who enjoyed formidable Democratic majorities in Congress, Biden has had to operate with a no-margin-for-error edge in fiercely partisan Washington.Born soon after Roosevelt's New Deal and having first run for office in the shadow of Johnson's Great Society, Biden has long believed in government as an instrument for good. Now, with the Covid-19 public health pandemic and the economic carnage it wrought, that philosophy is being put to a fundamental test and Biden's place in history is in the balance.He has chosen momentous action over incremental, willing to cast aside visions of a bipartisan Washington in favour of tangible results Biden insists are resonating with Republican voters, if not their elected officials.“The president was clear about the crisis of democracy and aware of the factors and forces that may try to undermine the American experiment if we are not careful to protect it,” said historian Michael Eric Dyson, who attended the recent session.“There was no question that the president was concerned about how we treat our fellow citizens and is keenly aware that the moral trajectory of the United States has made a difference in both domestic and foreign policy.”Over his first two months in office, Biden has signed into law USD 1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief bill and, this past week, proposed an even larger USD 2.3 trillion infrastructure and tax plan that is the first installment of a two-part legislative package meant to reshape the American economy.His team's guiding principle is that the United States must push past the pandemic and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol to rebuild the economy in an equitable way that shows the nation can still make good for its citizens as it faces a threat from autocratic states, including China, for global economic supremacy.“There's a lot of autocrats in the world who think the reason why they're going to win is democracies can't reach consensus any longer; autocracies do,” Biden said Wednesday when he announced his infrastructure plan in Pittsburgh.“That's what competition between America and China and the rest of the world is all about. It's a basic question: Can democracies still deliver for their people? Can they get a majority?” Biden continued. “I believe we can. I believe we must.”The president has urged action despite a very narrow Democratic majority in the House and a 50-50 split in the Senate that requires Vice President Kamala Harris to break ties. No Republican lawmakers voted for the Covid-19 relief bill, although it was popular among voters of both parties.No Republicans appear likely to support the infrastructure plan.To this point, the White House has refused to entertain the debate that often bedevils presidents who know their party traditionally loses seats in their first midterm elections: play it safe to try to preserve power or go big?Biden's bet for the latter is clear, banking that voters will ignore big price tags and reward tangible results on vaccines, roads, broadband and more while forcing Republicans to defend a tax structure that benefits ultra-wealthy companies.Even so, the progressive forces in the Democratic Party that helped elect Biden are already pushing the president to go bigger still, demanding immediate action on gun control, immigration and climate change.Biden is asking for patience, keenly aware of the arithmetic of the Senate and the headwinds he'll face on some issues. But the 78-year-old president also has pressed for urgency, knowing that his party's hold on Congress is tenuous and believing that now is the moment to restore a wary public's faith in government.This past week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., framed Biden's gamble as “in the tradition of America -- to think big.”Biden has indeed looked to history for guidance.A month ago, he gathered more than a half-dozen historians in the East Room of the White House and listened to each speak about what made previous presidents successful and what lessons could be drawn for the present.For two hours, Biden asked questions, attendees said, and reflected his own political role models.“This is a president who obviously loves history and has used history all of his life and his career," said presidential historian Michael Beschloss. “He knows all about 1933 and 1965. We have seen evidence of that his whole career."Biden's infrastructure package would go well beyond the usual commitments to roads and bridges to touch almost every part of the country. It's a down payment on combating climate change, a chance to take on racial inequities, an expansion of broadband, an investment in manufacturing and a reorienting of corporate taxes to pay for everything.The opposition will be fierce. Republicans have already balked at its scope and the taxes that would finance it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aiming-big-biden-is-looking-to-restore-faith-in-government-101617456400696.html
03-04-2021||World||Deadly breach could delay decisions about US Capitol fencing||The deadly breach of the Capitol’s perimeter could delay the gradual reopening of the building’s grounds to the public just as lawmakers were eyeing a return to more normal security measures following the Jan. 6 insurrection.Capitol Police officer William “Billy” Evans, an 18-year veteran of the force, was killed Friday when a man rammed his car into a barrier outside the Senate side of the building. The driver, identified as 25-year-old Noah Green, was shot and killed after he got out of his car and lunged at police with a knife.Their deaths came less than two weeks after the Capitol Police removed an outer fence that had cut off a wide swath of the area to cars and pedestrians, in an effort to secure the complex after thousands of then-President Donald Trump’s supporters had marched on the building Jan. 6, as Congress was certifying Joe Biden's election victory. About 800 of those loyalists broke inside the Capitol, and siege lead to the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer.Police have left an inner fencing perimeter intact. The tall, dark fencing — parts of it covered in razor wire until recently -- had blocked major arteries that cross the city and was a stark symbol of the fear many in the Capitol felt after the violent mob laid siege two month ago. Lawmakers said the seat of American democracy was meant to be open to the people, even if there was always going to be a threat.But after Friday’s attack, lawmakers said they needed to procced with caution.“It’s an eyesore, it sucks,” Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, chairman of a House spending committee that oversees security and the Capitol, said about the fencing in the hours after the two deaths. “Nobody wants that there. But the question is, is the environment safe enough to be able to take it down? In the meantime, maybe that fence can prevent some of these things from happening.”Ryan stressed that no decisions had been made, and that lawmakers would be “reviewing everything.” His committee and others are looking at not only the fence but at the staffing, structure, and intelligence capabilities of the Capitol Police.“The scab got ripped off again here today,” Ryan said. “So we've got to figure this out.”The breach happened inside the perimeter. The driver slipped through a gate that had opened to allow traffic in and out of the Capitol and rammed a barrier that had protected the building long before Jan. 6. There was no evidence that Green's actions were in any way related to the insurrection.Still, it was a reminder that there is always a target on one of the country's most visible public buildings, especially after the public attention over the broad security failures three months ago.“This may just cause everybody to pump the brakes a bit on taking the fence down entirely because of the sense of security that it provides us,” said Democratic Rep. Jennifer Wexton of Virginia, another member of the spending panel that oversees the legislative branch.As a lawmaker who represents the suburbs of Washington, Wexton said she wants to see the Capitol open again to visitors. While the indoor parts of the building have been closed for the last year because of the coronavirus pandemic, the plazas, roads and sidewalks that surround the Capitol were only closed after the riot, keeping the public completely away from the area.“I would like to see it come down at the earliest possible moment,” Wexton said of the fencing.While lawmakers were initially supportive of the fencing to secure the area, and the thousands of National Guard troops sent to the Capitol to back up the overwhelmed police force, they soon said they were ready for a drawdown.“I think we’ve overdone it,” said Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky last month. “It looks terrible to have the beacon of our democracy surrounded by razor wire and National Guard troops.“Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, the top Republican on the Senate Rules and Administration Committee, said the fencing should come down because the next security problem is “highly unlikely to be a carbon copy of the last problem.” Republican Rep. Carlos Gimenez of Florida told Fox News he believed Democrats were keeping the fence up for “political reasons."But abhorrence of the fence is a rare issue on which the two parties can agree.“It’s just ghastly, it’s an embarrassment,” said Illinois Sen. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Democrat. “If there’s a better way to protect us, I want to see it. I want to work to get it.”Security officials, though, say that the Capitol cannot return to what had been status quo.In February, acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman told lawmakers that “the Capitol’s security infrastructure must change.”A security review requested by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., in the aftermath of the riot and conducted by a task force recommended eventually replacing the barrier with mobile fencing and “an integrated, retractable fencing system” that could be used as needed. It is unclear whether such an expensive proposal could win approval from Congress.Ryan said his committee was doing extensive research and had a recent call with Israeli security officials to learn how they keep their government secure.“We’ve got to figure out what the sweet spot is with the security,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadly-breach-could-delay-decisions-about-us-capitol-fencing-101617455161648.html

The risk associated with this type of blood clot is “very small,” it added.“The benefits of Covid-19 vaccine AstraZeneca in preventing Covid-19 infection and its complications continue to outweigh any risks and the public should continue to get their vaccine when invited to do so,” said Dr. June Raine, the agency’s chief executive.Concerns over the AstraZeneca vaccine has already prompted some countries including Canada, France, Germany and the Netherlands to restrict its use to older people. The U.K., which has rolled out coronavirus vaccines faster than other European nations, is particularly reliant on the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was developed by scientists at the University of Oxford.Read | AstraZeneca Covid shot: Are women recipients more impacted by blood clot events?MHRA's view about the relative benefits of the vaccine is shared by the European Medicines Agency. It has said a causal link between unusual blood clots in people who have had the vaccine is “not proven, but is possible," and that the benefits of the vaccine outweigh the risks of side effects. The World Health Organization has also urged countries to continue using the jab.Adam Finn, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Bristol, said the “extreme rarity” of the blood-clotting events in the context of the millions of jabs administered in the U.K. makes the decision facing people very straightforward.“Receiving the vaccine is by far the safest choice in terms of minimizing individual risk of serious illness or death,” he said.A more detailed look at the MHRA’s findings show that of the 30 cases, 22 related to cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, which stops blood draining from the brain properly, and eight were connected with other thrombosis events with low platelets.It said there were no reports of any blood-clotting events around the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, which has also been widely rolled out in the U.K.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-regulator-says-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-safe-after-7-blood-clot-deaths-101617454026154.html

The US space agency recently released a photograph of Ingenuity in which the helicopter can be seen with all four of its legs deployed as it remains attached to the belly of the Perseverance rover.Until now, the Perseverance has helped Ingenuity charge its battery as well as use a thermostat-controlled heater powered by the rover. On Friday, Bob Balaram, the chief engineer for the Mars helicopter project at Nasa's JPL, said in a blog post that the heater comfortably protects key components of Ingenuity, such as the battery and some of the sensitive electronics, from harm at very cold temperatures.“This heater keeps the interior at about 45 degrees F (Fahrenheit) through the bitter cold of the Martian night, where temperatures can drop to as low as -130 F,” said Balaram.Why hasn’t Perseverance dropped Ingenuity yet?Since Ingenuity has to run its own heater from its own battery after the drop, the battery level will be an important factor in the helicopter’s survival and flight attempt. Balaram said that Perseverance will charge up the helicopter's battery to 100 per cent before Ingenuity drops the last few inches onto its “airfield.”Also Read | Nasa’s InSight lander records two strong quakes on Mars, over 500 so far. All you need to knowWhat are the other milestones before Ingenuity attempts its first flight on Mars?The Perseverance rover will drive away from Ingenuity after the drop and the high-tech solar panel of the helicopter will be uncovered as soon as possible. Although the Sun’s energy is almost half as weak at the Red Planet as compared to the Earth on a bright day, it is enough for the solar panel to charge Ingenuity’s battery. However, Ingenuity has to survive the first night on its own after it sets the temperature of its thermostat to about 5 degrees Fahrenheit or lower.The team will check the temperatures the next day of the drop and the battery recharge performance over the next couple of days. Successful communication to and from the helicopter via the base station on the rover is also a prerequisite. “If it all looks good, then it's onto the next steps: unlocking the rotor blades, and testing out all the motors and sensors,” said Balaram.Nasa’s JPL on Thursday announced that the first flight of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars will take place no earlier than April 11.Come fly with us. #MarsHelicopter is preparing to do something that's never been done: controlled, powered flight on another planet.

03-04-2021||World||Taiwan steps up probe into deadly high-speed train accident||Taiwan stepped up investigations into its deadliest train accident in seven decades, which killed 51 people and injured more than 100.Preliminary assessments showed a crane truck rolled down from a position above the rail line which the passing train was on, according to the Transportation Safety Board. The collision caused the first five carriages of the eight-coach Taroko Express to derail and pile up inside the narrow, single-track tunnel in Hualien County, about 125 kilometers (78 miles) from Taipei.Rescue efforts continued for a second day, and authorities believe that two of the cars still in the tunnel may hold the remains of additional victims, the Central News Agency reported, citing the National Fire Agency.Investigators suspect that the truck driver, who wasn’t in the vehicle when the crash took place, didn’t engage the hand brake when he parked at a work site on a hill next to the tunnel, the Taipei Times reported. The possibility that the brake had a mechanical failure is also being investigated, the Taiwan Railways Administration said in a statement on Saturday.The truck driver was delivered to the Hualien prosecutor’s office after interrogation on Saturday, where he requested to be released on bail, according to an Apple Daily report. A court granted him bail of NT$500,000 ($17,500) and the prosecutor is seeking to appeal the decision, Apple said, adding that he isn’t permitted to leave Taiwan.There were more than 490 passengers and four train employees on board. Among the dead are the train driver and assistant driver, an American national and a French national.Half-MastFlags in Taiwan were lowered to half-mast for three days from Saturday, and countries from the U.S. and China have offered condolences. Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen thanked the international community for its concern Saturday after visiting survivors at several hospitals in Hualien, according to a release from her office.Forty-one people remained hospitalized as of 6 p.m. local time Saturday. Tsai also visited the Hualien municipal mortuary, where she consoled family members of those who died and promised them government assistance.As of Saturday afternoon, the rail authority said it had removed the two carriages outside the tunnel. The government hopes to resume operations on the line sooner than an initial estimate of seven days, the Central News Agency reported, citing Transportation Minister Lin Chia-lung.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-steps-up-probe-into-deadly-high-speed-train-accident-101617452512354.html

In March, she caused a stir in the art world when a digital work she created as part of a collaboration was sold at an auction for $688,888 in the form of a non-fungible token (NFT).The sale highlighted a growing frenzy in the NFT market, where people can buy ownership rights to digital content. NFTs each have a unique digital code saved on blockchain ledgers that allow anyone to verify the authenticity and ownership of items.David Hanson, CEO of Hong Kong-based Hanson Robotics and Sophia's creator, has been developing robots for the past two and a half decades. He believes realistic-looking robots can connect with people and assist in industries such as healthcare and education.Sophia is the most famous robot creation from Hanson Robotics, with the ability to mimic facial expressions, hold conversations and recognize people. In 2017, she was granted Saudi Arabian citizenship, becoming the world’s first robot citizen.“I envisioned Sophia as a creative artwork herself, that could generate art,” Hanson said in an interview.“Sophia is the culmination of a lot of arts, and engineering, and the idea that she could then generate art was a way for her to emotionally and visually connect with people,” he said.Sophia collaborated with Italian artist Andrea Bonaceto, who drew portraits of Sophia. Sophia then processed his work via neural networks and proceeded to create a digital artwork of her own.The digital work that sold for $688,888 is titled “Sophia Instantiation”, and is a 12-second video file which shows Bonaceto’s portrait evolving into Sophia’s digital painting. It is accompanied by the physical artwork painted by Sophia.The buyer, a digital artwork collector and artist known as 888 with the Twitter handle @Crypto888crypto, later sent Sophia a photo of his painted arm. The robot then processed that, adding that image to her knowledge and painted more strokes on top of her original piece.In a tweet on Sophia’s account, the work was described as the first NFT collaboration between an “AI, a mechanical collective being and an artist-collector.”“As an artist, I have computational creativity in my algorithms, creating original works,” Sophia said when asked what inspires her when it comes to art. “But my art is created in collaboration with my humans in a kind of collective intelligence like a human-artificial intelligence hive mind.”Sophia’s artwork selling as an NFT is part of a growing trend. In March, a digital artwork by artist Beeple — whose real name is Mike Winkelmann — sold for nearly $70 million, shattering records and making it the most expensive digital artwork ever sold.Henri Arslanian, PricewaterhouseCooper’s Global Crypto Leader, said that NFTs give people “bragging rights” of the assets that they own.“And what is really amazing with NFT is that it not only allows you to actually show to the broader world that you own this, but it really creates this bond between the holder of the NFT and the artists,” he said.It also allows art to be sold without traditional intermediaries, so that artists can connect directly with buyers without being constrained by galleries or auction houses, Arslanian said.Sophia will carry on painting, Hanson said, and the next step in the robot's career could be that of a musician. She is working on several musical works in a project called Sophia Pop, where she collaborates with human musicians to generate music and lyrics, he said.“We’re so excited about Sophia’s career as an artist,” Hanson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/robot-artist-sells-art-for-688-888-now-eyeing-music-career-101617452051200.html
03-04-2021||World||Authors of UK racism report hit back at 'misrepresentation'||The commission behind a report that concluded that Britain doesn't have a systemic problem with racism has defended itself against critics, some of whom have argued that it downplayed the country's historic role in slavery.In a response late Friday, the Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities said disagreement with the government-backed review had “tipped into misrepresentation" and it took particular umbrage at accusations that it put a positive spin on slavery.“This misrepresentation risks undermining the purpose of the report — understanding and addressing the causes of inequality in the U.K. — and any of the positive work that results from it," the commission said in a statement.The Conservative government launched the commission’s inquiry into racial disparities in the wake of last year's Black Lives Matter movement. The panel of experts, which was made up of 11 members from a broad cross section of ethnic backgrounds, concluded that while “outright racism” exists in Britain, the country is not “institutionally racist” or “rigged” against minorities.Citing strides to close gaps between ethnic groups in educational and economic achievement, the report, which was published Wednesday, said race was becoming “less important” as a factor in creating disparities that also are fueled by class and family backgrounds.Many academics, lawmakers unions and anti-racism activists were skeptical of the findings in the 258-page report, with some claiming the commission ignored barriers to equality, while others said it downplayed the ongoing legacy of Britain's colonial past as well as its role in slavery.David Olusoga, professor of public history at Manchester University and one of Britain's leading academics on slavery, became the latest to join in the criticism.“Determined to privilege comforting national myths over hard historical truths, they (the panel) give the impression of being people who would prefer this history to be brushed back under the carpet,” he wrote in a piece for The Guardian newspaper published Saturday.In their statement published before Olusoga's article, the commission said the idea it would downplay the atrocities of slavery “is as absurd as it is offensive to every one of us” and described the personal attacks on its members as “irresponsible and dangerous."“We have never said that racism does not exist in society or in institutions," it said. "We say the contrary: racism is real and we must do more to tackle it.”Like other countries, Britain has faced an uncomfortable reckoning with race since the death of George Floyd, a Black American, by a white police officer in May 2020, which sparked anti-racism protests around the world.Large crowds at Black Lives Matter protests across the U.K. last summer called on the government and institutions to face up to the legacy of the British Empire and the country’s extensive profits from the slave trade.The toppling of a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston in the city of Bristol in June prompted a pointed debate about how to deal with Britain’s past. Many felt such statues extol racism and are an affront to Black Britons. Others, including the prime minister, argued that removing them was erasing a piece of history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/authors-of-uk-racism-report-hit-back-at-misrepresentation-101617451463100.html

So far around 160,000 people have been vaccinated in more than a month since just over 1 million doses were received.President Uhuru Kenyatta on March 26 after announcing new stricter restriction on movement and assembly due to an upsurge of Coronavirus cases and deaths, led his cabinet in getting vaccinated publicly.Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentist Union says the reluctance by health care workers was due the fact they were not sensitized enough before the vaccines were brought.Kenya's government says the country's positivity rate jumped from 2.6% at the end of January to 19.1% on April 2 after 9,676 people were tested Thursday.Separately, the British government says that beginning April 9 it will not permit Kenyan nationals and others who have transited through the East African country.A statement Thursday from the UK to Kenya, that was released by Kenya's foreign affairs ministry, said a significant amount travelers from Kenya are testing positive for the B.1.351 variant of the disease, which originated in South Africa.Only UK nationals and those holding residency permits, will be allowed to enter from the country, the statement said. On average, about 550 people travel from Kenya to the UK each week.The British High Commission stressed that these are temporary measures that will be kept under review, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kenya-stops-private-importation-administration-of-covid-19-vaccines-101617449548841.html
03-04-2021||World||Pakistan’s flip-flop on India reflects divisions within Imran Khan govt||When Pakistan’s new finance minister Hammad Azhar announced a move to partially restore trade ties with India on Wednesday, it was seen in the context of a gradual thaw in bilateral ties spurred by the two sides again adhering to the 2003 truce on the Line of Control (LoC).But the backlash on the other side of the border was swift – within hours, with many, including human rights minister Shireen Mazari, saying the decision by the Economic Coordination Committee (ECC) of the Cabinet didn’t have the endorsement of the whole Cabinet, and sections of the electronic media were up in arms about a concession made by Islamabad without any reciprocal measure from the Indian side.What should have been a simple endorsement of the ECC’s decision at a Cabinet meeting on Thursday instead turned into a larger debate on the need to review bilateral ties with India, especially the changes made by New Delhi in Jammu and Kashmir’s special status in August 2019. According to the buzz in Islamabad, much of this debate was spurred by hawkish elements in the Imran Khan government, including interior minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi.By the time the dust had settled, a new message had emerged from Islamabad following a second meeting chaired by Prime Minister Imran Khan on Friday to review relations with India – there can be no bilateral trade relations or normalising of ties till India reviews its 2019 decision on Jammu and Kashmir.Also read: Pakistan PM Imran Khan ‘puzzled at cacophony’ over omission from climate meetInsiders say this new messaging reflects divisions within the Imran Khan government on the behind-the-scenes contacts between India and Pakistan that led to the revival of the 2003 ceasefire on the LoC on February 25. These contacts, the insiders say, are being driven on the Pakistani side by army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Moeed Yusuf, the special adviser to the prime minister on national security.According to the insiders, even Qureshi wasn’t in the loop on the contacts that led to the ceasefire announcement in February and this was reflected in his hawkish speech at the Islamabad Security Dialogue last month. In marked contrast, Bajwa spoke at the same event about the need to “bury the past and move forward”, while Khan talked about India taking the first step to improve bilateral ties by addressing Kashmir, the only issue standing in the way of better relations.It has also emerged that the ECC cleared the issue of importing cotton and sugar from India because the formal proposal came from the commerce ministry, which is headed by the prime minister. However, Khan as the prime minister shot down the same proposal when it was discussed by the Cabinet the next day.Mehmal Sarfraz, a Lahore-based journalist who closely tracks India-Pakistan relations, attributed the imbroglio to the Imran Khan government moving too quickly on the issue of trade with India.“I think the government announced the decision too soon. Also, it shouldn’t really seem to be unilateral concessions from the Pakistani side when the Indian side has not yet taken any reciprocal steps,” Sarfraz said.Pakistan unilaterally suspended trade ties with India in August 2019 as part of a package of measures aimed at retaliating against the change in Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. The measures included a decision not to post a new high commissioner in New Delhi and to expel the Indian envoy in Islamabad.Baqir Sajjad Syed, an Islamabad-based journalist with Dawn newspaper, described the Pakistan government’s decision as “curious”. Syed noted that Abdul Razak Dawood, adviser to the prime minister on commerce and investment, tweeted that Khan allowed cotton imports to “ease pressure on yarn”, he said the move to resume trade with India “was public knowledge days before it happened, and it wasn’t that someone was caught by surprise”.“The only explanation that comes to mind is that there was an adverse reaction in some segments of the media, and secondly, some hawkish elements within the Cabinet prevailed on the prime minister to defer the ratification of [trade ties with India]. Remember, it has not been rejected,” Syed said.Insiders agreed with this view, saying Khan and Bajwa needed more time to build public opinion in favour of better ties with India while addressing the objections of more hawkish elements.For old Pakistan hands on the Indian side, the flip-flop on trade wasn’t entirely new.“I remember when I was the Indian deputy high commissioner in 1997, a team from the PHD Chamber of Commerce and Industry came to Pakistan and signed an agreement with the Lahore Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The very next day, the Lahore chamber issued a statement that there couldn’t be any trade with India till the Kashmir issue is resolved,” said Sharat Sabharwal, who served as India’s envoy in Islamabad during 2009-13.Sabharwal said the posting of high commissioners in both capitals, easing of travel restrictions and resuming trade were the obvious ways to build on the LoC ceasefire announcement.“It’s obvious there was opposition from some ministers in Imran Khan’s Cabinet, such as Shah Mahmood Qureshi, Asad Umar, Sheikh Rashid Ahmed and Shireen Mazari. Some in the Pakistan Army are also uncomfortable about the move,” he said.“The second factor is lobbies with strong commercial interest, which sometimes cloak their demands in the garb of issues such as Kashmir. There is a very strong sugar lobby in Pakistan and some producers would stand to lose if prices were to fall [because of cheaper imports from India],” Sabharwal said.Experts now believe the hardline position taken by Pakistan, by linking the normalisation of bilateral relations to the Kashmir issue and the changes in Jammu and Kashmir, could complicate the nascent moves to improve ties.“The Modi government certainly can’t do any review of its decisions on Kashmir,” Sabharwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-flip-flop-on-india-reflects-divisions-within-imran-khan-govt-101617449767861.html

You have done much and you have gone without much.”“Your expectation for those in government is, ‘Get it together.’"Steinmeier said the country had swung from self-satisfaction over lower infection numbers in the early stage of the pandemic to excessive pessimism today.He urged Germans to “pull together” and put aside “constant indignation over others or over people in high places.” He said that vaccine deliveries would increase sharply in the coming weeks, Europe was building up its production capacities, and general practitioners would join the vaccination effort in addition to large vaccine centers.“The truth is, we're not world champion, but we're not a failure either,” he said.Germany, along with the European Union as a whole, has lagged behind the U.S. and the U.K. in the speed of its vaccination effort amid slower procurement of vaccines and complaints about excessive bureaucracy and paperwork. Poll numbers for Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservative party have slipped as the country faces a national election on Sept. 26.

My govt's environment policies are driven solely by our commitment to our future generations of a clean and green Pakistan to mitigate the impact of climate change."Pakistan PM also said that he has already laid out priorities for the UN Climate Change Conference 2021."Hence our initiatives of Green Pakistan, 10 bn-tree tsunami, nature-based solutions, cleaning up our rivers etc. We have gained vast experience in seven yrs, beginning with KP, and our policies are being recognised and lauded.

Here's what we know so far||The shipping backlog at Egypt's Suez Canal is supposed to be cleared by Saturday-end, news agency Reuters reported citing sources at the canal authority. The 'Ever Given' container, which kept the crucial maritime channel blocked for almost a week, was dislodged last Monday, paving the way for the queued ships to gradually make their way through.Meanwhile, the Suez Canal Authority (SCA) launched an investigation on Wednesday into what caused the 'Ever Given' vessel to run aground in the Suez Canal and block the waterway for six days. Osama Rabie, SCA chairman, told the MBC Masr private TV that the probe will take "two more days" and a report on the Suez Canal Authority's findings would be published soon, according to Reuters.Also Read: Investigation begins into how ship got stuck on Suez CanalEgypt is expecting more than $1 billion in damages as compensation for blocking the crucial Suez Canal for more than a week, the Associated Press reported, citing a top canal official. Moreover, SCA has also warned that the ship and its cargo will not be allowed to leave Egypt if the issue of damages goes to court, as per the agency. However, it is not yet clear who the canal authorities would seek compensation from.As many as 422 vessels were found to have been queued up behind the 400-metre-long 'Ever Given' container when it was dislodged earlier this week, according to Rabie. While authorities have been aiding the queued ships to pass through, it still took the rest of the week to clear the massive pile-up of vessels. On Friday, some 80 ships passed through the Suez Canal in both directions, including an American aircraft carrier—the USS Dwight D Eisenhower, a liquefied natural gas tanker, and an oil tanker—the SCA said in a statement. On Saturday, as many as 85 vessels are expected to pass through the canal on both sides, the SCA chairman said. This will include the last 61 of the 422 ships that had queued up behind the 'Ever Given' container while it was stuck in the Suez Canal, he added.“This proves the global maritime community has great faith in the Suez Canal and Egypt's ability to guarantee safety and security to different types of vessels,” Rabie was quoted by the Associated Press in a statement.Last Monday, salvage teams re-floated the skyscraper-sized 'Ever Given' by a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides, thus ending a crisis that had clogged one of the world's most vital waterways and halted billions of dollars a day in maritime commerce.Also Read: 'Ever Given' finally set adrift. Here's a timeline of the Suez blockage crisisThe Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometres (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez in north-eastern Egypt. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa's southern tip—a 5,000-kilometre (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs. Others waited in place for the blockage to be over. The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, added to the strain on the shipping industry, already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-unclogged-but-egypt-may-sue-for-damages-here-s-what-we-know-so-far-101617441287790.html

All you need to know||The UK’s medicine regulator on Friday confirmed that seven people have died from unusual blood clots after getting AstraZenenca’s vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) had earlier released a report on adverse reactions after the AstraZeneca jab, saying at least 30 cases of blood clots were reported in Britain as of March 24.The majority of cases of blood coagulation included cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST), a type of blood clot in the brain, accompanied by low levels of platelets in the body. While Britain has continued the vaccination drive, as advised by its health regulator and the World Health Organization (WHO), countries like Germany and the Netherlands have restricted the use of the vaccine for people aged 60 and above.Are blood clot events more common in women?According to the latest report, most of the cases of blood clots in Germany and the Netherlands have been reported among women recipients of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. Britain is yet to provide gender-wise data on blood clot events.The Netherlands halted vaccination in people under the age of 60 as a "precautionary measure" following the death of a woman who had received a shot. Dutch agency Lareb, which tracks medication side effects, said that the events of extensive thrombosis with low platelet counts after vaccinations with the AstraZeneca vaccine were reported in women between 25 and 65 years old. “Three patients had extensive pulmonary embolisms. One died and one also had a brain haemorrhage," it said.In Germany, 31 cases of CVST were recorded after they were administered with AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine, out of which nine resulted in deaths. Germany’s vaccine regulator, the Paul Ehrlich Institute (PEI), said that almost all reports, with exception of two cases, concerned women between the ages of 20 and 63. The two men who suffered blood clots were 36 and 57 years old.However, cases of CVST is inherently more common in younger women, according to a BBC report, and taking contraceptive pills increases the risk. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) on Wednesday said that the review by its safety committee has not identified “any specific risk factors, such as age, gender or a previous medical history of clotting disorders, for these very rare events.” It further added that a causal link with the vaccine is not proven “but is possible and further analysis is continuing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-shot-are-women-recipients-more-impacted-by-blood-clot-events-101617445358155.html

By Saturday it had identified 3,650 close contacts and secondary contacts of cases, state media reported.The other 19 new infections in mainland China were imported, the National Health Commission said.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, rose to 24 from 20.Confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stand at 90,252, with the death toll unchanged at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-reports-26-new-covid-19-cases-officials-link-outbreak-in-yunnan-to-myanmar-101617442796021.html

However, fully vaccinated travelers may need fewer tests on arrival and may not have to quarantine after returning from lower and medium-risk countries, including popular Mediterranean destinations, the Telegraph said, without citing any sources. Unvaccinated holidaymakers will need a test on their return and could have to quarantine or self-isolate at home.The UK government aims to end the current ban on non-essential travel on May 17, but final decisions will depend on a further review of the risks as Europe battles a third Covid wave and struggles with low vaccination rates. Close to five million people in the UK have been fully vaccinated so far, receiving two doses, and more than 31 million people have had first doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britons-vaccinated-against-covid-19-to-face-fewer-holiday-restrictions-report-101617441489097.html

The UK has seen a total of 30 such cases as of March 24, out of more than 18 million doses given. The Netherlands on Friday joined Germany in suspending the vaccine’s use in people under 60.The rising number of blood-clot cases and the moves to suspend or limit shots have added to the uncertainty around the vaccine, which many countries around the world were relying on for their immunization programs. The company has also faced questions over trial results and delivery schedules.Kidd said government and health authorities plan to meet again on April 7 and will provide further advice. Rare clotting complications have occurred between day four and 20 after receiving the vaccination, Australia’s Health Department said.The Australian Technical Advisory Group on Immunisation has reaffirmed the current settings for and safety of the country’s Covid immunization program.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-working-with-eu-uk-to-investigate-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-linked-blood-clot-case-101617440463996.html
03-04-2021||World||George Floyd murder trial: Minneapolis top cop says use of force 'totally unnecessary'||On the fifth day of the trial over George Floyd's death, the longest-serving detective in the Minneapolis Police Department, Lieutenant Richard Zimmerman, testified that former police officer Derek Chauvin's use of force was "totally unnecessary", according to news agency AFP.Chauvin faces multiples charges of second and third-degree murder and third-degree manslaughter, for the killing of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, in Minnesota's Minneapolis on May 25 last year. Eyewitness reports, police bodycam footage, and viral videos from the site all point to the fact that Derek Chauvin knelt on George Floyd's neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds, while the latter lay face down, handcuffed, on the street. This resulted in George Floyd's death, medical examiners had concluded in two separate autopsies.Derek Chauvin became the first white police officer in Minnesota to be charged with the death of a Black civilian. His murder trial began on March 8, following intense 'Black Lives Matter' protests across the world in solidarity with the fundamental rights of the people of colour.Lieutenant Zimmerman, head of the homicide division in the Minneapolis police department for over 12 years, testified on Friday that Derek Chauvin had violated departmental policies on the use of force by pressing his weight down on George Floyd's neck. Police officers are not trained to carry out such actions, he said, let alone "restricting a person's breathing" for over nine minutes, reported CNN, citing Court TV footage of the trial."How can that person hurt you?" Lieutenant Zimmerman testified in the court after cross-examining security footage from the scene, according to the media network. He noted that trained police officers know "threat level goes down all the way once a person is cuffed" and said that under such circumstances, the use of force by Derek Chauvin was "uncalled for" and "totally unnecessary".The trial over George Floyd's death is one of the most closely-watched criminal cases in recent American history. The trial opened on Monday and included the prosecution’s opening remarks centred on a bystander video of Floyd’s death. Protesters were seen gathering outside the Fourth Judicial District Court of Minnesota, showing the interest that people had in the trial. Ben Crump, a lawyer for George Floyd’s family, told supporters on Monday that “the whole world is watching.”In addition to Derek Chauvin, three other officers of the Minneapolis police department, J Alexander Kueng, Thomas Lane, and Tou Thao, have also been charged for aiding and abetting second-degree murder, as they assisted Chauvin in restraining George Floyd and prevented bystanders from intervening in the subsequent events. The criminal case against Kueng, Lane and Thao is set to go on trial on August 23 later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trial-over-george-floyd-s-death-top-cop-says-use-of-force-totally-unnecessary-101617433624043.html

According to a report in September last year, researchers at the City University of Hong Kong claimed that such masks could help in countering coronaviruses.However, Health Canada said that its “preliminary assessment of available research identified that inhaled graphene particles had some potential to cause early lung toxicity in animals”. That assessment came after the department was made aware that “masks containing graphene have been sold with Covid-19 claims and used by adults and children in schools and daycares” and “may also have been distributed for use in healthcare settings”.While the recall was announced on Friday, such masks, manufactured using nanotechnology, remain widely available in Canada, and in India.While the effect of inhalation of the microscopic particles in humans is still being studied, Health Canada said that it has “requested data from mask manufacturers to assess the potential health risks related to their masks that contain grapheme”.Health Canada added that it has written to provinces and territories advising them to “stop distribution and use of masks containing graphene” while the department “will continue to take appropriate action to stop the import and sale of graphene face masks.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-bans-masks-containing-graphene-101617428707042.html
03-04-2021||World||University of California among schools victim of nationwide hack attack||The University of California is warning its students and staff that a ransomware group might have stolen and published their personal data and that of hundreds of other schools, government agencies and companies nationwide.A cybersecurity attack targeted a vulnerability in Accellion, a third-party vendor that is used to securely transfer files, the university said in a statement Wednesday.“We understand those behind this attack have published online screenshots of personal information, and we will notify members of the UC community if we believe their data was leaked in this manner," the university said.The hacker or hackers also have been sending threatening mass emails threatening to publish data “in an attempt to scare people into giving them money," the statement said.In an update Friday, the university system said the cyberattack affected about 300 organizations, “including universities, government institutions and private companies."Other schools, including Stanford University's School of Medicine and Yeshiva University in New York City, have reported that student and employee Social Security numbers and financial information were stolen and that some were posted online.The information was obtained in December and January when hackers exploited a vulnerability in a 20-year-old Accellion file transfer service, various reports have said. However, some organizations said they only recently became aware of the breach.The Baltimore Sun on Thursday reported that private information of staff members and students at the University of Maryland, Baltimore was posted online this week. The school said a hacking group known as Clop gained access to Accellion in December, the Sun said.The University of Colorado and the University of Miami reported that files were accessed in January and included personal data and some health, study and research data.The Washington State Auditor's Office reported last month that information on nearly 1.5 million unemployment applicants had been stolen.Accellion released a statement in March that said it had closed “all known" vulnerabilities and no new ones had been found.Ransomware attacks on a massive scale and seeking massive payouts have hit several organizations in recent months.In an unrelated attack, the computer system of one of the nation's largest school districts was hacked by a criminal gang that encrypted district data and demanded $40 million in ransom or it would erase the files and post students' and employees' personal information online.Broward County Public Schools, based in Fort Lauderdale, said in a statement Thursday that there is no indication that any personal information has been stolen and that it made no extortion payment to the ransomware gang.An epidemic of ransomware attacks has been plaguing government agencies, businesses and individuals for the past three years. Most are Russian-speaking gangs based in Eastern Europe and enjoy safe harbor from tolerant governments. The more sophisticated groups identify their targets in advance, infect networks through phishing or other means and often steal data as they plant malware that encrypts a victim's network.After the ransomware is activated, the criminals demand money to unlock the malware and refrain from posting — or selling — stolen data. In the case of corporations, that data could be trade secrets. In the case of retailers or government agencies it could be Social Security, bank account numbers and birth dates.Public school districts have been frequent targets of ransomware attacks. Overall, ransomware attacks disrupted learning at 1,681 schools, colleges, and universities in 2020 and at least 544 so far this year, said analyst Brett Callow at Emsisoft, a cybersecurity firm. Seven districts had personal data published.The average ransom paid for to hacking gangs nearly tripled from $115,000 in 2019 to $312,000 in 2020, according to the cybersecurity firm Palo Alto Networks. It said the highest ransom paid by an organization doubled last year from to $10 million, up from $5 million in 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/university-of-california-among-schools-victim-of-nationwide-hack-attack-101617423100697.html
03-04-2021||World||Pressure mounts on corporations to denounce GOP voting bills||Liberal activists are ratcheting up their calls on corporate America to denounce the GOP campaign to tighten state voting laws, putting businesses accustomed to cozy political relationships in middle of a growing partisan fight over voting rights and election laws.Pressure is mounting on leading companies in Texas, Arizona and other states, particularly after Major League Baseball’s decision Friday to move the 2021 All-Star Game out of Atlanta. The move came a week after Georgia Republicans enacted an overhaul of the state's election law that critics argue is an attempt to suppress Democratic votes.Other companies have, somewhat belatedly, joined the chorus of critics. Delta Air Lines and The Coca-Cola Co., two of Georgia’s best-known brands, this week called the new law “unacceptable," although they had a hand in writing it. That only angered Republicans, including Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and several U.S. senators, who accused the companies of cowering from unwarranted attacks from the left.The fight has thrust corporate America into a place it often tries to avoid — the center of a partisan political fight. But under threat of boycott and bad publicity, business leaders this week showed a fresh willingness to enter the fray on an issue not directly related to their bottom line, even when it meant alienating Republican allies.“We want to hold corporations accountable for how they show up when voting rights are under attack,” said Marc Banks, an NAACP spokesman. “Corporations have a part to play, because when they do show up and speak, people listen.”Civil rights groups have filed federal lawsuits to block the new Georgia law, which was passed after Democrats flipped the once-reliably Republican state in an election former President Donald Trump falsely claimed was rife with fraud. Some activists have called for consumer boycotts of Delta, Coca-Cola and other firms. They dismiss business leaders’ assertions that they helped water down the bill to ease earlier, more restrictive proposals; business leaders, they argue, should have tried to block the plan altogether.In Texas, the NAACP, League of Women Voters and League of United Latin American Citizens, among other organizations, are urging corporations in the state to speak out against a slate of Republican-backed voting proposals. “Democracy is good for business,” the campaign asserts.Nine organizations took out full-page ads in the Houston Chronicle and the Dallas Morning News, the state’s leading newspapers, urging corporate opposition to the plan. The Texas proposal would limit some early voting hours, bar counties from setting up drive-thru voting and prohibit local officials from proactively sending applications for mail ballots before voters request them.Unlike their Georgia-based counterparts, American Airlines and Dell Technologies didn’t wait for the Texas measure to pass. “To make American’s stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,” American said in a statement.Arizona, another battleground Biden flipped in November, hasn’t seen high-profile corporate players engage yet. But 30-plus groups sent a joint letter to Allstate Insurance, CVS Health and Farmers’ Insurance, among others, urging their public opposition to proposed voting restrictions. Emily Kirkland, executive director of Progress Arizona, a progressive group that signed the letter, said there's been no response yet.Other groups are demanding that corporations focus on Washington, where congressional Democrats are pushing measures intended to make it easier for Americans to vote, regardless of state laws. Among the changes, Democrats would enact automatic voter registration nationally and standardize access to early and mail voting.Democrats also want to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that require the federal government to approve all election procedures in states and locales with a history of discrimination. The Supreme Court struck down those provisions — which applied to Georgia and Arizona, among other states — in 2013.Corporate giants were mostly quiet when Trump falsely claimed he lost because of fraud. And business leaders largely maintained caution as Republican state lawmakers used Trump's lie to justify a flood of new bills to make it more cumbersome to vote.The reticence was a stark contrast to how chambers of commerce reacted six years ago when Republican-run states pushed “religious freedom” measures. Indiana, under then-Gov. and future Vice President Mike Pence, saw immediate corporate backlash. After North Carolina passed a so-called “bathroom bill” limiting LGBTQ rights in 2016, PayPal scuttled expansion plans there and the NBA moved its all-star game from Charlotte. An AP analysis in 2017 found the reaction would eventually cost North Carolina at least $3.76 billion in lost business.Then, Georgia’s corporate lobbying groups — with Delta’s and Coca-Cola’s backing — took no such chances, speaking out forcefully against Georgia conservatives' version of a “religious freedom” bill. Lawmakers passed it anyway but Kemp’s predecessor, Republican Nathan Deal, vetoed it amid the chamber outcry.Some Republicans dispute the comparison. Brian Robinson, a former top Deal aide who was part of the business coalition that publicly opposed the religious freedom bill, argued that measure “was clearly discriminatory” against LGBTQ citizens, while the nearly 100-page election bill is less clear-cut and is being misrepresented by Democrats and their allies.Companies are reacting to “Twitter mobs demanding reaction to their false narrative,” he said.National Republicans reacted even more harshly. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a former and potentially future presidential candidate, slammed Delta with the hashtag “#WokeCorporateHypocrites.”Still, Delta and Coca-Cola's response to the Georgia voting fight is standing as a cautionary tale for other businesses.Ed Bastian, the airline’s chief executive, initially released a statement noting the business lobby’s role in altering the bill as it moved through the General Assembly. Officials at the Atlanta Metro Chamber, where Bastian currently serves as president, detailed how corporate lobbyists spent weeks at the Capitol on mitigating provisions.Some Georgia Republicans wanted to roll back the state’s no-excuse absentee voting law, end automatic voter registration and ban Sunday early voting used heavily by Black churches. They also wanted to require photocopies of state IDs to receive and submit absentee ballots, while banning “drop boxes” as ballot collection receptacles.The final law preserved no-excuse absentee voting and automatic registration. The new ID requirement for absentee ballots allows a voter to write their state ID number, rather than produce a photocopy, and the legislature included funding for free state IDs. The law also codifies in-person early voting on weekends, although it allows counties to choose whether to be open for voting for up to two Sundays. And it made drop boxes of mail ballots a permanent fixture in Georgia, but limited the number.Business leaders’ philosophy, according to Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan, was “basically, Republicans are going to pass something, so they might as well try to keep from being awful.”But by Wednesday, the same day 72 Black business executives published a letter in The New York Times urging corporate leaders to speak out, Bastian was more direct. He sent a companywide memo declaring the law “unacceptable” and “based on a lie” — though he didn’t mention Trump.Big business’s mistake, Jordan said, was “thinking there was ever any version that wouldn’t end up like this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-mounts-on-corporations-to-denounce-gop-voting-bills-101617424878871.html

There were two deaths on Friday.Despite the repression, opponents of the coup march every day in cities and towns across the country, often holding what they call "guerrilla rallies", small, quick shows of defiance before security forces can respond.People also gather at night for candle-lit vigils but the huge rallies that drew tens of thousands in the early days of defiance have largely stopped in big cities.The authorities, who had already shut down mobile data in a bid to stifle opposition, ordered internet providers from Friday to cut wireless broadband, depriving most customers of access.Authorities also issued warrants for 18 show business celebrities including social media influencers and two journalists under a law against material intended to cause a member of the armed forces to mutiny or disregard their duty, state media reported late on Friday.All of them are known to oppose military rule and one, actress Paing Phyoe Thu, said she would not be cowed."Whether a warrant has been issued or not, as long as I'm alive I'll oppose the military dictatorship who are bullying and killing people. The revolution must prevail," she said on Facebook.Paing Phyoe Thu regularly attended rallies in the main city of Yangon in the weeks after the coup. Her husband, film director, Na Gyi, has been wanted by the authorities under the same law since February.Her whereabouts were not immediately known and it was not clear how she was able to post her message. Social media users in Myanmar did not appear to be connected early on Saturday.The charge can carry a prison term of three years.State broadcaster MRTV announced the warrants with screenshots and links to each of their Facebook profiles.While the military has banned social media platforms like Facebook, the junta has continued to use social media to track critics and promote its message.MRTV maintains a YouTube channel and shares links to its broadcasts on Twitter, both of which are officially banned.'INHUMAN ACTIONS'The United States condemned the internet shutdown."We hope this won’t silence the voices of the people," a State Department spokeswoman, Jalina Porter, told a briefingPorter said the shutdown would also have consequences for people who use the internet to benefit from online health programmes.The security forces have arrested numerous suspected opponents of the coup.Myanmar Now new portal reported on Friday that five women who spoke to a visiting CNN news crew on the streets of Yangon this week had been taken away by security men.Separately, one person was shot and wounded in a raid in the second city of Mandalay on Friday night, the Mizzima news service said.The coup has also rekindled old wars with autonomy-seeking ethnic minority forces in the north and the east.Myanmar's oldest insurgent group, the Karen National Union (KNU), has seen the first military air strikes on its forces in more than 20 years since announcing its support for the pro-democracy movement.The KNU said more than 12,000 villagers had fled from their homes because of the air strikes and it called for an international embargo on arms sales to the military."Their inhuman actions against unarmed civilians have caused the death of many people including children and students," the group said in a statement.Media has reported that about 20 people were killed in air strikes in KNU territory in recent days, including nearly a dozen at a gold mine run by the group.The KNU signed a ceasefire with the government in 2012 to end their 60-year insurgency.Fighting has also flared in the north between the army and ethnic Kachin insurgents.The turmoil has sent several thousand refugees fleeing into Thailand and India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-cracks-down-on-online-critics-death-toll-rises-to-550-101617423186720.html

US Capitol Police (USCP) identified the officer who lost his life in the attack as William “Billy” Evans and said the other was in stable and non-life-threatening condition. The attacker was shot dead by the police.Here’s what we know about the attack so far:1. The blue car rammed into the North Barricade just after 1pm (local) time at the complex in Washington, DC. Evans, one of the police officers to be attacked, joined the force in March 2003 and was a member of the First Responder’s Unit.Statement on the Loss of USCP Colleague Officer William "Billy" Evans: https://t.co/JMAEbTcbAp pic.twitter.com/DPvkAv5ptO2. The attacker came out of his vehicle after ramming it into the barricade and lunged at USCP officers with a knife, at which point he was shot by at least one officer. He was taken to the hospital but succumbed to his injuries around 1:30pm, the force said.3. Noah Green, a 25-year-old follower of the “Nation of Islam,” has been named as the suspected attacker. Green was from Indiana, and according to media reports, was unemployed and had health problems.4. Acting Metropolitan Police chief Robert Contee said that while an investigation into the incident was underway, the attack did not appear to be “terrorism-related.” Contee further said that investigators did not yet have a motive for the attack.5. The Capitol building was locked down as soon as the vehicle rammed into the barrier. The USCP later noted that “the external security threat incident” was cleared. However, the area around the crime scene would continue to be restricted, it further said.The USCP has cleared the external security threat incident located at all of the U.S. Capitol Campus buildings, however the area around the crime scene will continue to be restricted and individuals should follow police direction. pic.twitter.com/6SXr5WJmcE6.

Officer Evans made the ultimate sacrifice to protect the Capitol. Our hearts go to his family and loved ones,” Harris tweeted.Doug and I are grateful for the Capitol Police, the National Guard Immediate Response Force, and all who responded swiftly to the attack. We continue to be proud of the courageous men and women who defend the Capitol, especially during this challenging period.8. Biden has ordered flags at the White House to be flown at half-mast. House speaker Nancy Pelosi, describing Evans as “a martyr for our democracy,” also ordered flags at the Capitol building to be lowered to half-mast.9. On January 6, supporters of then-US president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building as members of the Congress convened to certify Biden and Harris as the next US President and vice president respectively.10. Trump, who refused to concede defeat to Biden in the 2016 Presidential elections, allegedly instigated the mob to storm the Capitol building.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officer-killed-suspect-shot-dead-what-we-know-about-us-capitol-attack-so-far-101617415508089.html
03-04-2021||World||Third Covid-19 lockdown in France from today: All you need to know||French President Emmanuel Macron announced a third nationwide lockdown beginning Saturday in view of the surging cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The decision was taken amid heavy criticism from other European countries which said France decided to not go under a third lockdown in early January despite being severely hit by the virus, unlike them.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe lockdown aims to stem the Covid-19 crisis and ease pressure on hospitals in hotspots that are left overwhelmed due to the new surge. In a televised address to the nation, Macron also stressed the need to vaccinate everyone faster. "We will do everything to vaccinate, vaccinate, vaccinate! Without rest, without holidays. Saturday and Sunday just like in the week," he said.France on Friday reported 46,677 new cases, which were 6.2% more than a week ago, taking the total to 4.74 million cases. It also reported 332 new deaths from Covid-19, taking the toll to 96,280.Here is all you need to know about the new restrictions:1. As a result of the lockdown, non-essential shops around the country will be closed for the next four weeks.2. Schools will be shut but university students will still be allowed to attend classes one day a week. 3. Outdoor activities will be limited to places within six miles of people’s home.4. Alcoholic drinks will be banned in parks and other outdoor public spaces.5. Macron, however, did not put a total prohibition on people socialising and authorised travel between regions over the Easter weekend.6. If one needs to travel during curfew hours from 7pm to 6am, or for trips exceeding 10 kilometres, a certificate will be required, Macron told citizens in his Wednesday address.7. An order to set up thousands of temporary ICU beds in hospitals reeling under pressure was also passed and parliament approved it on Thursday, according to news agency AP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/third-covid-19-lockdown-in-france-from-today-all-you-need-to-know-101617413228348.html
03-04-2021||World||California allows indoor events as Covid-19 cases near record low||California on Friday cleared the way for people to attend indoor concerts, theater performances and NBA games for the first time in more than a year as the rate of people testing positive for the coronavirus in the state nears a record low.State officials won't require testing or proof of vaccination for some of those events, but they do limit the number of people allowed to attend. Events that do require testing and vaccinations will be allowed to have more paying customers than those that don’t. Only people who live in California can attend these live performances.The rules are different for private indoor gatherings, including weddings, meetings or conferences. Those are only to be allowed if all guests test negative for the coronavirus at least 72 hours in advance or show proof of full vaccination. The changes do not mention requiring proof of vaccination and put much of the enforcement on business owners and operators.“Allowing some of these activities and opportunities to vaccinated individuals is an incentive,” said Dee Dee Myers, director of the Governor's Office of Business and Economic Development. “If they can return to some of their favorite activities because they're vaccinated then hopefully a few more people will go and get vaccinated.”The new rules seem to nudge California toward a system of vaccine verification, a hotly debated issue across the country. New York has launched a digital pass residents can use to show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test that is accepted at major entertainment venues. But Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order on Friday banning businesses from requiring so-called “vaccine passports.”President Joe Biden's administration has said the federal government won't come up with a national vaccine passport app, leaving that to the private sector. But the federal government is devising regulations for how and when those passports can be used.California Public Health Officer Dr. Tomás Aragón said Friday the state will follow the federal government's lead but said vaccinations won't be required for essential services.California's new rules come as the state has administered nearly 19 million doses of the COVID-19 vaccines. Nearly 6.9 million people are fully vaccinated in a state with close to 40 million residents. Only people 50 and over are eligible statewide to get the vaccine now, followed by those 16 and older on April 15.Requiring proof of vaccination prompts questions of privacy and equity as not everyone will be able to get a vaccine while others would not want their medical information stored in a clearinghouse, said Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, chair of the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of California-San Francisco.She noted that similar requirements in other countries have prompted people to get vaccinated, but the most notable problem in California is “we just haven't simply vaccinated enough people in the population right now,” she said. Surges in some parts of the country also suggest it's not a low-risk time to lift restrictions, she said.The new rules will continue to adhere to California's tier system, in which sectors of the economy can reopen depending on how widespread the virus is in each county.In the most restrictive purple tier, indoor concerts, sporting events and theater productions aren't allowed. In the red tier, venues of up to 1,500 people can operate at 10% and grow to 25% if all guests provide evidence of vaccination or a negative test. Venues of 1,501 people or more can operate at 20% capacity in the red tier, but must show proof of vaccination or a negative test. Capacity increases for tiers where the virus is less widespread.Venues can also choose to separate people into sections based on their vaccination status. Those who are fully vaccinated could sit shoulder-to-shoulder but they still must wear masks, Aragón said.Ben Bleiman, a San Francisco nightlife activist and chairman of the California Music and Culture Association, said venues need full capacity to make any money — but members will take the change, albeit with some trepidation.“On the one side you have the thrill and the joy of reopening," he said, adding on the other, “there’s some dread that something's going to go wrong.”Private indoor events, including wedding receptions and conventions, are not allowed in the purple tier. In the red tier, they are limited to 100 people and all guests must show proof of either a negative test or that they have been fully vaccinated. More people can attend such events in less restrictive tiers.Most of California's 58 counties are in the red tier, but big population centers like San Francisco, Santa Clara County and Los Angeles County are in the less restrictive orange tier. Just two counties are in the lowest yellow tier.Those capacity limits for private gatherings likely won't help large convention centers, which rely on indoor events that attract thousands of people.Ray Roa, director of sales and marketing for the Fresno Convention & Entertainment Center, said the updates are a step in the right direction, but officials need guidance on how to hold large-scale meetings and events like the ones his venue typically hosts.Gov. Gavin Newsom visited a San Diego vaccination site Friday to highlight California's vaccination efforts. Newsom, 53, got vaccinated on Thursday, the first day California allowed anyone 50 and older to get a shot.“We’re not going to get to herd immunity, we’re not going to get back to that semblance of normalcy unless we get more people vaccinated," Newsom said.___Har reported from San Francisco.___This story has been corrected to show private indoor gatherings in the red tier are limited to 100 people, not 50 people, and to clarify that California won’t require testing or proof of vaccination for many, but not all events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/california-allows-indoor-events-as-covid-19-cases-near-record-low-101617411055525.html

Parents will be allowed to bring babies and very young children, allowing some people the chance to meet the newest members of their family for the first time."I’m particularly pleased to allow residents to have more visitors, including grandchildren, given the isolation and concern felt by so many this past year," Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a statement.Visitors will have to wear personal protective equipment and provide a negative COVID test result.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-ease-curbs-to-allow-care-home-residents-meet-2-visitors-says-pm-johnson-101617408743527.html
03-04-2021||World||Joe Biden 'heartbroken' over deadly attack at US Capitol||A US Capitol police officer was killed and a second injured Friday after a vehicle rammed through security and crashed into a barrier at the Washington complex, forcing it into lockdown less than three months after a mob assault on Congress.Capitol Police shot dead the driver after he jumped out of the car and lunged at them with a knife, Acting Chief Yogananda Pittman told reporters.President Joe Biden, who was with First Lady Jill Biden at Camp David for the Easter holiday, offered his "heartfelt condolences" to the family of William Evans, the veteran policeman killed in the attack."Jill and I were heartbroken to learn of the violent attack at a security checkpoint on the US Capitol grounds," Biden said in a statement.US media said officials had identified the attacker as Noah Green, a 25-year-old Black man from Indiana and an adherent of the black nationalist Nation of Islam movement.Pittman said there was no immediate indication of his motivation or police file on him."It does not appear to be terrorism-related, but obviously we will continue to investigate," Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee added.Some of Green's online postings in March suggested a level of despair and paranoia. He said he was unemployed and had health problems, and made references to biblical concepts of the end of times.He wrote that he had faced "unimaginable tests" and was now "in search of a spiritual journey."In one post he spoke of being tormented by the FBI and CIA, hospitalized and subjected to "mind control," and called the government "the #1 enemy of Black people!"He was also said he was a follower of Louis Farrakhan, the leader of the Nation of Islam, who promotes Black nationalist, anti-white and anti-Semitic thinking.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-heartbroken-over-deadly-attack-at-us-capitol-101617408462966.html

Its selling price far exceeded the $114,000 that another unopened copy that was produced in 1987 fetched in a Heritage auction last summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unopened-super-mario-bros-game-from-1986-sells-for-660000-101617400099370.html
03-04-2021||World||US reaches 100 million with vaccines as Europe faces hiccups||The United States reaped the fruits Friday of its vaccination campaign against Covid-19 as it became the first nation to reach 100 million people, but Europe's rollout faced fresh impediments and South America tightened restrictions in the face of Brazil's soaring infections.The United States reported surging job growth and loosened travel curbs as it reached around half of its adult population with at least one dose, with President Joe Biden vowing to cover the vast majority within weeks.Led by a revival in the leisure and hospitality industries, the US economy created a mammoth 916,000 jobs in March, the Labor Department said.But infections remain on the rise in parts of the United States, prompting Biden to urge Americans to keep wearing masks and taking other precautions to stop the pandemic that has killed more than 2.8 million people worldwide."I plead with you. Don't give back the progress we've all fought so hard to achieve," Biden said in a brief address."We need to finish this job," he said. "We need every American to buckle down and keep their guard up in this homestretch."The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, meanwhile, updated guidance to say that fully vaccinated people can travel without observing quarantines, although they should still wear masks.The United States has suffered a catastrophic Covid toll at more than 550,000 people dead, with health measures polarizing the country since last year when Biden's predecessor Donald Trump criticized restrictions.New woes in EuropeEuropean nations have been struggling to speed up vaccination and several have returned to unpopular lockdowns, with France banning outdoor gatherings of more than six people.Some of Europe's vaccination woes come from its reliance on the AstraZeneca jab, yet to be approved in the United States, after reports of blood clotting.Such incidents are rare and the European Medicines Agency has said AstraZeneca is safe. But the Netherlands on Friday followed Germany in halting jabs of the vaccine for people under the age of 60."We must err on the side of caution, which is why it is wise to press the pause button now as a precaution," Dutch Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said.Only 10 percent of Europe's total population has received one vaccine dose, and four percent have received two, according to the World Health Organization.The WHO director for Europe, Hans Kluge, on Thursday called the rollout "unacceptably slow."Also complicating vaccination efforts is that India, often dubbed the "pharmacy of the world," has slowed down exports as it battles a major surge.India has been ramping up vaccinations, expanding eligibility to everyone over age 45.But on Friday the country reported 81,000 daily infections and 469 deaths, the highest since October.Among those contracting Covid-19 was cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar, who checked into a Mumbai hospital as a precaution but said he hoped to return home within days.China -- where the pulmonary disease first emerged in 2019 in circumstances that remain a topic of intense speculation -- as well as Russia have stepped up exports of their own vaccines.Chinese biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac said it will double capacity to produce its vaccine to two billion doses a year.Growing worries over BrazilOne of the worst Covid crises in the world is unfolding in Brazil, which has reported more deaths than any country after the United States with a staggering 66,500 Covid-19 fatalities in March alone.Latin America's infections have soared past 25 million, according to an AFP tally, likely fueled by a seemingly more contagious variant first detected in Brazil.Rio de Janeiro on Friday extended restrictions, saying that hospitalizations had started to level off for the first time in weeks."You have to give a little more time, no matter how hard it is for companies and for those looking for work to earn a living. These decreases in people-to-people contact are already paying off," Mayor Eduardo Paes told reporters.The city's famous beaches will remain off limits until April 19, when a daily nighttime curfew will also be lifted.But he said that schools would reopen for in-person classes Tuesday.The devastation in Brazil has frightened neighbors already battling their own surging caseloads. Peru and Ecuador announced fresh restrictions and Bolivia sealed the Brazilian border."We are in a very critical moment of the pandemic," Chilean government spokesman Jaime Bellolio said as he announced a closure of borders starting Monday.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a far-right ally of Trump, has dismissed the dangers of the virus and aired conspiracy theories, with the country's military chiefs and top ministers exiting in recent days amid the turmoil.At a field hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, one doctor said she was alarmed at the spread of the virus -- and frustrated to see many of her compatriots ignore face masks, shun social distancing guidelines and even flood to underground parties."I see no difference in people's behavior. People don't seem to understand the magnitude of this," said 53-year-old surgeon Marise Gomes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-reaches-100-million-with-vaccines-as-europe-faces-hiccups-101617399951638.html
03-04-2021||World||Biden lifts Trump sanctions on international court officials||President Joe Biden on Friday lifted sanctions that Donald Trump had imposed on two top officials of the International Criminal Court, undoing one of the past administration's more aggressive moves targeting international institutions and officials.Secretary of State Antony Blinken in a statement stressed that the United States still strongly disagreed with some actions by the court, which is a standing body based at The Hague in the Netherlands charged with handling genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. The United States is not one of the about 120 member countries of the court.“We believe, however, that our concerns about these cases would be better addressed” through diplomacy “rather than through the imposition of sanctions," Blinken wrote.The removal of the sanctions was the latest signal that the Biden administration is intent on returning to the multilateral fold. The Trump administration had unapologetically removed the United States from numerous international institutions and agreements and harshly criticised others, including the ICC, deeming them flawed and working against American interests.Since Biden took office, his administration has rejoined the World Health Organization, re-engaged with the U.N. Human Rights Council, returned to the Paris climate accord and on Friday started talks aimed at returning to the Iran nuclear deal. Trump had pulled out of all five.The court was created to hold accountable perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity in cases where adequate judicial systems were not available. The U.S. has not joined the ICC, which began operations in 2002 after enough countries ratified the treaty that created it, because of concerns the court might be used for politically motivated prosecutions of American troops and officials.Rights groups on Friday applauded Biden for throwing out Trump's sanctions — Amnesty International called those an “act of vandalism” against international justice — but called for Biden to go further, by supporting the court's work and making the United States a member country.The US sanctions had targeted ICC chief prosecutor Fatou Bensouda and the court's head of jurisdiction, Phakiso Mochochoko, for pressing ahead with investigations into the United States and its allies, notably Israel, for alleged war crimes. Two sets of sanctions were imposed, the first being a travel ban on Bensouda in March 2019, and then 18 months later a freeze on any assets she and Mochochoko may have in the United States or U.S. jurisdictions. The second round also made giving the pair “material support” a potentially sanctionable offense.Both sets of sanctions had been roundly denounced by the ICC itself as well as a number of court members and human rights groups. When former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo imposed the financial penalties in September 2020, he attacked the court as “a thoroughly broken and corrupt institution” and said “we will not tolerate its illegitimate attempts to subject Americans to its jurisdiction.”US presidents since Bill Clinton have expressed deep reservations about the court, although some, including President Barack Obama, agreed to limited cooperation with it.The Trump administration, however, was openly hostile to the tribunal and lashed out at Bensouda and others for pursuing prosecutions of Americans for actions in Afghanistan and Israelis for actions against the Palestinians. Israel is not a member of the ICC and, along with the U.S., rejects Palestinian membership because it is not a state.Blinken said the United States sees accountability for atrocities as a national security interest, and pointed to U.S. support for other, often temporary, tribunals globally.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-lifts-trump-sanctions-on-international-court-officials-101617399789545.html
03-04-2021||World||US, Iran hope to salvage Nuclear deal in Vienna||The United States and Iran said on Friday they would start indirect talks with other major world powers next week to try to get both countries back into an accord limiting Iran’s nuclear programme, nearly three years after former president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal.US state department spokesperson Ned Price called the resumption of negotiations, scheduled for Tuesday in Vienna, “a healthy step forward”.But Price added, “These remain early days, and we don’t anticipate an immediate breakthrough as there will be difficult discussions ahead.”Trump pulled the United States out of the Iran Nuclear Deal in 2018, and US President Joe Biden has said rejoining the agreement is a priority for his administration.The Biden administration and Iran have differed on any conditions for that to happen, including the timing of the lifting of US sanctions against Iran, and the stalemate on those points had threatened to pose a major foreign policy setback for the new Biden administration.Agreement on the start of multi-party talks - being held to get Iran and the United States over their differences on conditions for returning to the 2015 nuclear deal - came after talks on Thursday brokered by other governments that have remained in the accord, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). Price said next week’s talks will be structured around working groups that the European Union was forming with the remaining participants in the accord, including Iran.“The primary issues that will be discussed are the nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA, and the sanctions relief steps that the United States would need to take in order to return to compliance as well,” Price said. The US, like Iran, said that it did not anticipate direct talks between America and Iran now. Price said Washington, DC remains open to that idea, however.Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif immediately stressed that no meeting was planned between officials from Iran and the US.In a tweet, Zarif said the aim of the Vienna session would be to “rapidly finalise sanction-lifting & nuclear measures for choreographed removal of all sanctions, followed by Iran ceasing remedial measures”.Iranian state television quoted Abbas Araghchi, Iran’s nuclear negotiator, as saying during Friday’s discussions that any “return by the US to the nuclear deal does not require any negotiation and the path is quite clear”.“The US can return to the deal and stop breaching the law in the same way it withdrew from the deal and imposed illegal sanctions on Iran,” Araghchi was quoted as saying.Russia’s ambassador to international organisations in Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, said that “the impression is that we are on the right track, but the way ahead will not be easy and will require intensive efforts”.Iran has been slowly but steadily violating the restrictions of the 2015 deal.Tehran’s moves have been calculated to put pressure on the other nations in the deal - Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain - to do more to offset crippling sanctions reimposed under Trump.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-iran-hope-to-salvage-nuclear-deal-in-vienna-101617399452774.html
03-04-2021||World||UK MPs say Covid passports backed by Boris are divisive||A group of British lawmakers on Friday warned ministers against introducing “divisive and discriminatory” Covid-19 vaccine passports after UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson backed the scheme.The group of more than 70 MPs - including former leaders of both the main parties - warned that vaccine passports could be used to “deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs”.They spoke out after the UK PM on Thursday said the documents would be “useful” adding that “there’s definitely going to be a world in which international travel will use vaccine passports”.The Daily Telegraph reported on Friday that virus passports could be trialled at the FA Cup final football match in May and the World Snooker Championship starting this month.Earlier this week, Keir Starmer, leader of the opposition Labour Party, said if virus deaths and hospital admissions fall very low, “the British instinct... will be against vaccine passports”.The concept has won support internationally, particularly from countries dependent on tourism.

The suspect died shortly after, Pittman said.The two officers were hospitalised and Pittman said “it is with very heavy heart one of the officers has succumbed to his injuries.”At this time it does not appear to be an ongoing threat,” said Robert Contee, chief of Washington metro police. “It does not appear to be terrorism related.” He said the investigation is continuing.Video footage from the scene showed that the car had been driving fast enough for the airbag to deploy when it hit the security barricade.The authorities said in a statement that the incident occurred at a “vehicle access point” on the Senate side of the Capitol along Constitution Avenue in Washington D.C.“A suspect is in custody. Both officers are injured. All three have been transported to the hospital,” the police said in a tweet.The Capitol was on security lockdown, with no one allowed to enter or exit buildings, but they are allowed to move within the campus of buildings.The Capitol has been under heavy security since the Jan. 6 attack on the building by supporters of former President Donald Trump while Congress was voting to certify the 2020 election in Joe Biden’s favor. Some perimeter fencing has since been removed, but not all of it.Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell tweeted that he was “praying for the United States Capitol Police officers” and “grateful” to first responders on the scene.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/capitol-police-officer-killed-after-man-rammed-car-at-checkpoint-101617390404349.html
03-04-2021||World||US Capitol on lockdown after car rams barricade, injuring 2 officers; driver shot||A man rammed a car into two Capitol Police officers at a barricade outside the US Capitol on Friday afternoon before being shot to death by authorities when he got out of the vehicle while holding what appeared to be a knife, two law enforcement officials told The Associated Press.Both Capitol Police officers were taken to the hospital, with at least one in serious condition, the officials said. The suspect died at a hospital.The crash and shooting happened at a security checkpoint near the Capitol as Congress is on recess. It comes as the Washington region remains on edge nearly three months after a mob of armed insurrectionists stormed the Capitol as Congress was voting to certify Joe Biden’s presidential win.Five people died in the Jan. 6 riot, including Capitol Police officer Brian Sicknick, who was among a badly outnumbered force trying to fight off insurrectionists who supported former President Donald Trump's bid to overturn the election. Authorities installed a tall perimeter fence around the Capitol and for months restricted traffic along the roads closest to the building, but they have begun pulling back some of the emergency measures in recent weeks.While there was no immediate connection apparent between Jan. 6 and Friday, the incident underscores that the building and campus remain potential targets for violence. It occurred about 100 yards (91 meters) from the entrance of the building on the Senate side of the Capitol.The security checkpoint is typically used by senators and staff on weekdays, but lawmakers are away for recess. Fencing that prevented vehicular traffic near that area was recently removed.Capitol Police said that someone rammed a vehicle into two of its officers. The law enforcement officials told the AP that the driver then got out of the car with what appeared to be a knife. It's unclear which member of law enforcement shot the suspect.The officials initially said the suspect was being taken to the hospital in critical condition. One of the officers who was injured was taken by police car to the hospital; the other was being transported by emergency medical crews, the officials said.The officials could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The US Capitol complex was placed on lockdown after the shooting and staff were told they could not enter or exit buildings. Video showed National Guard troops mobilizing near the area of the crash.Video posted online showed a dark colored sedan crashed against a vehicle barrier and a police K-9 inspecting the vehicle. Law enforcement and paramedics could be seen caring for at least one unidentified individual.President Biden had just departed the White House for Camp David when the incident occurred. As customary, he was traveling with a member of the National Security Council Staff who was expected to brief him on the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-complex-on-lockdown-after-report-of-gunshots-nearby-101617384683470.html
