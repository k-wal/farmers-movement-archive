However, the White House disclosed that Russia has more troops on Ukraine's eastern border than at any time since 2014, when it annexed Crimea and backed separatist territory seizures.Asked by a lawmaker to estimate the chances of an invasion in the next few weeks, Wolters said: "Low to medium."Pressed by a different lawmaker to explain whether that risk would change after that period, Wolters kept his cards close, saying: "The answer is, it depends.""And I would have to take each and every second of the day from this point till tomorrow to give you a different answer," he said.If the current trajectory stayed the same, however, Wolters estimated the risk of an invasion could decrease."My sense is, with the trend that I see right now, that the likelihood of an occurrence will start to wane," he said.Ukraine and Russia have traded blame over a spike in violence in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, where Ukrainian troops have battled Russian-backed forces in a conflict that Kyiv says has killed 14,000 people since 2014.Tensions over a buildup of Russian troops on Ukraine's eastern border have pushed up the cost of raising domestic debt and prompted the government to accelerate efforts to secure more International Monetary Fund loans, a presidential adviser told Reuters on Thursday.(Reporting by Phil Stewart and Idrees Ali; Editing by Franklin Paul and Jonathan Oatis)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lowtomedium-risk-of-russia-invading-ukraine-in-next-few-weeks-us-general-101618507789668.html

He argued that would be a last resort given the human and financial cost for the economy, and instead tightened curbs in Covid hot spots, like the Paris region of Ile-de-France and Provence in the south.Yet deaths continued to climb as variants spread, prompting the French leader to eventually implement additional restrictions in March that effectively amount to another lockdown.With Macron up for re-election in 12 months time, the speed with which he can get the pandemic under control and reopen the economy could play a critical role in shaping his political future.The pandemic has been “cruel,” especially to those “who sometimes were not able to accompany -- during the last moments and in death -- a father, a mother, a loved one, a friend,” the president told Le Parisien newspaper.He has been weighing how best to mark the grim milestone, and for the moment his office hasn’t released the details of any plans. Government spokesman Gabriel Attal said on Wednesday only that there will obviously be “a time of tribute, of mourning for the nation.”France is now ranked third in Europe for fatalities.The U.K. became the first European country to cross the 100,000 death mark at the end of January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was deeply sorry for every life lost and that the government had done everything it could. Italy, the original epicenter of Europe’s outbreak, reached what Prime Minister Mario Draghi called the “terrible threshold” in early March.Like other countries, Macron’s government had been counting on vaccines to help bring the outbreak under control, but the rollout across the region has been plagued by delays. And despite an acceleration over the past few weeks, the inoculations have so far had a marginal impact, with most EU states experiencing a third wave.By April 14, France had administered a total of 15.75 million vaccine doses, of which 11.6 million were first doses, according to data disclosed by health authorities.About 300 people are dying each day in French hospitals with Covid-19, and some 5,900 patients are hospitalized in intensive care units across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-france-crosses-100-000-deaths-has-third-highest-fatalities-in-europe-101618506497792.html

But he also noted that a lot of violent extremist threats "do not fit into nice ideological buckets."Wray's comments about far-right U.S. extremists traveling to Europe track the findings in a non-public version of a report on domestic extremists recently published by U.S spy agencies.Reuters reported that the non-public report said Americans had traveled to Ukraine to fight with pro-Russian forces against the country’s elected government.Wray did not specify who the racially-motivated extremists he mentioned were but the report said U.S. white supremacists are the "actors with the most persistent and concerning transnational connections."Wray told legislators that the FBI was engaged in an "ongoing effort" to look out for new threats to the U.S. Capitol -- which was attacked by supporters of President Donald Trump on Jan. 6 -- and state capitols. He said the agency was receiving "an avalanche of tips that come in."Intelligence officials also told the committee they viewed current Russian military movements near Ukraine as a "show of force."The directors of the Defense Intelligence Agency and Central Intelligence Agency told the House Intelligence Committee U.S. agencies were monitoring Russian movements. "We all have to take very seriously the buildup," CIA director William Burns said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-far-right-extremists-engaged-with-like-minded-activists-overseas-fbi-chief-101618506160629.html
15-04-2021||World||Princes William, Harry won't walk side-by-side at Philip's funeral||Prince William and Prince Harry won’t walk side-by-side Saturday as they follow their grandfather’s coffin into the church ahead of Prince Philip’s funeral, minimizing the chances of any awkward moments between the brothers who are grappling with strained relations since Harry’s decision to step away from royal duties last year.Buckingham Palace on Thursday released the broad outlines of the funeral program for Queen Elizabeth II's husband, who died April 9 at 99. The palace revealed that William and Harry’s cousin, Peter Phillips, will walk between the princes as they escort the coffin to St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle, west of London.Prince Charles, the heir to the throne and the father of the princes, together with his sister, Princess Anne, will lead the 15-member procession.The brothers had been closely watched as Saturday’s funeral will almost certainly remind the pair of their shared grief at another royal funeral more than two decades ago. As young boys, both walked behind their mother Princess Diana’s coffin in 1997 in London in a ceremony watched around the world.Palace officials refused to comment when asked whether the positioning of William and Harry was an effort to minimize family tensions, which have grown after Harry and his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey that suggested an unnamed member of the royal family had made a racist comment to Harry before the birth of their child Archie.Meghan, who is pregnant and living in California with Harry, is not coming to the funeral on the advice of her doctor.“We’re not going to be drawn into those perceptions of drama or anything like that,’’ a palace spokesman said while speaking on condition of anonymity in line with policy. “This is a funeral and the arrangements have been agreed and they represent Her Majesty’s wishes.”In another effort to preserve family unity, the palace said senior royals would wear civilian clothes to the funeral. The decision, signed off by the queen, means that Harry won’t risk being the only member of the royal family not in uniform during the funeral.Members of the royal family often wear uniforms to public events by virtue of their honorary roles with the British Army, Royal Navy and Royal Air Force, but Harry lost his honorary military titles when he decided to give up frontline royal duties last year. As a result, protocol suggests that Harry, an army veteran who served two tours of duty in Afghanistan, would only wear a suit with medals at royal functions.The decision also sidesteps another potential controversy after reports that Prince Andrew, the queen's second-oldest son, considered wearing an admiral’s uniform to his father’s funeral. Andrew retains his military titles even though he was forced to step away from royal duties after a disastrous interview with the BBC about his acquaintance with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Attendance at the funeral will be limited to 30 people because of the coronavirus restrictions in England. The list will include several of Philip’s relatives from Germany, together with immediate members of the royal family. The children in the family will not attend.Guests will wear masks inside the chapel and observe social distancing. The queen, always the first to set an example, will also wear a mask.In other details released about the funeral, Royal Marine buglers will play “Action Stations,” an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle.Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, served in the Royal Navy for 12 years and maintained close ties to the armed forces throughout his life. Military personnel will have a large role in honoring him Saturday despite the attendance limit.Members of the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, the Royal Air Force and the British Army will take part in the funeral procession. Philip’s coffin will be carried to St. George’s Chapel on a specially adapted Land Rover that he designed himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/princes-william-harry-won-t-walk-side-by-side-at-philip-s-funeral-101618503461055.html

"I read vulnerability, loved ones, loss and separation, demise, but, importantly, also survival — all rolled into one graphic image. If you look at the image long enough, you’ll see wings: a symbol of flight and hope.”The image taken by Nissen for the Panos Pictures agency and the Danish daily Politiken also won first prize in the prestigious contest's General News Singles category.“The main message of this image is empathy. It’s love and compassion," Nissen said in a comment released by contest organizers."It’s a really, really hard, grim situation and then in that horror, in that suffering, I think this picture also brings some light,” Nissen said at an online awards ceremony after being told he had won the award and the 5,000-euro ($6,000) prize that goes with it.Second place in the category was a far more grim COVID-19 image — the body of a suspected coronavirus victim tightly wrapped in plastic in a hospital in Indonesia on April 18 by Indonesian photographer Joshua Irwandi.The pandemic even reached the Environment Singles category, with U.S. photographer Ralph Pace winning for his image of a curious California sea lion swimming toward a face mask drifting underwater at the Breakwater dive site in Monterey.Judges looked at 74,470 photographs by 4,315 photographers before selecting winners in eight categories including general news, sports, the environment and portraits.The World Press Photo Story of the Year was awarded to Italian documentary photographer Antonio Faccilongo, working for Getty Reportage, for a series titled “Habibi" about Palestinian detainees in Israeli prisons who smuggle their semen out of detention facilities in the hopes of raising a family.Winner in the Spot News Singles category was an image embodying the debate on race in the United States. The photo by Evelyn Hockstein for The Washington Post shows a white man and a Black woman disagreeing about the removal of the Emancipation Memorial in Washington, D.C., which depicts a freed slave kneeling at Abraham Lincoln’s feet.The Black Lives Matter movement also featured, with Associated Press photographer John Minchillo's series about the aftermath of the killing of George Floyd taking third prize in the Spot News Stories category that was won by Italian Lorenzo Tugnoli working for Contrasto for a series of images documenting the devastating port blast in Beirut.The Contemporary Issues Story category was won by Russian photographer Alexey Vasilyev with a series about the film industry in the northeast Russian region of Sakha. Associated Press photographer Maya Alleruzzo took second place in the category with a story about the Islamic State group enslaving Yazidi women in Iraq.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hug-curtain-image-named-world-press-photo-of-the-year-101618501727066.html

Jurors will then begin deliberating one of the most closely watched police misconduct cases ever seen in the United States.Chauvin, who is white, was seen in bystander video kneeling on the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, for more than nine minutes after Floyd was accused of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes. The footage of his death sparked global protests against the disproportionate use of force by police against Black people.His lawyers called an expert on the use of force to tell the jury that Chauvin's use of force was appropriate, contradicting the Minneapolis police chief, who testified that it far exceeded an appropriate response.They also called a forensic pathologist, former Maryland chief medical examiner Dr. David Fowler, who said Floyd, whose death was ruled a homicide at the hands of the police, really died of heart disease, and that the exhaust fumes of the adjacent police car may have also poisoned him.Dr. Martin Tobin, a pulmonologist who testified as an expert witness for prosecutors, will return to the stand on Thursday as a rebuttal witness in an effort to undermine Fowler's testimony.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chauvin-waives-right-to-testify-rests-case-at-murder-trial-for-floyd-arrest-101618500161007.html

15-04-2021||World||Rare blood clot risk higher from Covid-19 than vaccine: UK study||The risk of rare blood clotting following the Covid-19 infection is around 100 times greater than normal, several times higher than it is post-vaccination or following influenza, according to a new University of Oxford study published on Thursday.The research found that the rare blood clotting known as Cerebral Venous Thrombosis (CVT) is more common after Covid-19 than in any of the comparison groups, with 30 per cent of these cases occurring in the under 30s.Compared to the current Covid-19 vaccines being administered, this risk is between 8-10 times higher, and compared to the baseline, approximately 100 times higher.The study follows reports of possible links between the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine and rare cases of CVT, which are undergoing deeper investigations by the medicines regulators even as the jabs have been ruled as safe and effective.“There are concerns about possible associations between vaccines and CVT, causing governments and regulators to restrict the use of certain vaccines. Yet, one key question remained unknown: ‘What is the risk of CVT following a diagnosis of Covid-19?’,” said Paul Harrison, one of study authors as Professor of Psychiatry and Head of the Translational Neurobiology Group at the University of Oxford.“We’ve reached two important conclusions. Firstly, Covid-19 markedly increases the risk of CVT, adding to the list of blood clotting problems this infection causes.“Secondly, the Covid-19 risk is higher than we see with the current vaccines, even for those under 30; something that should be taken into account when considering the balances between risks and benefits for vaccination,” he said.The study authors, led by Professor Harrison and Dr Maxime Taquet from Oxford University’s Department of Psychiatry and the NIHR Oxford Health Biomedical Research Centre, counted the number of CVT cases diagnosed in the two weeks following diagnosis of Covid-19, or after the first dose of a vaccine. They then compared these to calculated incidences of CVT following influenza, and the background level in the general population.“The signals that Covid-19 is linked to CVT, as well as portal vein thrombosis – a clotting disorder of the liver – is clear, and one we should take note of,” said Dr Maxime Taquet, also from the Translational Neurobiology Group.In the study of over 500,000 Covid-19 patients, CVT occurred in 39 in a million patients. In over 480,000 people receiving a Covid-19 mRNA vaccine, such as Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna, CVT occurred in four in a million, and CVT has been reported to occur in about five in a million people after first dose of the Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine.“Compared to the mRNA vaccines, the risk of a CVT from Covid-19 is about 10 times greater. Compared to the AZ-Oxford (Oxford/AstraZeneca) vaccine, the risk of a CVT from Covid-19 is about eight times greater,” the findings note.However, the researchers said that all comparisons must be interpreted cautiously since data is still accruing. An important factor that requires further research is whether Covid-19 and vaccines lead to CVT by the same or different mechanisms. There may also be under-reporting or mis-coding of CVT in medical records, and therefore uncertainty as to the precision of the results, the study authors note.The findings come as numerous countries have limited use of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine to certain age groups or paused its rollout. Denmark has dropped the jab from its vaccination programme permanently following reports of very rare cases of blood clots.Earlier this month, the UK’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) said the vaccine is still safe and effective but said that people under-30 will be offered an alternative, where possible, as an additional precaution.The overall advice, including from the World Health Organisation (WHO), remains in favour of continued vaccinations as the experts concluded that the life-saving benefits of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine continue to outweigh the risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rare-blood-clot-risk-higher-from-covid-19-than-vaccine-uk-study-101618498309232.html
15-04-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson’s visit to boost bilateral partnership in tackling future pandemics||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India from April 25 will be an opportunity to consolidate the bilateral partnership in addressing future pandemics through health infrastructure development and joint investment in research on vaccines. This will be Johnson’s first major visit outside Europe after the re-election of the Conservative government in the UK election in December 2019. The last visit by a UK prime minister to India was by Theresa May in November 2016. The visit to India will be shorter than the originally planned trip of four to five days and won’t include stopovers in Mumbai and Pune because of the Covid-19 situation. The bulk of Johnson’s engagements, including his meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be on April 26. India-UK collaboration in Covid-19 mitigation efforts over the past year emerged as the “silver lining in the bilateral relationship”, and Johnson’s visit will be an opportunity to consolidate the bilateral partnership in addressing future pandemics through health infrastructure development, joint investment in research and development of vaccines, swifter exchanges of healthcare professionals and strengthening existing institutional links and partnerships in the health sector, the Indian high commission in London said in a statement. Work in this field can build on the success in the joint development, manufacture and distribution of the Oxford-Astra Zeneca vaccine, it said. The visit is also expected to boost cooperation in areas ranging from defence and security to the Indo-Pacific and western Indian Ocean region, trade and investment and climate change. In the post-Brexit period, the UK has been working on securing an enhanced trade partnership with India as a step towards a possible bilateral free trade agreement, the statement said. Bilateral trade and investment flows have seen steady and sustained growth in recent years, and India and the UK are committed to contribute and lead global post-pandemic recovery efforts. “India and UK are set to agree on a Roadmap 2030 for future relations. The 2030 vision is for revitalised and dynamic connect between people, re-energised trade, investment and technological collaboration, enhanced defence and security cooperation and closer engagement on regional issues, including the Indian Ocean Region and the Indo-Pacific,” the statement said. In March, the UK published its once-in-a-generation integrated review of security, defence, development and foreign policy, which reflected a significant reorientation of relations to the Indo-Pacific. Johnson’s visit is expected to bring focus on dialogue and bilateral cooperation to realise the full potential of enhanced cooperation in this region, the statement said. The UK will be hosting the 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) in Glasgow in November, and it has been closely associated with India’s International Solar Alliance (ISA) and Coalition for Disaster Resilient Infrastructure (CDRI). Joint efforts by India and the UK in climate change mitigation will be a key priority of Johnson’s visit. Given the significant contributions of the Indian diaspora in the UK, Johnson’s visit is also expected to deliver on further streamlining and liberalising migration and mobility of nationals between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-pm-boris-johnson-s-visit-to-boost-bilateral-partnership-in-tackling-future-pandemics-101618498029998.html

15-04-2021||World||US jobless claims plunge to 576,000, lowest since pandemic||The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to 576,000, a post-Covid low and a hopeful sign that layoffs are easing as the economy recovers from the pandemic recession.The Labor Department said Thursday that applications plummeted by 193,000 from a revised 769,000 a week earlier. Jobless claims are now down sharply from a peak of 900,000 in early January and well below the 700,000-plus level they had been stuck at for months.The decline in unemployment claims coincides with other evidence that the economy is strengthening as vaccinations accelerate, pandemic business restrictions are lifted in many states and Americans appear increasingly willing to travel, shop, eat out and otherwise spend again. In March, employers added a healthy 916,000 jobs, the most since August, and the unemployment rate fell to 6%, less than half the pandemic peak of 14.8%.For the week ending March 27, 16.9 million people were continuing to collect unemployment benefits, down from 18.2 million in the previous week. That decline suggests that some of the unemployed are being called back to jobs.Yet the still-high number of ongoing recipients shows that even as the economy has improved in recent weeks, millions are facing a loss of a job or income and have been struggling to pay bills or rent. The last time the jobless rate was this low, weekly claims were around 350,000, still well below their current level.Economists point to a range of potential explanations. Some states are still struggling to clear backlogs of applications from previous weeks. As a result, jobless claims being reported now may stem from layoffs that occurred weeks ago. Other states are also facing what they suspect is a sizable number of fraudulent claims for unemployment aid.Another possible factor is that under President Joe Biden’s $1.9 trillion rescue package, the federal government is now supplementing weekly jobless benefits by $300 a week — on top of the average state unemployment payment of about $340 — through September. That extra money may be encouraging more people to request unemployment aid.Still, not all unemployment applications are approved. The government reports each week on how many people have applied for aid — but not how many have actually received it. Claims are rejected if the applicants hadn’t earned enough money to qualify or had been fired or quit their jobs. Unemployment aid is intended for people who have been laid off through no fault of their own.Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, has found that the proportion of unemployment claims that are approved plummeted in the winter months. In February, for example, fewer than 25% of applications were approved and paid, Feroli discovered, down from a long-run average of about 45%. That suggests that the current level of jobless claims has been artificially inflated as more Americans seek benefits, because of the higher payments, even though some don’t actually qualify.Most analysts have grown bullish about the economy’s prospects for the coming months. They include Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who expressed his belief in an appearance last Sunday on “60 Minutes” that the economy is at “an inflection point" and appears poised for a boom.“We feel like we’re at a place where the economy’s about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly,” Powell said. “This growth that we’re expecting in the second half of this year is going to be very strong. And job creation, I would expect to be very strong.”Many economists, in fact, are concerned more about a potential burst of inflation stemming from the unleashing of pent-up consumer demand. Prices for lumber, copper, oil and other raw materials have already risen as demand for gas, homes and electronic equipment has jumped.Consumer prices rose 0.6% in March, the most since 2012, the government reported Tuesday, and are up 2.6% in the past year. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, though, prices rose by a more benign 1.6% year over year.Powell has said that while inflation will likely pick up in the coming months, the price increases will probably ease as the pandemic-induced disruptions in many industries’ supply chains are worked out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-plunge-to-576-000-lowest-since-pandemic-101618492898270.html

Situation is out of control in Pakistan as Lakhs of protestors gathered against Imran Khan Govt and Pak Army," said one of the users.On Wednesday, Pakistan Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed had announced that the government has decided to ban the radical Islamist Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), whose supporters and workers have been carrying out violent protests across the country for three days after the arrest of their chief.According to Dawn, he said the religiopolitical outfit would be banned under Rule 11(b) of the Anti-Terrorism Act (ATA), 1997.Rashid said the Punjab government had recommended a ban on the organisation, for which a summary was being sent to the federal cabinet. He said TLP leaders used to come to all rounds of talks with the government after issuing instructions to their workers regarding road closures."They were more prepared than us but today we've decided that [a] ban on TLP [will be placed] and this file is going to the cabinet for the approval from today," the minister said.The minister's statement came after law enforcement agencies and officials moved to clear TLP activists from roads in different cities of the country as protests entered the third day.Rashid said that the TLP workers through blocking roads had stopped ambulances from reaching their destinations and impeded the transport of oxygen cylinders for Covid-19 patients.He called upon TLP members "who are running the media" to surrender, saying they were mistaken in their belief that they could create problems for the government through social media."We want a document that exalts the flag of the Prophet (PBUH), but what you are demanding gives an impression of us being an extremist-minded state to the world," he told the TLP leadership.The TLP is protesting against the arrest of their leader Saad Hussain Rizvi, who was taken into custody earlier this week, and blasphemous caricatures published in France. They have demanded that the French ambassador be sent home and import of goods from that country banned, as reported by Dawn.According to media reports, the Imran Khan-led Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf government signed an agreement with the TLP in November last agreeing to expel the French Ambassador.The TLP launched a massive protest in November last year against the cartoons but dispersed after the agreement with the government to expel the Ambassador by February.

Foreign troops stationed in Afghanistan should withdraw in a responsible and orderly manner to ensure a smooth transition in Afghanistan and to avoid terrorist forces from taking advantage of chaos," Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian told a media briefing here while responding to questions on US troops pullout plan.Also Read | Biden’s exit plan cements India’s place at Afghan table"The US is the biggest external factor affecting the issue of Afghanistan... It must take full responsibility for preserving the outcomes of Afghanistan’s peaceful construction and reconstruction and accommodate legitimate security concerns of the countries in the region," he said.To a question that the US is linking its troops withdrawal to focus on China, Zhao said, "the US side links its withdrawal from Afghanistan to China’s challenge.Also Read | Blinken visits Afghanistan as US set to withdraw troops"This reflects deep rooted zero-sum mind-set from the Cold War which is detrimental to mutual trust between the two countries and it is not conducive to cooperation and coordination on international and regional issues.""We have to emphasise that the political solution to Afghanistan and early realisation of peace and stability in the country and the fight against terrorism are in the common interest of all parties concerned, including China and the US and are also common aspiration of the international community," he said.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki has said that the US "will begin an orderly drawdown of the remaining forces before May 1 and plan to have all US troops out of the country before the 20th anniversary of 9/11."Later US President Joe Biden said, "It is time to end America's longest war. It is time for American troops to come home."Zhao also said China will attend the UN conference on Afghanistan scheduled to be held in Istanbul from Aril 20 to May 4 to find a peaceful solution to Afghanistan’s civil strife.Observers say that the US' latest plan to speed up the withdrawal of more troops from Afghanistan may have troubling consequences for China.China, whose volatile Xinjiang province shares border with the Afghanistan, has been expressing concern over the US troops withdrawal despite its current round of tensions with Washington on a host of issues including, the US allegation of genocide by China against Muslim Uygurs in Xinjiang.China has been refuting allegations of mass detention camps and other human rights violations against Uygurs.The previous Trump administration had lifted the ban on the separatist East Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), a Uygur militant outfit.The ETIM was designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN’s 1267 counter-terrorism committee in 2002 for its alleged association with Al-Qaida, the then al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden and the Taliban.Despite its all-weather ties with Pakistan, which holds a strong control over the Taliban as it operates from the Pakistani territory, China’s concerns stem from the reports of regrouping of hundreds of Uygur militants who worked with Islamic State in Syria in Afghanistan to stage attacks in Xinjiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/terrorists-may-take-advantage-china-warns-on-us-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-101618491669642.html

"We will be hearing about a decision on the emergency use listing in April or early May, so please keep an eye on that."A WHO panel in final stages of review of the Chinese vaccines has said that a decision for at least one could come on April 26, while a second meeting has been planned for May 3, should more time be needed to make a decision on both shots.Such an emergency WHO listing is a prerequisite for purchase by the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility designed to get shots to poorer countries. It also helps guide countries with less developed regulatory systems about a vaccine's safety and efficacy.So far, the WHO has issued emergency listings for Pfizer and BioNTech's COVID-19 vaccine, as well as versions of AstraZeneca's vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India and South Korea's AstraZeneca-SKBio.CanSino's vaccine relies on a viral vector to deliver DNA to prompt an immune response, a technique similar to that used in both AstraZeneca's and Johnson & Johnson's vaccines now being investigated for their association with very rare blood clots combined with low platelet counts.CanSino has said there have been no reports of blood clots.Sinovac's vaccine, being used in places including Hong Kong and Brazil, relies on inactivated coronaviruses to generate an immune response, a technique used for decades including against polio.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-expects-decision-on-emergency-listing-for-chinese-vaccines-soon-101618491539266.html

The last time they seized the embassy without warning, so I need to be careful.”He did not elaborate on what kind of help he wanted from the British government.Britain Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said last week he condemned the “bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime in London.”More than 700 people in Myanmar have been killed in a brutal crackdown against pro-democracy protesters and others opposed to February’s coup.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-envoy-evicted-by-military-attache-appeals-for-uk-govt-s-help-101618490224826.html
15-04-2021||World||French lawmakers approve contentious bill to extend police powers||France's parliament passed a security bill Thursday to extend police powers despite criticism from civil rights activists who fear it threatens efforts to denounce police abuse.The bill was approved by 75 votes for and 33 against at the National Assembly, where French President Emmanuel Macron's party, which proposed the measure, has a large majority. The Senate has already adopted the bill.In an effort to quell criticism, lawmakers have redrafted the most controversial article of the text. It now says helping to identify on-duty police officers “with the obvious intent of harming'' will be punished by up to 5 years in prison and a 75,000 euro-fine (USD 89,800).Tens of thousands of protesters marched in Paris in November to denounced the initial provision that was making it illegal to publish images of police officers with intent to cause them harm.Opponents say the new draft still remains vague and subject to interpretation by police officers. They also fear it will intimidate people trying to fight police abuse and discrimination by taking and publishing pictures and videos.Macron's government said the law was needed to better protect police amid threats and attacks by a violent fringe and increasing harassment on social media.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin on Thursday praised the “compromise” that lawmakers found on the text. The bill also gives more autonomy to local police and extends the use of surveillance drones, amid other measures.The French branch of Amnesty International warned on Twitter about the “dangers” the bill posed to civil liberties and denounced its “generalized surveillance practices.”The text has “vague provisions that could allow abusive and unfair legal proceedings," the rights group said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-lawmakers-approve-contentious-bill-to-extend-police-powers-101618489644603.html

Bravo and thank you."The first phase of the salvage operation was complicated by the need to cut up a 200-tonne mass of twisted metal left after the fire consumed scaffolding that had been erected around the wood-and-lead spire at the time of the blaze.Work was also temporarily halted because of worries over lead contamination and slowed at times by the coronavirus pandemic.Technicians still have to reinforce some of the vaults closest to those destroyed with wooden arch-shaped frames that are lifted into place by crane, and extend a tarpaulin roof over the transept to protect the restoration work once it begins."HOLDING UP"The cathedral will only be declared out of danger once the phase to secure the site is complete, but all the indications were positive, said Jeremie Patrier-Leitus, a spokesman for the public body overseeing the restoration."The cathedral hasn't moved since the fire, it's holding up."The cathedral will be restored to its original design, including the 96-metre (315-feet) spire designed by architect Eugene Viollet-le-Duc and added in the mid-1800s. The felling of oaks for the new spire's frame has begun.Financing for the restoration was not a concern yet, said General Jean-Louis Georgelin, the former army chief of staff named by Macron to head the renovation. Some 834 million euros in donations flooded in from billionaire tycoons and households in France and abroad in the fire's aftermath."We will need all these donations to complete the necessary work. We need people to keep giving money," Georgelin told France Inter radio.Tearful Parisians and stunned tourists gazed in disbelief while the inferno raged at the cathedral, which marks the very centre of Paris. Some sang liturgical music in harmonies late into the night as they stood vigil, while others prayed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/notredame-fire-macron-hails-painstaking-efforts-to-rebuild-iconic-cathedral-101618489652615.html
15-04-2021||World||Chauvin's defense testifies George Floyd died from heart trouble, not restraint||George Floyd died of a sudden heart rhythm disturbance as a result of his heart disease, a forensic pathologist testified for the defense at former Officer Derek Chauvin's murder trial, contradicting prosecution experts who said Floyd succumbed to a lack of oxygen from the way he was pinned down.Dr. David Fowler, a former Maryland chief medical examiner who is now with a consulting firm, said Wednesday the fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's system, and possibly carbon monoxide poisoning from auto exhaust, were contributing factors in the 46-year-old Black man's death last May.“All of those combined to cause Mr. Floyd’s death,” he said on the second day of the defense case.Fowler also testified that he would classify the manner of death “undetermined,” rather than homicide, as the county's chief medical examiner ruled. He said Floyd's death had too many conflicting factors, some of which could be ruled homicide and some that could be considered accidental.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson is trying to prove that the 19-year Minneapolis police veteran did what he was trained to do and that Floyd died because of his illegal drug use and underlying health problems.Prosecutors say Floyd died because the white officer's knee was pressed against Floyd’s neck or neck area for 9 1/2 minutes as he lay on the pavement on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind him and his face jammed against the ground.Fowler listed a multitude of factors or potential ones: Floyd’s narrowed arteries, his enlarged heart, his high blood pressure, his drug use, the stress of his restraint, the vehicle exhaust, and a tumor or growth in his lower abdomen that can sometimes play a role in high blood pressure by releasing “fight-or-flight” hormones.Fowler said all of those factors could have acted together to cause Floyd’s heart to work harder, suffer an arrhythmia, or abnormal rhythm, and suddenly stop.Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell launched an aggressive cross-examination, attacking Fowler's findings down the line. He got Fowler to acknowledge that even someone who dies from being deprived of oxygen ultimately dies of an arrhythmia.He also got Fowler to admit that he didn’t take the weight of Chauvin’s gear into account when he analyzed the pressure on Floyd’s body. Blackwell further accused Fowler of jumping to conclusions and suggesting to the jury that Floyd had a white pill in his mouth in the video of his arrest. Fowler denied saying that.Blackwell also attacked Fowler's testimony about carbon monoxide, which displaces oxygen in the bloodstream.In his original testimony, Fowler said carbon monoxide could have contributed to oxygen depletion in Floyd, noting that he was facing the tailpipe end of a squad car. But Floyd's blood was never tested for carbon monoxide.“You haven’t seen any data or test results that showed Mr. Floyd had a single injury from carbon monoxide. Is that true?” Blackwell asked.“That is correct, because it was never sent,” Fowler said.Blackwell also noted that the squad car was a gas-electric hybrid and that Fowler had no data on how much carbon monoxide was actually released. And he suggested that the witness assumed the engine was running at the time. Fowler said he believed it was.The prosecutor also got Fowler to agree that it would take four minutes to cause irreversible brain damage if the brain is starved of oxygen, and that insufficient oxygen can cause the heart to stop."And if a person dies as a result of low oxygen, that person is also going to die ultimately of a fatal arrhythmia, right?” Blackwell asked.Fowler responded: “Correct. Every one of us in this room will have a fatal arrhythmia at some point.”Fowler further agreed that Floyd should have been given immediate attention when he went into cardiac arrest because there still was a chance to save him at that point.A number of medical experts called by prosecutors have said Floyd died from a lack of oxygen because his breathing was constricted by the way he was held down. A cardiology expert rejected the notion that Floyd died of heart problems, saying all indications were that he had "an exceptionally strong heart.”But Fowler said that Chauvin’s knee on Floyd was “nowhere close to his airway” and that Floyd’s speaking and groaning showed that his airway was still open. He also testified that Chauvin’s knee was not applied with enough pressure to cause any bruises or scrapes on Floyd’s neck or back.And he said that Floyd did not complain of vision changes or other symptoms consistent with hypoxia, or insufficient oxygen to the brain, and that he was coherent until shortly before he suddenly stopped moving.“The bottom line is, moving air in and out, and speaking and making noise is very good evidence that the airway was not closed,” Fowler said.Blackwell ended his cross-examination by getting two questions before the jury: Whether Chauvin's actions played a role in Floyd's death, or whether Floyd's death was coincidental and unrelated. But the defense objected, and Fowler was not permitted to answer.Chauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death after his arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market. The video of Floyd gasping that he couldn't breathe as bystanders yelled at Chauvin to get off him triggered worldwide protests, violence and a furious examination of racism and policing in the U.S.The defense hasn’t said whether Chauvin will take the stand.___Find AP’s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd___Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.

15-04-2021||World||Blinken visits Afghanistan as US set to withdraw troops||U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken made a visit to Afghanistan on Thursday to brief the country’s leaders on U.S. plans to withdraw its remaining troops by Sept. 11 and to press for a peace agreement with the Taliban.Blinken made the stop, which wasn’t announced beforehand in keeping with the strict security measures required for such visits, after President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that the U.S. was pulling the more than 2,500 remaining troops from the country by the 20th anniversary of the 2001 terrorist attacks. An additional 7,000 allied forces are also expected to withdraw.“The reason I’m here, so quickly after the president’s speech last night, is to demonstrate literally, by our presence, that we have an enduring an ongoing commitment to Afghanistan,” Blinken told a crowd at the U.S Embassy in Kabul. He then met with President Ashraf Ghani and chief executive Abdullah Abdullah, saying the two countries’ “partnership is changing, but the partnership is enduring.”“We respect the decision and are adjusting our priorities,” Ghani told him.The trip comes after Blinken visited NATO allies in Brussels to coordinate plans for the withdrawal. The decision pushes back a May 1 deadline that the Trump administration agreed to with Taliban leaders last year, and the move risks retaliation against Afghan and U.S. forces.Military and diplomatic leaders had said a rushed withdrawal could destabilize the country. Officials had also argued that the Pentagon’s previous “conditions-based” approach for withdrawal was a recipe for leaving U.S. forces in the country forever.Although some members of Congress have endorsed Biden’s withdrawal plans, lawmakers from both parties have said it would set the stage for the Taliban to return to power and for terrorists from al-Qaeda and Islamic State to re-establish operations in the country.Blinken told reporters in Brussels on April 14 that the U.S. will work closely with allies on a “safe, deliberate and coordinated withdrawal of our forces from Afghanistan.”U.S. officials hope the impending troop withdrawal will create a new sense of urgency for Ghani’s government to agree to a peace deal with the Taliban. At the same time, it’s complicated a U.S.-backed peace conference in Istanbul that representatives of the Afghan government and the Taliban were due to attend from April 24. The Taliban said in a tweet late Tuesday that it wouldn’t participate.A report on worldwide threats issued by U.S. intelligence agencies on April 13 forecast that the Taliban “is likely to make gains on the battlefield, and the Afghan government will struggle to hold the Taliban at bay if the coalition withdraws support.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-visits-afghanistan-as-us-set-to-withdraw-troops-101618486671981.html
15-04-2021||World||WHO asks researchers to use Covid-19 lessons to battle deadly superbugs||Lessons learned during the Covid-19 pandemic should be used to fight the spread of drug-resistant bacteria, which kill tens of thousands of people each year, the World Health Organization said Thursday.The UN health agency warned that the world was running out of options for fighting so-called superbugs, with few new effective antibiotics in the pipeline.But it said that the coronavirus crisis, which had dramatically deepened the global understanding of the health and economic implications of an uncontrolled pandemic, could spur progress.The worldwide push to rein in the pandemic had proven that rapid progress can be made when there is enough political will, the WHO pointed out."Antibiotics present the Achilles heel for universal health coverage and our global health security," Haileyesus Getahun, who heads the WHO's antimicrobial resistance division, warned in a statement."Opportunities emerging from the Covid-19 pandemic must be seized to bring to the forefront the needs for sustainable investments in (research and development) of new and effective antibiotics."Among other things, he said, there should be a global mechanism to pool funding to battle the scourge of antimicrobial resistance, along the same lines as the mechanisms created to fund the development of Covid-19 vaccines.Antibiotic resistance happens when bugs become immune to existing drugs, like antibiotics, antivirals or antifungals, rendering minor injuries and common infections potentially deadly.Resistance has grown in recent years due to overuse of such drugs in humans and also in farm animals.'Insufficient'Discovered in the 1920s, antibiotics have saved tens of millions of lives by defeating bacterial diseases such as pneumonia, tuberculosis and meningitis.But over the decades, bacteria have learned to fight back, building resistance to the same drugs that once reliably vanquished them -- turning into so-called "superbugs".To counter bacteria's ability to become resistant to known drugs, a steady stream of new antibiotics is needed, but for pharmaceutical companies, developing competitive new products in this field is complicated, costly, and not seen as very profitable.Almost all new antibiotics that have been brought to market in recent decades are variations of antibiotic drugs discovered before the 1980s, the WHO pointed out.Since 2017, the UN agency has published an annual report on what antibacterials are in the pipeline, evaluating their potential for stemming the crisis.In the report published Thursday, it concluded that none of the 43 new antibiotics currently being developed sufficiently address the problem of drug resistance in the world's most dangerous bacteria.It also pointed out that a full 82 percent of recently approved antibiotics were derivatives of existing antibiotic classes with well-established drug-resistance, warning that "rapid emergence of drug-resistance to these new agents is expected."The report highlighted the urgent need to develop new antibacterial treatments, saying those currently in the pipeline were "insufficient" to tackle the challenge."While there are some innovative products in the pipeline, it is likely that only a fraction of these will ever come to market due to the high failure rates in the drug development process," the report warned.Faced with a dire lack of effective antibiotics, this year's report for the first time also listed an overview of "non-traditional antibacterial medicines" that could help fill the gap.It highlighted 27 such drugs in the pipeline, including monoclonal antibodies like the treatments being used for Covid-19.Other non-traditional drugs being looked at as weapons in the fight against superbugs are antimicrobial peptides, antibacterial enhancers and bacteriophages -- tiny viruses that infect bacteria, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-asks-researchers-to-use-covid-19-lessons-to-battle-deadly-superbugs-101618486538143.html

Here’s why||Brazil has been one of the worst-hit nations by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic but the unusual high deaths among babies have caused immense concerns. Despite overwhelming evidence based on data that Covid-19 rarely turns fatal for children, around 1,300 babies have died from coronavirus, according to a BBC report.BBC did a feature on a Brazilian woman’s one-year-old son who died two months after he first displayed symptoms of Covid-19 in May last year. Jessika Ricarte took her son, Lucas, to a hospital after he developed a fever, then fatigue and slightly laboured breathing. The oxygen level was at a low 86 per cent but the doctor assured Jessika that Covid-19 was rare in children and sent her home with some antibiotics, reported BBC.Jessika, a resident of Tamboril in Ceará, northeast Brazil, said that although some of the symptoms disappeared at the end of his 10-day antibiotics course, the tiredness remained, as per the report. On June 3, Lucas vomited repeatedly after having lunch, prompting Jessika to take him to a local hospital. He tested positive for Covid-19 and was transferred to a paediatric intensive care unit in Sobral, a municipality that was over two hours away.Lucas was diagnosed there with a condition called multisystem inflammatory syndrome (MIS). A recent study, published in The Lancet, suggests that multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) is a newly identified and serious health condition associated with Covid-19. It is a rare but severe hyperinflammatory condition in children and adolescents that typically occurs 2–6 weeks after they are infected with the coronavirus.MIS-C is an extreme immune response to the virus and can affect multiple organ systems, including cardiac, gastrointestinal, haematological, dermatological, neurological, respiratory, and renal systems. For the study, the researchers analysed 1,080 patients who met the MIS-C case definition and had sufficient clinical data for analysis of pre-existing factors.Out of 1,080 patients, 431 were admitted to ICU on the same day as hospitalisation and 217 were admitted to ICU at least after a day of hospitalisation. The clinical signs and symptoms of MIS-C include cough, shortness of breath, vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and abdominal pain, among others. Around 28 per cent of patients had decreased cardiac function, 36 per cent suffered shock, and around 2 per cent cases resulted in deaths.Lucas was intubated after being diagnosed with MIS-C and suffered cardiac arrest while he was in the ICU, reported BBC. The doctor who was treating the kid said she was surprised at the seriousness of his condition since he did not have any risk factors in terms of comorbidities or overweight. A CT scan discovered that Lucas had had a stroke and later died after a sudden drop in heart rate and oxygen level, as per the report.According to experts quoted by BBC, Brazil’s sheer number of Covid-19 cases have led to an increase in infection among babies and young children. While Brazil’s official data suggest that Covid-19 killed at least 852 children up to the age of nine, Dr Fatima Marinho, a leading epidemiologist from the University of São Paolo, did research that estimated the virus killed 2,060 children under nine years old, including 1,302 babies. Marinho told BBC that she is seeing more cases of MIS-C than ever before, highlighting that there is a misconception that children are at a zero risk for Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/unusually-high-covid-deaths-among-babies-young-children-in-brazil-here-s-why-101618484497625.html

15-04-2021||World||Japan's radioactive Fukushima mascot Tritium prompts backlash and apology||Amid criticism at home and abroad over plans to release treated water from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear power plant into the ocean, Japan’s officials turned to a familiar playbook: use a cute character to explain the safety of the move.Within just a day, the big-nosed, tadpole-like character called Tritium -- which looks a bit like a Pokemon and is named after the radioactive element that the government plans to dilute and release into the ocean -- was scrapped and an apology issued.As part of promotional material released after Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced Japan would begin releasing more than a million cubic meters of water into the ocean in two years, the character was intended to explain to locals that the water isn’t hazardous. But after a wave of criticism on social media and in parliament, the Reconstruction Agency said it would temporarily retire and redesign the character on Wednesday.The episode highlights the struggles Tokyo faces in convincing not just its neighbors but also the public that it can safely release the tritium-tainted water into the ocean. Some 57% of Fukushima prefecture residents oppose the release, according to a poll from February.The move has also been loudly criticized by China, South Korea and Taiwan. “Since some politicians in Japan are so desperate to prove that nuclear-waste water is safe, then they can as well use it to drink, cook, wash clothes and for irrigation,” said Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian at a regular briefing Thursday in Beijing.The materials were created by advertising giant Dentsu Inc., an official told parliament on Wednesday, as part of a nearly $3 million budget for educating the public about radiation.These kinds of comic characters, known as “yuru-chara,” are used all across Japan as mascots for everything from regional sports teams to the police force. Tepco, the utility at the center of the Fukushima disaster, starting using a chubby bunny as its mascot in 2018 to help rehabilitate its image.Tritium is a form of hydrogen that has two extra neutrons, making it weakly radioactive.

15-04-2021||World||China's tech giants facing antitrust probe pledge to end unfair competition||More than 20 Chinese tech giants have made a public pact to abide by anti-monopoly guidelines, after regulators told them to note "the warning" of a record fine against e-commerce giant Alibaba.Beijing is taking China's tech firms to task to curtail the reach of private companies into the daily finances of the Chinese public -- and, analysts say, to rein in their runaway expansion.In a series of individual statements published by China's market regulator on Wednesday and Thursday, some of the country's biggest brands -- including ByteDance, Baidu and CTrip -- promised to "ensure fair competition", "not abuse market dominance", and "not implement unfair price behaviour".The oaths come after regulators summoned 34 tech companies on Tuesday and warned them to "rectify" any anti-competitive measures and "heed the warning of Alibaba's case".The firms were given one month to undergo complete rectification after conducting internal checks, and to correct practices that harmed competition.Ride-hailing service Didi, video platforms Kuaishou and Bilibili, as well as e-commerce firm JD.com are also among those who have since published commitments.JD.com said it would not force the practice of "choosing one of two" on its retailers -- where merchants are compelled to work only with one platform and not its rivals -- a move which Alibaba had come under fire for.Meanwhile, in its statement, Didi pledged: "Except where necessary for regular business activities, we will not illegally collect or misuse personal information."The next front in Beijing's assault on big tech could be the huge volumes of data they scoop up from China's consumers.On Saturday, regulators hit Alibaba with a $2.78 billion penalty, after a months-long investigation found it had been abusing its dominant market position.Alibaba and JD.com, along with messaging and gaming giant Tencent, have become hugely profitable on the back of growing Chinese digital lifestyles and government restrictions on major US competitors in the domestic market.But as the platforms amassed hundreds of millions of regular users, concern has risen over their influence in China, where they are used for a huge array of daily tasks.bys/apj/reb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-tech-giants-facing-antitrust-probe-pledge-to-end-unfair-competition-101618478258186.html
15-04-2021||World||French embassy asks it citizens to leave Pakistan||The French embassy in Pakistan on Thursday advised all French nationals and companies to temporarily leave the country, after violent anti-France protests paralysed large parts of the country this week."Due to the serious threats to French interests in Pakistan, French nationals and French companies are advised to temporarily leave the country," the embassy said in an email to French citizens."The departures will be carried out by existing commercial airlines."Anti-French sentiment has been simmering for months in Pakistan since the government of President Emmanuel Macron expressed support for a magazine's right to republish cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed -- deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.On Wednesday, the Pakistani government moved to ban an extremist political party whose leader had called for the expulsion of the French ambassador.Saad Rizvi, leader of Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP), was detained hours after making his demands, bringing thousands of his supporters to the streets in cities across Pakistan.Two police officers died in the clashes, which saw water cannon, tear gas and rubber bullets used to hold back crowds.The TLP are notorious for holding days-long, violent road protests over blasphemy issues, causing major disruption to the country.But successive governments have a long history of avoiding confrontation with hardline Islamist groups, fearing any crackdown on religious parties could spark wider violence in the deeply conservative Islamic republic."We are in favour of protecting the Prophet's honour, but the demand which they are seeking could have portrayed Pakistan as a radical nation worldwide," Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed told a news conference on Wednesday.Macron's comments in September triggered anger across the Muslim world, with tens of thousands in Pakistan, neighboring Iran and other Muslim countries flooding the streets and organizing anti-French boycotts.TLP supporters brought the capital Islamabad to a standstill at the time.Blasphemy is a hugely sensitive issue in conservative Pakistan, where laws allow for the death penalty to be used on anyone deemed to have insulted Islam or Islamic figures.On Twitter, the hashtag "#FrenchLeavePakistan" was trending with 42,000 tweets as of Thursday afternoon.Weeks after satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo republished the cartoons, its former offices in Paris were attacked by a Pakistani man who stabbed two people.At the time, Prime Minister Imran Khan accused the French president of attacking the Muslim faith and urged Islamic countries to work together to counter what he called growing repression in Europe.In an address to the United Nations, Khan, a populist leader who has been known to play to Pakistan's hardline religious base, blasted Charlie Hebdo for re-publishing the cartoons, saying "wilful provocations" should be "universally outlawed".cyb/ecl/ds/oho||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-embassy-asks-it-citizens-to-leave-pakistan-101618478055030.html
15-04-2021||World||Explained: What are the Iran nuclear talks all about?||Negotiations to bring the United States back into a landmark nuclear deal with Iran are set to resume Thursday in Vienna amid signs of progress — but also under the shadow of an attack this week on Iran's main nuclear facility.What is the deal they're talking about?In 2015, Iran signed an agreement with the US, Russia, China, Germany, France and Britain that was intended to set limits on Tehran's nuclear program in order to block it from building a nuclear weapon — something it insists it doesn't want to do.In exchange, Iran received relief from sanctions that those powers had imposed, including on its exports of oil and access to the global banking system. Iran was allowed to continue to pursue its nuclear program for civilian purposes, with strict limits on how much uranium it could enrich, the purity it could enrich it to and other measures.Before the deal, conservative estimates were that Iran was within five to six months of being able to produce a bomb, while some feared it was within two to three months. With the deal safeguards in place, that “breakout time” was estimated to be more than a year.But in 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled the US unilaterally out of the deal, criticizing clauses that ease restrictions on Iran in stages — and also the fact that eventually the deal would expire and Iran would be allowed to do whatever it wanted with its nuclear technology. He also said it needed to be renegotiated to address Iran’s ballistic missile program and regional influence such as backing militant groups.The crippling American sanctions that followed took their toll on Iran’s economy — but failed to bring Tehran back to the table to broaden the deal as Trump wanted. Instead, Tehran steadily exceeded the limitations set by the deal to pressure the remaining members for economic relief.In February, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said of Iran's estimated breakout time that “we’re down to three or four months and heading in the wrong direction.”___So what's being discussed now?US President Joe Biden has said that he wants to rejoin the deal, but that Iran must reverse its violations.The European Union called the talks in the hopes of doing just that. Though an American delegation is present in Vienna, they are not meeting directly with Iran. Instead, diplomats from the other countries shuttle back and forth between the two sides.Heading into the talks as they started last week, Iran said it was willing to return to full compliance with the deal, but that the U.S. would first have to drop all of the sanctions imposed under Trump.That is complicated, however. The Trump administration also added sanctions on Iran outside those related to its nuclear program, including over allegations of terrorism, human rights violations and for the country's ballistic missile program.Still, there are signs of hope. The talks quickly moved past that “who goes first” debate and have already started addressing specifics, said Aniseh Bassiri Tabrizi, an Iran scholar at Britain’s Royal United Services Institute.“It’s a very good development that there are these working groups actually talking and looking at the nitty gritty,” she told The Associated Press.For Iran to return to the deal, it must revert to enriching uranium to no more than 3.67% purity, stop using advanced centrifuges and drastically reduce how much uranium it enriches, among other things.Despite the challenges, Tabrizi said the task ahead is not as complicated as the one that faced the group in 2015 since they already have a deal to refer to.___How long will the talks take?There is no specified timeframe. Diplomats involved say the issues cannot be solved overnight, but are hoping for a resolution in weeks rather than months — for several reasons.The original deal was agreed after Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, widely seen as a moderate, first took office. Rouhani can't run again in upcoming June elections due to term limits, and he hopes to be able to leave office with Iran again able to sell oil abroad and access international financial markets.Meanwhile, the U.S. could face a much tougher negotiation if it doesn't get a deal before Rouhani leaves. Hard-liners in Iran reject the nuclear deal, saying it hasn’t delivered enough economic relief and is a slippery slope to more pressure on Iran. That doesn’t necessarily mean they would end talks if elected, though it would complicate things, said Sanam Vakil, deputy director of the Chatham House policy institute’s Middle East and North Africa program.There is another reason to move quickly: Iran in February began restricting International Atomic Energy Agency inspections of its nuclear facilities. Instead, it said that it would preserve surveillance footage of the facilities for three months and hand them over to the IAEA if it is granted sanctions relief. Otherwise, Iran said it would erase the recordings.___What obstacles could get in the way?Lots, as recent events have shown. Over the weekend, Iran's Natanz nuclear facility was sabotaged. It's not clear what exactly happened, but a blackout damaged centrifuges there.The attack was widely suspected of being carried out by Israel, which opposes the nuclear deal, though authorities there have not commented.Iran says Israel explicitly hopes to derail the talks with the sabotage. Rouhani said he still hoped the talks would yield a result — but the attack has complicated matters. For one, Iran responded by announcing it would increase uranium enrichment to 60% purity — far higher than ever before — and install more advanced centrifuges at the Natanz facility.And in the wake of the developments, both sides have ramped up the rhetoric.On Wednesday, Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has final say on all matters of state in the Islamic Republic, dismissed all offers seen so far in Vienna as “not worth looking at." Still, he said he had confidence in his negotiators.Blinken, meanwhile, said Washington had shown its seriousness by participating in the indirect talks in Vienna, but with Tehran's recent announcements, “it remains to be seen whether Iran shares that seriousness of purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-are-the-iran-nuclear-talks-all-about-101618477309909.html

It said no one was hurt in the attack.A group that Western and some Iraqi officials say is aligned with Iran praised the attack, but did not explicitly claim it.A barrage of rockets hit the same US-led military base in the Erbil International Airport vicinity in February, killing a non-American contractor working with the US military.Shortly before Wednesday's attack in Erbil, at least two rockets landed on and near a base to the west of the city that hosts Turkish forces, Iraqi security officials said. That attack killed a Turkish soldier, Ankara said.A rocket hit a base belonging to an Iraqi Shi'ite Muslim militia group near that Turkish base a few hours later, a security official said, wounding at least one fighter. It was not immediately clear who had fired the rocket.Turkey also has troops in Iraq both as part of a NATO contingent and a force that has attacked Kurdish separatist militants in the north.The Iran-backed militias oppose both the presence of the United States and Turkey and demand a full withdrawal of all foreign troops.The United States has sometimes responded with air strikes against Iran-aligned militias including on the Iraqi-Syrian border.An air strike ordered by former president Donald Trump that killed Iran's top commander Qassem Soleimani in January 2020 sent the region to the brink of a full-scale conflict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosivesladen-drone-targets-us-forces-at-iraq-s-erbil-airport-101618477005894.html

Bookings for the expanded group will start on April 23, Nip said, and 16 and 17-year-olds will need parental consent forms to be vaccinated.BioNTech vaccinations will only last until the end of September due to supply, Nip said, and appointments for the first dose must be made by August. He urged citizens to get inoculated as soon as possible.No third vaccine is expected in the city this year, said Food and Health Secretary Sophia Chan.The expansion means that Hong Kong’s entire adult population will now be eligible to receive vaccines, making it one of the first places globally to offer eligibility to its full adult population.“We have the capacity to expand the coverage of the vaccination scheme,” Nip said. “It’s the appropriate time to introduce this arrangement.”Widening RolloutWhile the Asian financial hub has largely managed to contain the virus, its rollout has been hampered by public distrust in both the Beijing-backed government and questions about the safety and efficacy of Chinese-made vaccines, slowing efforts to reach the herd immunity crucial for a full economic reopening.About 951,000 total vaccine doses had been administered to the Hong Kong public as of Wednesday, according to Bloomberg’s Covid-19 Vaccine Tracker -- with at least one dose given to just 8.4% of the population, compared to 19.8% in neighboring finance capital Singapore.More Than 832 Million Shots Given: Covid-19 Vaccine TrackerThe expansion comes days after the city outlined “vaccine bubbles” that would impose fewer social curbs on vaccinated people. Chief Executive Carrie Lam has also said the government was planning to only allow those who’ve had Covid-19 shots to fly from the city to Singapore once both governments finalize a travel bubble.Hong Kong has been expanding vaccine access rapidly since its rollout started in late February, as few among priority groups came forward in earlier stages of the campaign. Healthy adults aged 30 and up, domestic helpers and students aged 16 and above who study at overseas institutions were made eligible in March.The city is currently administering vaccines made by Sinovac and Mainz, Germany-based BioNTech, after the latter was temporarily halted last month following packaging defects found in some vials. The BioNTech program was resumed after authorities concluded that the defects didn’t pose a safety risk.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-widens-covid-19-vaccine-access-to-residents-ages-16-and-up-101618476546578.html
15-04-2021||World||US to announce sanctions against Russia over poll interference, hacking: Report||The United States will announce sanctions against Russia on Thursday in retaliation for alleged election interference and hacking, American media reported.Tensions have escalated between the two countries in recent months over a raft of issues, most recently over Russia amassing troops on its border with Ukraine.The sanctions will affect more than 30 Russian entities and will include expelling more than 10 Russians from the United States, including diplomats, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing sources.The diplomats will be targeted as punishment over allegations, denied by Russia, that it offered to pay militants in Afghanistan to kill American military personnel, the newspaper said.The executive order will also expand an existing ban on US banks trading in Russian government debt.Washington is also set to formally accuse Russian intelligence of carrying out the SolarWinds hack that targeted more than 100 US companies and 18,000 government and private computer networks.The president of Microsoft, one of the companies targeted, has said the sophistication and scale of the SolarWinds attack was on a level not previously seen.Russia has denied carrying out the attack.Together with Britain, Australia, Canada and the European Union, the United States will also sanction eight individuals and entities over the occupation of Crimea, the Journal reported.The sanctions come at a difficult time for US-Russia relations.US President Joe Biden and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin held a phone call Tuesday in which they agreed to "continue dialogue", after Biden last month described Putin as a "killer" who would "pay a price" for election meddling.US intelligence has previously said Putin and other senior officials "were aware of and probably directed" Russia's influence operation to sway the vote in the 2020 election in favor of Donald Trump.More recently a Russian troop build-up on the border with Ukraine -- where Kiev's forces have been battling pro-Russian separatists since 2014 -- has sparked widespread alarm and warnings from NATO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-announce-sanctions-against-russia-over-poll-interference-hacking-report-101618476326811.html
15-04-2021||World||'Running out of sperm': Sweden looks for donors as pandemic keep them away from clinics||Sweden is facing an acute shortage of sperm for assisted pregnancy as would-be donors avoid hospitals during the coronavirus pandemic, halting inseminations in large parts of the healthcare system and driving up waiting times by years."We're running out of sperm. We've never had so few donors as during the last year," said Ann Thurin Kjellberg, head of the reproduction unit at Gothenburg's University Hospital.The shortage has meant waiting times for assisted pregnancy have shot up from around six months to an estimated 30 months in the past year, possibly longer, doctors familiar with the matter told Reuters."It's stressful that we can't get a clear time or date for treatment," said Elin Bergsten, a 28-year-old maths teacher from southern Sweden.Two years ago, Bergsten and her husband learned he was unable to produce semen, and the pair immediately applied for assisted pregnancy. She was due to have her second cycle of insemination before her treatment was indefinitely delayed due to the shortage."It's a national phenomenon," Thurin Kjellberg said. "We've run out in Gothenburg and Malmo, they will soon run out in Stockholm," she added, naming the three most populous areas of the country.Beyond public healthcare providers, there are also private clinics in Sweden which are able to circumvent shortages by buying sperm from abroad.But assisted pregnancy treatment there often costs as much as 100,000 Swedish crowns ($11,785), making it unaffordable for many. Assisted pregnancy is free within Sweden's national health service.The Nordic countries and Belgium have the highest assisted conception rates in the world, in terms of availability of cycles per million of population, according to the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology.Under Swedish law, a sperm sample can only be used by a maximum of 6 women. Most donated sperm in Sweden has reached this legal capacity, meaning that in many areas, assisted pregnancy is only available for women who have used a specific sperm sample before.Margareta Kitlinski, who runs the reproduction unit at Skane University Hospital, the largest such clinic in Sweden, said it takes around 8 months to process a donor due to the many tests involved, and that many samples fail to become viable donations due to common problems in freezing."If you have 50 men contact you, at best only half of them could be donors," Kitlinski said.Some Swedish regions have taken to social media to encourage potential male donors, but with varying results. In the meantime, the shortage lingers."We need to go on TV and tell Swedish men to come forward," Thurin Kjellberg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/running-out-of-sperm-sweden-look-for-donors-as-pandemic-keep-them-away-101618475443835.html
15-04-2021||World||China increasingly a near-peer competitor, posing multiple challenges: Top US intel officer||China is increasingly becoming a near-peer competitor of the US, posing challenges in multiple domains, while pushing to revise global norms in ways that favour the authoritarian Chinese system, a top American intelligence officer has told lawmakers.Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines on Wednesday briefed members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on the worldwide threat assessment of the US."China increasingly is a near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple areas while pushing to revise global norms in ways that favour the authoritarian Chinese system," Haines said.China, she said, is employing a comprehensive approach to demonstrate its growing strength and compel regional neighbours to acquiesce to Beijing's preferences, including its claims over disputed territory and assertions of sovereignty over Taiwan.“It also has substantial cyber capabilities that, if deployed at a minimum, can cause localised temporary disruptions to critical infrastructure inside the United States,” Haines said.Russia, Iran and North Korea are the other three countries that pose threats to the United States, she said.At the same time regional conflicts continue to fuel humanitarian crises, undermine stability and threaten US persons and interests.“The fighting in Afghanistan, Iraq and Syria has a direct implication for U.S. forces, while tensions between nuclear-armed India and Pakistan remain a concern for the world. The iterate of violence between Israel and Iran, the activity of foreign powers in Libya and conflicts in other areas, including Africa and the Middle East, have the potential to escalate or spread,” Haines said.“Asia has periodic upheavals, such as the Burmese military seizure of power in February. Latin America has contested elections. Violent popular protests are likely to continue to produce volatility. And Africa will continue to see ongoing marginalisation of some communities, ethnic conflict, and contentious elections,” she said.Senator Mark Warner, Chairman of the Senate Committee, described the rise of China as a major challenge for the United States.“As we grapple with the challenges posed by a rising China, our problem is with the Chinese Communist Party, not with the Chinese people or the Chinese diaspora globally. And certainly not with Asian Americans here in the United States," he said.As China grows in power and stature, the CCP has sought to undercut the United States as the world's leading technological power, he said.“We see this in the reliance on both strategic investments and traditional espionage to acquire intellectual property, their use and export of surveillance technology to authoritarian regimes, and their modernization of traditional and asymmetric military capabilities, including in the space and cyber domains,” Warner said.“When we look at development, for example, of 5G technology, we've seen the CCP act aggressively to influence international standard-setting bodies and invest in a national champion, Huawei, that threatens to dominate the worldwide telecommunications market,” Warner said.“I fear that the CCP will develop a similar strategy to dominate the development of other emerging technologies, including AI, quantum computing, and BAU technology. In many ways, the IC is the only part of our overall enterprise that sees across all domains in this field, and I think we must be clear-eyed in assessing the threats posed by the CCP,” he added.Senator Marco Rubio said that the United States made a mistake to not focus on both China's capabilities and on its growing and intensifying efforts to involve and engage itself in the political environment in the United States."Different aims, perhaps, different tactics in some ways. But certainly, they have every capability that the Russians do, and more, in many cases. And they are certainly interested in molding public discourse and creating political pressure among creating pressure on political figures who they don't like here in the United States," he said.FBI Director Christopher Wray told Senators that the investigating agency now has over 2,000 investigations that tie back to the Chinese government."And on the economic espionage investigation side alone, it's about a 1,300 percent increase over the last several years. We're opening a new investigation into China every 10 hours. And I can assure the committee, that's not because our folks don't have anything to do with their time,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-increasingly-a-near-peer-competitor-top-us-intelligence-officer-101618475588940.html
15-04-2021||World||Ex-world leaders, Nobel laureates ask Joe Biden to waive Covid-19 vaccine patents||More than 170 former world leaders and Nobel laureates are calling on United States President Joe Biden to make Covid-19 vaccines more readily available by waiving US intellectual property rules.In an open letter shared by Oxfam on Wednesday, the signatories also urged Biden to support a proposal spearheaded by South Africa and India demanding the World Trade Organization (WTO) temporarily waive Covid-19 vaccine patents.The signatories include former UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, ex-French President Francois Hollande and Muhammad Yunus, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize among many more.According to Al Jazeera, the measure would allow vaccine manufacturing to ramp up globally, the letter reads, as public health experts have raised concerns that low-income countries are left behind without access to critical coronavirus jabs."The world saw unprecedented development of safe and effective vaccines, in major part thanks to US public investment. We all welcome that vaccination rollout in the US and many wealthier countries is bringing hope to their citizens. Yet for the majority of the world that same hope is yet to be seen. New waves of suffering are now rising across the globe. Our global economy cannot rebuild if it remains vulnerable to this virus," the readers wrote in a letter, seen by ANI.The leaders also expressed encouragement on the fact that the Biden administration is considering a temporary waiver of World Trade Organization (WTO) intellectual property rules during the Covid-19 pandemic, as proposed by South Africa and India, and supported by more than 100 WTO member states and numerous health experts worldwide."A WTO waiver is a vital and necessary step to bringing an end to this pandemic. It must be combined with ensuring vaccine know-how and technology is shared openly. This can be achieved through the World Health Organization Covid-19 Technology Access Pool, as your Chief Medical Advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci, has called for. This will save lives and advance us towards global herd immunity," they wrote.The leaders stated that supporting the emergency waiver of Covid-19 related intellectual property rules will give people around the globe a chance to wake up to a world free from the virus.Al Jazeera further reported that Biden, who made tackling the pandemic a central goal of his presidency, has said the US would share any surplus of vaccines with other countries once all US citizens are vaccinated. But he has provided few details about how the US intends to eventually allocate those doses."We will not end today's global pandemic until rich countries - most especially the US - stop blocking the ability of countries around the world to mass produce safe and effective vaccines," Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, a Nobel laureate in medicine, said in an Oxfam statement accompanying Wednesday's open letter."That the Biden administration is considering waiving barriers related to intellectual property rules offers hope for the international community. If the United States supports the lifting of patents, Europe will have to take its responsibilities," Hollande, the former French president, also said as quoted by Al Jazeera.Leaders of the US, India, Japan and Australia - the so-called "Quad" countries - last month also announced plans to work with the World Health Organization to develop and distribute Covid-19 vaccines to one billion people in the Indo-Pacific region.In February, hundreds of civil society groups in the US, along with several progressive lawmakers, are keeping up the pressure on the Biden administration to support India's TRIPS waiver on Covid-19 vaccines.India along with South Africa is at the forefront in a proposal introduced in October 2020, before the World Trade Organization (WTO) in the TRIPS council, for a waiver during Covid-19 to allow more countries to get equitable access to medicines.Members of the European Parliament have backed a joint proposal by India and South Africa for waiver on intellectual property rights for Covid-19 vaccine patents.In a letter addressed to the European Union leadership dated February, 14 members of the European Parliament (MEPs) have called for a moratorium on the suspension of Covid-19 vaccine patents.The World Health Organization declared the Covid-19 outbreak a pandemic on March 11, 2020. To date, more than 138.05 million people have been infected with the coronavirus worldwide, with over 2.91 million fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exworld-leaders-nobel-laureates-ask-biden-to-waive-covid-19-vaccine-patents-101618473976923.html
15-04-2021||World||US Capitol Police watchdog to testify on Jan 6 failures for the first time||The top watchdog for the US Capitol Police will testify for the first time on Thursday about the department's broad failures before and during the Jan 6 insurrection, including missed intelligence predicting a “war” and weapons that were so old that officers didn't feel comfortable using them.Capitol Police Inspector General Michael A. Bolton has investigated the force's missteps since the siege, when hundreds of President Donald Trump's supporters broke into the building and sent lawmakers fleeing for their lives. In a report obtained by The Associated Press, he paints a dire picture of his agency's ability to respond to future threats and casts serious doubt on whether the force would be able to respond to another large-scale attack.The Capitol Police have so far refused to publicly release the report — prepared in March and marked as “law enforcement sensitive” — despite congressional pressure. Democratic Re. Zoe Lofgren of California, who heads the House Administration Committee, said last month that she found the report, along with another the department had circulated internally, “detailed and disturbing.” Lofgren's committee is holding Thursday's hearing.Bolton found that the department's deficiencies were — and remain — widespread: Equipment was old and stored badly; officers didn't complete required training; and there was a lack of direction at the Civil Disturbance Unit, which exists to ensure that legislative functions of Congress are not disrupted by civil unrest or protest activity.That was exactly what happened on Jan 6 when Trump supporters violently pushed past police and broke into the Capitol as Congress counted the Electoral College votes that certified Joe Biden's victory.The report also focuses on several pieces of missed intelligence, including an FBI memo sent the day before the insurrection that then-Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund told lawmakers he never saw. The memo warned of threatening online postings by Trump backers, including one comment that Congress “needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in” and blood being spilled.“Get violent ... Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest," read one post recounted in the memo. "Go there ready for war. We get our President or we die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal.”A separate report prepared by the Department of Homeland Security in December alerted the police to messages on a blog where people appeared to be planning for Jan. 6. One online post included a map of tunnels under the Capitol used by lawmakers and staff. “Take note,” the message said.The Capitol Police said in a statement Wednesday that officials had already made some of the improvements recommended in the report, and that the siege was “a pivotal moment” in history that showed the need for “major changes” in how the department operates. Still, they said that they would need more money and staff to make improvements.“It is important to note that nearly all of the recommendations require significant resources the department does not have,” the statement said.

15-04-2021||World||Biden’s exit plan cements India’s place at Afghan table||US President Joe Biden appears to be going much further than his predecessors to involve India in Afghanistan.The exit plan that President Biden unveiled on Wednesday to “end America’s longest war” and bring all US-led coalition forces back home completely and unconditionally by September 11 includes a larger role for India along with other regional players in shaping the war-ravaged country’s future.“We’ll ask other countries - other countries in the region - to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India, and Turkey,” Biden said. “They all have a significant stake in the stable future for Afghanistan.”In March, Secretary of State Antony Blinken had in a letter to Afghan President Ashraf Ghani proposed a UN-convened conference of foreign ministers of India, Russia, Pakistan, China, and the United States to find a “unified approach” to support the Afghan peace process. Turkey is hosting, as also proposed by Blinken, that meeting starting April 24.People familiar with India-US ties, especially in the area of Afghanistan, said Biden has indeed been pulling India closer on Afghanistan but wanted to watch the process longer to see it was indeed a sustained move. Thus far, at least, he appears to have been more enthusiastic about Indian involvement than his predecessors.President George W Bush, who launched the war in Afghanistan, was content to let India focus on non-security reconstruction efforts, which have continued since, worth an estimated $3 billion so far - on roads, power plants, schools, hospitals and rebooting the banking system.President Barack Obama had been in a hurry to leave but got persuaded by his general to order a massive surge at the start of his term and then spent the rest of his time cutting it down.President Donald Trump had asked India to step up and do more in the area of economic assistance and development as part of his South Asia strategy. But India was not at the table for the 2019-20 Afghan peace talks, though the US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad travelled to New Delhi often to keep them abreast with the talks.“The Biden administration is clearly looking for a greater role for India in Afghanistan’s future than previous administrations,” said Husain Haqqani, former Pakistani ambassador to the US, who is now director for South and Central Asia at the Hudson Institute.“Question is, how will they (the Biden administration) persuade Pakistan and India to accept each other’s or even America’s vision?” he added.India has wanted to play a larger role in Afghanistan, going beyond its financial and training assistance. But it has struggled to find a place at the table in the constantly changing constellation of countries jostling for primacy and relevance. The Trump administration had kept India out of the peace talks and so did Russia, by not inviting it to peace talks it hosted in March - only China, Pakistan, Iran and the United States were invited. Pakistan is mostly blamed for India’s exclusion from the process, as it leverages its shared border and history with Afghanistan to get its way. Growing Indian influence there through a long list of assistance and cooperation has made Islamabad more insecure and nervous.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-exit-plan-cements-india-s-place-at-afghan-table-101618472878954.html
15-04-2021||World||At US-Japan summit, Joe Biden, Yoshihide Suga to counter assertive China||Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga and US President Joe Biden will highlight Tokyo's central role in Washington's strategy to counter the challenge of an increasingly assertive China at a summit on Friday.While that emphasis of Japan's key status will be welcome in Tokyo, where some politicians are pushing for a tougher stance towards Beijing, it also raises questions about how far Tokyo can go to meet demands on regional defence and human rights."This will be the precursor to a series of meetings among like-minded countries to send the right signal to Beijing," Kunihiko Miyake, an adviser to Suga, told Reuters.Suga took over as premier last September, inheriting a China policy that sought to balance security concerns with deep economic ties.But striking that balance has become harder as China increases maritime activities including in the East and South China Seas and near Taiwan, which Beijing considers a wayward province.Human rights concerns have deepened over mass detentions of Muslim Uighurs in the Xinjiang region. China denies abuses, but the United States has said Beijing is perpetrating a genocide.Suga will be the first foreign leader to meet Biden in person since the president took office, something that could give Suga a boost ahead of a general election this year."Asking Suga to meet the president first means a lot - that China competition is critical and who is the best partner? Japan," said Toshihiro Nakayama, a political science professor at Keio University."That also means that Japan has to do more."The two are also expected to discuss climate change, supply chain resilience, a global semiconductor shortage and Covid-19.Japan is grappling with rising coronavirus infections with fewer than 100 days from the planned start of the Summer Olympics in the capital of Tokyo.PEACE AND STABILITYIn a statement after a March meeting of US-Japan defence and foreign ministers, the two sides "underscored the importance of peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait" and shared "serious concerns" about human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.The United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada have imposed sanctions on Chinese officials for human rights abuses in Xinjiang and some Japanese lawmakers think Tokyo should adopt its own law allowing it to do the same - although Japanese executives worry about a backlash.Japanese officials were divided over whether Suga should endorse a statement on Taiwan, despite the United States urging, or human rights in Xinjiang, two Japanese ruling party lawmakers familiar with the discussions said.A Japanese foreign ministry official said it wasn't decided whether there would be a joint statement after the summit.Asked to comment, a senior US official said: "We would not want Japan to make any statements that they do not fully support."Any comments by Suga on either Taiwan or human rights will be closely watched by China, which has warned Tokyo against "being misled" by countries biased against Beijing.Taiwan is China's most sensitive territorial issue and a source of major friction with Washington, which is required by US law to provide the island with the means to defend itself.While Tokyo has no official diplomatic relations with Taipei, non-governmental engagement has flourished. Some Japanese lawmakers want even closer ties.The last time the countries' leaders referred to Taiwan in a joint statement was in 1969, when Japan's prime minister said that the maintenance of peace and security in the "Taiwan area" was important for its own security. That was before Tokyo normalised ties with Beijing.Japan hosts more than 50,000 US military personnel and, experts say, would be unlikely to stand idly by in any Taiwan crisis, although many ordinary citizens would probably be wary of entanglement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-us-japan-summit-joe-biden-yoshihide-suga-to-counter-assertive-china-101618466745450.html
15-04-2021||World||Myanmar security forces open fire on protesting medical workers: Report||(Reuters) - Myanmar security forces opened fire on Thursday on a pro-democracy protest by medical workers in the city of Mandalay, causing some casualties, media said.Opponents of a Feb. 1 coup that ousted an elected government led by Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi have kept up their campaign against the military this traditional New Year week with a series of actions and marches.Medical workers, some of whom have been at the forefront of the campaign against the coup, gathered in the second city of Mandalay early but troops soon arrived to disperse them, opening fire and detained some people, the Mizzima news agency said.The agency said it did not have details of casualties or arrests. The BBC's Burmese-language service also reported the crackdown on the protest by medical workers.A spokesman for the junta could not be reached for comment.The coup has plunged Myanmar into crisis after 10 years of tentative steps toward democracy, with daily protests and campaigns of defiance, including strikes by workers in many sectors that have brought the economy to a standstill.The five-day New Year holiday, known as Thingyan, began on Tuesday but pro-democracy activists cancelled the usual festivities to focus on their opposition to the generals who seized power.The military says the protests are dwindling.An activist group, the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, says the security forces have killed 715 protesters since the ousting of Suu Kyi's government.The United Nations human rights office said on Tuesday it feared the military clampdown on the protests risked escalating into a civil conflict, such as that in Syria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-security-forces-open-fire-on-protesting-medical-workers-report-101618460586750.html
15-04-2021||World||India, Pakistan, China, Russia have stake in Afghanistan's stable future: joe Biden||US President Joe Biden has said India, Pakistan, Russia, China, and Turkey have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan and these regional stakeholders should do more to bring peace in this war-torn country, from where he will withdraw all American troops by September 11."We will ask other countries in the region to do more to support Afghanistan, especially Pakistan, as well as Russia, China, India, and Turkey. They all have a significant stake in the stable future of Afghanistan," Biden said in a nationally televised speech from the White House on Wednesday.In less than 100 days after taking over as the president of the US on January 20, Biden announced to begin to withdraw all American troops from Afghanistan by September 11.The US currently has a little over 2,500 troops, which is far less than the 100,000-plus during the Barack Obama administration.White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that there is no military solution to the current situation Afghanistan, rather a diplomatic solution is required.“Even as we are withdrawing our troops, we will continue to support diplomatic and humanitarian work. We will ask other countries to step up, whether that's Pakistan, Russia, China, India, Turkey -- countries in the region that certainly have a stake in stability. We will continue to provide significant humanitarian resources,” Psaki said in response to a question.“We will continue to be engaged. This is the president's assessment about whether having troops on the ground, a military presence in the same way -- in a version of the same way it has been over the last two decades -- is in our national interest. And he has made the decision it is not,” she said.Biden said the war in Afghanistan was never meant to be a multi-generational undertaking. "We were attacked. We went to war with clear goals. We achieved those objectives. (Osama) Bin Laden is dead, and al Qaeda is degraded in Iraq, in Afghanistan. And it's time to end the forever war,” he asserted.The Biden administration on Wednesday did not give details of its expectations from India on the latter's role in Afghanistan after the complete withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan.In the past, successive US administrations have praised India’s role in peace and development in Afghanistan.“India has been the largest regional contributor to Afghan reconstruction, but New Delhi has not shown an inclination to pursue a deeper defense relationship with Kabul,” said a recent report on Afghanistan by the independent Congressional Research Service.“Pakistan’s security establishment, fearful of strategic encirclement by India, apparently continues to view the Afghan Taliban as a relatively friendly and reliably anti-India element in Afghanistan. India's diplomatic and commercial presence in Afghanistan and US rhetorical support for it exacerbates Pakistani fears of encirclement,” said the CRS report.The US and the Taliban signed a landmark deal in Doha on February 29, 2020 to bring lasting peace in war-torn Afghanistan and allow US troops to return home from America's longest war.Under the US-Taliban pact signed in Doha, the US agreed to withdraw all its soldiers from Afghanistan in 14 months.Since the US-led invasion that ousted the Taliban after the September 11, 2001 attacks, America has spent more than USD 1 trillion in fighting and rebuilding in Afghanistan.About 2,400 US soldiers have been killed, along with tens of thousands of Afghan troops, Taliban insurgents and Afghan civilians.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-pakistan-china-russia-have-stake-in-afghanistan-s-stable-future-joe-biden-101618462688472.html
15-04-2021||World||As festivals continue in India, how the world suffered due to crowded gatherings||In Uttarakhand’s Haridwar, thousands of devotees gathered to take a dip in the Ganges on the thirteenth day of the Mahakumbh on Wednesday, even as India continues to battle an intense second wave of Covid-19 infections.Whether it’s a religious event or a conference or a rally, super-spreading events that can infect dozens, hundreds, even thousands, of people have illustrated the potential for the coronavirus to infect in dramatic bursts. Such events have grabbed headlines, looming large in the narrative of the unfolding pandemic.Experts say these large clusters are more than just extreme outliers, but rather the pandemic’s likely main engine of transmission. This corresponds to the 80/20 rule of epidemiology, where 80% of cases come from only 20% of those infected. Benjamin Althouse, research scientist at the University of Washington’s Institute for Disease Modeling, said that coronavirus may be even more extreme, with 90% of cases coming from potentially just 10% of carriers.Here are some of the biggest super-spreader events globally.1. Mulhouse, FranceBeginning February 18, 2020, Christian Open Door church in Mulhouse, a city of 100,000 on France’s borders with Germany and Switzerland, hosted a week-long annual celebration. Thousands flocked to the event from across the globe. At the time, France had 12 confirmed cases, according to World Health Organization (WHO) data.There were none in the Mulhouse area. The prayer meeting kicked off the biggest cluster of Covid-19 in France to date, local government said. Around 2,500 confirmed cases have been linked to it. Worshippers at the church unwittingly took the disease caused by the virus home — to the West African state of Burkina Faso, the Mediterranean island of Corsica, to Guyana in Latin America, to Switzerland, and even to a French nuclear nuclear power plant.Also Read | Number Theory: Are more people dying in India’s second wave?Antoinette, one of the attendees, on March 4, became one of the first cases of Covid-19 on the French island of Corsica. By March 20, France had more than 10,000 cases of Covid-19. Around a quarter were in Grand-Est, the region that includes Mulhouse. “The very great majority” of these could be traced to the church, said Michel Vernay, the local public health official.2. San Siro, ItalyIt was the biggest soccer game in Atalanta’s history and a third of Bergamo’s population made the short trip to Milan’s famed San Siro Stadium. Nearly 2,500 fans of visiting Spanish club Valencia also traveled to that Champions League match. In total, 44,236 people were present at the stadium.More than a month later, experts began pointing to the February 19 game as one of the biggest reasons why Bergamo has become one of the epicentres of the coronavirus pandemic — a “biological bomb” was the way one respiratory specialist put it — and why 35% of Valencia’s team became infected.The match, which local media have dubbed “Game Zero”, was held two days before the first case of locally transmitted Covid-19 was confirmed in Italy. Nearly 7,000 people in the province of Bergamo had tested positive for Covid-19 and more than 1,000 people had died from the virus — making Bergamo the most deadly province in all of Italy for the pandemic. The Valencia region reported more than 2,600 people infected.3. Kuala Lampur, MalaysiaAn Islamic missionary movement Tablighi Jama’at gathering held between February 27-March 1 last year at a sprawling mosque complex on the outskirts of Malaysia’s capital Kuala Lumpur emerged as a source of hundreds of new coronavirus infections spanning Southeast Asia.It was attended by 16,000 people, including 1,500 foreigners. Out of Malaysia’s 673 confirmed coronavirus cases, nearly two-thirds are linked to the four-day meeting, Malaysia’s minister of health Adham Baba said. It is not clear who brought the virus there in the first place.The packed gathering, where guests had to take shuttle buses to sleep at other venues, was attended by nationals from dozens of countries, including Canada, Nigeria, China, South Korea, India and Australia, according to an attendee list posted on social media. Brunei has confirmed at least 50 cases linked to the mosque gathering. Singapore announced five linked to the event, Cambodia 13 and Thailand at least two.4. Daegu, South KoreaOther religious gatherings have been linked to the spread of the virus: A large church in South Korea triggered the largest cluster of cases outside of Wuhan, China, where the virus was first discovered in February last year.In early February, South Korea’s coronavirus outbreak appeared to be contained as the number of confirmed infections stabilised at 30. Then, on February 17, a 31st case surfaced at a health clinic in Daegu, a city about 150 miles south of the capital where the vast majority of known infections were located. An unidentified 61-year-old woman, who lived there and occasionally commuted to Seoul, tested positive for the virus.It seemed like a standard case until public health authorities started tracing the patient’s tracks. What they learned shocked them — the woman had, during the previous 10 days, attended two worship services with at least 1,000 other members of her secretive religious sect.Within 24 hours, the nation’s number of confirmed cases started multiplying exponentially. The tally rose by 20 during that period, doubled the following day and then doubled again on the third day.By February 26, the count skyrocketed past 1,000 — a more than 30-fold increase in a week that prompted the government to raise its health alert to the highest level. At least half of the new cases are linked to the sect called the Shincheonji — which translates to “new heaven and land” and whose members worship side-by-side in cramped spaces. More than 5,000 cases have now been attributed this religious ceremony.5. Washington DC, USAs the world looked on shocked by the events of January 6, when hundreds of unmasked supporters of former US president Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building in order to stop the certification of Joe Biden as the winner of the 2020 elections, a super-spreader event may have been in the making.In the days after the deadly riot, the former director of the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr Robert Redfield called it a “surge event”.“These (unmasked) individuals all are going in cars and trains and planes going home all across the country right now. So, I do think this is an event that will probably lead to a significant spreading event,” Redfield told McClatchy in an interview.In a working paper, yet to be peer-reviewed, economists at San Diego State and Bentley universities suggest that the riot “may have led to non-localized community-level Covid-19 spread”, meaning that the protesters, who came from all over the country, returned to their homes states after the even, resulting in the spread in their own communities instead of in their direct vicinity as usually the case in such super spreader events.Having said that, 150 National Guard troops, 38 US Capitol Police officers and at least four members of Congress tested positive after the siege in Washington DC.“All the cases to likely derive from this event will likely be lost in the huge number of cases we have in the country right now,” Eric Toner, senior scholar at the John Hopkins Center for Health Security, had told the Washington Post in its aftermath.This was not the only event linked to Trump, and his coronavirus denial and mismanagement. Stanford University economists estimate that Trump’s campaign rallies ahead of the November 3 elections resulted in 30,000 additional confirmed cases of Covid-19, and likely led to more than 700 deaths overall.The research, led by B. Douglas Bernheim, chair of economics at Stanford University, analysed data following 18 Trump rallies held between June 20 and September 22, three of which were indoors. Bernheim said in an email the work relies on statistical methods to infer causation after an event has occurred.6. Boston, USAn international conference hosted by the Biogen, an American biotechnology company, in Boston’s Marriott Long Wharf hotel resulted in over 300,000 cases, according to a study published in the journal Science.At least 99 Covid-19 cases were reported from the event that occurred between February 26 and 27 of last year in March. Sequencing the genomes of the virus obtained in March revealed two mutations that had not been reported before in the US prior to the conference.The first variant of the virus infected around 245,000 people the US, while the second infected 88,000 cases. The conference was responsible for around 20,000 cases in the Boston area alone. A “highly similar viruses within a narrow time window,” indicating a super-spreader event, the researchers wrote in the Science article.7. Sturgis, US In early September, several US Midwestern states experienced rising numbers of Covid-19 cases, many seemingly linked to an annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis, South Dakota.The rally, held from August 7 to 16, drew an estimated 460,000 motorcycle enthusiasts. Bikers crowded into bars and rock shows, mostly ignoring social distancing recommendations. Few wore masks. As a result, the rally was linked to hundreds of coronavirus cases across more than 10 US states.A study published by the IZA Institute of Labor Economics that used cell phone data to track movements claims that 266,796 cases between August 2 and September 2 can be linked to the Sturgis rally — 19% of the 1.4 million national coronavirus cases during that time period.However, this number is heavily disputed: South Dakota state epidemiologist Josh Clayton criticised the study for not accounting for the fact that cases had already been on the rise, which could partially be attributed to school reopenings. Johns Hopkins university said “data analyses used to obtain nationwide estimates were relatively weak”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-festivals-continue-in-india-how-the-world-suffered-due-to-crowded-gatherings-101618460336897.html

And the tools in their toolbox to influence our businesses, our academic institutions, our governments at all levels are deep and wide and persistent," Wray said, referring to China.The Hill reported that the Department of Justice late last year charged multiple individuals for their attempts to threaten, coerce or harass certain residents of the US to repatriate to China, following an FBI investigation.Eight individuals were charged with conspiring to act in the US as illegal agents of the People's Republic of China, with six of the defendants also facing charges for conspiring to commit interstate and international stalking.Wednesday's hearing is the first worldwide threats hearing in two years, after some Trump administration officials refused to participate in 2020, with lawmakers on Wednesday asking a number of questions about threats from China.The hearing comes as in a recent report released warning that Beijing is one of the largest threats to Washington."Beijing, Moscow, Tehran, and Pyongyang have demonstrated the capability and intent to advance their interests at the expense of the United States and its allies, despite the pandemic. China increasingly is a near-peer competitor, challenging the United States in multiple arenas--especially economically, militarily, and technologically--and is pushing to change global norms," the report said.As per the report, China's strategy is to drive wedges between the United States and its allies. Beijing has also used its success in combating the coronavirus pandemic to promote the "superiority of its system."The report also predicts more tensions in the South China Sea, as Beijing continues to intimidate rivals in the region.Under the former President Donald Trump's administration, ties between Washington and Beijing had deteriorated over issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang, encroachment on the special status of Hong Kong, accusations of unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China's military aggression around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fbi-opens-investigation-into-china-every-10-hrs-says-director-christopher-wray-101618458473834.html
15-04-2021||World||Will give lesson to foreign forces which use Hong Kong as pawn: Beijing official||Beijing's top representative in Hong Kong said on Thursday that any foreign powers that try to use the global financial centre as a pawn will face counter measures, amid escalating tensions between the city and Western governments.Luo Huining, the director at China's Hong Kong Liaison Office, was speaking at a ceremony to mark National Security Education Day, which authorities have organised to promote the sweeping legislation China imposed last year."We will give a lesson to all foreign forces which intend to use Hong Kong as a pawn," Luo said.The new law drew criticism from the West for curbing rights and freedoms in the former British colony, which was promised a high degree of autonomy upon its 1997 return to Chinese rule. Its supporters say it has restored order following mass anti-government and anti-China protests in 2019.China, the United States, Britain and the European Union have traded sanctions over the past year as the security law and measures taken to reduce democratic representation in the city's institutions exacerbated tensions.Earlier this week, a letter signed by more than 100 British politicians asked Boris Johnson's government to expand a list of Chinese officials accused of "gross human rights abuses".National Security Education Day will be marked with school activities, games and shows, and a parade by police and other services performing the Chinese military's "goose step" march.In line with Beijing's increased assertiveness, the Chinese routine, in which troops keep their legs rigidly straight when lifting them off the ground and arms swing at a 90-degree angle in front of the chest, will replace British-style foot drills at a parade of police and other forces.Elsewhere, in schools and cultural centres, Hong Kongers were invited to build national security "mosaic walls" to instil, according to a government website, the idea that people should work together to protect their homeland.Stickers and bookmarks reading "Uphold National Security, Safeguard our Home" have been delivered to schools and kindergartens.In February, Hong Kong unveiled national security education guidelines that include teaching students as young as six about colluding with foreign forces, terrorism, secession and subversion - the four main crimes in the new law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/will-give-lesson-to-foreign-forces-which-use-hong-kong-as-pawn-beijing-official-101618457391480.html
15-04-2021||World||Indian-American Meera Joshi, Radhika Fox nominated by Joe Biden for key admin posts||US President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced his intent to nominate a top attorney and an executive, both Indian-American women, to key administration positions.The nominations are being seen as a promotion for Meera Joshi and Radhika Fox who joined the administration on the very first day of the Biden presidency on January 20.Joshi has been nominated for Administrator of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration in the Department of Transportation while Fox was nominated for Assistant Administrator for Water, Environmental Protection Agency, the White House said in a statement.Joshi was appointed as the Deputy Administrator and senior official of the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration on January 20, 2021. The same day, Biden appointed Fox to the position of Principal Deputy Assistant Administrator for Water at the Environmental Protection Agency.Biden also announced his intent to nominate Faisal Amin for Chief Financial Officer of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). Amin currently serves as Deputy Director of Office of Administration in the Executive Office of the President.The three nominations were part of Biden’s announcement of his intent to nominate 12 members of his administration to lead on climate and transportation matters across key agencies, including the Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, Environmental Protection Agency, and Department of Transportation.Joshi, an attorney with over 16 years of experience leading government oversight agencies, was Chair and CEO of the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission, the nation’s largest for-hire transportation regulator where she spearheaded novel Vision Zero campaigns using data tools to keep high risk drivers and unsafe vehicles off the road.She also led landmark policy, including establishing robust open transportation data standards for app-based providers; enacting the nation’s first for-hire driver pay protection programme and providing broad access to for-hire transportation for passengers who use wheelchairs.Prior to transportation regulation, Joshi was the Inspector General for New York City’s Department of Corrections, responsible for investigation of corruption and criminality at all levels of New York City’s jail operations and the First Deputy Executive Director of New York City’s Civilian Complaint Review Board, leading investigations of police misconduct.In addition to her government positions, Joshi served as General Manager for the New York Office of Sam Schwartz Transportation Consultants, and was a visiting scholar at New York University’s Rudin Center for Transportation Policy.Joshi, who was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, holds a BA and a JD from the University of Pennsylvania.Fox currently serves as the Acting Assistant Administer for Water. The EPA’s Office of Water works to ensure that drinking water is safe, wastewater is safely returned to the environment, and surface waters are properly managed and protected.Prior to joining EPA, Fox served as Chief Executive Officer for the US Water Alliance, where she established herself as a widely recognised national thought leader on complex water issues, from equitable water management to investing in our nation’s water infrastructure.Her work has helped address the most salient water issues facing the nation, including climate change, affordability, equity, governance, innovative finance, and the evolution of the One Water movement.Fox previously directed the policy and government affairs agenda for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission, which is responsible for providing 24/7 water, wastewater, and municipal power services to 2.6 million Bay Area residents.She also served as the Federal Policy Director at PolicyLink, where she coordinated the organization’s policy agenda on a wide range of issues, including infrastructure investment, transportation, sustainable communities, economic inclusion, and workforce development.Fox holds a BA from Columbia University and a Masters in City and Regional Planning from the University of California at Berkeley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-meera-joshi-radhika-fox-nominated-by-joe-biden-for-key-admin-posts-101618455880773.html

15-04-2021||World||Standing among US graves, Joe Biden explains Afghanistan decision in personal terms||As President Joe Biden stood in the rain on Wednesday among the tombstones of US soldiers killed in Afghanistan, thoughts of his late son Beau were not far from his mind as he explained his decision to begin America's exit from its longest war.The president's elder son earned the Bronze Star while serving in Iraq from 2008-09. His death in 2015 from a brain tumor still haunts his father."I have trouble these days ever showing up at a cemetery not thinking of my son Beau, who proudly insisted on putting on that uniform and going with his unit to Iraq and giving up his spot as attorney general in the state of Delaware because he thought it was the right thing to do," Biden told reporters at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington."Look at them all," Biden said, gesturing to the rows of white gravestones stretching behind him.Beau Biden's military experience was among the reasons the president gave for deciding to withdraw all 2,500 US troops remaining in Afghanistan by Sept. 11 in a televised speech before the cemetery visit."I’m the first president in 40 years who knows what it means to have a child serving in a war zone,” Biden said, speaking from the Treaty Room at the White House, where President George W. Bush declared the beginning of the war in 2001."Throughout this process, my North Star has been remembering what it was like when my late son Beau was deployed to Iraq,” Biden said, and the impact it had on Beau and his family.Biden said that since he became vice president in 2009, he had carried a card of the exact number of US troops and personnel killed and wounded in Iraq and Afghanistan – 2,488 dead in Afghanistan and 20,722 wounded as of Wednesday."Every one of those dead are sacred human beings who left behind entire families," he said.The war in Afghanistan began as a search for al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after he masterminded the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States that turned Bush into a war president.US troop numbers in Afghanistan reached a peak of more than 100,000 in 2011. Afghan security forces are fighting an insurgency by the Islamist Taliban.A full withdrawal by Sept. 11 made sense, Biden said on Wednesday, because the original mission - getting bin Laden - had been achieved, and Afghanistan was no longer a safe haven for Islamist militants like him. Bin Laden was killed in Pakistan by American forces in 2011."We already have service members doing their duty in Afghanistan today whose parents served in the same war. We have service members who were not yet born when our nation was attacked in 9/11," Biden said in his speech, adding the war was never meant to be a multi-generational affair.Was it a hard decision? Biden was asked in Arlington.“No, it wasn’t. To me, it was absolutely clear. Absolutely clear. ... From the very beginning, you may recall, I never thought we were there to somehow unify ...

15-04-2021||World||Forensic expert blames George Floyd's death on heart trouble||George Floyd died of a sudden heart rhythm disturbance as a result of his heart disease, a forensic pathologist testified for the defense Wednesday at former Officer Derek Chauvin's murder trial, contradicting prosecution experts who said Floyd succumbed to a lack of oxygen from the way he was pinned down.Dr. David Fowler, a former Maryland chief medical examiner who is now with a consulting firm, said the fentanyl and methamphetamine in Floyd's system, and possibly carbon monoxide poisoning from auto exhaust, were contributing factors in the 46-year-old Black man's death last May.“All of those combined to cause Mr. Floyd’s death,” he said on the second day of the defense case.Fowler also testified that he would classify the manner of death “undetermined,” rather than homicide, as the county's chief medical examiner ruled. He said Floyd's death had too many conflicting factors, some of which could be ruled homicide and some that could be considered accidental.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson is trying to prove that the 19-year Minneapolis police veteran did what he was trained to do and that Floyd died because of his illegal drug use and underlying health problems.Prosecutors say Floyd died because the white officer's knee was pressed against Floyd’s neck or neck area for 9 1/2 minutes as he lay on the pavement on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind him and his face jammed against the ground.Fowler listed a multitude of factors or potential ones: Floyd’s narrowed arteries, his enlarged heart, his high blood pressure, his drug use, the stress of his restraint, the vehicle exhaust, and a tumor or growth in his lower abdomen that can sometimes play a role in high blood pressure by releasing “fight-or-flight” hormones.Fowler said all of those factors could have acted together to cause Floyd’s heart to work harder, suffer an arrhythmia, or abnormal rhythm, and suddenly stop.Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell launched an aggressive cross-examination, attacking Fowler's findings down the line. He got Fowler to acknowledge that even someone who dies from being deprived of oxygen ultimately dies of an arrhythmia.He also got Fowler to admit that he didn’t take the weight of Chauvin’s gear into account when he analyzed the pressure on Floyd’s body. Blackwell further accused Fowler of jumping to conclusions and suggesting to the jury that Floyd had a white pill in his mouth in the video of his arrest. Fowler denied saying that.Blackwell also attacked Fowler's testimony about carbon monoxide, which displaces oxygen in the bloodstream.In his original testimony, Fowler said carbon monoxide could have contributed to oxygen depletion in Floyd, noting that he was facing the tailpipe end of a squad car. But Floyd's blood was never tested for carbon monoxide.“You haven’t seen any data or test results that showed Mr. Floyd had a single injury from carbon monoxide. Is that true?” Blackwell asked.“That is correct, because it was never sent,” Fowler said.Blackwell also noted that the squad car was a gas-electric hybrid and that Fowler had no data on how much carbon monoxide was actually released. And he suggested that the witness assumed the engine was running at the time. Fowler said he believed it was.The prosecutor also got Fowler to agree that it would take four minutes to cause irreversible brain damage if the brain is starved of oxygen, and that insufficient oxygen can cause the heart to stop."And if a person dies as a result of low oxygen, that person is also going to die ultimately of a fatal arrhythmia, right?” Blackwell asked.Fowler responded: “Correct. Every one of us in this room will have a fatal arrhythmia at some point.”Fowler further agreed that Floyd should have been given immediate attention when he went into cardiac arrest because there still was a chance to save him at that point.A number of medical experts called by prosecutors have said Floyd died from a lack of oxygen because his breathing was constricted by the way he was held down. A cardiology expert rejected the notion that Floyd died of heart problems, saying all indications were that he had "an exceptionally strong heart.”But Fowler said that Chauvin’s knee on Floyd was “nowhere close to his airway” and that Floyd’s speaking and groaning showed that his airway was still open. He also testified that Chauvin’s knee was not applied with enough pressure to cause any bruises or scrapes on Floyd’s neck or back.And he said that Floyd did not complain of vision changes or other symptoms consistent with hypoxia, or insufficient oxygen to the brain, and that he was coherent until shortly before he suddenly stopped moving.“The bottom line is, moving air in and out, and speaking and making noise is very good evidence that the airway was not closed,” Fowler said.Blackwell ended his cross-examination by getting two questions before the jury: Whether Chauvin's actions played a role in Floyd's death, or whether Floyd's death was coincidental and unrelated. But the defense objected, and Fowler was not permitted to answer.Chauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s death after his arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 at a neighborhood market. The video of Floyd gasping that he couldn't breathe as bystanders yelled at Chauvin to get off him triggered worldwide protests, violence and a furious examination of racism and policing in the US. The defense hasn’t said whether Chauvin will take the stand.Earlier Wednesday, Judge Peter Cahill turned down a defense request to acquit Chauvin, rejecting claims that prosecutors failed to prove Chauvin’s actions killed Floyd. Requests for an acquittal are routinely made midway through a trial and are usually denied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forensic-expert-blames-george-floyd-s-death-on-heart-trouble-101618445736757.html
15-04-2021||World||Brazil's Supreme Court allows probe of Prez Bolsonaro's Covid-19 response||Brazil’s Supreme Court on Wednesday allowed a Senate investigation of President Jair Bolsonaro’s handling of the pandemic to go forward, one of two cases it tackled that could affect the leader’s bid for reelection next year.The full court started weighing the political future of former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a potential powerful rival to Bolsonaro. One of the judges earlier ruled he had been unjustly convicted in a corruption case, a decision that effectively reinstated his right to run for the presidency again.The court voted 10-1 Wednesday to uphold Justice Luís Roberto Barroso's order that the Senate should start an investigation of into Bolsonaro's management of the crisis because a required number of senators had sponsored such a call. The Senate president had tried to delay the probe, citing pandemic health restrictions.Critics, including those calling for or leading the investigation, say Bolsonaro has bungled Brazil's response to the pandemic by resisting health-driven restrictions on activity, failing to marshal resources for vaccines and stimulating the use of drugs that don't work against the virus.Bolsonaro and his allies say he’s being unfairly blamed for Brazil's surge in Covid-19 deaths, a toll that trails only that of the United States. Brazil’s seven-day average death toll hit a new record on Monday.The Senate probe “is an attempted political coup against the president," said Sen. Márcio Bittar, a Bolsonaro ally. in a Twitter post Wednesday.He's also cried foul as the Supreme Court has issued rulings that go against him, prompting outrage from his conservative base that claims the court is overstepping constitutional bounds.Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo, said the investigation poses the risks for Bolsonaro“The desperation with the pandemic tends to increase as deaths continue to grow. Economic issues are also far from being solved. And at the same time his administration is fighting with its base in congress over next year’s budget,” Melo said. “The surroundings of the inquiry don’t favor Bolsonaro."The top court last year knocked down Bolsonaro's attempt to overturn local restrictions meant to slow the advance of Covid-19, ruling that governors and mayors are free to determine their own Covid-19 protocols.On Tuesday, a justice also suspended parts of four Bolsonaro decrees aimed at loosening gun controls.The Brazilian leader, who has long downplayed the risks of the disease and still denounces lockdowns, has argued lawmakers should also investigate the actions of governors and mayors to whom the federal government provided funds. He and his allies scored a partial win at the Senate on Tuesday when the use of such funds was made part of the investigation.Bolsonaro on Wednesday complained that Justice Barroso's April 8 ruling that the Senate probe should go forward had created “an atmosphere of animosity.”“That justice is interfering with the Senate in order to go after me," he said.More than the required 27 senators had signed a request for the investigation, but the president of the Senate, Rodrigo Pacheco, had refrained from greenlighting the probe, citing health concerns amid the pandemic.The court on Wednesday also began assessing the decision by Justice Luiz Edson Fachin on March 8 to annul da Silva’s two corruption convictions, which were related to the massive “Car Wash” scandal focused on the state oil company. The hearing will continue Thursday after the justices agreed by 9 votes to 2 that the case should indeed be heard in a full court session.Early polling for the 2022 election shows the 75-year-old leftist, who governed Brazil between 2003 and 2010, neck-and-neck with Bolsonaro.Da Silva was leading polls in 2018 when he was knocked out of the race by a conviction involving a beachfront apartment that prosecutors alleged — and he denied — belonged to him.Bolsonaro won the election and the judge who oversaw da Silva’s conviction, Sergio Moro, became his justice minister. One of the top court’s two panels of justices already ruled Moro was biased against da Silva.The question now before the full court was whether Moro’s court even had jurisdiction to hear the case, and the justices may also evaluate the panel’s finding regarding bias.“The Supreme Court has the opportunity to make history today, maintaining the annulment of the sentences and the bias of Moro against him,” said Gleisi Hoffmann, chairwoman of da Silva's Workers’ Party, on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-supreme-court-allows-probe-of-prez-bolsonaro-s-covid-19-response-101618444905041.html
15-04-2021||World||US house resolution urges Prez Biden to refer China's Uyghur 'genocide' to UN||A bipartisan resolution was introduced in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday, condemning China's "genocide" of Uyghurs and other minorities while urging US President Joe Biden to refer the crackdown to the United Nations."The resolution calls upon President Biden to refer these atrocities to the United Nations for investigation under the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide," the US House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Gregory Meeks and another member Michael McCaul said in a joint press release.The resolution seeks multilateral sanctions against the Chinese government in the UN Security Council and other unspecified actions "to bring the genocide to an end.""China's human rights violations against the Uyghur community in Xinjiang are beyond the pale. The international community needs to stand together and condemn the horrific treatment of China's ethnic minorities, who have undergone mass detention and seen their way of life threatened," Meeks said.This comes a day after US Senators Marco Rubio and Chris Coons introduced bipartisan legislation wherein people of China's Uyghur minority community facing government repression would become eligible for prioritised US refugee status."The Uyghur Human Rights Protection Act would make it easier for Uyghurs and members of other Turkic or Muslim minority groups to apply for resettlement in the United States, and it encourages our allies and partners to implement similar policies," Coons, a Democrat, and his Republican colleague Rubio said in a release on Tuesday.The lawmakers introduced the legislation after leading a bipartisan group urging US Secretary of State Antony Blinken to take additional measures to aid Uyghur and other Muslim minorities in China's Xinjiang Province.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghurs. Beijing has been accused of sending its Muslim minority to mass detention camps to undergo forcible re-education or indoctrination.Beijing, on the other hand, has denied that it is engaged in human rights abuses against the Uyghurs in Xinjiang while reports from journalists, NGOs and former detainees have surfaced, highlighting the Chinese Communist Party's brutal crackdown on the ethnic community, according to a report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-house-resolution-urges-prez-biden-to-refer-china-s-uyghur-genocide-to-un-101618444343875.html
15-04-2021||World||It’s time to end America’s longest war: Joe Biden||US President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that the remaining US troops will leave Afghanistan by September 11, the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks that took them there in the hunt for Al Qaeda. He said American forces cannot stay on in the hope of creating the ideal withdrawal conditions and “it’s time to end America’s longest war”.The drawdown is not based on conditions and will start before May 1, the earlier deadline negotiated by the Trump administration with the Taliban. After September 11, US military presence in Afghanistan will be confided to providing protections to diplomats, according to officials.“We cannot continue the cycle of extending or expanding our military presence in Afghanistan hoping to create the ideal conditions for our withdrawal, expecting a different result,” Biden said, adding, “I am now the fourth American president to preside over an American troop presence in Afghanistan. Two Republicans. Two Democrats. I will not pass this responsibility to a fifth.”There are an estimated 2,500-3,500 US troops in Afghanistan, in addition to 8,500 deployed by coalition allies.“We went to Afghanistan because of a horrific attack that happened 20 years ago,” Biden said referring to the terrorist attacks carried out by Al Qaeda on September 11, 2001. “It is time to end America’s longest war. It is time for American troops to come home.”The US president also sought to reassure Afghans and the world that the withdrawal of troops will not end US engagement in that country. The US will continue to support the Afghan government and the peace process and will also keep providing assistance to Afghan security forces.A senior Biden administration official had told reporters earlier while previewing the plan announced by the president, the US will begin an “orderly drawdown of the remaining forces before May 1st and plan to have all US troops out of the country before the 20th anniversary of 9/11”. And it will not be be linked to conditions because the president “judged that a conditions-based approach, which has been the approach of the past two decades, is a recipe for staying in Afghanistan forever”.“Remaining military presence in Afghanistan will be the force required to protect our diplomatic presence”, the official said.As a candidate for the White House, Biden had backed a drawdown plan that left behind a residual force for counterinsurgency measures and training Afghan troops. And there had been speculation, after he took office, he still would do that, so as to not squander the gains of the last 20 years of fighting, as many had argued including India. But he was clearly not convinced.The American president is facing criticism already for the drawdown. “After a brief and seemingly halfhearted effort at diplomacy, Mr. Biden has decided on unconditional withdrawal, step that may spare the United States further costs and lives but will almost certainly be a disaster for the country’s 39 million people — and, in particular, its women,” The Washington Post wrote in a scathing editorial. The president, it added, “has chosen the easy way out of Afghanistan, but the consequences are likely to be ugly.”Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a Democrat, said, “I’m very disappointed in the President’s decision to set a September deadline to walk away from Afghanistan. Although this decision was made in coordination with our allies, the US has sacrificed too much to bring stability to Afghanistan to leave without verifiable assurances of a secure future.”The Biden administration official had said, perhaps anticipating the criticism, that it has long been known that “there is no military solution to the problems plaguing Afghanistan, and we will focus our efforts on supporting the ongoing peace process”.The official had added: “But what we will not do is use our troops as bargaining chips in that process.”Hours after the announcement of the Biden timeline, the Taliban said they will not attend a 10-day UN-led and US-backed peace initiative in Istanbul, Turkey till all foreign troops had left Afghanistan.“Until all foreign forces completely withdraw from our homeland, (we) will not participate in any conference that shall make decisions about Afghanistan,” tweeted Mohammad Naeem, spokesman for the Taliban office in Qatar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-time-to-end-america-s-longest-war-joe-biden-101618440970751.html
15-04-2021||World||Officer in Daunte Wright's killing: from leader to defendant||In a matter of days, the white police officer who fatally shot a Black man in a Minneapolis suburb went from being a respected professional who trained less experienced colleagues and led the department's union, to a criminal defendant held up by community activists as a symbol of police aggression toward Black people.Former Brooklyn Center police officer Kim Potter shot 20-year-old Daunte Wright in the chest during a Sunday traffic stop while she was training another officer. She offered her resignation Tuesday as outrage grew over Wright's death and Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott moved to fire her. The 26-year veteran was arrested Wednesday and charged with second-degree manslaughter.Tim Gannon, the Brooklyn Center Police chief who also resigned Tuesday, has said Potter meant to fire her Taser at Wright. He called the shooting “an accidental discharge.” But activists said that was no excuse; that with her years of experience, Potter should not have made that mistake. And now they want more than her resignation: They want to make sure she can never work as a police officer again.Potter said in a resignation letter that she had “loved every minute of being a police officer and serving this community,” but felt resigning was “in the best interest of the community, the department and my fellow officers.”For the 48-year-old Potter, being an officer extended far beyond going out on patrol. She also rose to become the local union president and traveled across the state with the Minnesota Law Enforcement Memorial Association’s honor guard, which marches at funerals and memorials for officers killed in the line of duty.But some Brooklyn Center residents say her decision to pull Wright over on Sunday represented something that was far from honorable: law enforcement's longstanding pattern of targeting Black men for traffic violations. Marquita Butler, a member of the city council, said numerous Black men, including her own brother, complained to her that police had racially profiled them.Gannon and the city manager met with her brother, she said. Butler credited Gannon for taking the time to explain why people are pulled over. But, she added, “My brother expressed to him the fear of being shot and potentially killed, and the police dismissed that.”Butler said as the city works to recover from Wright’s death, she wants to make it easier to file complaints with the police department and to “reimagine” what policing looks like.Elliott, the city's first Black mayor, has said he wants to establish a closer connection between the community and police. He pointed out that among the city's roughly 50 police officers, “very few” are people of color and none live in Brooklyn Center.Jonathan Mason, who mentored Wright while he was in high school, said he and other community activists are seeking the release of Potter’s service record, including potential complaints about her previous interactions with residents of color. The city has so far not responded to any such records requests, including from The Associated Press. Potter's attorney, Earl Gray, did not return a request for comment.Minnesota public records show Potter obtained her license to become a police officer in February 1995. She had graduated the previous year from Saint Mary's University of Minnesota with a major in criminal justice.In 2019, the year she came union president, she guided several other officers through the aftermath of a police shooting of a man with autism, according to a report from the Hennepin County Attorney’s office. She arrived at the scene soon after officers fatally shot the man, who had allegedly tried to stab an officer with a knife, the report said.After medics arrived, Potter instructed the two officers who shot the man to get into separate squad cars, turn off their body cameras, and not to speak to each other. Later, acting as union president, she accompanied two other officers who were at the scene during the shooting when they were interviewed by investigators.Through the years, the police department recognized Potter for actions in several dangerous situations, according to the Sun Post, a local newspaper. In 2014, she responded to a house fire and was credited with helping save nine people inside. In 2016, she was part of a group of officers who responded to several violent crimes, including one in which officers tried to save the victim’s life while also gathering testimony.Potter's husband, Jeff Potter, was a police officer and instructor in the nearby Minneapolis suburb of Fridley for 28 years. When he left the department in 2017, a police captain praised him for his dedication and lauded his work training officers in the use of force, firearms and Tasers.Kim Potter was training another officer on Sunday when they stopped the car Wright was driving. Bodycam video released by Brooklyn Center shows the other officer begins to arrest Wright, who had been issued a warrant for his arrest on a weapons charge.In the video from Potter's bodycam, she tries to assist the officer in arresting Wright, placing her hand on Wright's arm. But then he makes a break for his car and gets behind the wheel.Meanwhile, Potter pulls out her handgun and yells, “I’ll Tase you! I’ll Tase you! Taser! Taser! Taser!”After Potter fires a single shot, the car speeds away, and Potter is heard saying, “Holy (expletive)! I shot him.”On Wednesday, Potter was booked into the Hennepin County Jail. Concrete barriers and chain-link fencing surrounded the green lawn of her home in Champlin, a suburb that sits along the Mississippi River north of Minneapolis. Two police vehicles sat in the driveway._||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/officer-in-daunte-wright-s-killing-from-leader-to-defendant-101618440520414.html

The person was not identified.Health Canada said it “has received a report of an individual in Canada who has experienced a rare blood clot with low platelets following immunisation with Covishield, the SII version of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine. This is the first reported case in Canada”.It added that the episode will be “considered as part of the department’s ongoing safety review of the AstraZeneca and Covishield vaccines and the risk of rare blood clots with low platelets”.Canada received 500,000 doses of Covishield on March 3, and the entire consignment has already been distributed throughout the country. It was the first tranche of a two-million-dose deal between SII and the Canadian company Verity Pharmaceuticals, with the remaining doses expected to arrive by mid-May. Canada It has also received another 1.5 million doses from the United States.The earlier decision to pause vaccination for those below 55 with the AZ jab had been taken on March 29 following a recommendation from the National Advisory Committee on Immunisation.Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, meanwhile, said health authorities were “closely monitoring” reports from the US of possible side-effects of the single-jab Johnson & Johnson vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-reports-first-instance-of-rare-blood-clot-caused-by-az-s-covid-19-vaccine-101618427513556.html
