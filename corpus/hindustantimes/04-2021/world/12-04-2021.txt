Defense attorney Eric Nelson argued that the jurors could be influenced by the prospect of what might happen as a result of their verdict.“Ultimately, your honor, the question becomes will the jury be competent to make a decision regardless of the potential outcome of their decision," Nelson said.Judge Peter Cahill said he will not sequester the jury until next Monday, when he anticipates closing arguments will begin. He also denied a defense request to question jurors about what they might have seen about unrest following Sunday’s police shooting of 20-year-old Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center.In the wake of the shooting, hundreds of protesters broke into about 20 businesses at a shopping center, jumped on police cars and hurled rocks and other objects at officers in Brooklyn Center, about 10 miles from the heavily fortified Minneapolis courthouse. Police in riot gear fired gas and flash-bang grenades.The Brooklyn Center police chief later called the shooting accidental, saying the officer who fired meant to draw a Taser, not a handgun.Prosecutor Steve Schleicher argued against sequestering the Chauvin jury, saying: “I don’t think that would be an effective remedy.” He also opposed questioning the jurors.“World events happen,” Schleicher said. "And we can’t have every single world event that might affect somebody’s attitude or emotional state or anything be the grounds to come back and re-voir dire all the jurors.”The judge previously told the jury to avoid the news during the trial.The ruling came as the trial entered its third week, with the prosecution close to wrapping up its case and giving way to the start of the defense. Prosecutors built their case on searing witness accounts, experts condemning Chauvin's use of a neck restraint, and medical authorities attributing Floyd's death to a lack of oxygen.When testimony resumed Monday morning, Dr. Jonathan Rich, a cardiology expert from Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, echoed earlier witnesses in saying Floyd died of low oxygen levels from the way he was held down by police.He rejected defense theories that Floyd died of a drug overdose or a heart condition. Floyd had fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system and had high blood pressure and narrowing of the heart arteries, according to previous testimony.“It was the truly the prone restraint and positional restraints that led to his asphyxiation,” Rich said.In fact, the expert said, "Every indicator is that Mr. Floyd had actually an exceptionally strong heart.”Rich said he had reviewed Floyd’s autopsy report. He said that some narrowing of the arteries is extremely common, and that Floyd had a mildly thickened or mildly enlarged heart but that that would be normal in someone with high blood pressure.Corroborating other experts' testimony, Rich said that Floyd was “restrained in a life-threatening manner,” noting among other things that he was facedown on the ground, a knee was on his neck, his hands were cuffed behind his back and being pushed upward, and a knee was on the lower half of his body.Rich said that as one officer noted on video that Floyd was passing out, police probably still could have saved his life if they had repositioned him so that his lungs could expand again. And once an officer noted that Floyd's pulse had stopped, police still had a significant opportunity to save his life by administering CPR, he said.On cross-examination, Nelson tried to shift blame onto Floyd for struggling with police when they tried to put him in their car. The defense attorney asked Rich if Floyd would have survived if he had “simply gotten in the back seat of the squad car."But Rich quickly reiterated the death was caused by the officers' actions: “Had he not been restrained in the way in which he was, I think he would have survived that day. I think he would have gone home, or wherever he was going to go.”Nelson responded: “So, in other words, if he had gotten in the squad car, he’d be alive.”Derek Chauvin, 45, who is white, is charged with murder and manslaughter in Floyd’s May 25 death. Police had been called to a neighborhood market where Floyd was accused of trying to pass a counterfeit bill.Prosecutors say Chauvin had his knee on Floyd's neck as the 46-year-old Black man lay pinned to the pavement for 9 1/2 minutes. Bystander video of Floyd crying “I can't breathe!” until he finally went limp sparked protests and scattered violence in Minneapolis and around the U.S.Chauvin's attorney is expected to call his own medical experts to make the case that it was not the officer's knee that killed Floyd. The defense has not said whether Chauvin will testify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/judge-refuses-to-isolate-jury-in-george-floyd-murder-case-101618249551129.html
12-04-2021||World||White House says US not involved in Iran nuclear site incident||The White House on Monday said it was not involved in a power outage incident at an Iranian nuclear site and declined comment on Tehran's accusing Israel of sabotaging the Natanz facility."The US was not involved in any manner," White House press secretary Jen Psaki said in response to questions. "We have nothing to add on speculation about the causes or the impacts."Iran vowed revenge for what it described as an act of "nuclear terrorism" that caused an electricity outage in one of the production halls at the uranium enrichment plant.Israel fiercely opposes Tehran's 2015 nuclear deal with major powers, an accord that Iran and the new administration of President Joe Biden are engaged in trying to revive after then-US President Donald Trump abandoned it three years ago.Multiple Israeli media outlets quoted unnamed intelligence sources as saying Israel's Mossad spy service carried out a successful sabotage operation at the underground complex.Israel, whose existence Iran does not recognize, has not formally commented on the incident.Iran and the global powers described as "constructive" talks last week to salvage the nuclear deal, which has unraveled as Iran has breached its limits on sensitive uranium enrichment since Trump reimposed harsh sanctions on Tehran.Talks are expected to resume on Wednesday in Vienna, and Psaki said she expected them to be "difficult and long.""We have not been given any indication about a change in participation," by Iran, she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-says-us-not-involved-in-iran-nuclear-site-incident-101618249135933.html
12-04-2021||World||Minnesota police say officer who shot Black man meant to draw Taser, not handgun||The police chief in a Minneapolis suburb where a Black man was fatally shot during a traffic stop said Monday that he believes the officer who fired intended to use a Taser, not a handgun.Brooklyn Center Police Chief Tim Gannon described the shooting as “an accidental discharge.” The state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension was investigating.Daunte Wright, 20, died Sunday in a metropolitan area that was already on edge because of the trial of the first of four police officers charged in George Floyd’s death.Gannon said at a news conference that the officer made a mistake, and he released body camera footage from the officer who fired. The footage showed three officers around a stopped car. When another officer attempts to handcuff Wright, a struggle ensues. The officer is heard shouting “Taser!” several times before firing her weapon.“This was an accidental discharge that resulted in a tragic death of Mr. Wright,” the chief said.Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott called the shooting “deeply tragic.”“We’re going to do everything we can to ensure that justice is done and our communities are made whole," he said.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz tweeted that he was praying for Wright’s family “as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.”Speaking before the unrest, Wright's mother, Katie Wright, urged protesters to stay peaceful and focused on the loss of her son.“All the violence, if it keeps going, it’s only going to be about the violence. We need it to be about why my son got shot for no reason,” she said to a crowd near the shooting scene in Brooklyn Center, a city of about 30,000 people on the northwest border of Minneapolis. “We need to make sure it’s about him and not about smashing police cars, because that’s not going to bring my son back.”Protesters who gathered near the scene waved flags and signs reading “Black Lives Matter.” Others walked peacefully with their hands held up. On one street, someone wrote in multi-colored chalk: “Justice for Daunte Wright.”Katie Wright said her son called her as he was getting pulled over.“All he did was have air fresheners in the car, and they told him to get out of the car,” Wright said. During the call, she said she heard scuffling and then someone saying “Daunte, don’t run” before the call ended. When she called back, her son’s girlfriend answered and said he had been shot.Authorities said the car was pulled over for having expired registration and after determining the driver had an outstanding warrant, police said they tried to arrest him. Then the driver reentered the vehicle, and an officer fired, striking him, police said. The vehicle traveled several blocks before striking another vehicle.Wright’s family offered a different account, with Katie Wright saying her son was shot before getting back into the car.A female passenger sustained non-life-threatening injuries during the crash, authorities said. Katie Wright said that passenger was her son’s girlfriend.Court records show Wright was being sought after failing to appear in court on charges that he fled from officers and possessed a gun without a permit during an encounter with Minneapolis police in June. In that case, a statement of probable cause said police got a call about a man waving a gun who was later identified as Wright.”Shortly after the shooting, demonstrators began to gather, with some jumping atop police cars. Marchers also descended on the Brooklyn Center Police Department, where rocks and other objects were thrown at officers, authorities said. The protesters had largely dispersed by 1:15 a.m. Monday.President Joe Biden was briefed on the shooting, and the White House has been in touch with the governor, mayor and local law enforcement, White House press secretary Jen Psaki said.“We were incredibly saddened to hear about the loss of life at the hands of law enforcement in Minnesota yesterday,” she said.National Guard troops and law enforcement officers continued to guard the front of the police department on Monday morning. Police were erecting a concrete barrier as Minnesota State Patrol officers joined the line in front of the precinct.Several people and reporters watched from across the street as traffic returned to normal on the street where protesters were met with tear gas the night before. One man yelled at the officers using a megaphone as others flew Black Lives Matter flags.About 20 businesses were broken into at the city’s Shingle Creek shopping center, Minnesota Department of Public Safety Commissioner John Harrington said at a news conference.The National Guard was activated, and Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott announced a curfew that expired shortly before daybreak.Police said Brooklyn Center officers wear body cameras, which they believe were activated during the traffic stop.The trial of Derek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis officer charged in Floyd’s death, continued Monday. Floyd, a Black man, died May 25 after Chauvin, who is white, pressed his knee against Floyd’s neck. Prosecutors say Floyd was pinned for 9 minutes, 29 seconds.More National Guard members and state law enforcement personnel were to be deployed around the Twin Cities and in Brooklyn Center in addition to teams already in place for Chauvin’s trial at the Hennepin County courthouse in Minneapolis, Harrington said.There was no visible increase in the already high security presence on Monday morning outside the courthouse, which was fortified ahead of Chauvin’s trial with tall fencing topped with barbed wire and coils of razor wire between the fences and concrete barriers. National Guard troops with military vehicles, sheriff’s deputies and county security guards continued to stand watch.Meanwhile, all Brooklyn Center students were to attend online classes Monday because school buildings were closed, Superintendent Carly Baker said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minnesota-police-say-officer-who-shot-black-man-meant-to-draw-taser-not-handgun-101618249259596.html

The transaction is all-cash and the sum includes Nuance's net debt.Nuance's technology is currently used by more than 55 percent of physicians and 75 percent of radiologists in the United States. Microsoft said the deal would double its potential healthcare market to nearly $500 billion."AI is technology's most important priority, and healthcare is its most urgent application," Microsoft Chief Executive Satya Nadella said."Together, with our partner ecosystem, we will put advanced AI solutions into the hands of professionals everywhere to drive better decision-making and create more meaningful connections, as we accelerate growth of Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare and Nuance."This acquisition builds on the existing partnership between the two companies, which have been collaborating since 2019 in telemedicine, a sector whose growth has been spurred exponentially by Covid-19 lockdowns around the world.Last year, the Redmond, Washington-based giant integrated Nuance Communication's Dragon Ambient eXperience program into its Teams communications software, which enables remote transcription of medical conversations.Nuance CEO Mark Benjamin noted the increasing demand for its products in recent years."To seize this opportunity, we need the right platform to bring focus and global scale to our customers and partners to enable more personal, affordable and effective connections to people and care," Benjamin said in the statement. "The path forward is clearly with Microsoft."'No brainer'The deal comes on the heels of Microsoft's 2016 purchase of LinkedIn for $27 billion and represents "the latest step in Microsoft's industry-specific cloud strategy," the company said.Like other technology heavyweights, Microsoft has been a big beneficiary of the economic dislocations during Covid-19.The company's earnings jumped by 33 percent in the latest quarter to $15.5 billion and included a boost from cloud computing and personal computing, including its Xbox video games.Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives called the Nuance tie-up a "trophy" deal for the company founded by Bill Gates, which is on a "strategic offensive" in search of targets to purchase."For Nadella & Co, this is the right acquisition at the right time with Microsoft doubling down on its healthcare initiatives over the coming years," he said in an analysis. "The Nuance deal is a strategic no brainer in our opinion for MSFT and fits like a glove into its healthcare endeavors."Based in Burlington near Boston, Nuance was founded in 1992 and specializes in conversational artificial intelligence solutions, particularly in the healthcare sector.Nuance Communications, which employed more than 7,100 people as of September 30, reported sales of $1.48 billion last year.Benjamin, will remain at the head of the new group, the statement said. He will report to Microsoft's executive vice president of cloud and artificial intelligence, Scott Guthrie.Ives said Microsoft is on the hunt for more acquisitions and this deal "could be the first step in an increased appetite for deals in 2021 with Discord (video game chat community) another potential trophy for Redmond."It comes just a few months after the takeover of ZeniMax, the parent company of video game publisher Bethesda Softworks, for $7.5 billion in September.Media reports cite the potential for other big deals, including crafting platform Pinterest in a possible $51 billion transaction, and the popular Discord discussion platform for about $10 billion.Shares of Nuance surged 17 percent to $53.35 in midday trading, while Microsoft edged up 0.3 percent to $256.68.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/microsoft-to-acquire-ai-cloud-computing-company-nuance-for-19-7-billion-101618245863031.html

Also, the international communities should ensure anti-Covid-19 vaccine is available for all,” Khan was quoted as saying in a statement issued by the Prime minister Khan's office after the inauguration of the forum.The 4-day FfD forum is being held from April 12-15, under Pakistan’s Presidency of ECOSOC.A number of world leaders are participating in the meeting to address the themes of resilient recovery, recurrent debt crises, pandemic response and recovery, liquidity for vulnerable countries, and a climate resilient future.Khan recalled his five-point agenda for emergency financial support to developing countries including debt relief and restructuring, creation and redistribution of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), larger concessional finance, and an end to illicit financial outflows from the developing countries.He said there is a need to transform the world economy into one that is development-oriented and environmentally sustainable.Highlighting the need for massive mobilisation of public and private investment on sustainable infrastructure and climate finance, especially in the developing countries, Khan said: “The United Nations was well placed to take the lead in formulating and coordinating the implementation of a plan to make the transition to a green global economy by creating an inclusive, multi-stakeholder mechanism”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ensure-anti-covid-19-vaccine-is-available-for-all-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-urges-un-101618247844712.html

But we have many reasons for optimism. The decline in cases and deaths during the first two months of the year shows that this virus and its variants can be stopped," he added.Transmission was being driven by "confusion, complacency and inconsistency in public health measures."India has overtaken Brazil to become the nation with the second highest number of infections worldwide after the United States, as it battles a massive second wave, having given about 105 million vaccine doses among a population of 1.4 billion."We are at a critical point in the pandemic now, the trajectory of this pandemic is growing for the 7th week in a row," said the WHO team leader on Covid-19, Maria van Kerkhove.Noting that there had been a 9% rise in cases last week, the seventh consecutive week of increases, and a 5% rise in deaths, she added: "If you look at the epi (epidemic) curve and the trajectory of the pandemic right now, it is growing exponentially".Tedros said that in some countries, despite continuing transmission, restaurants and nightclubs were full and markets were open and crowded with few people taking precautions."Some people appear to be taking the approach that if they’re relatively young, it doesn’t matter if they get Covid-19," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-long-way-from-over-who-chief-tedros-adhanom-ghebreyesus-101618246019658.html
12-04-2021||World||China forces Jack Ma's Ant Group to transform into a financial holding firm||Jack Ma’s Ant Group Co. will drastically revamp its business, bowing to demands from Chinese authorities that want to rein in the country’s fast-growing Internet giants.Ant will now effectively be supervised more like a bank, a move with far-reaching implications for its growth and ability to press ahead with a landmark initial public offering that the government abruptly delayed late last year.The overhaul announced by regulators and the company on Monday will see Ant transform itself into a financial holding company, with authorities also directing the firm to eliminate unfair competition in payments, increase oversight of how that business fuels it crucial consumer lending operations, and ramp up data protections. The firm will also need to cut the outstanding value of its money-market fund Yu’ebao.The directives come as China’s regulators pledge to curb the “reckless” push of technology firms into finance and crack down on monopolies online. The twin pillars of Ma’s empire -- Ant and e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. -- have been at the center of the increased scrutiny, sending a clear message to the country’s largest corporations and their leaders to fall in line with Beijing’s priorities.Several government agencies, including the People’s Bank of China, and regulators overseeing the banking and securities sectors met with Ant to dictate the changes.Regulators also slapped a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba this month after an anti-trust probe found the e-commerce company abused its market dominance.“The darkest hour for Alibaba has passed, but I wouldn’t say so for Ant Group,” said Dong Ximiao, chief researcher at Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute. “The latest announcement clarified the framework for Ant’s restructuring, but the tone is still harsh and some of the requirements are tougher than expected. I don’t think the overhang is removed for Ant investors at this stage.”While the revamp leaves Ant’s main businesses intact, regulators are making its harder for the firm to exploit synergies that allowed it to direct traffic from its payments service Alipay -- which has a billion users -- to other financial services including wealth management, consumer lending and even on-demand neighborhood services and delivery.Authorities will now require Ant to cut off any improper linking of payments with other financial products including its Jiebei and Huabei lending services. In a statement, Ant said it would fold those units into its consumer finance arm, apply for a license for personal credit reporting, and improve consumer data protection.“Ant’s growth prospects just became a lot more challenging, given it will be much more difficult to capitalize on its scale,” said Mark Tanner, founder of Shanghai-based consultant China Skinny. “These growth challenges, in addition to the wider concerns about the tech sector regulators, makes their IPO value and attractiveness a shadow of what it was.”Ant Chairman Eric Jing promised staff last month that the company would eventually go public. Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Francis Chan has estimated the firm’s valuation may drop about 60% from the $280 billion it was pegged at last year given the rule changes being contemplated in areas including payments.Payments focusChanges to its payments business were among the top priorities outlined by regulators on Monday, with Ant pledging to return the business “to its origin” by focusing on micro-payments and convenience for users.Earlier this year, China proposed measures to curb market concentration in online payments, which Ant and rival Tencent Holdings Ltd. have transformed with their ubiquitous mobile apps that are used by a combined 1 billion people.The central bank said in draft rules that any non-bank payment company with half of the market in online transactions or two entities with a combined two-thirds share could be subject to antitrust probes.If a monopoly is confirmed, the central bank can suggest that cabinet impose restrictive measures including breaking up the entity by its business type.Mobile payments are only part of what contribute to online transactions, but they have become the most important platform in China, fueling growth in other financial services.Investors are also awaiting final rules aimed at curbing online consumer lending, that were unveiled late last year.Given all the changes still down the track, an Ant IPO remains “far, far away,” said Zhongguancun Internet Finance Institute’s Dong.“What we have now is a clear roadmap for Ant to restructure its sprawling businesses, and what’s certain is that if it revives the IPO in the future, it will be a listing of the entire financial holding company,” said Chen Shujin, Hong Kong-based head of financial research at Jefferies Financial Group Inc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-forces-jack-ma-s-ant-group-to-transform-into-a-financial-holding-firm-101618245289221.html

The SII did not respond to a request for comment. Botswana's health ministry did not say how the people died.Millions of doses of the AstraZeneca shot have been safely administered around the world.But Europe's drug regulator said last week it had found a possible link between AstraZeneca's vaccine and very rare cases of blood clots.The European Medicines Agency received reports of 169 cases of the rare brain blood clot by early April, after 34 million doses had been administered. Most of the cases reported had occurred in women under 60.The Botswana health ministry said in a statement late on Sunday that the two deaths were of elderly people. It did not elaborate."The ministry has referred the matter to the regulator being BOMRA for immediate investigation. It is expected that BOMRA investigation will seek to establish the cause of two deaths as well as whether they are in any way linked to the Covid vaccine which was administered," the statement read.It advised the public to remain calm and said people who were recovering from recent severe illness should consider delaying getting the vaccine.Experts say that, even if a causal link is proved between the vaccine and blood clots, the risks of getting a serious clot are minute compared to the risks from possible Covid-19 infection, which can cause similar clots along with other serious symptoms.Botswana has recorded around 40,000 coronavirus cases and 630 deaths during the pandemic, few by comparison with many other countries around the world, but its diamond-driven economy was hit hard last year, contracting almost 8%.AstraZeneca's vaccine is the cheapest and most readily available. It does not need to be kept at extremely cold temperatures, making it a mainstay of many vaccination programmes in developing countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/botswana-probes-deaths-of-two-people-who-took-astrazeneca-shot-101618244214546.html

Shortly before that incident, Major caused what the White House said was a minor injury to a Secret Service employee on March 8.Both dogs spent time back in Delaware after the first incident — the White House said it was because the first lady would be traveling for a few days — and the president had said Major was being trained.On National Pet Day on Sunday, Jill Biden tweeted photos of both dogs captioned, “Love these two!”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-dog-major-gets-help-adjusting-to-white-house-after-two-biting-incidents-101618241671362.html
12-04-2021||World||Protests in Minnesota after police shoot Black man||Protests broke out in the US state of Minnesota on Sunday after police fatally shot an African-American man at a traffic stop. The incident occurred just 10 miles (16 kilometres) from a courtroom in nearby Minneapolis where a former police officer is on trial for killing George Floyd, which had led to anti-race protests and marches around the world in 2020.Police fired rubber bullets and used tear gas as the crowd lobbed water bottles and garbage bags at the police as they faced off outside the police headquarters in Brooklyn Center, a city near Minneapolis, where the shooting took place. Protesters waved ‘Black Lives Matter’ flags, blasted music and chanted slogans directed at the police, according to reports.StarTribune, a local news publication, reported National Guard troops arrived at the scene of the protests just before midnight as looters targeted a Walmart store and a shopping mall. Looting had spread to other areas as authorities imposed a night-time curfew till 6am.The victim has been identified as Daunte Wright, 20. “Our entire community is filled with grief following today’s officer-involved shooting of Daunte Wright, a 20-year-old young man. Our hearts are with his family, and with all those in our community impacted by this tragedy,” said Brooklyn Center Mayor Mike Elliott on Twitter. “While we await additional information from the BCA (Bureau of Criminal Apprehension) who is leading the investigation, we continue to ask that members of our community gathering do so peacefully, amid our calls for transparency and accountability.”Brooklyn Center police department said that officers had stopped a man for traffic violation on Sunday afternoon. They determined there was an outstanding warrant for his arrest. But when officers tried to take him into custody, he got back into the car.At this time one of the officers, who has not been identified, shot at the driver. The man drove away nevertheless and crashed into another vehicle several blocks away. He was pronounced dead at the scene and a female passenger in the car is reported to have suffered life-threatening injuries.Brooklyn Center police chief Tim Gannon of Brooklyn Center Police Department told reporters at a news conference on Monday that he believes the officer intended to draw the taser to use on Wright but pulled the handgun instead. “This appears to me, from what I viewed, and the officer’s reaction in distress immediately after, that this was an accidental discharge.” The police played a video of the shooting from the body cam of one of the officers.Earlier, Wright’s mother, Katie Wright, told reporters, “All he did was have air fresheners in the car and they told him to get out of the car.”StarTribune reported the victim had called his mother when he was pulled over. “He got out of the car, and his girlfriend said they shot him,” she said. “He got back into the car, and he drove away and crashed and now he’s dead on the ground since 1.47pm. ...

12-04-2021||World||47 nations allocated 14.7 million doses of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine: Statement||Some 14.1 million doses of the Pfizer BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine have been allocated to 47 countries and economies for delivery in the second quarter of this year, the Gavi Vaccine Alliance said on Monday.Brazil, Colombia, Mexico, the Philippines, South Africa, and Ukraine are set to be among the main recipients of the Pfizer vaccine between April and June, according to Gavi, which co-leads the COVAX facility with the World Health Organization (WHO) and other partners.The COVAX programme offers a lifeline to low-income countries in particular, allowing them to inoculate health workers and others at high risk, even if their governments have not managed to secure vaccines from the manufacturers.Australia, Britain, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates are due to receive their first shots via COVAX with the Pfizer doses, which is "based on current knowledge of COVID-19 vaccine supply availability", Gavi said in a statement.The programme delivered nearly 38.4 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines to 102 countries across six continents, six weeks after it began to roll out supplies, Gavi said last Thursday.Deliveries of the AstraZeneca vaccine to 142 participants under a previously announced round were underway, "with some delays" that may extend deliveries past May, Gavi said on Monday.Reduced availability delayed some deliveries in March and April, and much of the output of the Serum Institute of India, which makes the AstraZeneca vaccine, is being kept in India, where the number of daily infections is spiralling.The chief executive of Gavi, Seth Berkley, said last Friday that COVAX aimed to deliver one third of a billion COVID-19 doses by mid-year, on the way to more than 2 billion in 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/47-nations-allocated-14-7-mn-doses-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-statement-101618231198773.html
12-04-2021||World||China operationalises 5G services at Tibet radar station||China has operationalised 5G services at the world’s highest manually operated radar station in Tibet near the border with Sikkim. Located at over 17,000 feet (5,182 metres), the Ganbala radar station was built in the 1960s and is strategically located in the Yadong county of Xigase prefecture in the Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR); it is located close to both Sikkim and Bhutan.The purpose of the new 5G station is primarily to help the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) soldiers posted at the remote station to access the internet and keep in contact with family.“Recently, a 5G signal base station was put into use at the Ganbala radar station in Tibet at the elevation of 5,182 metres, the world’s highest manually operated radar station,” the official defence portal, China Military Online reported on Monday.The report added that “information blockade” was adding to the “exceptionally challenging” living conditions at the radar station including the lack of potable water, accommodation, and heating.The PLA started to coordinate with civilian enterprises to launch 5G base station construction in Ganbala last year to solve the difficulty of network access for the border troops.“The stable and high-speed 5G signal enables soldiers in the deep mountains to keep up with the information society, leaving the monotonous and boring life on the border behind forever,” the report added.The operationalisation of 5G signal base station has “…shortened the distance between soldiers and their families and friends”.Radar operator Lin Linghui told the website said that serving in the military on plateau areas means that he could not get together with family members often, but he could now have video chat with his family freely and witness the growth of his child.Clearly, the launch of 5G signals at a height of over 17,000 feet in the mountains is part of China’s continuing efforts to improve living conditions and infrastructure in the strategic area for PLA troops.In recent years, the Chinese military has continued to advance various projects to improve the conditions of its border troops, including green vegetables supply all year round, warm, and clean barracks, and ready-to-use oxygen inhalers.“The implementation of these measures has supported the improvement of training and on-duty conditions for soldiers stationed in border areas,” the military website said.Since last May, climbers to Mt Everest from the Chinese side have been able to use 5G coverage after the world’s highest-altitude base station started operating on the mountain.Built at an altitude of 6,500 metres, the base station is located at the advance base camp of Mt Everest, the world’s highest peak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-operationalises-5g-services-at-tibet-radar-station-101618236037768.html

12-04-2021||World||Sputnik vaccine helping Russia regain foothold in Latin America||Russia has been trying to get its coronavirus vaccine Sputnik V into Brazilian arms for months, and been repeatedly frustrated by legal, regulatory and possibly even diplomatic obstacles.That began to change as the South American nation played catch-up in the global race to snap up shots. Receiving little help from the US, which was struggling to get a handle on its own outbreak, Sputnik V seemed as good as any; Brazil's federal government and a group of nine northeastern states signed two deals with Russia's sovereign wealth fund, RDIF, for a total 47 million doses. The shot is moving toward regulatory approval.The vaccine has now been purchased by at least nine Latin American nations, with Brazil its greatest uphill battle.That growing adoption reflects Russia gaining a greater foothold in the region the US has traditionally viewed as within its sphere of influence — and where the American government had boasted of steering Brazil away from Russian vaccines. It's similar to China's success in achieving wide use of its own vaccines in Latin America.That has caused consternation in US diplomatic circles, although it remains to be seen if Russia’s vaccine outreach will yield deeper partnerships.Tom Shannon, a former undersecretary of state whose long diplomatic career included several stints in the region, told The Associated Press the US has largely missed an opportunity to engage with Latin American governments during the pandemic, with the exception of a recently announced plan by President Joe Biden’s administration to provide Mexico surplus shots“For the Kremlin, Covid was a godsend,” Shannon said of Russia’s vaccine outreach. “This was a chance for them to restart their diplomacy in the hemisphere with a whole new face of public health intervention and they are taking full advantage of it.”“When you have 300,000 dead, you take the help where you can get it from,” he said of Brazil.Russia’s presence in Latin America has been limited since the 1990s, and in recent years primarily entailed an alliance with Venezuela for provision of arms and energy projects, as well as Nicaragua for arms and building emergency response capabilities. But Latin America's arms purchases plunged as its commodities boom ended and Venezuela economy melted down.Russian ties were also strong with the government of Argentina’s Cristina Fernandez Kirchner from 2007 to 2015 and appear to be reviving. As current vice president, Kirchner spearheaded negotiations to buy Sputnik V even when local scientists initially were skeptical of the early experimental data reported by the Gamaleya Institute that developed the vaccine.Argentina's embrace of the vaccine helped convince Mexico — which had struggled to get vaccines from US companies — to sign an agreement for 24 million doses, though they have been slow to arrive.Bolivia’s previously tight relations with Russia had reversed under President Luis Arce’s right-wing predecessor, but Arce, who took office in November, agreed to buy millions of doses. After speaking with Putin by phone, he also announced reactivation of a Russian-led project to build a nuclear research and technology centre.US vaccine outreach, meantime, has been almost entirely indirect, with a pledge of $4 billion to the World Health Organization’s COVAX program to provide shots to low- and middle-income countries. Recently, such shipments have been delayed.The US has snatched up more doses than it will eventually need, and Biden has repeatedly said his focus is vaccinating all Americans before sharing vaccines abroad. The US has had almost three times as many Covid-19 deaths per capita as Russia and, even with one of the world's fastest immunization rollouts, Americans have complained about the pace.By contrast, Russia’s own vaccination program has lagged because of widespread skepticism of the vaccine — a February poll showed only 30% of Russians were willing to get the shot — and drug makers being slow to ramp up production.Only recently did Biden's administration agree to provide 2.7 million surplus AstraZeneca doses to Mexico. Brazil has been trying to negotiate the same for itself, according to its foreign ministry.“Although I truly think that the US and European countries are the preferred partners in the region, if there is a vacuum, there isn’t the slightest doubt that China and Russia will seek a way to take advantage,” Mauricio Claver-Carone, the head of the Inter-American Development Bank, told the AP.The US Department of Health and Human Services’ 2020 annual report said in a section titled “Combatting malign influences in the Americas” that it had convinced Brazil to not to buy the Russian shot. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said March 16 other countries faced similar coercion, without naming them.“The pressure has been unprecedented, tough and devoid of any diplomatic niceties,” Peskov said. “We are categorically against politicizing the situation with vaccines.”Fabiano Mielniczuk, a professor who specializes in Russian international politics at Brazil’s Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul, said suspicion of Russia represents an outdated Cold War mentality, and sees its moves to introduce the shot “much more as market-oriented action than as geopolitical action.”Despite the assertion in the “malign influences” section, it's unclear what action the US took. The US embassy denied exerting any pressure regarding vaccines approved by Brazil’s health regulator, which has not yet signed off on Sputnik V. Brazil’s government denied even being consulted.Frustrated by the speed and bureaucracy of health regulator Anvisa, the Russians conducted phase 3 trials of its vaccine elsewhere, according to Bahia state’s Gov. Rui Costa, who had worked closely with the fund. At the time, Brazil still required local phase 3 trials for regulatory approval.In a last-ditch effort, RDIF’s director Kirill Dmitriev reached out to former President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, according to Alexandre Padilha, a lawmaker and former health minister who joined their subsequent meeting. That led to the nine states' eventual deal for 37 million doses. RDIF declined to comment for this story.“The northeastern governments already have various investment partnerships with the Chinese,” Padilha said. “I think without a doubt this can open doors for northeast governors to establish other partnerships and technology investments with the Russians.”Putin meantime heaped flattery on Bolsonaro at a multinational summit in November, saying the Brazilian had “expressed the best qualities of masculinity and determination” by putting citizens’ interests before his own health. Bolsonaro posted video of the praise to social media.Courting the rival former and current presidents simultaneously reflects Putin’s pragmatism, said Mielniczuk, the political science professor.Brazil’s federal government agreed to buy 10 million doses.Even after Anvisa dropped its demand for local phase 3 trials, the Brazilian lab that would produce Sputnik V locally — Uniao Quimica — struggled to clear hurdles.RDIF’s Dmitriev told Brazilian magazine Veja in mid-March that he felt his vaccine was still facing political bias. But Anvisa said delays were technical, caused by lacking documentation, and on March 23 it held a five-hour meeting with Uniao Quimica and Gamaleya to iron out problems. A week later, Anvisa certified Uniao Quimica’s manufacturing practices.On April 6, Bolsonaro spoke with Putin by video call and said afterward that his government was working to resolve "some obstacles″ to importing the shot. The leaders also discussed broader trade, defense industry cooperation and technology.After the call was first reported, the former director of Brazil's trade and investment promotion agency, Márcio Coimbra, said on Twitter, “Now distant from Washington, we may be closer than ever to Moscow.”Some documentation is still missing, but Sputnik V is inching closer to approval in Brazil — and another soft-power score for Russia. It serves as a wake-up call, said Eric Farnsworth, who has developed and implemented US policy in the region.“We’re not the only ones that Latin America can interact with and they’re showing it right now,” said Farnsworth, vice president of the Council of the Americas, a New York-based organization promoting business in the region. “There is much ground to be recaptured, and the only way to do that would be to overwhelm the region with generosity in combatting the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sputnik-vaccine-helping-russia-regain-foothold-in-latin-america-101618232821569.html

The man died from his wounds."I heard six loud shots while I was having lunch around 1.30 pm (1130 GMT)," the caretaker of a nearby building told AFP."I went out immediately, and I saw a young black man on the ground, face down, outside the hospital. He was maybe 20 or 30 years old and he was already dead," said the caretaker, who declined to give her name.The injured woman works as a security guard at the hospital, which runs a Covid-19 vaccination centre.Paris prosecutors said they were treating the shooting as a murder and an attempted murder.District mayor Francis Szpiner told reporters that the attacker had fired several rounds at the man."It would seem that the security guard was hit by a stray bullet," he said.Szpiner said the shooting was "neither a terrorist attack nor an attack on the vaccination centre".- 'Walked off with amazing calmness' -The owner of a restaurant across the street from the hospital told the BFMTV television channel that he also heard shots ringing out."I turned around and I saw a guy with a hoodie firing. Then I saw him approach a guy lying on the ground and put two bullets in his head to finish him off," he said."The shooter walked off with amazing calmness, as if nothing had happened," he said.Police cordoned off the area around the hospital, and forensic experts were examining the scene for clues, AFP journalists said.A fire engine and several police vans lined the street outside the facility.After the attack, the hospital turned away several people who had been waiting for doctors visits, admitting only priority patients."The hospital is now functioning with reduced staff," a Red Cross staffer told AFP.

12-04-2021||World||Alibaba shares rise as it plays down effects of record $2.78 billion fine||Shares in tech giant Alibaba climbed more than six percent Monday as the ecommerce titan reassured investors that a record $2.78 billion antitrust fine imposed by China would have little impact on its operations.However, concerns that officials had not finished with a crackdown on the sector weighed on big-name firms including Tencent and JD.com.Ant Group, whose planned record-shattering $35 billion Hong Kong-Shanghai IPO was shelved late last year amid the Chinese crackdown on Big Tech, separately announced a restructuring plan but vowed to "ensure business continuity".Regulators slapped Alibaba with the penalty on Saturday after a months-long probe concluded it had been abusing its dominant market position.But in a conference call to investors on Monday, Alibaba's board suggested the fine marked the end of the investigation, with chairman Daniel Zhang saying the penalty would not have a "negative impact" on business operations.The government has cracked down on major Chinese tech platforms -- and Alibaba in particular -- over allegations of anti-competitive behaviour, misuse of consumer data and over-aggressive expansions."We had good guidance on some of the specific issues under the anti-monopoly law and I would say that we are pleased that we are able to put this matter behind us," company vice-chair Joe Tsai added.Ant Group said it would comply with government demands that it establish a financial holding company and apply for relevant licences to bring its online lending, credit and wealth management businesses more in line with Chinese banking regulations.Ant's foray into the wider world of financial services has alarmed regulators who are trying to rein in soaring personal debt.Ant Group added that it would "return to its origins (in) our payment business", but gave few details.Alibaba, meanwhile, will introduce measures to lower entry barriers and business costs faced by merchants on its shopping platform.Alibaba's stock price jumped nearly nine percent to as high as HK$237.60 in Hong Kong on Monday morning before easing back marginally to close up 6.5 percent.But other tech firms took a hit with Tencent down one percent, JD.com losing two percent and NetEase one percent lower."Alibaba's stock has rallied as the fine wasn't as bad as it could have been," said OANDA's Jeffrey Halley. "However, it is the thought that counts, and investors seem concerned that Alibaba will not be the last China tech giant in the fine firing line."Alibaba has faced special scrutiny after co-founder Jack Ma publicly criticised Chinese regulators in October over their warnings about Ant Group's expansion."We have continuous communication with the regulators," Zhang said, adding that the group will "fully comply" with the requirements.Alibaba was punished for forbidding merchants who use its popular online marketplaces from simultaneously offering products on rival e-commerce sites, the State Administration for Market Regulation said in announcing the fine Saturday.Lina Choi from Moody's Investors Service warned that the required changes will "likely limit Alibaba's revenue growth" in the future and hinder attempts to grab more market share."Investments to retain merchants and upgrade products and services will also reduce its profit margins," she said.Alibaba and JD.com, along with messaging-and-gaming colossus Tencent, became hugely profitable on the back of growing Chinese digital lifestyles and government restrictions on major US competitors in the domestic market.But their success has drawn the scrutiny of Beijing as the platforms amassed hundreds of millions of regular users.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alibaba-shares-rise-as-it-plays-down-effects-of-record-2-78-billion-fine-101618229346388.html

Singapore uses robots for home deliveries to cut Covid-19 spread||Hoping to capitalise on a surge in demand for home deliveries, a Singapore technology company has deployed a pair of robots to bring residents their groceries in one part of the city state. Developed by OTSAW Digital and both named "Camello", the robots' services have been offered to 700 households in a one-year trial. Users can book delivery slots for their milk and eggs, and an app notifies them when the robot is about to reach a pick-up point - usually the lobby of an apartment building.The robots, which are equipped with 3D sensors, a camera and two compartments each able to carry up to 20 kg (44 lb) of food or parcels ordered online, make four or five deliveries per day on weekdays and are on call for half day on Saturday. They use ultraviolet light to disinfect themselves after every trip, said OTSAW Digital's chief executive, Ling Ting Ming. "Especially during this pandemic period, everybody is looking at contactless, humanless," he told Reuters. For the time being, staff accompany the robots on their rounds to ensure no problems arise.Tashfique Haider, a 25-year-old student who has tried out the service, said it could be particularly helpful for the elderly so they wouldn't have to carry goods home. But a passerby worried the technology might be too much trouble for some. "The younger customers will like it. I don't think they (the older generation) will, because these are gadgets that younger people like," said 36-year-old housewife Xue Ya Xin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-normal-singapore-uses-robots-for-home-deliveries-to-cut-covid-19-spread-101618228376313.html
12-04-2021||World||Russians celebrate 60th anniversary of Yuri Gagarin's spaceflight||Russia on Monday celebrated the 60th anniversary of the legendary flight that made Yuri Gagarin the first man in space, a major source of national pride for millions of his countrymen.Russia's space industry has struggled in recent years and been hit by a series of mishaps, but the sending of the first human into space on April 12, 1961 remains a crowning achievement of the Soviet space programme.President Vladimir Putin was to travel Monday to the southern city of Engels on the banks of the Volga River, to the site of the cosmonaut's landing where a memorial stands to honour the historic flight.He was to be accompanied by Valentina Tereshkova, a Soviet cosmonaut and the first woman in space.The day of Gagarin's flight is celebrated every year in Russia as Cosmonautics Day, and this year authorities are pulling out all the stops to mark the 60th anniversary, with round-the-clock television coverage, murals on high-rises and laser projections of Gagarin's portrait.For Moscow commuters, the morning started with a broadcast on the Metro of the original report by state news agency TASS about the launch, followed by Gagarin's legendary words -- "Poekhali!" (Let's go) -- as his Vostok spacecraft lifted off.In a message from the International Space Station, the four Russians on board saluted "all earthlings" and hailed Gagarin's accomplishment."Gagarin's legendary 108-minute flight became an example of heroism for his successors, including us," said cosmonaut Oleg Novitsky.Vostok took off carrying the 27-year-old son of a carpenter and a dairy farmer from the Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, then part of the Soviet Union.The flight lasted just 108 minutes, the time it took to complete one loop around the Earth.Gagarin landed in a potato field in front of a five-year-old girl, Rita Nurskanova, and her grandmother.In an interview with newspaper Moskovsky Komsomolets for the anniversary, Nurskanova said that after seeing a flash of light and a spacesuit, her grandmother started to pray and wanted to run.Gagarin calmed them down, saying he was human and "came from the sky," she said. Then her grandmother helped him unfasten his helmet.'Name that everyone knows'Gagarin's now-rusty Vostok capsule is on display at Moscow's Museum of Cosmonautics where a new exhibition dedicated to his achievement is set to open on Tuesday.Visitors will be shown documents, photos and personal belongings, some dating back to Gagarin's childhood and school years."This is probably the only surname that everyone knows, from four-year-old children to people over 80," Vyacheslav Klimentov, a historian and the museum's deputy director of research, told AFP.Gagarin's flight remains a symbol of the country's dominance in space during the Soviet era. Four years before Gagarin, the USSR had become the first country to send a satellite into orbit, called Sputnik.But the anniversary also comes at a difficult time for Russia's space industry, which has suffered a number of setbacks in recent years, from corruption scandals to lost spacecraft to an aborted take-off during a manned mission in 2018.Russia's ageing Soyuz rockets are reliable and allow Moscow to remain relevant in the modern space industry, but the country is struggling to innovate and keep up with other key players.In a major blow, Russia last year lost its monopoly for manned ISS launches after reusable rockets from Elon Musk's Space X, carrying NASA astronauts, successfully docked at the space station.In a video message on Monday, the head of Russia's Roscosmos space agency, Dmitry Rogozin, stressed that the USSR sent a man into space despite having lost "colossal resources" during World War II.Rogozin has set a series of ambitious goals for Roscosmos in recent years despite funding cuts to the space programme.He said that Russia was "on the cusp of very important changes" that will see next-generation spacecraft and lunar missions."We believe in our space, in Russian space," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russians-celebrate-60th-anniversary-of-yuri-gagarin-s-spaceflight-101618227782073.html
12-04-2021||World||Syrian air force may have dropped chlorine bomb on town in rebel area in 2018: Chemical arms watchdog||The global chemical weapons watchdog has "reasonable grounds to believe" that Syria's air force dropped a chlorine bomb on a residential neighbourhood in the rebel-controlled Idlib region in February 2018, a report released on Monday said.There was no immediate comment from the Syrian government. Syria and its military ally Russia have consistently denied using chemical weapons during President Bashar al-Assad's decade-old conflict with rebel forces, saying any such attacks were staged by opponents to make Damascus look like the culprit.The new report by the OPCW chemical weapons watchdog's investigative arm said no one was killed when the cylinder of chlorine gas, delivered in a barrel bomb, hit the Al Talil neighbourhood in the city of Saraqib in February 2018.However, a dozen people were treated for symptoms consistent with chemical poisoning, including nausea, eye irritation, shortness of breath, coughing and wheezing, it said.Chlorine is not an internationally banned toxin, but the use of any chemical substance in armed conflict is banned under the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, the implementation of which is overseen by the OPCW watchdog based in The Hague.A crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators by Assad in 2011 mushroomed into civil war, with Russia and Iran supporting his government and the United States, Turkey and some Arab adversaries of Damascus backing some of the many rebel groups.In April 2020, the OPCW's Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) concluded that Syrian warplanes and a helicopter had dropped bombs containing chlorine and sarin nerve gas on a village in Syria's Hama region in March 2017.The latest report by the IIT also implicated Syrian government forces. It concluded that "there were reasonable grounds to believe that at least one cylinder filled with chlorine was dropped from a helicopter of the Syrian Arab Air Forces, belonging to the Tiger Forces."The Tiger Forces are an elite Syrian military unit generally used in offensive operations in the war, which has largely subsided with Assad having wrested back most territory with crucial Russian and Iranian support."All elements indicated the presence of Tiger Forces in the vicinity of Saraqib. They found that a helicopter was just flying above the bombed area at the moment of the gas release," a summary of the OPCW report said.It said that samples collected from the scene were examined and other possible means of chlorine contamination considered, but the OPCW team said nothing was found to indicate that the incident was staged by Assad's adversaries.The team identified individuals believed to be involved in the alleged attack but did not release them.Between 2015 and 2017, a joint United Nations-OPCW team known as the Joint Investigative Mechanism (JIM) found that Syrian government troops had used the nerve agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs on several occasions, while Islamic State militants were found to have used mustard gas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/syrian-air-force-may-have-dropped-chlorine-bomb-on-town-in-rebel-area-in-2018-chemical-arms-watchdog-101618226774335.html
12-04-2021||World||China mulls mixing Covid-19 vaccines to boost efficacy: Official||China’s top disease control official has said Beijing is considering missing Covid-19 vaccines to boost efficacy as the country expands its inoculation programme.Gao Fu, the director of Chinese Centre of Disease Control (CDC) has said that mixing doses is one way to boost efficacy as vaccines “don’t have very high rates of protection”.“Inoculation using vaccines of different technical lines is being considered,” Gao was quoted as saying in agency reports at a conference in the city of Chengdu.Following reports that interpreted Gao’s statement as an admission of the lack of vaccine efficacy, the top expert appeared to backtrack.Gao told Global Times that “…protection rates of all vaccines in the world are sometimes high, and sometimes low”. “How to improve their efficacy is a question that needs to be considered by scientists around the world,” he said.“In this regard, I suggest that we can consider adjusting the vaccination process, such as the number of doses and intervals and adopting sequential vaccination with different types of vaccines,” Gao added.China has developed four domestic vaccines, which are approved for public use; a fifth is being used for smaller-scale emergency inoculation.The country will likely produce 3 billion doses by the end of the year, a health official said over the weekend.China’s top health authority, the national health commission (NHC) on Sunday also urged local authorities to “…halt mandatory vaccination orders as some cities were reportedly found to adopt compulsory measures to meet the country’s goal of vaccinating 560 million people by June”.Mi Feng, the NHC spokesperson was quoted by state media as saying that “some places adopted inappropriate measures, including a ‘one-size-fits-all’ or ‘compulsory for all’ approach, which needs to be corrected”.In one case, officials from the township of Wancheng in south China’s Hainan province had to revoke a controversial inoculation notice which claimed that people who did not take the shot would be banned from public transport and from entering public venues such as restaurants and supermarkets.Until Saturday, China had administered 164.47 million doses, making it the second-fastest country in the world after the US in terms of inoculation numbers.Beijing has also offered its vaccines around the world, shipping millions of doses abroad. Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Thailand and Pakistan, Brazil, Chile, Ukraine, Zimbabwe, and Tunisia are among the countries, which have ordered Chinese vaccines.“Some nations are relying heavily on Chinese vaccines for their covid-19 vaccination programmes. The majority of those administered by the UAE, for example, are made by Sinopharm. Serbia looks set to receive another 500 000 Sinopharm doses, having already taken delivery of 1.5 million. Cambodia and Egypt have received shipments of 300 000 doses at a time,” the British Medical Journal said in a report last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-mulls-mixing-covid-19-vaccines-to-boost-efficacy-official-101618226017586.html

There will be a virtual (portion) of the exercise," he said.The opening ceremonies for BK-21 will be held at the AFP General Headquarters in Camp Aguinaldo, Quezon City on Monday, Sobejana said, adding that 700 American and 1,000 Filipino troops would take part.This year's resumption of the annual BK-21 event, which was called off last year due to the Covid-19 pandemic, follows a phone call between the two countries' defence chiefs on Sunday to "reaffirm their shared commitment to the US-Philippines alliance".In a statement, Pentagon spokesperson John Kirby said that US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin III and his Filipino counterpart Delfin Lorenzana "discussed the situation in the South China Sea, and the recent massing of People's Republic of China maritime militia vessels at Juan Felipe (Whitsun) Reef".The defence and foreign affairs ministries in the Philippines have been up in arms for a fortnight over the presence of 220 fishing boats suspected to be manned by Chinese maritime militia at Whitsun Reef, with statements flying back and forth over the alleged incursion into the Philippines' exclusive economic zone.Secretary of Philippines Foreign Affairs Teddy Locsin Jnr said last Wednesday he was "firing off another diplomatic protest" to China's embassy and would continue objecting "every day until the last one's gone like it should be by now if it is really fishing".Even after such an intensifying row, China hasn't shown any sign of relocation of the vessels. Instead, they have accused the Philippines of using a 2016 international tribunal ruling, which deprived China of certain outcrops of territorial-generating status, the ruling from the permanent court of arbitration effectively punches holes in China's all-encompassing "nine-dash" line that stretches deep into the South China Sea, as reported by the Sydney Morning Herald.The 2016 International Tribunal Ruling denies China of its thousand years of fishing rights in the area.Meanwhile, the United States has reminded China of Washington's treaty obligations to the Philippines in the event of an attack in the waters."An armed attack against the Philippines' armed forces, public vessels or aircraft in the Pacific, including in the South China Sea, will trigger our obligations under the US-Philippines Mutual Defence Treaty," State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters.The Whitsun Reef belongs to the Spratly archipelago, the territory of which is claimed by Brunei, China, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Vietnam.China considers the Spratly archipelago to be its territory, despite the Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling, which said there was no legal basis for China's maritime claims. The arbitration proceeding was initiated by the Philippines in January 2013, Sputnik reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-us-begin-two-week-joint-military-drill-amid-tensions-in-south-china-sea-101618223633827.html
12-04-2021||World||India overtakes Brazil, Bangladesh orders shutdown as surge hits South Asia||India on Monday overtook Brazil as the country with the second-highest number of coronavirus infections and Bangladesh halted international flights and shut offices as a new wave battered South Asia.The region -- home to almost a quarter of the world's population -- has been hit by soaring infection rates in recent weeks.India reported a new daily record of more than 168,000 cases on Monday to take the total toll to 13.5 million cases, above Brazil's 13.48 million.Experts have blamed coronavirus complacency and frustration for the surge.Hundreds of thousands of maskless Hindu devotees thronged the banks of the Ganges River for a ritual bath as part of the Kumbh Mela festival in the holy city of Haridwar.The huge religious festivals and political rallies in poll-bound states have been widely accused as cases grow among the population of 1.3 billion.In neighbouring Bangladesh there was a mad scramble for buses and trains after the government ordered an eight-day closure of all offices and international and domestic transport from Wednesday.Tens of thousands of people flocked to Dhaka's main bus, train and ferry stations to flee the capital ahead of the shutdown.The country of 160 million people has recorded 684,756 cases and 9,739 deaths, but the number of daily cases has increased sevenfold in a month.Hospitals across the nation say they are being overwhelmed by the new cases, and daily deaths have more than doubled."There is no alternative now to this in order to curb the Covid-19 surge," junior minister Farhad Hossain said ahead of the clampdown announcement.Indian authorities have also warned of tougher restrictions unless the public keeps to social distancing and the wearing of masks."The whole country has been complacent -- we allowed social, religious and political congregations," Rajib Dasgupta, a health professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in Delhi, told AFP.India has recorded more than 873,000 cases in the last seven days -- an increase of 70 percent compared to the previous week, according to data compiled by AFP.In comparison, Brazil recorded about 497,000, about 10 percent higher from the previous week.The United States -- the worst-hit country -- reported just under 490,000 cases with a rising trend of nine percent.The spike in India, after daily rises in cases fell below 9,000 in early February, has seen many badly affected states and territories impose restrictions on movement and activities.India's wealthiest state Maharashtra, which has been the main driver of the infection spike, last week imposed a weekend lockdown and night curfew.- 'No alternative' -But Maharashtra has warned that a complete lockdown -- a drastic measure that national and state governments have tried to avoid to protect the already devastated economy -- could be imposed within the next few days as cases continue to rise."The solution is for everyone to stay home for two months and end this (pandemic) once and for all. But the public doesn't listen," said Rohit, 28, a waiter at a popular Mumbai restaurant who moved to the financial hub for work from the northern state of Punjab."Nobody follows the rules in the restaurant... If we tell customers to wear masks, they are rude and disrespectful to us."The chief minister in New Delhi, where a night curfew is in place, said Sunday that two thirds of new Covid-19 patients were younger than 45.He said the government would consider imposing a lockdown if hospital beds start running out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-overtakes-brazil-bangladesh-orders-shutdown-as-surge-hits-south-asia-101618220363074.html
12-04-2021||World||Leaders of Merkel's CDU meet to discuss choice of candidate for next chancellor||Senior members of Germany's Christian Democrats met on Monday to discuss whether to back party chairman Armin Laschet as the conservative candidate for chancellor at a September election, or go for Markus Soeder, chief of their Bavarian sister party.Soeder, the Bavarian premier and leader of the Christian Social Union (CSU), put himself forward on Sunday to run as the conservative candidate in September's federal election and said he would settle the question soon and amicably with his rival, Laschet.Pressure is mounting for a swift decision on who should stand for the two-party bloc as the candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has ruled out standing for a fifth term.Tobias Hans, CDU premier of the tiny western state of Saarland, said ahead of a meeting of the CDU executive committee that he expected the group to back Laschet."It's clear that the CDU Executive Committee stands behind its party leader," Hans said.As the larger partner in the CDU/CSU alliance, the CDU's choice of candidate is likely to be decisive, sources in the alliance say.The CDU's wider federal board meets after the executive committee, or praesidium, and Laschet plans to hold a news conference at around 1 p.m. (1100 GMT). The CSU meets in the afternoon in Munich.The CDU's executive committee in the city state of Berlin, where the party does not hold power, said it backed Soeder."Markus Soeder is the hands-on, successful crisis manager who can lead Germany out of the pandemic and make the country fit for the future," Kai Wegner, chairman of the CDU Berlin, said in a statement.Laschet, 60, is a centrist widely seen as a candidate who would continue Merkel's legacy, but he has clashed with her over coronavirus restrictions. Premier of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, his chaotic handling of the crisis has undermined his popularity.Soeder, 54, is an astute political operator who has sided with Merkel during the pandemic. No CSU leader has become German chancellor.Many conservatives are nervous about contesting the Sept. 26 federal election without Merkel, who has led them to four victories. She has not explicitly backed either candidate but has hinted that she would back the CDU leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-of-merkel-s-cdu-meet-to-discuss-choice-of-candidate-for-next-chancellor-101618218983756.html
12-04-2021||World||NASA aims to land first woman, person of colour on Moon by 2024 under 'Artemis' mission||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the US space agency, has said that in addition to landing the first woman on the Moon, it also plans to send the first person of colour to the lunar surface as part of its ambitious international spaceflight programme, 'Artemis'. The mission, endorsed by the Biden-Harris administration, aims to land the astronauts on the lunar south pole by 2024 and and create sustainable missions to the earth’s natural satellite by 2028.The ambitious mission is being regarded as a forward step for diversity. The 'Artemis' program is so named after the Greek goddess of the Moon and the twin sister of Apollo, the inspiration behind Nasa's first moon landing mission. Last year in November, Nasa had introduced the 18 astronauts who will staff the human spaceflight mission. The group includes nine women and several people of colour, but it is not yet known who the actual "first woman" or the "first person of colour" to touch the lunar surface will be. The initial group of Artemis astronauts also includes Indian American Raja Chari.On Friday, the US administration under president Joe Biden and vice-president Kamala Harris submitted 2022 budget priorities to Congress. Nasa's goal to land the first woman and the first person of colour on the Moon under the Artemis programme "aligns with President Biden's commitment to pursue a comprehensive approach to advancing equity for all," said acting Nasa administrator Steve Jurczyk in an official statement."With Nasa's Space Launch System rocket and Orion spacecraft, as well as U.S. commercial partnerships with the human landing system and Gateway lunar outpost, we will send astronauts to the Moon and provide learning opportunities for future missions," Nasa said in its official statement, adding that the Biden-Harris administration's 2022 discretionary funding request "furthers the robotic exploration of the solar system and the universe". According to Nasa, the Artemis programme will serve as a proving ground for the returning astronauts to the Moon, who will later be sent to Mars. The legacy and science advanced during the Apollo programme will be carried forward to a new century for humans to achieve breakthroughs in space exploration that previously seemed impossible, the US space agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-aims-to-land-first-woman-person-of-colour-on-moon-by-2024-101618214004696.html
12-04-2021||World||'Behave responsibly': UK PM Boris Johnson appeals as Covid-19 lockdown eases||Prime Minister Boris Johnson urged people to continue to "behave responsibly" as shops, hairdressers, restaurants, pubs and gyms reopen their doors on Monday in the latest stage of the coronavirus lockdown easing in England.People were seen queuing overnight outside some clothing stores and also some pubs and restaurants, which are now allowed to serve customers outdoors. Social mixing indoors remains heavily restricted and people are still expected to work from home where possible to minimise the amount they have to commute."I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed," Johnson said."I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress COVID as we push on with our vaccination programme," he said.According to some media reports, the UK PM will be among some of the first in line to get his haircut ahead of a special House of Commons session for tributes to the late Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, who passed away on Friday.Under this stage of the lockdown easing roadmap laid out by the government, public buildings such as libraries and community centres can reopen. Most outdoor attractions including zoos, theme parks, and socially-distanced drive-in performances can reopen.Some smaller outdoor events such as fetes, literary fairs, and fairgrounds can take place; weddings, civil partnership ceremonies, wakes and other commemorative events can take place for up to 15 people.People are not allowed to visit each other's homes and socialising indoors remains prohibited outside of households and support bubbles.The Metropolitan Police also urged people to exercise caution as it prepared to enhance patrols in busy areas of London.“The Met is ready to welcome back people to the streets of London. We will be stepping up our patrols to busy high footfall areas, to look out for everyone’s safety and to disrupt any criminal activity,” said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Jane Connors, the Met Police’s lead for COVID-19 response.“Of course, where we need to take action against those who dangerously flout the rules we will do. While the case rate has declined in London, we have seen the concerning position in northern Europe. It is important that we all stick to the rules so further lockdowns, or restrictions, are avoided,” she said.Businesses have been making extensive preparations for this stage of the lockdown roadmap, including safety glass, queuing systems, social distancing signage, better ventilation, and more frequent cleaning.Monday’s rule changes in England mark the latest easing since the country's third national stay-at-home lockdown began on January 6. Other devolved regions are also similarly gradually easing up, with schools back in full force in Scotland and a stay-at-home lockdown in Wales being lifted.The next significant lockdown roadmap date is May 17, when up to six people from different households could be allowed to socialise indoors.The latest stage comes as more than 32 million people in the UK have now had their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine and of those 7.4 million have also had their second dose. Saturday marked a record day for the National Health Service (NHS) vaccination programme, with a record total of 475,230 second doses administered along with 111,109 first doses.Meanwhile, the daily death toll from the deadly virus continues a downward trend, with seven deaths reported on Sunday – the lowest daily death toll last September.Everyone in England is now also being encouraged to access free, rapid lateral flow tests for themselves and their families to use twice a week, as an added method of monitoring infection rates.Rapid lateral flow tests are said to detect cases with high levels of virus and are very effective in finding people who do not have symptoms but are very likely to transmit the disease. Anyone testing positive is then expected to follow up with a more reliable PCR test.People who have been in contact with someone who has tested positive with COVID-19 can also order a PCR test during their 10-day self-isolation period, whether or not they have symptoms.From Sunday, an updated “Hands, Face, Space, Fresh Air” campaign is also being used to remind the public of the need to use the NHS COVID-19 app to check in to premises, including outdoor hospitality, hairdressers and gyms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/behave-responsibly-uk-pm-boris-johnson-appeals-as-covid-19-lockdown-eases-101618218109171.html
12-04-2021||World||Russian feminist activist on 'Kafkaesque' trial on pornography charges||A Russian court on Monday opened the trial of a feminist activist and artist charged with disseminating pornography after she shared artwork depicting female anatomy online — a case in line with the Kremlin’s conservative stance promoting “traditional family values” that has been widely seen as controversial and elicited international outrage.Yulia Tsvetkova, 27, from the far-eastern city of Komsomolsk-on-Amur, faces up to six years in prison on charges reportedly related to her group on the popular social network VKontakte where colorful, stylized drawings of vaginas were posted. Tsvetkova is not allowed to give details of accusations against her.The first hearing in the Komsomolsk-on-Amur court on Monday comes a year and a half after Tsvetkova was first detained, and eight months after Russian President Vladimir Putin signed constitutional amendments that outlawed same-sex marriage and tasked the government with “preserving traditional family values.”Tsvetkova's lawyer, Irina Ruchko, told reporters after the hearing that Tsvetkova maintains her innocence and that her defense team intends to prove it in court.Tsvetkova ran a children’s theater and was a vocal advocate of feminism and LGBT rights. She founded an online group, called Vagina Monologues, encouraging followers to fight stigma and taboo surrounding the female body, and posted other people’s art in it.Amnesty International last week called the case, which is being heard behind closed doors, “Kafkaesque absurdity” and urged Russian authorities to drop all charges against the activist who was merely “freely expressing her views through art.”Tsvetkova was detained in November 2019 and spent the next four months under house arrest. Her home was raided, as well as her mother's education studio for children.The activist was fined twice for violating Russia’s law against disseminating gay “propaganda” to minors. The court ordered Tsvetkova to pay a fine of 50,000 rubles ($780) in December 2019 for running an LGBT-themed online group, and 75,000 rubles ($1,060) more in July 2020 for a drawing in support of LGBT families. The second fine was later decreased to 50,000 rubles.Many public figures have spoken out in her support, including Russian state TV veteran Vladimir Pozner. Activists across Russia protested her prosecution, artists dedicated performances to her, and an online petition demanding to drop the charges gathered over 250,000 signatures.The European Union's delegation to Russia said in a tweet last week that the bloc “is closely following" the case against Tsvetkova and that “apparently, her persecution is related to her public position as an LGBT activist." The delegation called on Russian authorities to stop the prosecution of the activist.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-feminist-activist-on-kafkaesque-trial-on-pornography-charges-101618217438653.html

12-04-2021||World||Prince Harry arrives back in the UK for Prince Philip funeral||Prince Harry, whose explosive interview alongside his wife Meghan plunged the royal family into its biggest crisis in decades, has arrived back in Britain for Prince Philip's funeral on Saturday.Philip, the husband of Britain's Queen Elizabeth who had been at her side throughout her 69-year reign, died at Windsor Castle on Friday.Harry, Philip's grandson, arrived in London on Sunday from Los Angeles on a British Airways flight, The Sun newspaper reported. Buckingham Palace said Meghan, who is pregnant, will not attend on the advice of her doctor.Harry, sixth in line to the throne, will quarantine in accordance with coronavirus guidelines so that he can attend the ceremonial funeral at Windsor Castle.Interviewed by Oprah Winfrey last month, Meghan said her pleas for help while she felt suicidal were ignored and that an unnamed member of the family had asked how dark their unborn child's skin might be.Harry also bemoaned his family’s reaction to their decision to step back from official duties and move to Los Angeles.In response, Queen Elizabeth said the royals were saddened by the challenging experiences of her grandson and Meghan and promised to privately address revelations about a racist remark about their son.Philip, who died aged 99, is lying at rest in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle.'HUGE VOID'On Saturday, the coffin, covered by Philip's standard, a wreath, his naval cap and his sword, will be moved to the State Entrance of Windsor Castle by a bearer party from the Queen’s Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards.Prince Charles and other members of the royal family will take part in a procession on foot behind the coffin, which will be carried by a specially modified Land Rover that Philip helped to design. The queen, 94, will not walk in the procession.As the coffin reaches St George's Chapel at Windsor, Britain will observe a minute of silence. There will be no public processions, and the funeral will be held entirely within the grounds of Windsor Castle and limited to 30 mourners in accordance with Covid-19 restrictions.A spring snow storm on Monday struck Windsor Castle, where Queen Elizabeth pondered the loss of her husband of 73 years.Her son Prince Andrew said on Sunday the queen was stoical in the face of a loss that she had described as "having left a huge void in her life".Andrew joined his siblings Charles, Anne and Edward in saying they had taken strength from a national outpouring of affection and would rally around their mother in her time of grief.Charles on Saturday paid tribute to his "dear Papa" who had given such devoted service to Queen Elizabeth, to the royal family, to Britain and to the Commonwealth, expressing gratitude for touching praise of his father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-harry-arrives-back-in-the-uk-for-prince-philip-funeral-101618214352722.html

12-04-2021||World||Dubai parts with curtains for restaurants to shield the site of food in Ramadan||Dubai is parting with a longstanding requirement that restaurants be covered by curtains in the daytime during Ramadan to shield the sight of food from people fasting.The move, announced Sunday by the city-state's Economic Development Department, is the latest change aimed at boosting tourism in the autocratically ruled Muslim nation.“Restaurants will be allowed to serve customers without putting in place curtains, dividers or facades as has been the mandatory practice previously,” the state-run WAM news agency said. “The new circular replaces circulars issued in previous years that have required restaurants to block dining areas from the sight of those who are fasting.”The new rules also don't require restaurants to obtain special permits to serve food during sunlight hours as well.During Ramadan, Muslims observing the holy month abstain from food and drink — even water — during the day. Muslims traditionally break the daylong Ramadan fast with their first sips of water and their evening meal, called iftar.Among Gulf Arab states, home to large, non-Muslim expatriate populations, most require curtains be put up to block the sight of food from those fasting. Eating and drinking in public also could bring fines and legal trouble.Dubai, one of the seven sheikhdoms in the United Arab Emirates, long has been a tourism destination for those wanting beaches, shopping and partying in this skyscraper-studded city. However, Ramadan always represented a slower period due to its restrictions.In recent years, hoping to boost tourism as Ramadan will be marked during its crucial winter months, Dubai has started to change. In 2016, Dubai loosened rules prohibiting daytime alcohol sales.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-parts-with-curtains-for-restaurants-to-shield-the-site-of-food-in-ramadan-101618208405632.html
12-04-2021||World||Canada’s Sikh community cancels festivities due to resurgence in Covid-19 cases||As Canada tightens curbs to control a fresh surge in Covid-19 infections, the country’s Sikh community has cancelled several events that were lined up to mark Vaisakhi, the Sikh New Year festival, as well as the traditional Khalsa Day celebrations.Community groups had to scramble to call off gatherings last year when the coronavirus pandemic first struck during spring. After the situation somewhat improved, a fresh resurgence of cases in Canada one year into the pandemic has now forced them to cancel plans to celebrate this year’s festive season.Kultar Singh Gill, chair of the Ontario Sikh and Gurdwara Council (OSGC), has said there’s no question of organising the annual Khalsa Day parade in Toronto, which attracts tens of thousands of participants at the venue in the city’s downtown, and has featured political leaders like Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, leaders of opposition parties and provincial leaders.Instead, they wanted to hold a motorcycle rally along the route of the parade on April 25, but those plans had to be cancelled because the province of Ontario has enforced stay-at-home orders. Gill said, “It has to be safety first and everybody understands that.” He was hopeful that Covid-19 cases are expected to subside gradually, so smaller events can be slotted for May.For now, he said, gurdwaras will mostly hold events virtually as provincial rules permit 15% in-person capacity at indoor events.That is also the case with Khalsa Diwan Society in Vancouver, which organises an annual parade that has also been attended by Trudeau. The society’s treasurer Kuldip Thandi said there will be no Vaisakhi celebrations this year.According to provincial authorities in British Columbia, “Indoor in-person religious gatherings and worship services of any size are prohibited.”Annually, April is observed as Sikh heritage month across Canada. The Nishan sahib, the pennant of the symbol of the faith, has been raised at some municipalities in Ontario, including Brampton. Local community leader Sukhminder Singh Hansra said it will also be raised at Toronto’s City Hall on April 19. It was raised at the beginning of the month at the city hall in Brampton in the Greater Toronto Area. Hansra said the community was planning a car rally to celebrate the month and the religious festivities associated with it, but it is no longer possible due to stay-at-home orders. Canada reported 7,619 new Covid-19 cases on Sunday, an increase of 68% over the last 14 days, taking the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 1,060,162, including 23,315 fatalities. Pubic health authorities have been cautioning against large gatherings, as Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam said on Sunday, “Several jurisdictions have highlighted social gatherings as an important driver for spread.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-sikh-community-cancels-festivities-due-to-resurgence-in-covid-19-cases-101618208916437.html

There are reports of extrajudicial internment and forced labour camps. Family members of Canadian citizens with Chinese citizenship have been detained.”Canada also cautioned those who undertake journalism or research in China, particularly in Xinjiang or Tibet. “You should be particularly vigilant if researching or reporting on subjects critical of or sensitive to the government and in areas such as Tibet or Xinjiang,” says the advisory, pointing to instances of arrests of foreign journalists on grounds of national security violations.In general, Canada asked its citizens to exercise a high degree of caution if travelling to China “due to the risk of arbitrary enforcement of local laws”.In July last year, Canada sent out an advisory with regard to Hong Kong, warning that Canadians going there “may be at increased risk of arbitrary detention on national security grounds and possible extradition to mainland China”.Relations between Canada and China turned sour since the detention of Meng Wanzhou, CFO of Chinese telecom giant Huawei, in Vancouver in 2018. She was detained following an extradition request from the US for allegedly trying to bypass sanctions imposed on Iran.Days after her arrest, Chinese officials detained two Canadian nationals, Michael Spavor and Michael Korvig, who are in jail in what Canada has called “hostage diplomacy”. The two Michaels have been charged with spying and ferrying state secrets outside China.More recently, on February 22 this year, Canada’s House of Commons passed a resolution defining Chinese actions in Xinjiang as “genocide”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/avoid-travelling-to-china-s-xinjiang-canada-warns-its-citizens-101618206936095.html
12-04-2021||World||Minneapolis Police shoot dead Black man, 16km from where George Floyd was killed||A Black man in suburban Minnesota was fatally shot by the Minneapolis Police at a Brooklyn Center traffic stop on Sunday, sparking subsequent 'Black Lives Matter' protests and further fanning tensions over police violence across the United States of America. The victim was identified by his family as 20-year-old Daunte Wright. A report by the Associated Press said that Wright was shot by the police before getting back into his car and driving away, then crashing the vehicle several blocks away. He was later pronounced dead, Wright's kin said.The incident took place 10 miles (16 km) from where George Floyd was killed during an arrest in Minneapolis last May, Reuters reported, adding that angry crowds protested outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department building on Sunday night, while officers in riot gear fired rubber bullets and lobbed flash bangs at protesters and let off clouds of chemical irritants.America is still recuperating with the death of George Floyd, who was killed last year after Derek Chauvin, one of the police officers who arrived on the scene, knelt on Floyd's neck for over nine minutes. After his death, protests against police brutality, especially towards Black people, quickly spread across the United States and internationally. Tensions are running high in Minneapolis, already on edge and midway through the ongoing trial of Derek Chauvin, who is charged with murder and manslaughter, in George Floyd’s death. In the hours after the shooting on Sunday, protesters clashed with police in riot gear, breaking a cruiser’s windshield as police fired nonlethal rounds, the Minneapolis Star Tribune reported.Minnesota Governor Tim Walz said in a statement that he was monitoring the unrest in Brooklyn Center, a suburb of Minneapolis, as "our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement."“I am closely monitoring the situation in Brooklyn Center. Gwen and I are praying for Daunte Wright’s family as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement,” Governor Tim Walz said in a statement posted late Sunday night on Twitter.I am closely monitoring the situation in Brooklyn Center. Gwen and I are praying for Daunte Wright’s family as our state mourns another life of a Black man taken by law enforcement.Officials from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension said the agency was on the scene, as per the AP report. Citing a statement from the Brooklyn Center Police, the agency reported that officers stopped an individual shortly before 2pm on Sunday after determining the driver had an outstanding warrant. Police said when they tried to arrest the driver, the driver reentered the vehicle and drove away. An officer fired at the vehicle, striking the driver. Police said the vehicle traveled several blocks before striking another vehicle. Police did not identify the driver who was shot but said the Hennepin County Medical Examiner’s Office will release the person’s name following a preliminary autopsy and family notification. A female passenger sustained non-life threatening injuries during the crash.Meanwhile, the Wrights demanded answers from police. Katie Wright, Daunte's mother, tearfully pleaded for more information regarding the incident and for her son’s body to be moved from the street. She told reporters at the scene, according to Reuters, that she received a call from her son on Sunday afternoon telling her that police had pulled him over for having air fresheners dangling from his rear-view mirror, illegal in Minnesota. She could hear police tell her son to get out the vehicle, she said.Public mourners included Wright's family and friends who gathered, wept and consoled each other alongside protesters who carried “Black Lives Matter” flags, jumped atop police cars, confronted officers and walked peacefully in columns with their hands help up. On one street, written in multi-colored chalk: “Justice for Daunte Wright.”The incident, which sparked protests late into Sunday night, happened with Minneapolis Brooklyn Center is a city with a population of about 30,000 people located on the northwest border of Minneapolis.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-police-shoot-dead-black-man-16km-from-where-george-floyd-was-killed-101618203661077.html
12-04-2021||World||Outrage over US Navy operation in India’s EEZ decades too late||The outrage over US Navy’s intrusion in India’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) near Lakshadweep last week was decades too late.US warships have been conducting “operational assertion”, as these intrusive sail-throughs are called, to express America’s refusal to recognise certain maritime claims by India, at least since 1985, under a freedom of navigation programme it launched in 1979, according to defence department reports.India requires prior notice from foreign warships to enter its territorial sea, which extends its sovereignty 12 nautical miles from the baseline and requires prior permission for military exercises and manoeuvres in its exclusive economic zone, which extends it exclusive rights to economic resources for 200 nautical miles as per international maritime norms.The 7th Fleet, which is the largest in US Navy with an area of responsibility in the Western Pacific and Indian Oceans, sparked outrage in India last week with a statement saying one of its warships, USS John Paul Jones, “asserted navigational rights and freedoms” about 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep islands. The ship was well inside India’s EEZ and was required by India to obtain prior permission, which the US did not.The external affairs ministry said in a statement India’s “stated position on the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea is that the convention does not authorise other states to carry out in the exclusive economic zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state”.The US says it does not recognise India’s claims pertaining to both territorial sea jurisdiction and the EEZ. And it conducted “operational assertions” in India’s territorial sea, challenging India’s claims, for the first time in 1985, and continued through to 1989, and then from 1991 through 1994, and then in 1996, 1997, 1999, 2001, 2007, and 2011, according to the maritime claims reference manual issued by the defence department’s representative for ocean policy affairs.Disregarding India’s requirement of prior notice for military exercises in its EEZ, the report said the US conducted “operational assertions” in 1999, 2001, and from 2008 through to 2017 and then in 2019 - multiple times a year in many of them - according to US defence department reports.No specific reason or context was mentioned for any of these operational assertions individually. They were all covered by a generic “US does not recognise this claim”.The US has been conducting these operational assertions under the US Freedom of Navigation (FON) Programme launched in 1979 to “safeguard lawful commerce and the global mobility of US forces”, said the annual freedom of navigation report that the Pentagon sent to the Congress in 2020.The outrage, some experts argued, was not so much about the intrusion as it was about the aggressive tone of the 7th Fleet. “US pointedly says its navy entered India’s EEZ, noted India requires prior consent but not sought, and termed India’s excessive maritime claims as contrary to international law,” former foreign secretary Kanwal Sibal noted in a tweet. “Why aggressive tone now when issue old and not aired publicly? Result: Indian official reaction and tweet outpourings.” The US defines “excessive maritime claims” as “attempts by coastal states to unlawfully restrict the freedom of navigation, overflight and other lawful uses of the sea. These claims are made through laws, regulations or other pronouncements that are inconsistent with international law as reflected in the law of the sea convention. If left unchallenged, excessive maritime claims could infringe the freedom of the seas entitled to all nations”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/outrage-over-us-navy-operation-in-india-s-eez-decades-too-late-101618204956355.html
12-04-2021||World||Japan starts vaccinating people aged 65 and above as fourth Covid-19 wave looms||Japan began Covid-19 vaccinations for its sizable elderly population on Monday, with imported doses still in short supply and the pace unlikely to stop a fourth wave of infection.Shots for people aged 65 and above began at some 120 sites across the country, using Pfizer Inc's vaccine made in Europe and delivered to the regions in the past week.Just 2,810 people in Tokyo are expected to get a shot from the first batch, while most regions will receive 1,000 doses or fewer, according to a health ministry schedule. Japan has a rapidly ageing population totalling 126 million.Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato reiterated on Monday the government's projection that it can secure enough vaccines for Japan's 36 million people over the age of 65 by the end of June."If imports from the EU go smoothly, I understand the country is expected to distribute vaccines that can be administered to all of the elderly," Kato said.Tokyo also began on Monday a month-long period of quasi-emergency measures to blunt a fourth wave of contagion driven by virulent mutant strains and with the planned start of the Summer Olympics just over 100 days away.Japan was among the last major economies to begin Covid-19 inoculations when it started in mid-February. Taro Kono, the minister in charge of vaccines, has defended the pace, saying local governments wanted time to prepare."After tomorrow, we will inform the prefectures how much we can distribute, and they will decide how much to allocate to each municipality," Kono said on national broadcaster NHK on Sunday.Japan is dependent on Pfizer's vaccine as the only Covid-19 shot approved by domestic regulators. The pace of shots is likely to accelerate in May as a greater number of imports from the company's facilities in Europe is due to arrive.About 1.1 million people in Japan, mostly frontline healthcare workers, have gotten at least one dose of the Pfizer vaccine's two-shot regimen so far. Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is among some 90 bureaucrats who were vaccinated ahead of a meeting with United States President Joe Biden this month.Shots for the general populace are not likely to be available until the late summer or even winter, too late to stem a resurgence of cases that appears to be focused on people in their 30s and 40s, according to Haruka Sakamoto, a physician and researcher at Keio University in Tokyo."The currently available vaccination cannot prevent the fourth wave of the pandemic," she said. "I think the younger generation is now going to be more greatly affected compared to the previous waves."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-starts-vaccinating-people-aged-65-and-above-as-fourth-covid-19-wave-looms-101618202252058.html
12-04-2021||World||China considers mixing Covid-19 vaccines to boost protection rate||China's top disease control official has said the country is formally considering mixing COVID-19 vaccines as a way of further boosting vaccine efficacy.Available data shows Chinese vaccines lag behind others including Pfizer and Moderna in terms of efficacy, but require less stringent temperature controls during storage.Giving people doses of different vaccines is one way to improve vaccines that "don't have very high rates of protection", Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said on Saturday, without specifying whether he was referring to foreign or domestic vaccines"Inoculation using vaccines of different technical lines is being considered," Gao told a conference in the Chinese city of Chengdu.Gao said that taking steps to "optimise" the vaccine process including changing the number of doses and the length of time between doses was a "definite" solution to efficacy issues.Two injections of a vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech, when given shorter than three weeks apart, was 49.1% effective based on data from a Phase III trial in Brazil, below the 50% threshold set by World Health Organization, according to a paper published by Brazilian researchers on Sunday ahead of peer review.But data from a small subgroup showed that the efficacy rate increased to 62.3% when the doses were given at intervals of three weeks and longer. The overall efficacy rate for the vaccine was slightly above 50% in the trial.China has developed four domestic vaccines approved for public use and a fifth for smaller-scale emergency use. An official said on Saturday that the country will likely produce 3 billion doses by the end of the year.No detailed efficacy data has been released on vaccines made by China's Sinopharm. It has said two vaccines developed by its units are 79.4% and 72.5% effective respectively, based on interim results.Both vaccine makers have presented data on their COVID-19 vaccines indicating levels of efficacy in line with those required by WHO, a WHO panel said in March.China has shipped millions of its vaccines abroad, and officials and state media have fiercely defended the shots while calling into question the safety and logistics capabilities of other vaccines."The global vaccine protection rate test data are both high and low," Gao told state tabloid Global Times on Sunday."How to improve the protection rate of vaccines is a problem that requires global scientists to consider," Gao said, adding that mixing vaccines and adjusting immunisation methods are solutions that he had proposed.Gao also rejected claims by some media reports that he said Chinese COVID-19 vaccines have a low protection rate, telling Global Times that it was "a complete misunderstanding."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-considers-mixing-covid-19-vaccines-to-boost-protection-rate-101618200725056.html
12-04-2021||World||NASA shares images of electric blue dunes on Mars||The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) recently shared an image of Mars in which the surface of the Red Plant, which looks like it is electric blue in colour, is visible.The image, shared by the space agency with the title 'Blue Dunes on the Red Planet', combines shots taken between December 2002 and November 2004 by the Thermal Emission Imaging System instrument on the Mars Odyssey orbiter.Two types of dunes are seen in the image. One set is yellowish in colour and signifies warmer climates, and the other set is bluish or pale that represents colder climates."In this false-color image, areas with cooler temperatures are recorded in bluer tints, while warmer features are depicted in yellows and oranges. Thus, the dark, sun-warmed dunes glow with a golden color. This image covers an area 19 miles (30 kilometers) wide," NASA said.The set of images, clicked on the Red Planet at 80.3 degrees north latitude, 172.1 degrees east longitude, were released to mark the 20th anniversary of Odyssey, the longest-working Mars spacecraft in history.NASA had shared images of blue Martian dunes earlier in 2018 and earlier this year, the agency posted some breathtaking images of how the blue planet looks from space.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-shares-images-of-electric-blue-dunes-on-mars-101618197287564.html
12-04-2021||World||Russia, China protecting own interests in Myanmar by blocking arms embargo: EU||EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Sunday it was "no surprise" that Moscow and Beijing were blocking efforts at the UN Security Council to impose an arms embargo as the international efforts to halt the violence in Myanmar is yet to yield results."The world is horrified by the bloody military coup in Myanmar, with reports of more than 80 people killed in Bago last Friday. We are pursuing a robust diplomatic initiative in close coordination with like-minded partners. However, geopolitical competition in Myanmar makes it difficult to find common ground, to halt the violence and ensure a return to democracy," Borell wrote in a blog post.The bloc's foreign policy chief further stated that even in the face of "such brutality", geopolitics divides the international community and hampers a coordinated response.Borell noted that Myanmar's location makes it a strategic point for China's Belt and Road Initiative (offering deep-sea access to the Indian Ocean), but also to India's own corridor to the South China Sea. Other countries like Japan, South Korea and Singapore also have strong economic interests in Myanmar. And Russia is the country's second supplier of weapons, after China."Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Russia and China are blocking the attempts of the UN Security Council, for example, to impose an arms embargo. China is keen to protect its strategic interests in the country and has called the coup 'a major government reshuffle', while Russia insists that it is a purely 'domestic matter'," he said.He also stated that the situation in the country is complicated by Myanmar's highly diverse and complex ethnic fabric: there are 135 recognised ethnicities within its borders and some, like the Rohingya, are not even recognised. The conflict between ethnic minorities and the central government has been going on since independence, he pointed out.Borell called on the bloc to play an active role adding that the bloc "cannot accept that a democratically-elected government is overthrown and replaced by military rule."Despite the bloc, the US and the UK have imposed sanctions on the junta, he said that "Sanctions in itself are not a policy" and called for a "need to create a shared diplomatic platform to kick-start a process of dialogue aimed at restoring democracy in Myanmar, in accordance with the clear will of its brave people."Over 80 people were killed in Myanmar's central town of Bago on Friday as military and police forces continue their crackdown against protestors using heavy weapons, NHK reported citing a human rights group.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group and Myanmar Now news outlet said on Saturday that 82 people were killed on Friday during the protest against the February 1 military coup in the country.Military and police forces began attacks on the protestors early Friday morning, using guns, bombs, and other heavy weapons, causing many casualties. The human rights group says that as of Saturday, 701 people have died since the military coup.On February 1, Myanmar's military overthrew the civilian government and declared a year-long state of emergency. The coup triggered mass protests met by the deadly violence, resulting in hundreds of people having been killed since then.Protests broke out in Myanmar against the coup. People hit the streets in various streets, demanding the restoration of civilian government. In response, the security forces have used rubber bullets and live rounds to break up rallies and detained thousands of activists.International powers have voiced anger and dismay at the junta's brutal approach and imposed sanctions on key officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-china-protecting-own-interests-in-myanmar-by-blocking-arms-embargo-eu-101618195113323.html
12-04-2021||World||Probe ordered after US police pepper-spray Black soldier||The governor of the US state of Virginia vowed a full investigation Sunday after footage emerged of two police officers detaining a Black army officer at gunpoint and pepper-spraying him in the face.Lieutenant Caron Nazario, who is Black and Latino, repeatedly asked what he had done wrong and said, "This is really messed up," as the officers holding guns demanded he get out of his car.The police accused him of not cooperating.Nazario, wearing his military uniform, was driving a newly bought SUV when the officers ordered him to pull over because he did not have permanent license plates, news reports said.Virginia governor Ralph Northam said in a statement he had instructed police to conduct an "independent investigation" into the incident, which he said was "disturbing and angered me."Police in the United States have been hit with multiple allegations of racism and misconduct, including over the death of a Black man in Minneapolis last year in a case that attracted international outrage.A police officer is currently on trial over George Floyd's death, facing charges of manslaughter and murder.The Washington Post said that Nazario, a health administration officer with the Virginia National Guard, was driving home on December 5 when he was pulled over.Footage from the officers' bodycams and Nazario's phone spread rapidly over the weekend after Nazario filed a lawsuit on April 2 seeking $1 million in damages.He was released without charge after the incident.The lawsuit reportedly claims police threatened to end his military career if he spoke out about the officers' conduct."We must keep working to ensure Virginians are safe during interactions with police, the enforcement of laws is fair and equitable, and people are held accountable," Northam said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/probe-ordered-after-us-police-pepper-spray-black-soldier-101618193062139.html
12-04-2021||World||US issues warning to China; says action against Taiwan would be 'serious mistake'||US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Sunday (local time) issued a warning to China stating it would be a "serious mistake" for anyone to attempt to change Taiwan's "status quo" amid heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing over the island country's sovereignty."What we have seen and what is a real concern to us is increasingly aggressive actions by the government in Beijing, directed at Taiwan, raising tensions in the straits. And we have a commitment to Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act, a bipartisan commitment that's existed for many, many years, to make sure that Taiwan has the ability to defend itself and to make sure that we're sustaining peace and security in the Western Pacific. We stand behind those commitments," Blinken said in an interview with NBC News, according to a transcript provided by the US Department of State."I can tell you is it would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change the existing status quo by force," the top US diplomat added.When pressed on whether Washington's "commitments" included military action, Blinken responded that he would not be discussing "hypotheticals" and instead stated the US would stand by its commitment to allow Taiwan to defend itself."All I can tell you is we have a serious commitment to Taiwan being able to defend itself. We have a serious commitment to peace and security in the Western Pacific. And in that context, it would be a serious mistake for anyone to try to change that status quo by force," he said.In what could be called another massive blow to China, the United States last week issued new guidelines that encourage exchanges with Taiwanese counterparts, State Department spokesperson Ned Price.According to South China Morning Post, the guidelines are a move made to bring Washington into compliance with a law signed by former President Donald Trump.The announcement comes amid heightened tensions between the US and China over Taiwan.White House spokesperson Jen Psaki told reporters on Friday that Washington has been watching China's aggressive actions against Taiwan very closely and raising concerns about it both publicly and privately."We have been clear publicly and privately expressing our concern, our growing concerns about China's aggression towards Taiwan. China is taking increasingly coercive action to undercut democracy in Taiwan," Psaki said during the briefing.US lawmakers plan to introduce legislation next week that would put additional sanctions on Chinese officials; build closer US relations with Taiwan and place more checks on Beijing's military operations and territorial claims, among other measures intended to counter China and the threat it poses on human rights and maritime security.Beijing claims full sovereignty over Taiwan, a democracy of almost 24 million people located off the southeastern coast of mainland China, despite the fact that the two sides have been governed separately for more than seven decades.Taipei, on the other hand, has countered the Chinese aggression by increasing strategic ties with democracies including the US, which has been repeatedly opposed by Beijing. China has threatened that "Taiwan's independence" means war.Taiwan returned to the forefront of US-China tensions last weekend when Beijing sent more than two dozen warplanes into the self-governing island's air defence identification zone in a 48-hour period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-issues-warning-to-china-says-action-against-taiwan-would-be-serious-mistake-101618190870635.html
12-04-2021||World||'Forced confession' victims urge Chinese TV channels ban||Thirteen people who describe themselves as "victims of forced confessions broadcast on Chinese television" are urging European satellite operator Eutelsat to reconsider carrying Chinese channels CGTN and CCTV4.The letter published by human rights watchdog Safeguard Defenders details a list of violations that the signatories say China is guilty of using to extort confessions from them and "refuse the right to a fair trial"."We are asking you... to determine whether television providers in democratic societies ought to continue to be morally complicit in the broadcast of information that is intentionally twisted and obtained through torture," the group said."We are only a dozen victims able to speak out.... Many other victims are in prison. A few have been executed."The victims have no way of demanding reparations. The only way to stop this is for television regulators to investigate and take measures," the group added.The letter notes Australian public broadcaster SBS stopped using content from Chinese state-run television in March pending a review of human rights concerns.The UK also fined CGTN for partiality and violation of privacy and removed it from the airwaves, a ban that pushed the channel to set up shop in France.French audiovisual regulator CSA determined in March that CGTN met the technical criteria necessary for broadcasting but just this week Safeguard Defenders submitted two complaints against the channel.One cited an allegedly coerced interview with a Uyghur child and the other was a defamation complaint from German researcher Adrian Zenz, whose reports on the treatment of Uyghurs in China's western Xinjiang region have drawn rebukes from Beijing.The signatories are from China and other countries, including Chinese human rights lawyers Bao Longjun and Jiang Tianyong who have been targeted by authorities in their country.Simon Cheng, a former British consulate staffer in Hong Kong, who was granted asylum in the UK after allegedly being tortured by Chinese secret police also signed the letter.Also giving support is Swedish activist and Safeguard Defenders co-founder Peter Dahlin, who spent three weeks in jail in 2016 before being expelled from the country as a national security threat.Angela Gui, daughter of Gui Minhai who published in Hong Kong until he was sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2020, signed on behalf of her father.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/forced-confession-victims-urge-chinese-tv-channels-ban-101618186922878.html
12-04-2021||World||Top US diplomat criticizes China, says 'need to get to the bottom' of Covid-19 origin||China's failure to provide access to global health experts made the Covid-19 pandemic worse than it had to be, U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken said on Sunday, and it was important to "get to the bottom" of the origin of the novel coronavirus.The top U.S. diplomat's sharp words underscored criticism from other members of the Biden administration over Beijing's lack of transparency in the crucial early days of the pandemic.China did not give access to international experts or share information in real time to provide true transparency, Blinken said in an interview with NBC's "Meet the Press."As a result, the virus "got out of hand faster and with, I think, much more egregious results than it might otherwise," Blinken said.The World Health Organization director-general, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said on March 30 that data was withheld from WHO investigators who traveled to China to research the origins of the pandemic.A WHO report, written jointly with Chinese scientists, released at the time said the virus had probably been transmitted from bats to humans through another animal, and that a lab leak was "extremely unlikely" as a cause.Tedros said the issue required further investigation.The events highlight why there needs to be a stronger global health security system to ensure this doesn't happen again, Blinken said. Reforms must include a commitment to transparency, information sharing and access for experts "and China has to play a part in that," he said.Blinken said it was important to reach a more conclusive accounting of how the pandemic began."We need to do that precisely so we fully understand what happened, in order to have the best shot possible preventing it from happening again," he said. "That's why we need to get to the bottom of this." When the WHO report was issued in March, the United States, the European Union and other Western countries called for China to give "full access" to independent experts to all data about the original outbreak in late 2019.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-diplomat-criticizes-china-says-need-to-get-to-the-bottom-of-covid-19-origin-101618185853332.html

It did not appear that sensitive user information such as credit card numbers were among the leaked info. But the information could be used in phishing attempts to get users to hand over that more sensitive info.Last week, Cyber News reported on another data breach from a social platform: it found that personal data for 500 million LinkedIn users had been scraped and posted online. The Microsoft-owned company said that no private member account data from LinkedIn was included in the leak.As reported by The Verge, that news came just a couple of days after it was discovered that personal data for some 533 million Facebook users also was leaked online for free. The Facebook leak reportedly included users' phone numbers, birthdates, locations, email addresses, and full names.The social audio app Clubhouse had a monster first year- despite being invite-only and available only on iOS devices- seeing more than 10 million downloads.Twitter, LinkedIn, Discord, Spotify, and Slack have all launched or are working on competing for social audio platforms, and Facebook reportedly has one in the works as well.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/personal-info-for-1-3-million-clubhouse-users-leaked-online-report-101618185519451.html
12-04-2021||World||Fed's Powell sees US boom ahead, with Covid-19 still a risk||The US economy is poised for an extended period of strong growth and hiring, the chair of the Federal Reserve said in an interview broadcast Sunday, though the coronavirus still poses some risk.Chair Jerome Powell, speaking to CBS' “60 Minutes," also said that he doesn't expect to raise the Fed's benchmark interest rate, currently pegged at nearly zero, this year. And he downplayed the risk of higher inflation stemming from sharp increases in government spending and expanding budget deficits.“We feel like we’re at a place where the economy’s about to start growing much more quickly and job creation coming in much more quickly,” Powell said. “This growth that we’re expecting in the second half of this year is going to be very strong. And job creation, I would expect to be very strong.”In the wide-ranging interview, Powell said that the Fed is closely studying the development of a digital dollar, but hasn't yet made a decision on whether to proceed. Powell said last month that the central bank wouldn't issue a digital currency without approval from Congress.Powell noted that roughly a million jobs were added in March, when revisions to jobs data in January and February are included. The unemployment rate fell to 6% from 6.2%.“We would like to see a string of months like that,” he said. “That is certainly in the range of possibility.”Still, there are about 8.4 million fewer jobs than before the pandemic, and Powell acknowledged that he sees a homeless encampment near the Fed's headquarters in Washington.“There’s a lot of suffering out there still. And I think it’s important that, just as a country, we stay and help those people,” he said. “The economy that we’re going back to is going to be different from the one that we had.”Powell also said the primary risk to the economy remains the pandemic and a breakdown in precautions that Americans have largely taken for the past year.The principal risk ”is that we will reopen too quickly, people will too quickly return to their old practices, and we’ll see another spike in cases,” he said. “The economy should move ahead. But it can move ahead more quickly to the extent we keep the spread of Covid under control.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/feds-powell-sees-us-boom-ahead-with-covid-19-still-a-risk-101618184570338.html
12-04-2021||World||Biden team eyes potential threat from China’s digital yuan plans||The Biden administration is stepping up scrutiny of China’s plans for a digital yuan, with some officials concerned the move could kick off a long-term bid to topple the dollar as the world’s dominant reserve currency, according to people familiar with the matter.Now that China’s digital-currency efforts are gathering momentum, officials at the Treasury, State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council are bolstering their efforts to understand the potential implications, the people said.American officials are less worried about an immediate challenge to the current structure of the global financial system, but are eager to understand how the digital yuan will be distributed, and whether it could also be used to work around U.S. sanctions, the people said on the condition of anonymity.A Treasury spokeswoman declined to comment. A National Security Council spokeswoman did not reply to a request for comment.The People’s Bank of China has rolled out trial issuance of a digital yuan in cities across the country, putting it on track to be the first major central bank to issue a virtual currency. A broader roll-out is expected for the Winter Olympics in Beijing next February, giving the effort international exposure.Many key details of the digital yuan are still in flux, including specifics on how it would be distributed. China’s recent establishment of a joint venture with SWIFT, the messaging nexus through which most cross-border settlements pass through today, suggests it is possible a digital yuan could work within the current financial architecture rather than outside of it.U.S. officials are reassured that China’s intentions aren’t to use the digital yuan to evade American sanctions, according to people familiar with the matter. The dollar’s current dominance in cross-border transactions gives the U.S. Treasury the power to cut off much of a business or even a country’s access to the global financial system.China’s officials have said the main intentions of the digital yuan are to replace banknotes and coins, to reduce the incentive to use cryptocurrencies and to complement the current private-sector run electronic payments system -- dominated by Ant Group Co.’s Alipay and Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat Pay. The PBOC has been working for years on the digital yuan, also called the e-CNY, having set up a specialist research team in 2014.​​“To provide a backup or redundancy for the retail payment system, the central bank has to step up” and provide digital-currency services, Mu Changchun, the director of the PBOC’s digital-currency research institute, said at an event last month.The PBOC is also examining the potential for using the digital yuan in cross-border payments, launching a project studying the issue with a unit of the Bank for International Settlements along with the United Arab Emirates, Thailand and Hong Kong’s monetary authority.The Biden administration isn’t currently planning to take any action to counter longer-term threats from China’s digital currency, the people familiar with the discussions said. However, China’s plans have given renewed impetus to efforts to consider the creation of a digital dollar, they said.Members of Congress have also been increasingly interested in a digital dollar, aware of China’s moves, and asked Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen about the issue in hearings earlier this year.Powell said in February the Fed was looking “very carefully” at a digital dollar. “We don’t need to be the first. We need to get it right.”Yellen has signaled interest in research into the viability of a digital dollar, a shift from a lack of enthusiasm under her predecessor, Steven Mnuchin.“It makes sense for central banks to be looking at” issuing sovereign digital currencies, she said at a virtual conference in February. Yellen said a digital version of the dollar could help address hurdles to financial inclusion in the U.S. among low-income households.A recent report from the U.S. Director of National Intelligence said the extent of the threat of any foreign digital currency to the dollar’s centrality in the global financial system “will depend on the regulatory rules that are established.”China’s currency makes up little more than 2% of global foreign exchange reserves compared with nearly 60% for the U.S. dollar. Policy decisions, rather than technical developments, will also be necessary to push forward yuan internationalization, as China maintains a strict regime of capital controls.China’s financial system is too “fragile and weak” to pose a real threat to the dollar’s status as the world’s reserve currency, according to Mark Sobel, U.S. chairman for the Official Monetary and Financial Institutions Forum.“At the end of the the day the markets have more confidence in the Fed” than China’s central bank, said Sobel, a former senior U.S. Treasury official for international matters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-team-eyes-potential-threat-from-china-s-digital-yuan-plans-101618184054832.html

12-04-2021||World||Brazil: 1,803 Covid-19 deaths; China's vaccine 50.7% effective against variant||Brazil on Sunday recorded 1,803 new Covid-19 deaths, as a large study found that a Chinese vaccine that has become the linchpin in the country's vaccination campaign is 50.7% effective against the infectious new homegrown variant known as P1.Brazil, which has in recent weeks become the global epicenter of the coronavirus pandemic, saw over 37,000 new cases, the Health Ministry said on Sunday. With over 353,000 deaths, Latin America's biggest country has the second highest coronavirus death toll in the world, after the United States.The outbreak has recently reached its most severe phase due to a lack of federal restrictions, a patchy vaccine rollout and the P1 variant.Sao Paulo's Butantan biomedical institute, which tested and is now producing the CoronaVac vaccine developed by China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd, said on Sunday a study it conducted found the shot had an efficacy rate of 50.7% against the P1 variant, and a less widespread strain known as P2.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, a China hawk and vaccine skeptic who has come under fire for his handling of the outbreak, initially said his government would not buy the Sinovac shot, but later made a U-turn as his government struggled to secure supplies. Since then, the Chinese shot has become the most widely administered one in the country.Butantan said that if the second dose is delayed by more than two weeks, the efficacy rises to 62.3%. The vaccine has an efficacy of between 83.7% and 100% at preventing those infected from requiring medical assistance, it said.The study, which it said had been sent to the medical journal The Lancet for publication, tested 12,400 volunteers across Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-1-803-covid-19-deaths-china-s-vaccine-50-7-effective-against-variant-101618180759233.html
12-04-2021||World||'The right path': Chile defends Sinovac use amid fresh efficacy questions||Chilean authorities on Sunday backed the country's widespread use of the Covid-19 vaccine manufactured by Chinese firm Sinovac after China's top disease official appeared to make conflicting statements about its efficacy.Gao Fu, the director of the Chinese Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told a conference in the Chinese city of Chengdu on Saturday that the country was considering mixing Covid-19 vaccines since currently available vaccines "don't have very high rates of protection."He later said in an interview with state media that his comments were "completely misunderstood."Available data shows Chinese vaccines lag behind others including Pfizer and Moderna in terms of efficacy, but require less stringent temperature controls during storage.The Covid-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac was found to be just over 50% effective in reducing infection in Brazilian clinical trials. A real-world study of vaccination and contagion data by the University of Chile suggested last week the vaccine was 54% effective in reducing infection.Chile paid $3.5 million to host a clinical trial of the vaccine and has also ordered 60 million doses to be administered to its 18 million-strong population over three years.The country has largely relied on the Sinovac vaccine, along with smaller numbers of Pfizer's equivalent drug, to roll out one of the world's fastest vaccination campaigns, so far inoculating 4.6 million people with two doses and 7.2 million with one.Chile also signed deals for the supply of vaccines from western drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca but these are yet to materialise because of supply bottlenecks.On Sunday, Chilean science minister Andres Couve said it was important to focus on the data and the vaccine's effectiveness in reducing illness that required medical treatment or being hospitalized or dying, which it achieved in the Brazilian study in 83.7% and 100% of cases respectively.He said Chile's health ministry will shortly publish a real world study on the effectiveness of both vaccines rolled out in its population and appealed to Chileans to continue to participate in the vaccination programme.Heriberto Garcia, director of Chile's Public Health Institute which greenlighted CoronaVac's emergency roll-out, said people should not pay attention to headlines."The University of Chile study and the study the health ministry will release say the same thing: the number of people who fall ill and are hospitalized has decreased," he told local newspaper La Tercera. "We are going down the right path."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-right-path-chile-defends-sinovac-use-amid-fresh-efficacy-questions-101618178464415.html
12-04-2021||World||English shops and pub gardens reopen in 'major step' to freedom||England's shops, hairdressers, gyms and pub gardens will reopen on Monday in what Prime Minister Boris Johnson said was a "major step" towards freedom from the restrictions of the Covid-19 pandemic.Hundreds of thousands of businesses have been closed since early January when England entered a third lockdown to stem surging infections driven by the "Kent" variant of the virus.A vaccination campaign that has delivered a first shot to well over half of adults and lockdown measures have cut deaths by more than 95% and cases by over 90% from the January peak.Sunday's seven deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test is the lowest daily death toll by this measure since Sept 14.That progress would allow a staged easing of lockdown to proceed, Johnson said earlier this month, adding that he was looking forward to a pint in a pub garden."I'm sure it will be a huge relief for those business owners who have been closed for so long, and for everyone else it's a chance to get back to doing some of the things we love and have missed," he said in a statement on Sunday."I urge everyone to continue to behave responsibly and remember 'hands, face, space and fresh air' to suppress Covid as we push on with our vaccination programme."With more than 127,000 fatalities, the United Kingdom has the fifth highest death toll in the world from Covid-19.Persuading people to return to some kind of normality and start spending again is key to Britain's recovery after official data last month showed that 2020 was the worst year for its economy in more than three centuries.UK retailers, which have lost an estimated 27 billion pounds ($37 billion) in sales during lockdowns, are hoping pent-up demand will fuel a trading boom.Non-essential stores, such as home and fashion chains, will reopen in Wales as well as England on Monday, although those in Scotland need to wait until April 26.Pubs and restaurants will only be able to serve outdoors from Monday, although early rules requiring meals to be served with drinks and curfews have been scrapped.Indoor service will not be allowed until May 17 at the earliest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/english-shops-and-pub-gardens-reopen-in-major-step-to-freedom-101618178477336.html
12-04-2021||World||Trump, speaking to donors, sharply insults top Republican Mitch McConnell||Addressing a meeting of affluent donors and top Republican officials, Donald Trump spent more time lashing out at fellow Republicans -- and most sharply at their Senate leader -- than at Democrats, news media reported Sunday.The former president, speaking Saturday to members of the Republican National Committee at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida, called for party unity in the wake of his loss to Joe Biden and the party's loss of Senate control.But his polarizing ways and piercing criticism of fellow party members have created awkward complications for Republican leaders as they look to 2022 midterm elections and beyond.As Trump continued on Saturday to assert falsely that he won the November election, he particularly excoriated Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, calling him a "dumb (expletive)" and a "stone cold loser."Trump has blamed McConnell for not fighting to block Congress's January 6 certification of Biden's election victory -- certification that took place only after a pro-Trump mob violently stormed the Capitol building.McConnell later declared that Trump was "practically and morally responsible" for the deadly attack.- 'Did he say thank you?' -The former president, in his remarks Saturday, also criticized McConnell's wife, Elaine Chao, who was Trump's transportation secretary but who resigned following the events of January 6."I hired his wife. Did he ever say thank you?" Trump said, before mocking Chao for resigning.He then said he was "disappointed" in his own vice president, Mike Pence, for his role in certifying the election result.And he again attacked top US scientist Anthony Fauci, saying the epidemiologist is "full of crap."Without mentioning the more than 560,000 Americans who have died of Covid-19, Trump praised Republicans such as Florida governor Ron DeSantis for reopening their states early, in defiance of experts' advice.During the Mar-a-Lago meeting, which some Republicans said they hoped would focus more on the party's path forward, Trump instead rehashed past grievances, including his criticism of Republican officials in Georgia and Pennsylvania who had refused to support his claims of a stolen election.Describing the crowd at his January 6 rally -- several thousand people drawn to Washington by Trump's frequent pleas on Twitter -- he claimed that "some people say it was over a million people," a considerable exaggeration.McConnell did not attend the Mar-a-Lago event. He has told advisors he has not spoken to Trump in months and never plans to do so again, according to The Washington Post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-speaking-to-donors-sharply-insults-top-republican-mitch-mcconnell-101618178530415.html
12-04-2021||World||Land Rover SUV redesigned by Prince Philip to carry his coffin||A Land Rover that Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, helped design over 15 years ago will be part of the funeral procession of Duke of Edinburgh, Prince Philip, and will be flanked by pall bearers drawn from the Royal Marines as it transports the British Royal member’s coffin on April 17.Britain’s Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband who died on Friday aged 99, will have a ceremonial funeral on Saturday without any public access or public procession, Buckingham Palace said.Prince Philip had a role in the design of the vehicle and had always wanted it to be involved in his funeral, a senior aide said, according to UK media reports.The vehicle is believed to be a modified Defender 130 Gun Bus, which was commissioned for use by the Queen’s late husband in 2005 – three years before the British luxury brands Jaguar and Land Rover (JLR) were taken over by Tata Motors.Saturday’s funeral will take place at St George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle after an eight-minute ceremonial procession within the castle’s grounds. There will be no public access, although the service and procession will be televised.“It will be what’s known as a ceremonial royal funeral,” a Buckingham Palace spokesperson said, adding: “The plans for the funeral are very much in line with the Duke of Edinburgh’s own personal wishes.”Philip currently lies at rest in the Private Chapel at Windsor Castle. There will be no lying in state. On April 17 the coffin will be moved from the State Entrance to St George’s Chapel for a funeral service.The service will begin with a national minute of silence. The congregation will adhere to national Covid guidelines. At the end of the service Philip will be interred in the Royal Vault in St George’s Chapel. Prince Philip’s death triggered eight days of national mourning, which ends with his funeral on Saturday.Well-rehearsed plans for his funeral -- codenamed “Operation Forth Bridge” -- have had to be hastily revised because of coronavirus restrictions.Public elements of the ceremony have been eliminated to avoid crowds gathering, while the congregation at the chapel is limited to just 30.That sparked huge speculation about whether the duke’s grandson Prince Harry will attend, after he and his American wife and actor Meghan quit royal duties last year.Buckingham Palace on Saturday confirmed Harry’s attendance but said Meghan, who is heavily pregnant with the couple’s second child, would not travel on medical advice.The couple, who now live in the United States, have launched a series of broadsides against the royals, including charges of racism and not looking after Meghan’s mental health.‘Huge void’Queen Elizabeth II has been left bereft at the death of her husband, Prince Philip, one of their sons said on Sunday, as prayers were said at memorial services across Britain.Prince Andrew said his 94-year-old mother was “incredibly stoic” but had been hit hard by the death of the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday. Last year the couple celebrated 73 years of marriage. “She described it (his death) as having left a huge void in her life,” Andrew said after a church service at Windsor Castle, west of London. The Queen and Philip’s second son described his father as “the grandfather of the nation” and said close family were “rallying round” his mother.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/land-rover-suv-redesigned-by-prince-philip-to-carry-his-coffin-101618167270671.html
12-04-2021||World||Bhutan delivers first vaccine dose to 85% of adult population in a week||The curve of Bhutan’s Covid-19 vaccination drive, when plotted on a graph, is nearly perpendicular, titled at a slight obtuse angle.While most countries, even the ones that have performed well, took months to scale up inoculations against coronavirus, the tiny nation of nearly 800,000 citizens did it in a matter of days.Bhutan administered the first shot of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine to 85% of its adult population within a week, according to a report by The Economist on Saturday. Only Israel (95.1%) and the Seychelles (94.1%) have vaccinated a higher percentage of adults, but in months, the report adds.Earlier on Wednesday, government officials told news agency AFP that 470,000 people out of 770,000 in total had been administered the first shot of the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine donated by India.The numbers are fortified from Our World in Data, which shows that 61.45% of the country’s entire population had received at least one dose of the vaccine until April 10.But the Himalayan kingdom’s ambitious vaccination drive, which began nine days ago, hasn’t always been straightforward.Bhutan — which has so far recorded a total 918 Covid-19 cases and one fatality — received the vaccine from India in January. However, the Zhung Dratshang, a body of Buddhist monks, advised the government that the stars weren’t auspicious. And so, the first jab was given nearly two months later to a woman named Ninda Dema — born in the Year of the Monkey, the Economist report says.From there on, it was an upward trend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-delivers-first-vaccine-dose-to-85-of-adult-population-in-a-week-101618165949479.html
