Critics say Pakistan’s sweeping anti-terrorism laws have also been used to silence critics of the country’s powerful military.Afridi, his wife and two children — including a two-year old son — were killed in the attack, Khan said.Afridi had been assigned to the anti-terrorism courts in Swat two months earlier. Swat was once a Taliban controlled area and is where education activist Malala Yousafzai was shot by the Taliban for advocating for girls' education.Pakistan's military drove the Taliban from the area in 2009.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunmen-kill-pakistani-anti-terrorism-court-judge-and-family-101617560225895.html
04-04-2021||World||Florida homes evacuated as wastewater leak risks 'catastrophic' flood||Emergency crews in central Florida were working Sunday to prevent an environmental catastrophe at a leaking reservoir that risked sending millions of gallons of contaminated wastewater toward nearby homes and into the Tampa Bay.More than 300 homes near the site of an abandoned phosphate mine and fertilizer-production facility in Manatee County were under mandatory evacuation orders, and Governor Ron DeSantis on Saturday declared a state of emergency to free up funds to tackle the crisis."What we are looking at now is trying to prevent, and respond to if need be, a real catastrophic flood situation," DeSantis told a press conference after viewing the site by helicopter Sunday.He said emergency workers, assisted by the Florida National Guard, were pumping about 33 million gallons of water daily out of a wastewater reservoir at the site, which has sprung a growing leak in its plastic lining."According to on-site engineers, a controlled release was necessary to prevent a catastrophic failure," the governor said.The wastewater "meets water-quality standards for marine waters," he said, with the exception of phosphorous and nitrogen levels.Marine algae thrive on such elements, and environmental groups fear the release of millions of gallons of nutrient-rich water into the ocean could trigger a deadly "red tide," or algal bloom, that can suffocate fish and other aquatic life and deter tourist activity.A collapse of the reservoir also risked sending water into nearby stacks of phosphogypsum, a leftover from fertilizer production.Phosphogypsum is considered radioactive as it contains isotopes such as radon, as well as toxic heavy metals like arsenic, lead and mercury.The Center for Biological Diversity national conservation group called for the US Environmental Protection Agency to step in."Federal officials need to clean up this mess the fertilizer industry has dumped on Florida communities and immediately halt further phosphogypsum production," Jaclyn Lopez, the organization's Florida director, said in a statement. Troubled history Manatee County officials have ordered a "complete evacuation" of the area, including 316 homes.Problems at Piney Point stretch back decades.Florida's agriculture commissioner, Nicole Fried, wrote to DeSantis, saying the current emergency was only the latest in a string of incidents."For more than 50 years, this central Florida mining operation has caused numerous human health and environmental disasters and incidents," she wrote, adding there had been several earlier failures of the reservoir's lining.Manatee County's acting administrator Scott Hopes said authorities were looking to permanently empty reservoirs at the site."We won't be repairing the liner, we will be depleting the holding ponds of their water and then we will be moving forward to a permanent solution into the future once we mitigate the current risk," Hopes told the press conference.This will "probably include filling these ponds after they have been devoid of their contents and capping them."DeSantis said the company operating the site, HRK Holdings, should be held accountable."This is not acceptable and it's not something we will allow to persist," he said.HRK did not immediately respond to a request for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-homes-evacuated-as-wastewater-leak-risks-catastrophic-flood-101617560035500.html

During NBC’s Meet the Press show, Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, said that the world is at “category 5 hurricane status”, indicating that the ongoing surge would lead to the highest daily cases since the start of the pandemic.“Let me say that, at this time, we really are in a category 5 hurricane status with regard to the rest of the world,” Osterholm said. “At this point, we will see in the next two weeks, the highest number of cases reported globally since the beginning of the pandemic,” he added.The highest number of daily Covid-19 cases globally was reported in December 2020, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) data, but the numbers gradually declined amid the vaccination drive. However, another surge in Covid-19 cases in countries like India, the US, Brazil, Italy, and Germany has raised fresh concerns about the ongoing health crisis.“In terms of the United States, we’re just at the beginning of this surge, we haven’t even really begun to see it yet,” the American epidemiologist said.On Friday, India added the most number of Covid-19 cases than any other country, surpassing the US in the number of new infections reported on average. The daily Covid-19 cases have shot up 10 times in a span of 50 days, according to the Union health ministry data. Last week, Brazil recorded its highest ever daily deaths related to Covid-19 as states across the Latin American nation are seeing ICU bed shortages.Dr Anthony Fauci, the top infectious disease expert of the US, on Saturday warned that the United States may be on the cusp of another Covid-19 surge if Americans aren't careful. Fauci told CNN that there is a need to doubling down on public health measures and get as many people vaccinated as quickly to escape the surge.According to the Coronavirus Resource Center of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, more than 130 million cases of coronavirus and over 2.84 million related deaths have been reported so far. The United States remains the worst-hit country in terms of total Covid-19 cases and related deaths, followed by Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/highest-daily-covid-19-cases-globally-in-next-two-weeks-us-expert-predicts-101617556148031.html

However, in a landmark ruling, the apex court in February reinstated the lower house of Parliament.The political scenario in the country worsened after the Supreme Court last month nullified CPN-MC's merger with CPN-UML. The two parties had merged in May 2018 to form a unified Nepal Communist Party following the victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections."We will hold talks with all pro-democracy parties before forming a new government," Singh told PTI.Informed sources said that a faction of the ruling CPN-UML, Janata Samajwadi Party and CPN-Maoist Centre will also join the move if Nepali Congress takes initiatives to form a new government under its leadership.Prime Minster Oli led government will lose majority in the lower house if CPN-Maoist Centre led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’ withdraws its support, according to party sources.On Saturday, Prachanda said that the country's politics had taken a new turn after the NC decided to seek PM Oli's resignation and take initiative to form the next government under its leadership."I am going to intensify talks with political parties and am hopeful that a new government will be formed and there will be a new course of events," he said at a programme in Kaplivastu.Addressing the participants of the program, Prachanda said a new government will soon be formed and a new political atmosphere will be created.A senior leader of CPN-Maoist Centre has said that the Maoist party will withdraw its support to the Oli government that would pave way for forming an alternative government under the leadership of the Nepali Congress.Meanwhile, the Standing Committee meeting of the Maoist party which was scheduled to take place on Sunday has been postponed as most of its members are outside Kathmandu.During the next Standing Committee meeting of the party a decision is likely to be taken to withdraw support from the Oli government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepali-congress-moves-to-oust-kp-sharma-oli-to-form-govt-under-its-leadership-101617556649892.html

Officials are investigating the manager of the construction site, Lee Yi-hsiang, whose truck is suspected of not having its brakes properly applied.Lee read out a statement apologising for what happened as police took him away from his residence, Taiwan media reported."I deeply regret this and express my deepest apologies," he said. "I will definitely cooperate with the prosecutors and police in the investigation, accept the responsibility that should be borne, and never shirk it. Finally, I once again express my sincerest apologies."A Hualien court said on Sunday evening it had ordered that Lee be detained for two months, saying there was a risk he may destroy evidence. After questioning by the judge and evidence from prosecutors, he is suspected of causing death by negligence, it said.His lawyer told reporters that Lee wanted to face up to what had happened and was apologetic and expressed regret.Transport minister Lin Chia-lung, in a statement on his Facebook page, said he would step down once the initial rescue work had come to an end, adding he "took full responsibility"."I should have accepted all the criticism over the past few days, but we have not done well enough," he said.Premier Su Tseng-chang's office said prior to the announcement that Lin had made a verbal offer to resign, but Su had rejected it for the time being, saying efforts for now should focus on rescue and recovery.Survivors have described terrible scenes inside the train.Priest Sung Chih-chiang told Reuters what surviving passenger Chung Hui-mei had told him."She could not find her daughter. When she yelled, she found her daughter was under the steel panels. She put her effort to move those pieces one by one, but her daughter's voice became quieter and quieter, and then there was no response," he said."SO ANGRY"Workers are continuing to remove the train from inside the tunnel and look for other bodies, and officials have warned the death toll could go up or down as they verify identities. The government revised the toll down by one on Sunday evening to 50.The transport ministry and the rail administration that comes under it are facing a number of questions, including why there was no proper fencing at the site and whether too many standing-only tickets were sold for the train journey.Deputy transport minister Wang Kwo-tsai said late on Saturday the railway administration needed to take hard look at all these issues.The railway administration is without a permanent director after its former chief retired in January.The uncle of the youngest confirmed victim, a 5-year-old girl, tearfully told reporters he was still waiting for an apology for the accident. "I'm so angry," he said.The government has promised compensation and said it will do everything it can to help survivors and their relatives, including coordinating public donations.The damaged section of the track will not reopen until April 20 at the earliest, Wang said, though rail traffic continues on a parallel track that runs through another tunnel and was not affected by the accident.The accident occurred at the start of a long weekend for the traditional Tomb Sweeping Day, when people return home to tend to family graves.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-transport-minister-to-quit-over-train-crash-says-will-cooperate-in-probe-101617554810433.html
04-04-2021||World||Amid outcry, states push mental health training for police||The officer who Cassandra Quinto-Collins says kneeled on her son's neck for over four minutes assured her it was standard protocol for sedating a person experiencing a mental breakdown.“I was there watching it the whole time,” Quinto-Collins told The Associated Press. “I just trusted that they knew what they were doing.”Angelo Quinto's sister had called 911 for help calming him down during an episode of paranoia on Dec. 23. His family says Quinto didn't resist the Antioch, California, officers — one who pushed his knee on the back of his neck, and another who restrained his legs — and the only noise he made was when he twice cried out, “Please don’t kill me.”The officers replied, “We’re not going to kill you,” the family said. Police deny putting pressure on his neck. Three days later, the 30-year-old Navy veteran and Filipino immigrant died at a hospital.It is the latest stark example of the perils of policing people with mental health issues. In response to several high-profile deaths of people with mental health issues in police custody, lawmakers in at least eight states are introducing legislation to change how law enforcement agencies respond to those in crisis.The proposals lean heavily on additional training for officers on how to interact with people with mental health problems. It's a common response when lawmakers face widespread outcry over police brutality like the US saw last year following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. But none of the proposals appear to address the root question: Should police be the ones responding when someone is mentally ill?In California, lawmakers introduced legislation on Feb. 11 that, among other things, would require prospective officers to complete college courses that address mental health, social services and psychology, without requiring a degree.In New York, lawmakers in January proposed an effort to require law enforcement to complete a minimum of 32 credit hours of training that would include techniques on de-escalation and interacting with people who have mental health issues.The proposal came nearly a year after Rochester, New York, officers put a spit hood over Daniel Prude’s head and pressed his naked body against the street until he stopped breathing. The victim’s family, like Quinto's, said they had called 911 for help after Prude, who is Black, began having a mental health episode.Similarly, in Utah, the mother of 13-year-old Linden Cameron called 911 in September because he was having a breakdown and she needed help from a crisis intervention officer. Salt Lake City police ended up shooting him multiple times as he ran away because they believed he made threats involving a weapon.He was hospitalized, and no weapon was found. The officers were not crisis intervention specialists but had some mental health training.Last month, Utah Gov. Spencer Cox signed legislation that will create a council to standardize training for police crisis intervention teams statewide.At least 34 states already require officers to have training or other education on interacting with people who have physical or mental health conditions. But law enforcement experts say updated training is needed and agencies are far behind.“The training that police have received for the past I’d say 25 years has not changed significantly, and it’s out of date, and it doesn’t meet today’s realities,” said Chuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based think tank. “I mean the last thing a mother wants when they call the police is for an officer to use force. Especially in a situation that didn’t call for it because the officers weren’t trained in how to recognize a crisis.”Some of the new legislation looks to strengthen or improve standards. But because mental health training is a mandate in a majority of states, some advocates and experts believe it may never fully prepare officers on how to respond.The Treatment Advocacy Center, a nonprofit dedicated to getting treatment for the mentally ill, concluded in a 2015 report those with untreated mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than others.“The solution that would have the most impact on the problem is to prevent people with mental illness from encountering law enforcement in the first place,” said Elizabeth Sinclair Hancq, co-author of the report.Since that is not always possible, she said, another solution is to create co-responder programs where a social worker or other mental health professional assists officers on such calls.That is what Philadelphia introduced in October, weeks before officers fatally shot Walter Wallace Jr., a Black man, within a minute of arriving at his address for the third time in a day while he was having a mental health crisis. Police said Wallace ignored commands to drop a knife.Other cities, including Los Angeles, San Francisco and Portland, Oregon, have similar programs.For families of victims, who now say they regret calling 911 for help, required training and legislative reform are long overdue.“In retrospect, it wasn’t the smartest idea to call the police,” said Isabella Collins, the 18-year-old sister of Quinto, who died in California. “But I just wanted him to be able to calm down, and I thought that they could help with that.”Antioch police didn't release details of Quinto's death for more than a month. Police Chief Tammany Brooks has denied that officers used a knee or anything else to put pressure on Quinto’s head, neck or throat. An investigation and autopsy are underway.The department didn't respond to a request for comment.Quinto's family filed a wrongful-death claim against the city in February, claiming he “died as a direct consequence of the unreasonable force used against him.”“I guess it was really naive of me to think that he wouldn’t get hurt,” Collins said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amid-outcry-states-push-mental-health-training-for-police-101617549870716.html
04-04-2021||World||Jordan's former queen says allegations against Prince Hamza are 'wicked slander'||The widow of Jordan's late king on Sunday defended her son, former Crown Prince Hamza Bin Hussein, against allegations by the authorities that he carried out actions targeting "security and stability" in the kingdom.The head of the armed forces visited the prince on Saturday and warned him over actions that people familiar with the matter said could be related to a plot to destabilise Jordan, and several high-profile figures were detained.Jordan's neighbours and allies expressed solidarity with King Abdullah over the security measures in the kingdom, an important ally of the United States.Prince Hamza said in a video recording he was under house arrest and had been told to stay at home and not contact anyone, and Queen Noor, the widow of late King Hussein, said the authorities' accusations against him were slander."Praying that truth and justice will prevail for all the innocent victims of this wicked slander," she wrote on Twitter. "God bless and keep them safe."Prince Hamza was dismissed as heir to the throne in 2004 by King Abdullah, his half-brother, in a move that consolidated the monarch's power.Although he has been sidelined, Prince Hamza has angered the authorities by building ties with disgruntled figures within powerful tribes.Speaking in English in the video recording, passed by his lawyer to the BBC, Prince Hamza said the country's leaders were a corrupt few who put their interests above the public.A security investigation has been launched and a former minister, a junior member of the royal family and unnamed others have been detained.Jordan is seen as one of the most stable countries in the Middle East. Echoing statements of support by other allies and neighbours of Jordan, Morocco's King Mohammed VI held a phone call with King Abdullah II in which he expressed solidarity and support for the country's security measures, Morocco's royal palace said on Sunday.Some opposition figures have rallied around Prince Hamza, in a move that has displeased the king, officials familiar with the situation said. Prince Hamza had been groomed from childhood by his mother to become a king and has taken many of his late father's public behaviour and language, endearing himself to some Jordanians who are nostalgic for King Hussein's long decades of rule.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jordans-former-queen-says-allegations-against-prince-hamza-are-wicked-slander-101617538985384.html

04-04-2021||World||French tycoon Bernard Tapie, former owner of Adidas, tied up and beaten in burglary||Former French minister and scandal-ridden tycoon Bernard Tapie, once the owner of Adidas, was attacked along with his wife during a midnight burglary of their home, police said Sunday.The couple were asleep when four men broke into the house in Combs-la-Ville near Paris around 00:30 AM Sunday (2230 GMT Saturday), beat them and tied them up with electrical cords before making off with their loot.Dominique Tapie managed to free herself and made her way to a neighbour's home, from where she called the police. Slightly injured from several blows to the face, she was taken to hospital for a check-up."She is doing well," Tapie's grandson Rodolphe Tapie told AFP.During the burglary the perpetrators "pulled her by the hair because they wanted to know where the treasure was", the mayor of Combs-La-Ville, Guy Geoffroy, told AFP. "But of course there was no treasure, and the fact that they didn't find one made the violence only worse."- Jewellery and a Rolex -Tapie himself, who is 78, received a blow to the head with a club, prosecutor Beatrice Angelelli told AFP, but he declined to be taken into medial care."My grandfather refused to be taken away," Rodolphe Tapie said. "He is shattered, very tired. He was sitting on a chair when he was hit with a club."The burglars broke into Tapie's home, a vast estate known as the "Moulin de Breuil", through a first-floor window, undetected by the guards.They made off with two watches, including a Rolex, earrings, bracelets and a ring, according to a source close to the investigation.Tapie was a Socialist minister who rose from humble beginnings to build a sporting and media empire, but later ran into a string of legal problems.He made a fortune in the early part of his career by taking over failing companies in corporate raids, stripping them of their assets and selling them for profit during the high-rolling years of financial deregulation in France.He often flaunted his wealth, including by buying a 72-metre yacht and a football club, Olympique de Marseille, which won the French championship while he was their owner.He has also been under suspicion of match-fixing in France's top football league.He was briefly minister for urban affairs in Francois Mitterrand's government in 1992.- Many legal troubles -Tapie was found guilty in a series of cases for corruption, tax fraud and misuse of corporate assets, went to prison for five months and was stripped of the right to stand in any election in France.After his release from prison in 1997, Tapie added showbiz to his various activities, trying his hand at acting, singing and hosting radio and TV shows.In 2012 he also became a media boss, taking over southern French daily La Provence and other newspapers.One fraud case has dogged Tapie for decades, involving a hugely controversial settlement worth 400 million euros ($470 million at current rates) awarded to him by a government arbitration panel, the size of which sent shockwaves through France.The panel judged he had been the victim of fraud when he sold his stake in the Adidas sports apparel company in 1993 to state-run French bank Credit Lyonnais, which was found to have undervalued the sportswear brand.- 'Determined' to stand trial -The case also ensnared then-finance minister Christine Lagarde, who now runs the European Central Bank. She was found guilty of "negligence".Lagarde's handling of the case sparked suspicion that her former boss Nicolas Sarkozy, whom Tapie had backed for president in 2007, was favourably disposed towards the businessman -- allegations Sarkozy has vehemently denied.Last autumn, Tapie's fraud trial was postponed for reasons of ill health because he was suffering a double stomach cancer and cancer of the oesophagus which were getting worse.The trial is due to resume in May, with Tapie "determined" to be present, according to his lawyer.Police are treating Sunday's incident as a violent robbery and kidnapping, a source close to the investigation told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-tycoon-tapie-former-owner-of-adidas-tied-up-and-beaten-in-burglary-101617550505431.html
04-04-2021||World||Jordan says King’s half-brother, Hamza Bin Hussein, plotted to destabilize country||Jordan said it uncovered a plot to destabilize the kingdom that involved King Abdullah II’s half-brother and extended beyond the country’s borders.A half-brother of Jordan’s ruler, former Crown Prince Hamza Bin Hussein, was part of the foiled conspiracy, Deputy Prime Minister Ayman Safadi said on Sunday, in a first official explanation of a string of arrests a day earlier. More than 16 people were taken into custody, he said at a news conference in the capital, Amman.“There was an effort to target Jordan’s security and stability, this effort was foiled,” he said. He gave no evidence to back up his claims.The crackdown comes as Jordan, a U.S. ally that’s home to as many as 2 million Palestinian refugees and normalized relations with neighboring Israel in 1994, struggles with a worsening squeeze on its finances and a resurgence of Covid-19 cases that has prompted the government to renew restrictions on movement. The U.S. most recently provided the Middle East kingdom with $700 million in August.“We are closely following the reports and in touch with Jordanian officials,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said in a statement. “King Abdullah is a key partner of the United States, and he has our full support.”Jordan’s stability is crucial to the region because of its role in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Bordering both Syria and Iraq, the kingdom has also fashioned itself as a force for moderation in a turbulent neighborhood.Also Read | Explained: Why Jordan placed its former crown prince under 'house arrest'Security personnel and armored vehicles were seen parked outside royal palaces and patrolling the Dabouq neighborhood of the capital, Amman, on Saturday. The Washington Post said earlier that Hamza, the eldest son of the late King Hussein and his fourth wife Queen Noor, was under house arrest at his palace in Amman. It cited a senior Middle East intelligence official briefed on the events as saying there was an ongoing investigation into an alleged plot to unseat King Abdullah, Hamza’s older half-brother.Hamza, in a six-minute video provided to the BBC by his lawyer, said he was “not part of any conspiracy.”Support From Allies“I had a visit from chief of general staff of the Jordanian armed forces this morning in which he informed me that I was not allowed to go out, to communicate with people or to meet with them because in the meetings that I had been present in -- or on social media relating to visits that I had made -- there had been criticism of the government or the king,” Hamza said in the video. He added that his Internet and phone lines had been cut.On Twitter, Hamza’s mother, Queen Noor called the incidents a “wicked slander”.Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Major General Yousef Huneiti on Saturday denied claims about the arrest of Hamza and said the prince was merely asked to stop “movements and activities that are used to target” the security and stability of Jordan. He added that the move was part of joint comprehensive investigations undertaken by security agencies, as a result of which bin Zeid, Awadallah and others were arrested.The army chief indicated that the investigations were ongoing and their results will be announced “with full transparency and clarity.”Hamza was the crown prince for four years before the title was transferred in 2004 to the current king’s eldest son, Hussein. He has occupied various roles, including brigadier in the Jordanian army.Awadallah, who holds a doctorate from the London School of Economics and Political Science, has served in various positions in Jordan, including economic secretary to the prime minister, minister of finance and head of the royal court. Until 2018, he was King Abdullah’s personal envoy to Saudi Arabia, where he was close to Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman.Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Egypt and other Arab states expressed support for King Abdullah. Saudi Arabia said it supported the Jordanian monarch’s decisions and measures to preserve security and stability and face any attempt to affect them.“The Biden administration would view the potential of a failed state as detrimental to regional stability,” said Ayham Kamel, the New York-based head of Eurasia Group’s Middle East and Africa research team. “The Israeli security establishment would not look favorably toward any real instability in Jordan that triggers a Palestinian crisis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jordan-says-king-s-half-brother-plotted-to-destabilize-country-101617548809286.html

The trials will also gather evidence on how ventilation and different approaches to social distancing could enable large events to go ahead.Officials are also developing plans to trial Covid-19 passports that are expected to show if a person has received a vaccine, has recently tested negative for the virus, or has some immunity due to having tested positive in the previous six months.The issue of vaccine passports has been a hotly debated topic around the world, including in the United States and Israel. The question is how much governments, employers, venues and other places have a right to know about a person's virus status. Many disagree over what the right balance is between a person's right to medical privacy and the collective right of people in groups not to be infected with a dangerous disease by others.Some critics also say such vaccine passports will enable discrimination against poor people and impoverished nations that do not have ready access to vaccines.Authorities in Britain have said the passes could involve the use of an app or paper certificates for those who don't have access to the digital option.But U.K. Sports Minister Nigel Huddleston stressed to reporters that “the earliest pilots almost certainly won't involve any elements of certification” but will involve testing before and after the events. Prime Minister Boris Johnson is expected to set out more details about the coronavirus passports on Monday.“We are doing everything we can to enable the reopening of our country so people can return to the events, travel and other things they love as safely as possible, and these reviews will play an important role in allowing this to happen,” Johnson said.Dozens of British lawmakers, including some from Johnson’s own Conservative Party, have opposed the plans.Cabinet minister Michael Gove, who has led the task force responsible for drawing up the plans, acknowledged that vaccine passports raised “a host of practical and ethical questions” which needed to be resolved before any wider rollout.Officials said the trial events include the FA Cup semi-final at London's Wembley Stadium later this month with a crowd of 4,000 in a stadium that seats 90,000, and the event's final on May 15, with a crowd of 21,000. Other events include the World Snooker Championship in Sheffield, central England and a comedy club gathering.The news about the trials came as businesses including pubs, restaurants, nonessential shops and hairdressers prepared to welcome back customers as restrictions ease in England. Officials say about 47% of the country’s population has had a first dose of the coronavirus vaccine, and more than 5 million people in the U.K. have received their second dose.Johnson’s government is also expected to set out its approach to easing restrictions on international travel next week. Media reports say when Britain's current ban on foreign holidays is lifted, a risk-based traffic light system with ratings for countries around the world will be introduced and travellers will be required to quarantine accordingly.More details are to be unveiled when a government task force on global travel reports on April 12. The government has said that international leisure travel cannot take place until mid-May at the earliest.Last week the U.K. added four more nations to its red list of countries from which travel is banned except for U.K. citizens and those with residency rights. By April 9, the U.K. red list will be up to 39 countries. It aims to prevent more virus variants — especially ones first detected in Brazil and South Africa — from getting into the U.K.Despite Britain's success on the vaccination front, it still has the highest reported Covid-19 death toll in Europe at around 127,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-eyes-testing-out-covid-19-passports-at-mass-gatherings-101617546649469.html
04-04-2021||World||Another Covid-19 surge in US if Americans aren't careful, warns Fauci||The US top infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci on Saturday (local time) warned that the United States may be on the cusp of another Covid-19 surge if Americans aren't careful.There are two key things the US can do to prevent more infections, more hospitalisations, and more deaths, CNN quoted Dr Anthony Fauci as saying."A, you keep pushing down and doubling down on public health measures, and B, you do whatever you can to get as many people vaccinated as quickly and as expeditiously as possible," he said.On the vaccine front, the US has been doing "extremely well," Fauci said.Citing the data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CNN reported that the country reported a new record over the weekend with more than four million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in 24 hours.According to Johns Hopkins University, as many as 30,672,830 people have detected positive for the Covid-19. The death toll in the country stands at 554,779."A record reporting day!! 4.08M doses reported administered over the total yesterday," Dr Cyrus Shahpar, the Covid-19 Data Director at the White House, wrote on Twitter.But despite the record pace of vaccinations, there are not enough Americans vaccinated yet to control the spread of the virus, experts warn. So far, about 31.4 per cent of Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and only 18 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated, CDC data shows.That's why experts urge continued safety measures for now.Earlier, Fauci also warned that a new wave of Covid-19 infections could be on the way while urging former President Donald Trump to tell his supporters to be vaccinated.More than 101 million doses of the vaccine have been administered in the US so far, However, President Joe Biden, last month had pledged that all American adults would be eligible to receive the vaccine by May 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/another-covid-19-surge-in-us-if-americans-aren-t-careful-warns-fauci-101617547650619.html
04-04-2021||World||Ex-chief of Chinese defence giant Norinco under probe for graft||The former chairperson of one of China’s largest arms manufacturers is being probed for suspected disciplinary violations including graft.Yin Jiaxu, 65, the ex-chief of Chinese defence giant China North Industries Group Co (Norinco) is being probed for “serious violation” of laws and regulations, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), the country’s top anti-graft watchdog said in a brief statement, published on its website, on Sunday.Yin, who headed the high-profile Fortune 500 company between 2013 and 2018, is the latest former senior official from the defence industry to be probed.The CCDI, according to Beijing Daily, found that during Yin’s term as head of the group for five years some senior officials in the group had abused their powers for personal gains, providing unjustified convenience for their spouses, children, and relatives to run businesses or enterprises.“Born in 1956, he was the deputy general manager of China South Industries Group Co in 2002, and later served as the deputy general manager of Norinco in 2010, then as the chairman from 2013. Yin retired in 2018,” the state media report said.Norinco provides weapons and technical support to China’s People’s Liberation Army and is engaged in the oil and gas business.The group says on its website that according to Fortune 500 company rankings in 2020, it was placed “…154th in the world top 500 corporations with $68.7 billion operating revenue, and ranks number 1 among military enterprises in China. Since entering the world’s top 500 in 2010, Norinco group has been listed for the 11th consecutive year on the Fortune (list)”.The Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), which tracks the global defence industry said in its December report that Norinco was the ninth-largest arms company in the world and third-largest in China, after Aviation Industry Corporation of China and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation.According to SIPRI, the top 25 defence companies had four Chinese firms.“Three are in the top 10: Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC; 6th), China Electronics Technology Group Corporation (CETC; 8th) and China North Industries Group Corporation (Norinco; 9th). The combined revenue of the four Chinese companies in the top 25 - which also include China South Industries Group Corporation (CSGC; 24th) - grew by 4.8% between 2018 and 2019,” the report said.President Xi Jinping’s anti-corruption campaign has netted several senior officials including those in the defence industry since it was launched in his first term.In January, it was announced that the former chief of China’s multi-billion aircraft carrier programme and head of one of the largest shipping companies, Hu Wenming, would be arrested on charges of corruption.Hu was expelled from the ruling Communist Party of China (CPC) in 2020 for severely violating party discipline and being suspected of taking bribes and misfeasance.Hu had worked in several major state-owned arms companies including AVIC, Norinco, and China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) and eventually CSIC, according to People’s Daily.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/exchief-of-chinese-defence-giant-norinco-under-probe-for-graft-101617547811545.html

04-04-2021||World||UK added Pakistan to ‘red list’ after people kept travelling for weddings amid Covid-19 surge||The United Kingdom on Friday added four new countries, including Pakistan, to its “red list” - a list of countries from where travellers are refused entry - to protect Britain against coronavirus variants. With some exception, international visitors who have departed from or transited through the four countries in the previous 10 days won’t be allowed to enter England from April 9.The travel ban was announced after the British government repeatedly warned against travelling to Pakistan without a legitimate reason. According to a BBC report, many individuals of British Pakistani nationality were found making non-essential travels, like attending weddings. BBC’s North West Tonight aired a video of an unnamed woman from Manchester, reportedly posted on her social media account, who was seen attending a wedding in Lahore.In the video, the woman said that everyone was stressed out by coronavirus disease (Covid-19) back home and that’s why she was at the wedding in Lahore. “Corona(virus) has made everyone in the UK mad...but everyone is enjoying themselves here (Pakistan). So I thought I'll get away from all of that by coming here to enjoy myself too,” said the woman, according to the BBC translator.UK media reports that Pakistan was placed on red list due to people travelling to Lahore for weddings pic.twitter.com/pHYhTymGWNAlso Read | Covid-19: Surge in cases in Pakistan, lockdown in Bangladesh According to the report, around 32,000 travellers flew from the UK to Pakistan in January 2021, out of which nearly 15,000 British Pakistanis went from Manchester airport, almost half the number of travellers who flew to Pakistan in the same month last year before the pandemic began. For India, the drop was larger with an 82% decrease in the number of travellers as compared to January 2020.A travel agent from Greater Manchester told BBC that about half of the travellers booked through him were not travelling for legitimate reasons. Pakistan has been witnessing a surge in coronavirus cases and the influx of British Pakistani nationals also led to the discovery of the UK variant, B.1.1.7, in the city of Mirpur, prompting the British High Commissioner to Pakistan to issue a reminder.“For those of you in the UK thinking of travelling to Pakistan under current UK Covid restrictions you must stay at home and it is illegal to travel abroad for leisure,” said Christian Turner, British High Commissioner to Pakistan, in a video.Update on Covid & 🇬🇧🇵🇰 travel: it’s illegal to travel from UK for leisure; cases are rising in 🇵🇰; & border measures can change at short notice - stay informed at https://t.co/SaaXJrgQHx pic.twitter.com/gZ01SJIJijAfter the travel ban was announced, Naz Shah, a member of Parliament for Bradford West, wrote to UK foreign secretary Dominic Raab, alleging that the government was consciously discriminating against Pakistan and the Pakistani diaspora community.

04-04-2021||World||Closure of border with China due to Covid-19 hits livelihoods of Nepalis||The closure of the Nepal-China border due to the Covid pandemic has affected the livelihoods of Nepali people who worked or ran businesses across the international border in Tibet.Several people living in Nepal's Sudurpaschim province were entrepreneurs and seasonal workers across the border in Tibet.If things had been normal, Karsang and her husband Anga Thapa of Talkot village in Bajhang district would be busy serving guests in their hotel at this time of the year, the Kathmandu Post reported.The couple from Sudurpaschim in far western Nepal owns a hotel in Taklakot, Tibet, 30 km across the international border. Taklakot or Purang is the first city in Tibet travellers encounters after leaving Nepal. Located at an altitude of 4,755 metres, it is popular among Indian pilgrims going on the holy journey known as Kailash Manasarovar Yatra for acclimatising for one or two days.It is also the time of the year when people from Humla used to hop across the border to Taklakot to work as seasonal labourers. They earned up to Nepali ₹350,000 in three months.The Kailash Manasarovar Yatra season begins in May and lasts till September. The arrival of Indian pilgrims and Nepali workers would keep hoteliers like Thapa busy for months."I used to make a profit of around Nepali ₹1.5 million during the pilgrim season," The Kathmandu Post quoted Thapa as saying.It's been nearly one and a half years since the pandemic began, and the situation has not changed. The Thapas are wondering when Taklakot will reopen.Before Covid-19, more than 20,000 pilgrims were visiting the sacred mountain and lake during the spring season.The Thapas are facing a financial crisis due to the prolonged closure of their hotel. "We have admitted our three children in a boarding school in Surkhet. We have to pay Nepali ₹40,000 in school fees monthly," Anga said.With the hotel closed, their revenues dried up; and they were forced to mortgage their house to raise cash for household expenses and school fees. "Our income is almost zero."The closure of the border in early 2020 has affected a large number of Nepali entrepreneurs and seasonal workers from Bajhang, Humla, Dolpa, Darchula and Mugu.Nepalis have been running hotels and selling Nepali products, wooden utensils, handicrafts, Nepali carpets, bamboo, reeds, leather and other handicraft items for many years in Taklakot.Dan Bahadur Lama, a wooden utensil trader from Namkha Rural Municipality in Humla district, said they have a turnover of more than Nepali ₹2 billion annually, The Kathmandu Post reported."The government has ignored this border point despite being linked to the livelihoods of many people in the five districts," said Yogesh Bohara of Chhangru, Darchula, who has been trading curio goods in Taklakot.He said that a diplomatic initiative should be launched to reopen the border soon. "If the border is not reopened this year too, many people will be ruined," he said.Meanwhile, the country has witnessed 277,768 total cases of coronavirus infection and 3,032 Covid-19 fatalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/closure-of-border-with-china-due-to-covid-19-hits-livelihoods-of-nepalis-101617543411676.html

Social media posts showed collapsed buildings and vehicles submerged by flash floods.Indonesia's weather agency said a tropical cyclone was approaching the Savu Straits between the southern part of Nusa Tenggara province and East Timor's north coast, warning that it could bring yet more rain, waves and winds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floods-landslides-kill-dozens-in-indonesia-and-east-timor-101617542053278.html
04-04-2021||World||Pak anti-terrorism court jails Hafiz Saeed's 5 aides in terror financing case||A Pakistani anti-terrorism court has sentenced five leaders of Mumbai attack mastermind Hafiz Saeed’s Jamaat-ud-Dawah (JuD) to nine years of imprisonment each in a terror financing case.Three of them -- Umar Bahadar, Nasarullah and Samiullah -- have been convicted for the first time since the Anti-Terrorism Court (ATC) Lahore pronounced its verdict some time ago in the terror financing cases registered by the Counter-Terrorism Department (CTD) of the Punjab police.The other two -- JuD spokesperson Yahya Mujahid and senior leader Prof Zafar Iqbal -- had already been convicted for many years in other terror financing cases.ATC Lahore Judge Ejaz Ahmad Buttar on Saturday handed down nine-year imprisonment to each five of them. The judge also ordered a six-month jail term to Saeed's brother-in-law Hafiz Abdul Rehman Makki in the same case.“The court found the JuD/LeT leaders guilty of offence of terrorism financing. They had been collecting funds and unlawfully financing the proscribed organisation, LeT (Lashkar-e-Taiba). The court has also ordered confiscation of assets made from funds collected through terrorism financing,” the CTD said.The JuD leaders were presented in the court amid high security and the media was not allowed to cover the proceedings.The CTD of Punjab Police had registered 41 FIRs against the JuD leaders, including 70-year-old Saeed, in terror financing cases. The trial courts have so far decided 37 of them.The ATC had sentenced the LeT founder, Saeed, for a collective imprisonment of 36 years on terror finance charges under sections 11-N of Anti-Terrorism Act 1997 in five cases so far. Saeed’s jail terms will run concurrently. That means he will not stay in jail for many years. He is serving his term in Lahore’s Kot Lakhpat jail along with other convicted JuD leaders.Saeed-led JuD is the front organisation for the LeT which is responsible for carrying out the 2008 Mumbai attack that killed 166 people, including six Americans.Saeed, a UN designated terrorist whom the US has placed a USD 10 million bounty on, was arrested on July 17, 2019 last year in the terror financing cases.The US Department of the Treasury has designated Saeed as a Specially Designated Global Terrorist. He was listed under the UN Security Council Resolution 1267 in December 2008.The ATC Lahore had also sentenced LeT operation commander Zakiur Rehman Lakhvi for a collective imprisonment of 15 years on three counts in a terror financing case. He will have to serve in jail for five years as his sentence in three counts (five years each) will run concurrently.The global terror financing watchdog Financial Action Task Force (FATF) is instrumental in pushing Islamabad to take measures against terrorists roaming freely in Pakistan and using its territory to carry out attacks in India and elsewhere.The Paris-based FATF placed Pakistan on the Grey List in June 2018 and asked Islamabad to implement a plan of action to curb money laundering and terror financing by the end of 2019 but the deadline was extended later on due to Covid-19 pandemic. In February, the FATF retained Pakistan on its Grey List until June.With Pakistan's continuation in the 'grey list', the country may find it difficult to get financial aid from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, thus further enhancing problems for the cash-strapped nation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-anti-terrorism-court-jails-hafiz-saeed-s-5-aides-in-terror-financing-case-101617537035226.html

04-04-2021||World||Pope Francis urges Covid-19 vaccines for poor in Easter message||Pope Francis urged Catholics to remain hopeful in his Easter Sunday address, calling vaccines an "essential tool" in ending the pandemic and urging their swift rollout to the world's poorest countries.On the holiest holiday for the world's 1.3 billion Catholics and the second under the shadow of the coronavirus crisis, the pope focused his message on the world's most vulnerable -- the sick, migrants, people facing economic hardship, and those living in war zones like Syria, Yemen and Libya."The pandemic is still spreading, while the social and economic crisis remains severe, especially for the poor," the 84-year-old Argentine said, speaking to a congregation of only around 100 people inside the vast St. Peter's Basilica."Vaccines are an essential tool in this fight," he said, calling on the international community to overcome delays in distributing vaccines "especially in the poorest countries".Francis, who has focused on the plight of vulnerable groups since becoming pope in 2013, had already warned rich nations against vaccine hoarding in an address to the UN General Assembly in September.The pope said it was "scandalous" that armed conflicts around the world had not ceased.He called for an end to the war in Syria, "where millions of people are presently living in inhumane conditions", and in Yemen "whose situation has met with a deafening and scandalous silence".He also expressed his closeness to Myanmar's youth -- "committed to supporting democracy" -- called for dialogue between Israelis and Palestinians, and urged an end to violence in Africa, citing Nigeria, the Sahel, Northern Ethiopia's Tigray region and Cabo Delgado in Mozambique."There are still too many wars and too much violence in the world," Francis said, adding that April 4 marked an awareness day against landmines, "insidious and horrible devices".- Key month for Italy -The pope's Easter "Urbi et Orbi" ("To the city and the world") message in the Vatican came as 60 million Italians spent the Easter holiday under lockdown.The whole of Italy -- the first country in Europe to have been hit by the coronavirus -- has been declared a high-risk "red zone" from Saturday through Monday, with restrictions on movement and restaurants closed along with non-essential retail.Despite the gloom, there have been hopeful signs that vaccinations are gaining pace in Italy, while infection rates dipped in late March -- although emergency rooms remain under enormous strain.April is set to be a crucial month for Italy's vaccine rollout, with authorities hoping to administer 300,000 doses per day within two weeks, according to the country's coronavirus commissioner, General Francesco Paolo Figliuolo.Three regions, including that of Veneto which includes Venice, are also preparing to slightly loosen their anti-coronavirus rules from Tuesday onwards, passing from the most restrictive "red" zones to "orange".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-francis-urges-covid-19-vaccines-for-poor-in-easter-message-101617535344406.html
04-04-2021||World||Pope, in Easter message, slams weapons spending in time of pandemic||Pope Francis urged countries in his Easter message on Sunday to quicken distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, particularly to the world's poor, and called armed conflict and military spending during a pandemic "scandalous".Coronavirus has meant this has been the second year in a row that Easter papal services have been attended by small gatherings at a secondary altar of St. Peter's Basilica, instead of by crowds in the church or in the square outside.After saying Mass, Francis read his "Urbi et Orbi" (to the city and the world) message, in which he traditionally reviews world problems and appeals for peace."The pandemic is still spreading, while the social and economic crisis remains severe, especially for the poor. Nonetheless – and this is scandalous – armed conflicts have not ended and military arsenals are being strengthened," he said.Francis, who would normally have given the address to up to 100,000 people in St. Peter's Square, spoke to fewer than 200 in the church while the message was broadcast to tens of millions around the world.The square was empty except for a few police officers enforcing a strict three-day national lockdown.The pope asked God to comfort the sick, those who have lost a loved one, and the unemployed, urging authorities to give families in greatest need a "decent sustenance".He praised medical workers, sympathised with young people unable to attend school, and said everyone was called to combat the pandemic."I urge the entire international community, in a spirit of global responsibility, to commit to overcoming delays in the distribution of vaccines and to facilitate their distribution, especially in the poorest countries," he said.Francis, who has often called for disarmament and a total ban on the possession of nuclear weapons, said: "There are still too many wars and too much violence in the world! May the Lord, who is our peace, help us to overcome the mindset of war."'INSTRUMENTS OF DEATH'Noting that it was International Awareness Day against anti-personnel landmines, he called such weapons "insidious and horrible devices ... how much better our world would be without these instruments of death!"In mentioning conflict areas, he singled out for praise "the young people of Myanmar committed to supporting democracy and making their voices heard peacefully". More than 550 protesters have been killed since a Feb. 1 military coup in Myanmar, which the pope visited in 2017.Francis called for peace in several conflict areas in Africa, including the Tigray region of northern Ethiopia and the Cabo Delgado province of Mozambique. He said the crisis in Yemen has been "met with a deafening and scandalous silence".He appealed to Israelis and Palestinians to "rediscover the power of dialogue" to reach a two-state solution where both can live side by side in peace and prosperity.Francis said he realised many Christians were still persecuted and called for all restrictions on freedom of worship and religion worldwide to be lifted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-in-easter-message-slams-weapons-spending-in-time-of-pandemic-101617533986282.html

Some suvivors lost entire families and the youngest victim was just four.A French national and two Americans were also confirmed killed.On Saturday around one hundred relatives held an emotional Taoist prayer ceremony near the crash site.Shaded under a canopy of black umbrellas they wept openly, calling for their loved ones to "come home".Friday's crash took place at the start of the Tomb Sweeping Festival, a four-day public holiday when many Taiwanese return to villages to tidy the graves of their ancestors.Taiwan's eastern railway line, a popular tourist draw, winds its way through towering mountains and dramatic gorges before entering the picturesque Huadong Valley.The last major train derailment in Taiwan was in 2018 and left 18 people dead on the same eastern line.Taiwan's most deadly rail disaster on record was in 1948 when a train caught fire and 64 people perished.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-remorseful-truck-driver-makes-tearful-apology-over-taiwan-rail-crash-101617533055199.html

Mud inundated homes, while bridges and roads in the eastern end of the island were destroyed, according to National Disaster Mitigation Agency spokesperson Raditya Jati. Rescuers are struggling to reach the remote and worst-hit area in East Flores regency. "The only access there is by the sea from Adonara Island, but the rains -- as well as strong waves -- have prevented any crossing," Jati told AFP on Sunday. Extreme weather is expected to continue in the coming week, he added.Separately on Sunday, major floods also killed two people in Bima city in the neighbouring province of West Nusa Tenggara, according to the disaster agency. Dams in four subdistricts also overflowed, submerging nearly 10,000 houses in Bima following a nine-hour downpour, said Jati.Fatal landslides and flash floods are common across the Indonesian archipelago during the rainy season when downpours are frequent and relentless. In January, flash floods damaged the Indonesian town of Sumedang in West Java, killing 40 people. Last September, at least 11 people were killed in landslides on Borneo while a few months earlier, dozens died in landslides in Sulawesi. Indonesia's disaster agency has estimated that 125 million Indonesians -- nearly half of the country's population -- live in areas at risk of landslides.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-flash-floods-and-landslides-kill-at-least-44-leave-several-injured-101617529542230.html

The weather has been good so far, so they have no reason to stay there," he said.The Chinese Embassy in Manila responded to Lorenzana's comments, saying it was "completely normal" for Chinese vessels to fish in the area and take shelter near the reef during rough sea conditions. It added, "Nobody has the right to make wanton remarks on such activities."An international tribunal invalidated China's claim to 90% of the South China Sea in 2016, but Beijing does not recognise the ruling and has built artificial islands in the disputed waters equipped with radar, missiles batteries and hangars for fighter jets."They have done this (occupy disputed areas) before at Panatag Shoal or Bajo de Masinloc and at Panganiban Reef, brazenly violating Philippine sovereignty and sovereign rights under international law," Lorenzana said in his Sunday statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-intends-to-occupy-more-south-china-sea-areas-philippines-defence-chief-101617528307193.html
04-04-2021||World||Myanmar anti-coup protesters launch painted Easter eggs as symbol of protest||Anti-coup demonstrators in Myanmar, adept at finding themes to tie together protests nationwide, took to the streets on Sunday holding painted eggs in a nod to Easter.In the biggest city of Yangon, one group marched through the Insein district chanting and singing protest songs and cradling eggs bearing the slogan “Spring Revolution.” Many of the eggs also bore a drawing of the three-fingered salute, a symbol of resistance to the Feb. 1 coup.In Mandalay, the country’s second largest city, protesters gathered at dawn on motorbikes to shout their defiance of the power grab that overthrew the democratically elected government.Myanmar’s military has violently cracked down on protesters and others in opposition, with the latest civilian death toll since the coup at 557, according to the independent Assistance Association for Political Prisoners. More than 2,750 have been detained or sentenced, the group said.Sunday’s so-called “Easter Egg Strike” follows other themed days. They included a “Flower Strike,” in which protesters laid flowers in public places to honor those killed by security forces, and a “Silent Strike,” in which people across the country left the streets deserted.Security forces continued to spread fear among ordinary citizens. Overnight, a resident of Yangon recorded video of a group of soldiers and police using sling shots to fire stones at the windows of homes, breaking the night's silence. At other times, soldiers and police keep up their intimidation at night with raids on neighborhoods, during which they shout abuse, shoot at random, make arrests and vandalize property.On Saturday, police opened fire killing several protesters in Monywa in central Myanmar and elsewhere.With most of the internet access cut or severely restricted by the junta, it is becoming increasingly difficult for people in Myanmar to get images of their plight to the outside world.After weeks of overnight internet cutoffs, the military on Friday shut all links apart from those using fiberoptic cable, which was working at drastically reduced speeds. Access to mobile networks and all wireless — the less costly options used by most people in the developing country — remained blocked on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-anti-coup-protesters-launch-painted-easter-eggs-as-symbol-of-protest-101617528313401.html

Though churches are open, many Christians will not be able to mark their most important festival in the way that they would like, Johnson noted."This has been a very tough 12 months. But, as ever, the arrival of Easter brings with it new hope. And, this year more than ever, it brings the promise of brighter days ahead for us all. So stay safe, keep following the rules, and have a very happy Easter," he said.According to the prime minister, British Christians have demonstrated this year that Jesus Christ is "the way, and the truth, and the life" not just today but every day.He also commended the role of churches that are opening their doors as Covid-19 vaccination centers.As of Saturday, the UK has reached a milestone of 5 million people fully vaccinated against Covid-19. Over 31 million Britons have received at least one dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-says-uk-looking-forward-to-brighter-days-ahead-on-easter-101617528636176.html

The variant, known to have emerged in Britain, is feared to be highly transmissible.A total of 594 new coronavirus cases were reported in Osaka prefecture on Sunday, a day after a record 666 were confirmed.Variants of the virus have cropped up around the world since last year, including the E484 mutation detected in a growing number of cases in Tokyo, officials say.Around 70% of coronavirus patients tested at a Tokyo hospital last month carried the E484K mutation, nicknamed "Eek" by some scientists and known for reducing vaccine protection, said public broadcaster NHK.The "Eek" mutation was found in 10 of 14 people who tested positive for the virus at Tokyo Medical and Dental University Medical Hospital in March, the report said.For the two months through March, 12 of 36 Covid patients carried the mutation, with none of them having recently travelled abroad or reporting contact with people who had, it said.Hospital officials were not available to confirm the report, which said that none of the patients there carried the British strain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-japan-to-expand-emergency-measures-as-needed-amid-fears-of-new-strains-101617527227419.html

States have imposed several snap lockdowns in recent months to contain clusters.Australia has met its principal targets for vaccination start dates, Hunt added, and wants to see everyone who wants a shot getting an initial dose by the end of October. More than 841,000 vaccinations have been completed across Australia as of Saturday evening, he added.The government is behind on its vaccine rollout plans, Mark Butler of the opposition Australian Labor Party said Sunday. Prime Minister Scott Morrison had promised 4 million doses would be given by the end of March, Butler said.Australian authorities said on Saturday they were working with the European Union and the U.K. to investigate the first local case of an unusual clotting in a patient after receiving the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-sets-national-record-for-covid-19-vaccinations-in-a-day-101617523787282.html

The other vessel was the bulk carrier Habco Pioneer, which has a capacity of nearly 30,000 tonnes. Both vessels are Indonesia-flagged.There were no reports of casualties or missing crew on the Habco Pioneer, owned by tugboats and barges company PT Habco Primatama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesian-divers-hunt-17-missing-after-fishing-boat-bulk-carrier-collide-101617510545791.html
04-04-2021||World||Taiwan minister accepts responsibility for train crash as questions mount||Taiwan's transport minister said on Sunday he would not shirk his responsibility for a deadly train crash even as his resignation offer was rejected amid growing questions over safety lapses that could have contributed to the disaster.In the island's worst rail accident in seven decades, 51 people have been confirmed dead after a packed express train slammed into a truck near the eastern city of Hualien on Friday, causing it to derail and the front part to crumple.Speaking at the crash site overlooking the ocean and backed by precipitous mountains, Lin Chia-lung said he would "not avoid" responsibility."I am also in charge of minimising the damage caused by the entire accident. After the whole rescue work is completed, I believe I will take the responsibility," he said.Premier Su Tseng-chang's office said Lin had made a verbal offer to resign on Saturday, but Su rejected it for the time being, saying efforts for now should focus on rescue and recovery.The truck that the train hit had slid down a sloping road onto the track just outside a tunnel. Officials are investigating the manager of the construction site, Lee Yi-hsiang, whose truck is suspected of not having its brakes properly applied.Lee had been released on bail, though the high court's Hualien branch on Sunday rescinded that decision after the prosecutors appealed it, sending the case back to the lower court. Lee and his lawyer have declined to answer reporters' questions.Reuters was not immediately able to locate contact details for Lee or his lawyer.The transport ministry, and the rail administration which comes under it, are facing scrutiny over a number of questions, including why there was no proper fencing at the site and whether too many standing-only tickets were sold.Deputy transport minister Wang Kwo-tsai said late on Saturday the railway administration needed to take hard look at all these issues, adding that his personal feeling was that "initially it looks like negligence" on the part of the building site contractor.The railway administration is also without a permanent director after its former chief retired in January. The position is being filled in an acting capacity by another deputy transport minister, Chi Wen-chung.Wang said Lin was working hard to find the right person to fill the job.'DAUGHTER'S VOICE BECAME QUIETER AND QUIETER'The uncle of the youngest confirmed victim, a five-year-old girl, tearfully told reporters he was still waiting for an apology for the accident."I'm so angry," he said.The government has promised compensation and that it will do everything it can to help survivors and their relatives.The damaged section of the track will not reopen until April 20 at the earliest, Wang said, though rail traffic continues on a parallel track that runs through another tunnel and was not affected by the accident.Minister Lin said rescue and recovery work would continue."We continue to pull out the cabins stuck inside. The third cabin was dragged out last night. We expect to pull out two other cabins today," he added.The accident occurred at the start of a long weekend for the traditional Tomb Sweeping Day, when people return home to tend to family graves.Survivors have described horrible scenes inside the wreck.Priest Sung Chih-chiang told Reuters what surviving passenger Chung Hui-mei had told him."She could not find her daughter. When she yelled, she found her daughter was under the steel panels. She put her effort to move those pieces one by one, but her daughter's voice became quieter and quieter, and then there was no response," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-minister-accepts-responsibility-for-train-crash-as-questions-mount-101617516160996.html

04-04-2021||World||China forms vetting panel to screen out 'unpatriotic' Hong Kong poll candidates||Under China's overhaul of the electoral system of Hong Kong, a vetting committee has been set up to screen out 'unpatriotic' candidates, which will consider previous actions and words by an individual, according to the city's justice minister.Hong Kong's Justice Secretary Teresa Cheng Yeuk-wah said the new committee would receive advice from the police's national security unit and a commission led by the chief executive and supervised by Beijing, before making a decision, reported South China Morning Post (SCMP).She said that the disqualification of candidates may not necessarily indicate a breach of the national security law, adding that discussions on 'national security reasons' would be kept secret while determining the eligibility of a candidate for elections.The vetting committee, comprising principal officials, will have the power to decide who can run in elections under sweeping changes to the city's political system approved by Beijing on Tuesday.Committing acts that endangered national security, or that "undermine or have a tendency to undermine the overall interests" of Hong Kong would be considered unpatriotic under the new rules, reported SCMP.Speaking on the issue of conflict of interest for the chief executive Carrie Lam when she chairs the national security commission, Cheng said that the body was under the supervision of the central government and therefore 'it will not be that anyone can have the final say'.Reacting to this, Former Democratic Party chairwoman Emily Lau Wai-hing said the retrogression power was "very threatening" to all candidates, while it was concerning that candidates might never know the true reasons for being disqualified."So it's more like a system that the government has all the control... It is not worthwhile taking part in these elections, as no one knows about the criteria, while one may have to bear the consequences of being doxxed and investigated by the national security unit," Lau said.On Thursday, China's National Peoples' Congress Standing Committee approved sweeping changes to Hong Kong's electoral system which would empower the Election Committee - originally tasked with picking the chief executive - the right to nominate all candidates aspiring to be lawmakers and elect 40 representatives of its own to the city's Legislative Council.Despite fierce international condemnation, China approved the contentious resolution, a move that critics say could further smother opposition voices in Hong Kong. Several countries have condemned Beijing's move to overhaul Hong Kong's electoral system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-forms-vetting-panel-to-screen-out-unpatriotic-hong-kong-poll-candidates-101617513177364.html

Here's all you need to know||Hamzah bin Hussein, Jordan's former crown prince and half brother of King Abdullah II, said in a video message on Saturday that he has been placed under "house arrest". This comes amid a series of arrests of high-profile figures in the kingdom, including a member of the royal family and a longtime confidant of the monarch, citing reasons related to "the security and stability of Jordan", The New York Times reports.'Plot' to unseat King Abdullah IIThe 59-year-old King Abdullah II has ruled Jordan since 1999, when he succeeded his father, King Hussein, to the throne. Prince Hamzah is the eldest son of the late King Hussain and his fourth wife Queen Noor and was born to a Syrian-American family. Now, although Hamzah was named the crown prince of Jordan back in '99, his half-brother and current king, King Abdullah II, transferred the title of the crown prince to his son, Prince Hussein, in 2004.According to a report by The Washington Post on Saturday, as many as 20 of Jordan's high-ranking individuals have now been arrested on security concerns, amid an ongoing investigation into an alleged plot to unseat Hamza's older half brother, King Abdullah II. The arrested aides include Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, a member of Jordan's royal family and former envoy to Saudi Arabia, and former finance minister Bassem Ibrahim Awadallah, a longtime confidante of King Abdullah II. The two senior palace officials and the unnamed "others" were reportedly arrested after a "close security follow-up."Prince Hamza's video messageIn the six-minute video message apparently filmed on Saturday and provided to the BBC by his lawyer, Jordan's former crown prince Hamzah bin Hussein described how he had been ordered to remain in his home incommunicado with his wife and children. "Since then, a number of the people I know -- or my friends -- have been arrested, my security has been removed, and the internet and phone lines have been cut," The Times quotes the former crown prince of Jordan as saying. "This is my last form of communication, satellite internet, that I have, and I have been informed by the company that they are instructed to cut it so it may be the last time I am able to communicate," Prince Hamza said, adding that he was making this recording to make it clear that he is "not part of any conspiracy or nefarious organisation or foreign-backed group, as is always the claim here for anyone who speaks out."Malik R Dahlan, an international lawyer, confirmed to the New York Times that the video was of Prince Hamzah, who serves on the board of his Institution Quraysh for Law & Policy in London.The Jordanian army and security services, in an earlier statement published by the Petra news agency, had denied reports that Prince Hamza had been arrested. The former crown prince of Jordan was later asked "to cease all movements or activities that could be employed to target Jordan's security and stability," The Post reported, quoting a statement by the Jordanian Armed Forces which confirmed the multiple arrests.Arrests of top officials and royal family members are unusual in Jordan, a normally stable Arab kingdom that has been a stalwart ally of the West, particularly when it comes to counterterrorism cooperation in the Middle East. It borders Israel, the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Syria and Iraq, the Post reported.International reactionsJordan is regarded as a vital ally of the United States in the Middle East and has been a major partner in the US-led campaign against the Islamic State. Jordan receives annual aid from Washington and the US most recently provided Jordan with $700 million in August.The US state department on Saturday said, “We are closely following the reports and in touch with Jordanian officials," Ned Price, a state department spokesperson, said in a statement. "King Abdullah is a key partner of the United States, and he has our full support."Saudi Arabia and Egypt too have expressed their support to King Abdullah, news agency AFP reported. Responding to the arrests, Saudi officials said they supported the Jordanian king’s decisions and measures to preserve security and stability and face any attempt to affect them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-jordan-placed-its-former-crown-prince-under-house-arrest-101617508469184.html

04-04-2021||World||Vietnamese citizens accuse H&M of kowtowing to China over 'problematic map'||Social media users in Vietnam have accused Swedish fashion retailer H&M of kowtowing to Beijing after the company agreed to change the map online to show disputed territories in the South China Sea as part of China.This comes after Chinese regulators said H&M has agreed to change a "problematic map" online following government criticism. On Friday, the Shanghai branch of the Cyberspace Administration of China said it had been alerted by members of the public to a "problematic map of China" on H&M's website.It did not specify what was wrong with the illustration, but on Weibo - China's Twitter-like platform - a graphic from an earlier People's Daily report showing the so-called nine-dash line - the mark Beijing uses to claim about 90 per cent of the disputed waters of the South China Sea - was widely shared, South China Morning Post reported.The Shanghai municipal bureau of planning and natural resources ordered the "error" to be remedied immediately and H&M complied, according to the cyberspace watchdog.However, the retailer's apparent concession did not go down well in Vietnam, which holds rival claims to some of the territories contained within the nine-dash line.Twitter users proclaimed that Paracel and Spratly Islands belong to Vietnam "due to international law" and that the H&M brand will now be "fighting against the law" Another social media user called the brand "stupid" and asked it to "get out of the country", using the local names for the Paracel and Spratly island chains in the South China Sea that are claimed by both Beijing and Hanoi.China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and has overlapping territorial claims with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan. Beijing's rising assertiveness against counter claimants in the East and South Sea has resulted in unprecedented agreement across the Indo-Pacific.Foreign companies in China including H&M and Nike are facing tremendous pressure following their statement on forced labour in Xinjiang. They are also been subjected to pressure amid China's rising tension with the west.Recently, several companies including H&M said they were concerned about allegations that forced labour has been used to produce cotton in Xinjiang.The ruling Communist Party lashed out at H&M, Nike and other shoe and clothing brands last week after the United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed travel and financial sanctions on officials accused of abuses in Xinjiang in China's northwest.Chinese media has called for Chinese boycotts of Swedish multinational retailer H&M, sports apparel powerhouses Nike and Adidas; New Balance; Burberry and other members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) that have voiced concerns or pledged not to use supply chain components produced in Xinjiang, South China Morning Post reported.Swedish multinational H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, has been pulled from major e-commerce stores in China and blocked by several major navigation, review and rating apps.Dozens of Chinese celebrities have terminated contracts or said they would cut ties with these brands, including Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Uniqlo -- a move lauded by state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnamese-citizens-accuse-h-m-of-kowtowing-to-china-over-problematic-map-101617507058118.html
04-04-2021||World||Canada’s Covid-19 tally passes 1 million-mark amid third wave of pandemic||Covid-19 cases in Canada breached the 1 million mark as a third wave ripples across the country.The country had recorded 1,001,650 cases since the start of the pandemic as of Saturday afternoon, according to the Canadian Press. Canada, like other nations, is grappling with the spread of new variants that are sending more people to hospital and resulting in stricter lockdown measures.Ontario began a four-week, province-wide lockdown on Saturday at 12:01 a.m. Toronto time -- lowering capacity for stores and shutting down hair salons, indoor restaurant dining, gyms and most sporting activities and events.Quebec is closing schools and non-essential stores for 10 days in two regions, while British Columbia this week prohibited indoor dining and gyms from opening until April 19. So far, about 14% of Canada’s population has received at least one dose of vaccine versus 31% in the U.S., according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadas-covid-19-tally-passes-1-million-mark-amid-third-wave-of-pandemic-101617501509520.html
04-04-2021||World||MLB pulls All-Star game from Atlanta over Georgia's new voting laws. Here's where the dispute stands||A dispute, in the making over the last two weeks, has now broken out over Georgia's new election laws, which critics say is specifically aimed at suppressing the minority vote that helped US President Joe Biden in his race to the White House last November. The corporate world has been joining in on the dissent against the law, and on Sunday, Major League Baseball (MLB) said it was moving this year’s All-Star Game and the MLB Draft event from Atlanta to show its concern for voting rights in the state of Georgia.“I have decided that the best way to demonstrate our values as a sport is by relocating this year’s All-Star Game and MLB Draft,” news agency Bloomberg quoted MLB commissioner Robert Manfred Jr as saying. “Major League Baseball fundamentally supports voting rights for all Americans and opposes restrictions to the ballot box,” he added.Georgia's new voting law, which was signed into effect on March 25, intends to make several changes in the way elections are conducted in the state. The law gives the Georgia election board powers to interfere in the election offices of 159 counties and imposes ID requirements for absentee ballots, replacing the current system that required only signatures. The new voting law in Georgia also limits the use of ballot drop boxes and shortens the time for runoff elections in the state from nine weeks to four weeks.Also Read: Explained: Georgia's new voting law that Biden called 'Jim Crow in 21st centuryThe new voting law in Georgia has found several critics, with the Democratic Party saying the legislation will restrict voting access, especially for people of colour. This comes as a crucial objection since Georgia — being a 'battleground state' — was at the centre of the US presidential elections last year. Having voted in favour of the Republican party for years, Georgia switched its trend in the 2020 elections, making Biden the first Democrat to win in Georgia since 1992. Analysts believed that the state turned blue as a large number of people of colour voted for the Democrats. This electorate, the Democrats believe, is what is at stake now on account of the new voting laws.Also Read: 'No accident': Georgia governor signs voting bill under slave plantation painting, sparks rowUS President Joe Biden, in a statement last week, compared the new election laws in Georgia to the 19th-century Jim Crow laws, which once legalised racial segregation and disenfranchised Black citizens in America’s South. The Republicans, on the other hand, have claimed that Georgia's new voting laws will help 'restore' the confidence which people lost after the 2020 elections. Former US president Donald Trump, who led the allegations of "voter fraud" in Georgia following the elections, is now back in on the debate over the new voting laws. According to a report by the Associated Press, he has endorsed the new voting laws in Georgia and urged his supporters to fight "woke cancel culture" by boycotting the corporate entities objecting to the legislation.Former US president Barack Obama on Saturday commended MLB in a tweet for “taking a stand on behalf of voting rights for all citizens.” The CEOs of Atlanta-based Delta Air Lines and Coca-Cola have condemned Georgia's new voting laws as being "too restrictive", reports AP. A joint statement from executives of nearly 200 companies, including HP, Microsoft, PayPal, Target, Twitter, Uber and Under Armour, also took aim at the legislation “threatening to make voting more difficult" and said “elections are not improved” when lawmakers impose new barriers to voting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mlb-pulls-all-star-game-from-atlanta-over-georgia-s-new-voting-laws-101617501635876.html
04-04-2021||World||Vaccine passports become latest flash point in Covid-19 politics||Vaccine passports being developed to verify Covid-19 immunization status and allow inoculated people to more freely travel, shop and dine have become the latest flash point in America’s perpetual political wars, with Republicans portraying them as a heavy-handed intrusion into personal freedom and private health choices.They currently exist in only one state — a limited government partnership in New York with a private company — but that hasn’t stopped GOP lawmakers in a handful of states from rushing out legislative proposals to ban their use.The argument over whether passports are a sensible response to the pandemic or governmental overreach echoes the bitter disputes over the past year about masks, shutdown orders and even the vaccines themselves.Vaccine passports are typically an app with a code that verifies whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for Covid-19. They are in use in Israel and under development in parts of Europe, seen as a way to safely help rebuild the pandemic- devastated travel industry.They are intended to allow businesses to more safely open up as the vaccine drive gains momentum, and they mirror measures already in place for schools and overseas travel that require proof of immunization against various diseases.But lawmakers around the country are already taking a stand against the idea. GOP senators in Pennsylvania are drawing up legislation that would prohibit vaccine passports, also known as health certificates or travel passes, from being used to bar people from routine activities.“We have constitutional rights and health privacy laws for a reason,” said Pennsylvania House Majority Leader Kerry Benninghoff, a Republican. “They should not cease to exist in a time of crisis. These passports may start with Covid-19, but where will they end?”Benninghoff said this week his concern was “using taxpayer money to generate a system that will now be, possibly, in the hands of mega-tech organizations who’ve already had problems with getting hacked and security issues.”A Democratic colleague, Rep. Chris Rabb of Philadelphia, sees value in vaccine passports if they are implemented carefully.“There’s a role for using technology and other means to confirm people’s statuses,” Rabb said. “But we do have concerns around privacy, surveillance and inequitable access.”Republican legislators in other states have also been drafting proposals to ban or limit them. A bill introduced in the Arkansas Legislature on Wednesday would prevent government officials from requiring vaccine passports for any reason, and would ban their use as a condition of “entry, travel, education, employment or services.”The sponsor, Republican state Sen. Trent Garner, called vaccine passports “just another example of the Biden administration using Covid-19 to put regulations or restrictions on everyday Americans.”President Joe Biden's administration has largely taken a hands-off approach on vaccine passports.At a news conference this week, Andy Slavitt, acting administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said he considered them a project for the private sector, not the government.He said the government is considering federal guidelines to steer the process surrounding vaccine passports. Among its concerns: Not everyone who would need a passport has a smartphone; passports should be free and in multiple languages; and private health information must be protected."There will be organizations that want to use these. There will be organizations that don’t want to use these,” said Dr. Brian Anderson of Mitre, which operates federally funded research centers and is part of a coalition working to develop standards for vaccine certifications to make their use easier across vendors.Anderson noted the Vaccination Credential Initiative is not making recommendations on how — or even if — organizations choose to use the certifications.In Montana, GOP lawmakers this week voted along party lines to advance a pair of bills that would ban discrimination based on vaccine status or possession of an immunity passport, and to prohibit using vaccine status or passports to obtain certain benefits and services.And a freshman Republican state lawmaker in Ohio spoke out about the concept, saying more restrictions or mandates are not the answer to every Covid-19 problem.“Ohioans are encouraged to take the Covid-19 vaccine for the health and well-being of themselves and others,” Rep. Al Cutrona said. “However, a vaccine should not be mandated or required by our government for our people to integrate back to a sense of normalcy.”Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis on Friday issued an executive order that said no governmental entity can issue a vaccine passport, and businesses in that state can't require them. He said he expected the Legislature to pass a similar law.His order said requiring "so-called Covid-19 vaccine passports for taking part in everyday life — such as attending a sporting event, patronizing a restaurant, or going to a movie theater — would create two classes of citizens.”US Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Georgia, a newly elected member who has embraced and promoted a range of far-right political positions, told her supporters on Facebook earlier this week that “something called a vaccine passport” was a form of “corporate communism” and part of a Democratic effort to control people’s lives.And a GOP lawmaker in Louisiana has teed up a bill to keep the state from including any vaccination information on the Louisiana driver’s license or to make issuance of a driver’s license subject to vaccine status.In New York, a government-sponsored vaccine passport called the Excelsior Pass is being introduced. A smartphone app, it shows whether someone has been vaccinated or recently tested negative for Covid-19.Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo touted the idea as letting an event venue usher, for example, use their own smartphone to scan a concertgoer’s code.New York officials have not released specific details about how the app will work, access someone’s vaccination or testing status or protect a user’s name, date of birth or the location where their code was scanned. The app’s privacy policy says data will be “maintained in a secure manner” and won’t be used for sales or marketing purposes or shared with a third party. But some privacy experts say the public needs more specifics to ensure its information is protected.Albert Fox Cahn, founder and executive director of the Surveillance Technology Oversight Project at the Urban Justice Center, a New York–based civil rights and privacy group, warned the Excelsior Pass creates a new layer of surveillance without sufficient details about how it collects data or protects privacy."We basically only have screenshots of the user interface and not much more,” Cahn said of Excelsior Pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-passports-are-latest-flash-point-in-covid-19-politics-101617494944273.html
04-04-2021||World||In New York, pandemic pushes some Orthodox Jews to leave their community||Two months into lockdown, 29-year-old Ella left the ultra-Orthodox Jewish community that she was raised in near New York, started wearing trouser pants for the first time and contacted an organization that helps "leavers" adapt to life in wider society.US groups like the one she approached report increased demand for their services since coronavirus, from people with more time for soul-searching to others troubled by social distancing violations and some who have already left needing counseling and financial support.Ella, an alias because she has yet to tell her parents that she has quit Orthodoxy, said she was always interested in the world outside her "extremely religious family." When she was younger she hid romance novels under her mattress and sometimes "pushed" the limits of her community's strict dress code.In the summer of 2019, she and her husband took their first steps towards breaking away by moving a couple of miles down the road to a community whose adherence to Jewish law was not quite as strict.When lockdown happened in March 2020, they found themselves cut off from friends and family, which gave them space and months to think about whether they wanted to take the next step and leave their community altogether."We had time to cement our new identity and feel confident that we made the right decision before having to face anybody," said Ella.She was one of more than 150 people in 2020 who joined the New York-based organization Freidom, which supports former ultra-Orthodox, or Haredi, Jews, primarily Yiddish speakers, navigate culture and language in secular US society.The group saw a 50 percent increase in participation in events -- which typically include hikes, cinema and restaurant trips but are currently virtual -- from new members last year, according to founder Gene Steinberg.Not all newly left: like 25-year-old Ben, who received counseling after he separated from his wife, a marriage that had been arranged, shortly before lockdown and found himself living alone without his kids.The non-profit Footsteps has seen its membership increase by around an 18 percent over the past year, according to one of its officials, Yael Reisman.For her, large weddings and funerals organized by some Orthodox rabbis last summer despite distancing restrictions coupled with a devastating death toll in Hasidic communities early on in the city's outbreak, contributed to the questioning.Areas of Brooklyn with a large Haredi population, such as Borough Park, resisted some measures, including through protests, prompting authorities to intervene and sparking controversy that they were being unfairly targeted."You start to think that the people you rely on and trust maybe aren't doing it the right way," said Reisman.Footsteps has also seen acute need from long-time members due to food insecurity, housing instability and mental health issues brought on by the Covid-19, says Reisman.- 'Unorthodox' -Shaya Schtroks, a 34-year-old former rabbi who left Hasidism nine years ago, said he received a "critical" $10,000 after the pandemic scuppered his real estate finance business.The swelling of online events has made it easier to join the groups, especially for people outside the New York region, home to the largest Jewish population outside Israel, with some two million people from secular to Haredi.At the same time, many of the tempting pleasures of a less religious life, such as shows or bars, are on hold."I think it's bringing more people out. But I also think it's slowing down their process," said Reisman.The idea of leaving ultra-Orthodoxy was the subject of the hit 2020 Netflix series "Unorthodox."No concrete numbers exist to assess how many leave, says sociologist Schneur Zalman Newfield. The communities themselves remain silent and many who leave do so in secrecy."I do think it's more common. People on the inside are more aware of the process," said Newfield.Members of Orthodox groups stress sense of solidarity and belonging that exists in the tight-knit communities.Rabbi Yaacov Behrman,spokesman for the Brooklyn-based Chabad Lubavitch Headquarters, said there were "many resources available" to people in need during the pandemic.Project Makom, an initiative that helps former and questioning Haredis find their place within Orthodoxy, has seen membership almost double from 85 in 2019 to 160 in 2020."A lot of people are sort of restructuring their priorities right now, and so this group is not different," said founder Allison Josephs.Ella enjoyed a low-key Passover this week as she contemplates her new life."I finally have the chance to think for myself but I'm not exactly used to doing it. So I'm trying to explore what I want for my future," she said.pdh/dwNEWFIELD EXPLORATION||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-new-york-pandemic-pushes-some-orthodox-jews-to-leave-their-community-101617498978384.html
04-04-2021||World||Canada becomes 23rd country to cross 1 million Covid-19 infections mark||Canada on Saturday evening crossed one million Covid-19 infections mark, 14 months after reporting its first case on January 25 last year and becoming the 23rd country to cross the grim milestone. The total number of infections in the country stood at 1,001,651 after the province of British Columbia reported its latest figures, according to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC).Canada has seen a sharp rise in cases in recent weeks as more contagious variants of the disease are feared to be spreading rapidly. Canada’s chief public health officer Dr Theresa Tam tweeted that “with the ongoing increase in infection rates and rising proportion of cases involving more contagious #VariantsofConcern, we need to maintain a high degree of caution everywhere.”Canada recorded 9,941 new infections on Saturday, an increase of 35% over the daily figure two weeks earlier. The disease has also caused 23,050 deaths so far.The rising caseload has resulted in several provinces enforcing restrictive measures again, including a shutdown starting Saturday in Ontario. Quebec also announced a lockdown in three cities last week, and British Columbia, too, has announced greater restrictions.The restrictions come in even as over five million people in the country have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine. Variants originating in the United Kingdom, Brazil and South Africa have caused particular concern in recent days and the head of the newly-formed Coronavirus Variants Rapid Response Network has said that Covid-19 vaccinations could become an annual feature. In an interview with CBC, virologist Dr Marc-André Langlois from the University of Ottawa said that variants may stay “around for a long time” and “may even become endemic”, which could mean that “every year when we get our flu shot, we’ll be getting our coronavirus shot for whatever variants are circulating at that specific time.”Canada’s first case was spotted on January 25 last year in a man who had returned to Toronto from the Chinese city of Wuhan, the epicentre of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-becomes-23rd-country-to-cross-1-million-covid-19-infections-mark-101617504309818.html

But when reports of the container ship Ever Given being wedged across the Suez Canal emerged, 29-year-old Elselehdar was on duty hundreds of miles away in the Mediterranean port city of Alexandria."I was shocked," she said, according to the report. "I felt that I might be targeted maybe because I'm a successful female in this field or because I'm Egyptian, but I'm not sure," she added. Also Read | Stuck in Suez: Thousands of animals packed tight in ship hullsElselehdar is among the 2 per cent of the world's women seafarers, the report said. "People in our society still don't accept the idea of girls working in the sea away from their families for a long time. But when you do what you love, it is not necessary for you to seek the approval of everyone," she said.Screenshots of a fake news headline and a doctored image picked from a news story released on March 22, which profiles Elselehdar, were doing the rounds on social media, paving the way to the rumours that she was involved in the Suez incident. "This fake article was in English so it spread in other countries. I tried so hard to negate what was in the article because it was affecting my reputation and all the efforts I exerted to be where I am now," she said.Traffic congestion that affected trade across the world was caused as a result of the skyscraper-sized container ship being stuck in the Suez Canal. More than 300 ships were waiting to pass the Suez Canal, many with animals as cargo, as rescue efforts were on for almost a week. The ship was freed on March 29 and the world's commerce resumed its course after the traffic cleared to a large extent on April 3.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egypts-first-female-ship-captain-marwa-elselehdar-says-blamed-for-blocking-suez-canal-101617500257863.html

The other companies did not immediately respond to queries for comment.Google has pledged to steer clear of tracking individual online activity when it begins implementing a new system for targeting ads without the use of so-called "cookies."The internet giant's widely used Chrome browser recently began testing an alternative to the tracking practice that it believes could improve online privacy while still enabling advertisers to serve up relevant messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-lawmakers-press-online-ad-auctioneers-over-user-data-101617494896214.html
04-04-2021||World||Egyptian mummies paraded through Cairo on way to new museum||A grand parade conveyed 22 ancient Egyptian royal mummies in special capsules across the capital Cairo on Saturday to a new museum home where they can be displayed in greater splendour.The convoy transported 18 kings and four queens, mostly from the New Kingdom, from the Egyptian Museum in central Cairo's Tahrir Square to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization in Fustat, about 5km (3 miles) to the south-east.Authorities shut down roads along the Nile for the elaborate ceremony, designed to drum up interest in Egypt's rich collections of antiquities when tourism has almost entirely stalled because of Covid-19 related restrictions.As the royal mummies arrived at the museum, which was officially inaugurated on Saturday, cannons fired a 21-gun salute. President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi stood by as the mummies filed past on vehicles bedecked with golden pharaonic motifs.The heads of the U.N. cultural agency UNESCO and the World Tourism Organization were also present at the ceremony.Each mummy had been placed in a special capsule filled with nitrogen to ensure protection, Egyptian archaeologist Zahi Hawass said.They were carried on vehicles designed to cradle them and provide stability.'CIVILISED' DISPLAY"We chose the Civilization Museum because we want, for the first time, to display the mummies in a civilized manner, an educated manner, and not for amusement as they were in the Egyptian Museum," Hawass said.Archaeologists discovered the mummies in two batches at the complex of mortuary temples of Deir Al Bahari in Luxor and at the nearby Valley of the Kings from 1871.The oldest is that of Seqenenre Tao, the last king of the 17th Dynasty, who reigned in the 16th century BC and is thought to have met a violent death.The parade also included the mummies of Ramses II, Seti I, and Ahmose-Nefertari.Fustat, the home of the new museum, was the site of Egypt's capital under the Umayyad dynasty after the Arab conquest."By doing it like this, with great pomp and circumstance, the mummies are getting their due," said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo."These are the kings of Egypt, these are the pharaohs. And so, it is a way of showing respect."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egyptian-mummies-paraded-through-cairo-on-way-to-new-museum-101617494681227.html

President Emmanuel Macron has pledged more hospital beds to care for critically ill Covid-19 patients.Macron had hoped to steer France out of the pandemic without having to impose a third national lockdown that would further batter an economy still reeling from last year's slump.But new strains of the virus have swept across France and much of Europe, amid a slower rollout of anti-Covid vaccines in the European Union than in some countries including Britain and the United States.Health authorities did not publish new case numbers on Saturday, citing a problem with the flow of data from some test results.According to an Ifop poll of 1,021 people carried out online on April 1 and published on Sunday in Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD) newspaper, a majority of French people expressed misgivings over the government's handling of the pandemic.Fifty-eight percent of people said they did not trust the vaccination campaign would be carried out according to plan.However, a majority of people, 51%, said they did plan to get a Covid-19 vaccine, with only 34% saying they would not. Another 15% said they had already been inoculated.Macron has vowed to speed up France's vaccination campaign, and the defence ministry said late on Saturday that seven military hospitals would be mobilised from April 6 to administer doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-reports-further-rise-in-covid-19-intensive-care-patients-101617495058072.html

"However, a small minority did not engage despite the repeated efforts of officers on the ground."This left us with no option but to move to an enforcement stage and arrests have been made."Free speechThe new bill follows action by Extinction Rebellion which paralysed parts of London in early 2019 and fuelled calls from some politicians for the police to be given tougher powers to prevent excessive disruption.Since the proposed law was brought before parliament last month, there have been sporadic demonstrations across the country, with Saturday's rallies being part of what organisers said was a national weekend of action."(I'm here) to defend the rights of free speech, and the rights of organisations in our society," said Jeremy Corbyn, former leader of the main opposition Labour Party, who was among those who took part in the London protest."These demonstrations, 50 of them today, will make a difference," he told Reuters opposite the Houses of Parliament.Much of the protest so far has been focused in the southwestern English city of Bristol. Some demonstrations there have turned violent, with officers bombarded with missiles and police vehicles set on fire, which Prime Minister Boris Johnson described as "disgraceful attacks".A large crowd gathered again in Bristol on Saturday evening, although the rally remained peaceful.Some senior officers have said the "kill the bill" tag was deliberately provocative as "the bill" is a nickname in Britain for the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-in-london-as-thousands-join-kill-the-bill-rallies-across-britain-101617494662064.html
04-04-2021||World||Suspect's wife says she 'can't understand' California attack||The estranged wife of the man who allegedly went on a shooting rampage in a Southern California office building earlier this week that left four people dead — including a 9-year-old boy — said Saturday that she couldn't fathom why her husband targeted people who had treated her like family for more than a decade.Police say the suspect, Aminadab Gaxiola Gonzalez, had targeted the mobile home brokerage company, Unified Homes, and had personal and business relationships with the victims. His wife, Aleyda Mendoza, had worked in the Orange County business for more than 10 years as a broker assistant.Mendoza, in a text message to The Associated Press, said she and Gaxiola have been separated for two years and “he never told me anything about where he was staying or what he was doing.”“I can’t understand what went through his head to make such a terrifying decision,” Mendoza wrote. “He left behind a sea of pain and grief for so many families who can’t find comfort.”Gaxiola, 44, was charged with four murder counts and three attempted murder counts for firing at two officers who were not hit and for critically wounding the boy’s mother, authorities said. His arraignment is scheduled for Monday.The shooting in the city or Orange, southeast of Los Angeles, was the nation’s third major mass shooting in just over two weeks. The other shootings — in Colorado and Georgia — left 18 dead.Authorities identified the people killed in the California attack as Luis Tovar, 50, who owned Unified Homes; Leticia Solis Guzman, 58; and Jenevieve Raygoza, 28, and her brother, Matthew Farias, 9.Mendoza said the people at Unified Homes “always supported me” and her children.“Unified Homes was my home for more than 10 years and they were my family,” she wrote. “I learned everything I know there and they shaped who I am today.”Usually, Matthew was at day care after school but Wednesday afternoon he was with his mother, Blanca Tamayo, who worked at Unified Homes. She was the only person shot who survived. When police arrived Tamayo was cradling her dead son.Tovar had a previous relationship with Tamayo and they were Raygoza’s parents.Mendoza said she and her children now fear for their lives because they have received threatening calls since the shooting.“My heart is crushed, I still can’t accept that this happened,” she wrote. “I keep closing my eyes and praying to God this is all just a bad dream and I’ll wake up soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suspects-wife-says-she-can-t-understand-california-attack-101617489245485.html
04-04-2021||World||Pope urges hope amid 'darkness' of pandemic in Easter vigil||Pope Francis urged his coronavirus-weary flock to not lose hope even through the continued “dark months” of the pandemic as he celebrated a scaled-back Easter vigil service in St. Peter’s Basilica on Saturday.Due to social-distancing norms, only about 200 masked people were allowed to attend the service, which marks the period between Christ’s crucifixion and his joyous resurrection on Easter Sunday.For the second year in a row, the Vatican cut out the traditional sacrament of baptism for a handful of adults to limit the chance of contagion. Usually a long, late-night ritual, this year's vigil service also started earlier than usual to respect Italy’s 10 p.m. Covid-19 curfew.But the service began in the dramatic way it always does, with the pope lighting a single candle in the darkened basilica and then sharing its flame with others until the pews slowly begin to twinkle and the basilica's lights are turned on.In his homily, Francis said Easter offers a message of hope and new starts.“In these dark months of the pandemic, let us listen to the risen Lord as he invites us to begin anew and never lose hope,” he said. “It is always possible to begin anew, because there is a new life that God can awaken in us in spite of all our failures.”Francis, who again eschewed a facemask, limped considerably through the service, in a sign that he is suffering through a prolonged bout of sciatica nerve pain.On Sunday, Francis is to preside over Easter Mass before a similarly small group of faithful and deliver his traditional “Urbi et Orbi” blessing “to the city and the world.” Usually the Easter Mass and blessing is celebrated before tens of thousands of people in a flower-decked St. Peter’s Square.But this year Francis will celebrate the service in the basilica and deliver the blessing from the altar, to prevent crowds from forming in the piazza.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-urges-hope-amid-darkness-of-pandemic-in-easter-vigil-101617489006176.html
04-04-2021||World||France cuts growth forecast as new nationwide lockdown starts||France’s economy will rebound less than previously expected this year due to the latest four-week nationwide lockdown aimed at halting a surge in coronavirus cases.French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire cut the country’s 2021 GDP growth forecast to 5% from 6%, following an 8.1% contraction last year. A Bloomberg survey in March showed economists were expecting the economy to expand 5.7%.“Closing education establishments and 150,000 stores is essential to slow the spread of the virus, but these measures will have an impact on the French economy,” Le Maire told Le Journal du Dimanche newspaper in an interview published on Sunday. “This estimate is both sincere and cautious.”President Emmanuel Macron sought to avoid a third nationwide lockdown to protect the economy but was forced last week to announce tighter restrictions across the country. More contagious, deadlier variants have accelerated the spread of the virus, and the vaccination campaign is yet to have a significant impact after getting off to a slow start.Schools still closedThe new lockdown came into force Saturday night after a week that saw more than 200,000 new coronavirus cases and as close to 5,500 patients are in intensive care. As well as stores closing, schools will remain shut for three weeks including the holiday period.Le Maire said government assistance to businesses impacted by the lockdown would cost around 11 billion euros ($12.9 billion) in April.ECB Governing Council member and Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau has urged the European Union to implement a joint recovery fund urgently to help countries cope with the impact of Covid-19.Le Maire echoed the call, saying Europe must not delay. France was due to receive 5 billion euros from the 750 billion-euro fund in July but this was now unlikely, the finance minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-cuts-growth-forecast-as-new-nationwide-lockdown-starts-101617488189975.html

He was last seen wearing a dark camouflage sweater, dark sweatpants and black sandals. Police said he was wearing a black sock on his left foot and a white sock on his right foot.The woman was riding a southbound No. 5 train headed to Times Square with her three children at about 2:30 p.m. Tuesday when the man yelled anti-Asian slurs at them, spit twice in her direction and knocked her cellphone out of her hand, police said. The man then kicked the phone out the train's back door and onto the tracks before fleeing on West 41st Street, authorities said.The woman was taken to a hospital in stable condition for observation, officers said.Anyone with information about the incident is urged to call New York City police.The attack was among the latest in a national spike in anti-Asian hate crimes. Also near Times Square last week, a 65-year-old Filipina American woman was viciously assaulted while walking to church. A parolee convicted of killing his mother nearly two decades ago was charged with assault and attempted assault as hate crimes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/man-on-subway-spat-at-woman-yelled-anti-asian-slurs-police-101617487986792.html
04-04-2021||World||Ukrainian soldier killed amid fresh tensions in east||Russian-backed separatists accused Ukrainian forces of killing a child in a drone attack on Saturday, as Kiev reported the death of one of its soldiers in a mine explosion.Kiev has been battling pro-Russian separatists in the eastern Donetsk and Lugansk regions since 2014, following Moscow's annexation of the Crimean peninsula.Reports this week swirled of Russian troop movements and an escalation of armed clashes, while Moscow and Kiev's Western allies exchanged warnings.Self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic (DPR) claimed that a five-year-old child was killed and a woman injured on Saturday in a Ukrainian drone attack.A report by the DPR's news agency has not provided any images of the aftermath of the attack allegedly carried out in the village of Oleksandrivske some 15 kilometres (nine miles) from the front line.The claim cannot be independently verified as both international monitors and the Ukrainian defence ministry have not responded to AFP's requests for a comment.Meanwhile, a Ukrainian soldier was killed when an explosive device went off near the village of Shumy north of the separatist's de facto capital Donetsk, the army said."A soldier from the Joint Forces received an injury incompatible with life," the Ukrainian military said in a statement posted on Facebook.- Germany, France urge 'restraint' -Ukraine this week accused Russia of massing thousands of military personnel on its northern and eastern borders as well as on the Crimean peninsula.Moscow has repeatedly denied sending troops and arms to back up the separatists and Russian President Vladimir Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov stressed on Thursday that Moscow is at liberty to move troops across its territory.Germany and France, which have played a mediating role in Russia-Ukraine tensions, released a joint statement on Saturday calling for "restraint" and "immediate de-escalation" from all sides.Reaffirming their "support for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine", Berlin and Paris said they were "concerned about the growing number of violations of the ceasefire" brokered last July.On Friday US President Joe Biden affirmed his "unwavering support" for Ukraine in a call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky after Russia earlier that day warned the West against sending troops to Ukraine to buttress its ally.Moscow and Kiev this week blamed each other for a rise in violence along the frontline that has undermined the ceasefire.Zelensky said on Thursday that 20 Ukrainian servicemen had been killed since the start of the year.The fighting has claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2014, according to the United Nations.bur-dg/dl/harFACEBOOK||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukrainian-soldier-killed-amid-fresh-tensions-in-east-101617487719126.html
04-04-2021||World||In alleged coup, Jordan prince placed under house arrest||The half-brother of Jordan's King Abdullah said Saturday he has been placed under house arrest by Jordanian authorities and accused the country's leadership of corruption and incompetence.In a videotaped statement leaked to the British Broadcasting Corp., Prince Hamzah said he was visited early Saturday by the country's military chief and told "I was not allowed to go out, to communicate with people or to meet with them.”He said his security detail was removed, and his phone and Internet service had been cut. He said he was speaking over satellite Internet, but expected that service to be cut as well. The BBC says it received the statement from Hamzah's lawyer.In the statement, Hamzah said he had been informed he was being punished for taking in part in meetings in which the king had been criticized, though he himself was not accused of being a direct critic.He said he told the army chief: “I am not the person responsible for the breakdown in governance, for the corruption and for the incompetence that has been prevalent in our governing structure for the last 15 to 20 years and has been getting worse by the year. I am not responsible for the lack of faith that people have in their institutions. They are responsible.”The country's top general had earlier denied that Hamzah — a former crown prince stripped of the title in 2004 — was arrested or under house arrest, even as authorities announced the arrests of former senior officials close to the ruling monarchy.Hamzah was asked to “stop some movements and activities that are being used to target Jordan's security and stability,” said Gen. Yousef Huneiti, the army chief of staff.He said an investigation was ongoing and its results would be made public “in a transparent and clear form.”“No one is above the law and Jordan’s security and stability are above all,” he told the official Petra news agency.Petra had earlier reported that two senior officials who formerly worked for the palace, along with other suspects, had been arrested for “security reasons,” without providing further details.The Petra report said Sharif Hassan bin Zaid, a member of the royal family, and Bassem Ibrahim Awadallah, a former head of the royal court, were detained. Awadallah, also previously served as planning minister and finance minister and has private business interests throughout the Gulf region.The agency did not provide further details or name the others who were arrested.“We are closely following the reports and in touch with Jordanian officials,” State Department spokesman Ned Price said. “King Abdullah is a key partner of the United States, and he has our full support.”Saudi Arabia's official news agency said the kingdom “confirmed its full support to Jordan and its king and crown prince in all decisions and procedures to maintain security and stability and defuse any attempt to affect them.”Abdullah has ruled Jordan since the 1999 death of of his father, King Hussein, who ruled the country for close to a half-century. The king has cultivated close relations with U.S. and other Western leaders over the years, and Jordan was a key ally in the war against the Islamic State group. The country borders Israel, the occupied West Bank, Syria, Iraq and Saudi Arabia.Jordan’s economy has been battered by the coronavirus pandemic. The country, with a population of around 10 million, also hosts more than 600,000 Syrian refugees.Jordan made peace with Israel in 1994. The countries maintain close security ties, but relations have otherwise been tense in recent years, largely due to differences linked to Israel’s conflict with the Palestinians. Jordan is home to more than 2 million Palestinian refugees, most of whom have Jordanian citizenship.Stability in Jordan and the status of the king has long been a matter of concern, particularly during the Trump administration, which gave unprecedented support to Israel and sought to isolate the Palestinians, including by slashing funding for Palestinian refugees.In early 2018, as then-President Donald Trump was threatening to cut aid to countries that did not support U.S. policies, the administration boosted assistance to Jordan by more than $1 billion over five years.Abdullah stripped his half-brother Hamzah of his title as crown prince in 2004, saying he had decided to “free” him from the "constraints of the position" in order to allow him to take on other responsibilities. The move was seen at the time as part of Abdullah's consolidation of power five years after the succession.The current crown prince is Abdullah’s oldest son, Hussein, who is 26.Jordan's ruling family traces its lineage back to Islam's Prophet Muhammad. Abdullah had chosen Hamzah as his crown prince hours after their father died of cancer in February 1999. The designation was out of respect for King Hussein, who was known to have favored Hamzah the most among his 11 children from four marriages.Abdullah and Hamzah have not displayed any open rivalry over the years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-alleged-coup-jordan-arrests-royal-family-member-and-others-101617487462879.html
04-04-2021||World||Deja vu: Millions return to lockdown on Easter||Millions of people around the world prepared on Saturday to spend another Easter weekend under restrictions because of Covid-19 surges, but there was good news from the hard-hit United States, which crossed the milestone of 100 million coronavirus vaccinations.There have been worrying spikes in infections in many parts of the world, even as vaccine roll-outs gather pace, forcing the reimposition of deeply unpopular restrictions including in European nations.Italy began a strict Easter lockdown on Saturday, with the entire country considered a high-risk coronavirus “red zone” during a time when families usually hold reunions.At the Vatican on Good Friday, a handful of onlookers caught a glimpse of Pope Francis presiding over the “Way of the Cross” ceremony in an empty St Peter’s Square, with Covid-19 restrictions preventing large gatherings there for a second year in a row.New restrictions also came into force on Saturday in France, where authorities are scrambling to deal with a dramatic rise in cases that have overwhelmed hospitals in the capital Paris.Curbs had been intensified in other European nations such as Belgium, and Germany - where the government scrapped plans for a strict Easter lockdown - saw Chancellor Angela Merkel urge people to limit their social contacts ahead of the break.Cases in Latin America cross 25 million markLatin America and the Caribbean passed the 25 million mark on Friday for recorded coronavirus cases as a surge in infections saw countries place restrictions on travel and movement while vaccine campaigns catch up.An AFP tally showed the region reaching the grim milestone of 25,001,533 infections, putting it in third place after Europe with 44.2 million cases and the US and Canada with over 31.5 million.The death toll for Latin America and the Caribbean exceeded 788,000, according to AFP’s count, second only to Europe which has lost some 936,000 people in the pandemic.Infection rates in South America have soared in recent months, fuelled by a more contagious variant, dubbed P1, first detected in the continent’s largest country, Brazil, and since found in several other countries.Argentine President Alberto Fernandez has tested positive for the coronavirus, the first-term Peronist leader tweeted.Canada, meanwhile, has prohibited the use of face masks containing graphene due to the possibility of risks from inhalation of particles, health officials have announced.With inputs from Anirudh Bhattacharyya in Toronto||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deja-vu-millions-return-to-lockdown-on-easter-101617480140335.html
04-04-2021||World||Personal data of over 500 million Facebook users leaked: Report||Data affecting more than 500 million Facebook users that was originally leaked in 2019, including email addresses and phone numbers, has been posted on an online hackers forum, according to media reports and a cybercrime expert."All 533,000,000 Facebook records were just leaked for free," Alon Gal, chief technology officer at the Hudson Rock cybercrime intelligence firm, said Saturday on Twitter.He denounced what he called the "absolute negligence" of Facebook.Some of the data appeared to be current, according to a report in Business Insider which AFP was unable to confirm independently. It said some of the leaked phone numbers still belong to the owners of Facebook accounts."This means that if you have a Facebook account, it is extremely likely the phone number used for the account was leaked," Gal said.But Facebook said the reports were old news."This is old data that was previously reported on in 2019," a company spokesperson told AFP. "We found and fixed this issue in August 2019."Close to 32 million American accounts and 20 million French accounts were among those affected, Gal tweeted in January, when the person holding the data was trying to sell it.The data include phone numbers, complete names, birthdates and, for some accounts, email addresses and relationship status."Bad actors will certainly use the information for social engineering, scamming, hacking and marketing," Gal said on Twitter.This is not the first time leaks or use of data from the world's largest social network -- with nearly two billion users -- has embroiled Facebook in controversy.In 2016, a scandal around Cambridge Analytica, a British consulting firm that used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to target political ads, cast a shadow over the social network and its handling of private information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/personal-data-of-over-500-million-facebook-users-leaked-report-101617471967728.html
