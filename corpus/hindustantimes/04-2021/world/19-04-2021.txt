The move follows the adoption of Indo-Pacific strategies by key EU members such as France, Germany and the Netherlands. All these policies envisage closer security and economic cooperation with India, which is seen as a key player in the region. “The aim is to contribute to regional stability, security, prosperity and sustainable development, at a time of rising challenges and tensions in the region,” the European Council, which sets the EU’s policy agenda, said in a statement on the Indo-Pacific strategy. “The renewed EU commitment to the Indo-Pacific, a region spanning from the east coast of Africa to the Pacific island states, will have a long-term focus and will be based on upholding democracy, human rights, the rule of law and respect for international law,” it said. The development also comes against the backdrop of concerns among EU members about the aggressive and assertive actions of China across the Indo-Pacific. However, the EU has opted to strike a fine line between cooperating with China on issues such as trade and investment and climate change and challenging its actions that go against a rules-based order. The EU will develop partnerships in security and defence, including addressing maritime security, malicious cyber activities, disinformation, emerging technologies, terrorism, and organised crime, the statement said. The strategy, adopted during a meeting of the European Council on April 16, said the EU will “continue to explore deepening economic relations with India”. This will be part of efforts to strengthen the EU’s strategic trade position in the Indo-Pacific following significant regional agreements such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP). Without naming China, the European Council also said the current dynamics in the Indo-Pacific “have given rise to the intense geopolitical competition adding to increasing tensions on trade and supply chains as well as in technological, political and security areas”. Human rights are also being challenged, and these developments “increasingly threaten the stability and security of the region and beyond, directly impacting on the EU’s interests,” it said. The EU’s approach will foster a rules-based international order, a level playing field and an open and fair environment for trade and investment, the strengthening of resilience, and supporting connectivity with the EU. “Free and open maritime supply routes in full compliance with international law remain crucial. The EU will look to work together with its partners in the Indo-Pacific on these issues of common interest,” the European Council said. The EU and its regional partners will also work together to mitigate the economic and human effects of the Covid-19 pandemic and ensure an inclusive and sustainable socio-economic recovery. In the realm of security and defence, the EU will protect critical maritime routes through capacity building for partners to improve their maritime domain awareness, and organise more joint exercises and port calls between Indo-Pacific naval units and the EU counter-piracy Naval Force Operation Atalanta. The EU will also strengthen cooperation with partners on counter-terrorism, cyber-security, maritime security and crisis management, and a “meaningful European naval presence in the Indo-Pacific” is seen as important for the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/longterm-focus-european-union-unveils-strategy-for-cooperation-in-indopacific-101618854272909.html
19-04-2021||World||French police warn Prez Emmanuel Macron about rising levels of street violence||French police warned President Emmanuel Macron about rising levels of street violence, as he toured crime hotspots on Monday following a string of shocking assaults.A spate of violent attacks in recent months has made fear of crime a top political issue ahead of presidential elections next year in which Macron is expected to seek a second term."We are faced with young people who are more organised, and more heavily armed," a policewoman named Ludivine told Macron in Montpellier.Macron was driven around a poverty-wracked part of the southern city in a police car where he spoke to officers and observed drug-dealing spots."We are dealing with career criminals, always the same ones, around 50 of them in Montpellier," the police officer said.Another officer said that anti-police violence had been normalised during the anti-government "yellow vest" revolt which began in 2018.Macron asked if police had observed a difference since the protests which often saw demonstrators battle security forces on the streets."Yes, demonstrators have become more professional. They don't hesitate in getting physical with us," another officer told the French president.Security has become a top political issue in France 12 months ahead of the presidential election.In a interview with the right-wing Le Figaro newspaper on Sunday, Macron acknowledged that physical assaults had increased."Since 2017, even though France has seen a fall of between 18-25 percent in violent thefts, burglaries and vehicle theft, it has had a major increase in physical assaults," he said.Macron singled out the rise in violence against police officers, firefighters and medics as being of particular concern.He has promised to honour a target of recruiting 10,000 extra police officers by 2022 and his government has drafted controversial new legislation aimed at protecting and reinforcing the police.Several recent crimes have shocked the country.Alain Francon, one of France's most prolific theatre directors, was stabbed in the throat near his hotel in central Montpellier in March by a man who told police he objected to Francon looking at him.In January, a 15-year-old schoolboy was left in a coma after being repeatedly kicked by a gang in a well-heeled neighbourhood of the capital in an assault that captured national media attention for days.Earlier this month, 78-year-old tycoon Bernard Tapie was tied up with electrical cords along with his wife during a violent overnight robbery at their home outside Paris.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/french-police-warn-prez-emmanuel-macron-about-rising-levels-of-street-violence-101618853424396.html

They will then have follow-up appointments and be monitored for a year."This study has the potential to transform our understanding by providing high-quality data," said Shobana Balasingam, vaccines senior research advisor at Wellcome.The trial's initial phase will look at the minimum dose that allows the virus to start replicating without symptoms in some 50 percent of volunteers.Then in the second phase, another group of volunteers will all receive this established minimum dose.The trial comes as a London hospital has isolated a group of healthy volunteers while exposing them to the virus, in a world first.That began in March and is being carried out in collaboration between Imperial College London and the company hVIVO at the Royal London Hospital.Those who have been infected in a controlled way are monitored to see how their illness progresses and how drugs and vaccines could work against it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-university-launches-trial-to-reinfect-volunteers-who-have-had-covid19-101618850358869.html
19-04-2021||World||Dozens of Turks sneak into Europe in passport scam: Report||The Turkish government on Monday widened an investigation into claims dozens of people had used special passports to enter Europe legally and never returned.The scandal has dominated local headlines since it emerged last week that 43 people with grey service passports entered Germany last November to attend an environmental workshop and never returned to Turkey.Grey passports are issued to people working abroad for the state, allowing visa-free travel to many countries.They were sent by a local district municipality in the eastern province of Malatya, according to local media.The interior ministry in a statement on Monday said the probe would be widened to include six more local municipalities in cities including Ordu on the Black Sea.The six included ruling and main opposition party mayors.They had sent individuals for "folk dance shows, culture tours, youth programmes" in cooperation with non-governmental organisations, the interior ministry said.It also temporarily suspended issuing service-stamped passports for non-public sector employees who were assigned to work abroad by local authorities.Last week, the ministry suspended the deputy governor of Malatya, two public officials and the provincial head of the population and citizen affairs body over the scandal.One source told HaberTurk website how people paid 6,000 euros ($7,200) for the passport to go to Germany through Bingol municipality in eastern Turkey.They also claimed at least "450-500" people went to Europe using this method.In a video posted online by Anka News Agency, the main opposition party mayor of Yesilova in southwestern Turkey said the claims relating to his district dated back to 2018, before he was elected.Mumtaz Senel said 387 people were sent to Rome with grey passports but 23 never returned their passports.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-of-turks-sneak-into-europe-in-passport-scam-report-101618848253009.html
19-04-2021||World||A look at high-profile cases over killings by US police||Former Minneapolis police Officer Derek Chauvin is charged with murder and manslaughter in George Floyd's death after pressing his knee into Floyd's neck as he cried out: “I can't breathe.”The defense argued that Chauvin, a white 19-year veteran, used reasonable force and that Floyd died because of his illegal drug use and underlying health problems.It has been rare to charge police with crimes in the death of civilians, and winning a conviction is harder in part because juries are often reluctant to second guess an officer’s split-second decisions. But Chauvin's knee was on Floyd's neck for 9 1/2 minutes, prosecutors say, as bystanders shouted at the officer to get off Floyd.Here's a look at other high-profile killings by police and the outcome of the case:ERIC GARNEREric Garner, 43, died in July 2014 in New York City after a white officer placed him in a chokehold when Garner refused to be handcuffed for allegedly selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A Staten Island grand jury declined to indict Officer Daniel Pantaleo in December that year. The Justice Department said in 2019 that it wouldn't file civil rights charges after a yearslong investigation.MICHAEL BROWNMichael Brown, 18, was fatally shot by a white officer, Darren Wilson, in August 2014 in Ferguson, Missouri, touching off weeks of sometimes-violent protests. A St. Louis County grand jury declined in November 2014 to indict Wilson in the unarmed Black teen's death, and the U.S. Department of Justice later also declined to charge him. Wesley Bell, the current St. Louis County prosecuting attorney, conducted a five-month review of witness statements, forensic reports and other evidence and announced in July that he would not charge Wilson.LAQUAN MCDONALDChicago Police Officer Jason Van Dyke shot 16 times at Laquan McDonald, killing the Black 17-year-old as he walked away from officers in October 2014. Van Dyke was charged with first-degree murder the same day the city released the shocking dashcam video of the shooting. Van Dyke was found guilty of second-degree murder in 2018 and sentenced to nearly seven years in prison.TAMIR RICETamir Rice, 12, was fatally shot by a white Cleveland police officer in November 2014 after officers responded to a 911 call from a man drinking beer and waiting for a bus who said a “guy” was pointing a gun at people. Tamir, who was Black, had a pellet gun tucked in his waistband and was shot after the officers’ cruiser skidded to a stop just feet away. A grand jury in December 2015 declined to indict patrolman Timothy Loehmann, who fired the fatal shot, and training officer Frank Garmback. The U.S. Justice Department announced last year that it would not bring federal criminal charges, saying the quality of video of the shooting was too poor for prosecutors to conclusively establish what had happened.WALTER SCOTTMichael Slager, a white South Carolina police officer, shot Walter Scott in the back as the unarmed 50-year-old Black man fled following a 2015 traffic stop. In 2016, a mistrial was declared after the jury deadlocked over a verdict in Slager's murder trial. The next year, Slager pleaded guilty in federal court to violating Scott’s civil rights and as part of a plea deal, prosecutors dropped state murder charges. Slager was sentenced to 20 years in prison. He is now appealing his punishment, saying his lawyer never told him about a plea offer from prosecutors that could have cut years off his sentence.FREDDIE GRAYFreddie Gray, a 25-year-old Black man, died after he suffered a spinal injury while handcuffed and shackled in a Baltimore police van, sparking weeks of unrest across the city. Three officers were acquitted and prosecutors dropped the remaining state cases in July 2016. The U.S. Department of Justice announced in 2017 that it wouldn't bring federal charges against the six officers involved in the arrest, saying it did not find enough evidence to prove the officers willfully violated Gray's civil rights.PHILANDO CASTILEPhilando Castile, a 32-year-old elementary school cafeteria worker, was shot five times by a St. Anthony, Minnesota police officer during a 2016 traffic stop after Castile informed the officer he was armed. The shooting gained widespread attention after Castile’s girlfriend, who was in the car with her then-4-year-old daughter, livestreamed its gruesome aftermath on Facebook. Officer Jeronimo Yanez testified that Castile was pulling his gun out of his pocket despite commands to do so. The officer was acquitted of manslaughter at trial.JUSTINE RUSZCZYK DAMONDJustine Ruszczyk Damond, an unarmed white dual citizen of the U.S. and Australia, was fatally shot in July 2017 by Minneapolis Police Officer Mohamed Noor when she approached his squad car in the alley behind her home minutes after calling 911 to report a possible rape. Noor testified at trial that a loud bang on the squad car startled him and his partner and that he fired to protect his partner’s life. He was convicted of third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter and sentenced in 2019 to 12 1/2 years in prison.JORDAN EDWARDSRoy Oliver, a white Texas police officer, fired at a car full of teenagers as it drove away from a large house party in April 2017, fatally shooting 15-year-old Jordan Edwards, who was sitting in the front passenger seat. Police initially said the vehicle backed up toward officers “in an aggressive manner,” but later admitted that bodycam video showed the vehicle was moving forward as officers approached. Oliver was convicted of murder in 2018 and sentenced to 15 years in prison.BREONNA TAYLORBreonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Louisville emergency medical worker studying to become a nurse, was shot several times in her hallway after three plainclothes narcotics detectives busted down the door of her apartment in the middle of the night in March 2020. A grand jury brought no charges against officers in her death, although one was indicted for shooting into a neighboring home that had people inside. Prosecutors said two officers who fired at Taylor were justified in using force to protect themselves after they faced gunfire from her boyfriend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-look-at-high-profile-cases-over-killings-by-us-police-101618848205747.html

19-04-2021||World||UN experts slam UK report for repackaging 'racist tropes'||A body of experts that advises the United Nations on human rights concerns has slammed a widely criticized British government-backed report that concluded there was no systemic racism in the country.The UN Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent said Monday that it found it “stunning” that the report “repackages racist tropes and stereotypes into fact” and urged the British government to reject its findings.“The report cites dubious evidence to make claims that rationalize white supremacy by using the familiar arguments that have always justified racial hierarchy,” the Geneva-based working group said.“This attempt to normalize white supremacy despite considerable research and evidence of institutional racism is an unfortunate sidestepping of the opportunity to acknowledge the atrocities of the past and the contributions of all in order to move forward,” it added.The Commission on Race and Ethnic Disparities, which was set up by British Prime Minister Boris Johnson after last year's Black Lives Matter protests, published its report into racism last month.Its conclusions that Britain is not “institutionally racist” or “rigged” against minorities have been widely vilified, with some critics even arguing that the report downplayed the country’s historic role in slavery.Citing strides to close gaps between ethnic groups in educational and economic achievement, the report said race was becoming “less important” as a factor in creating disparities that are also fueled by class and family backgrounds.Many academics, lawmakers unions and anti-racism activists were skeptical of the findings in the 258-page report, with some claiming the commission ignored barriers to equality, while others said it downplayed the ongoing legacy of Britain’s colonial past as well as its role in slavery.Johnson’s spokesman, Max Blain, said the U.N. working group’s statement “misrepresents the findings” of the U.K. racism report.“This report in no way condones racist behavior, and in fact it highlights that racism and inequality are still problems for our country,” he said.The commission, which was made up of 11 members from a broad cross section of ethnic backgrounds, has also previously defended itself against the charges, arguing that some of the criticism has “tipped into misrepresentation” and that it never argued that racism does not exist in society or in institutions.The U.N. working group also poured scorn on what it described as the report's “mythical representation of enslavement," saying it was "an attempt to sanitize the history of the trade in enslaved Africans."This, it went on, is “a reprehensible, although not unfamiliar tactic, employed by many whose wealth came directly from the enslavement of others, ever since slavery was outlawed.”One of the main clarion calls in last year's Black Lives Matter protests across the U.K. was for the government and institutions to face up to the legacy of the British Empire and the country’s extensive profits from the slave trade.The toppling of a statue of 17th-century slave trader Edward Colston in the city of Bristol in June prompted a pointed debate about how to deal with Britain’s past. Many felt such statues extol racism and are an affront to Black Britons. Others, including the prime minister, argued that removing them was erasing a piece of history.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-experts-slam-uk-report-for-repackaging-racist-tropes-101618834589534.html
19-04-2021||World||South Korea looks to ban internet file-sharing with North Korea||South Korea's government on Monday said it had proposed a law to require its citizens to get official permission before using the internet to exchange digital material such as movies, music, scanned books, or artwork with anyone in North Korea.If approved by parliament, the measure would be the first major amendment to South Korea's Inter-Korean Exchange and Cooperation Act in three decades and is part of its recent efforts to improve relations with North Korea.That law already regulates physical goods sent into or out of North Korea, and the proposed changes would add digital content, Lee Jong-joo, a spokeswoman for South Korea's unification ministry, which handles inter-Korean affairs, told a briefing."While in the past the main target (of the law) was the movement of goods, gradually there have been cases of transferred or received scanned files or software via the internet becoming a focus," Lee said.The revision, first outlined in January, comes after the South in December banned the launching of propaganda leaflets into the North.That measure drew the criticism of rights activists, who have for decades sent anti-North Korean leaflets over the border using balloons or bottles in the sea. It also attracted negative attention from some politicians in the United States, which is South Korea's biggest ally.Last week the Human Rights Commission of the U.S. House of Representatives raised concerns that some measures taken by Seoul may infringe on freedom of expression.Campaigners in South Korea have sent food, medicine, money, mini radios and USB sticks containing South Korean news and dramas, while defectors often try to remain in touch with family members through calls or the internet.Isolated North Korea has long denounced the practice and last year had stepped up its condemnation of it, to the alarm of a South Korean government intent on improving ties on the divided peninsula.When asked whether the ministry was considering restricting radio broadcasts, Lee said such broadcasts are not categorised as a transfer of digital materials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-looks-to-ban-internet-file-sharing-with-north-korea-101618822062088.html

In March, she lost a court appeal against the sentence and the restrictions imposed against her, including the travel ban."International support is the only way we can expose the injustices in my country and protect the victims," her sister Lina said as she accepted the prize and its 60,000 euros ($72,000) at a virtual ceremony."For years now, the Saudi regime has been trying to tarnish her image, to erase any support for her, and to make her forgotten. But the more time passes, the more Loujain proves to the world how incredibly brave, resilient and attached to her values she is," she added.Hathloul's family has alleged the activist experienced torture and sexual harassment in detention, claims that have repeatedly been dismissed by a Saudi court.While some of the activists detained along with Hathloul have been provisionally released, several others remain imprisoned on what campaigners describe as opaque charges.The detentions have cast a spotlight on the human rights record of the kingdom, an absolute monarchy where day-to-day control is widely believed to be in the hands of controversial Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saudi-women-s-activist-loujain-al-hathloul-wins-top-europe-rights-award-101618840174728.html

Just as with the climate crisis, we must help those who are the most vulnerable first."She said Covax "offers the best path forward to ensure true vaccine equity and a way out of the pandemic".Nearly 900 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines have been injected in at least 206 territories around the world, according to an AFP count.Some 48 percent of the doses have been administered in high-income countries accounting for 16 percent of the global population.Just 0.1 percent have been administered in the 29 lowest-income countries, home to nine percent of the world's population.$2 billion needed The Covax facility ensures the 92 poorest participating economies can access coronavirus jabs, with the cost covered by donors.Since the first shipment landed in Ghana on February 24, Covax has delivered more than 39 million doses to 114 participating territories.Covax is co-led by the WHO, the Gavi vaccine alliance, and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations.The scheme is aiming to distribute enough doses to vaccinate up to 27 percent of the population in the 92 poorest participating economies by the end of the year.The facility on Thursday launched a push for an extra $2 billion in donations, saying it needed the money in advance to reserve Covid vaccine doses throughout the rest of the year.Some $400 million was raised at Thursday's opening donor conference, while Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will host a Covax funding summit focused on the 92 countries in June.Environment link"Greta Thunberg has inspired millions of people worldwide to take action to address the climate crisis, and her strong support of vaccine equity to fight the Covid-19 pandemic yet again demonstrates her commitment to making our world a healthier, safer and fairer place for all people," said WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus."I urge the global community to follow Greta's example and do what they can, in support of Covax, to protect the world's most vulnerable people from this pandemic."The WHO has consistently made the link between human health, animal health and the health of the planet during the Covid-19 pandemic.The novel coronavirus, which is thought to have made the species jump from the animal world, has now killed more than three million people worldwide since the outbreak emerged in China in December 2019.Thunberg said earlier this month that she plans to skip the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow this November, saying the uneven rollout of Covid vaccine campaigns would mean countries could not participate on even terms.While the climate crisis has been largely overshadowed by the pandemic, COP26 is seen as one of the opportunities to put the climate back on the agenda, following a summit to be hosted this week by US President Joe Biden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/greta-thunberg-donates-120k-towards-covax-slams-tragedy-of-vaccine-inequity-101618845765487.html

However, the Rangers were released on Monday.Addressing the nation after violent protests across the country, Khan said expelling the French ambassador is not a solution to the problem of blasphemy.“Sending away the French ambassador is not a solution. It will only trigger incidents of blasphemy in other countries as in the West they call it freedom of expression,” he said.He added that snapping ties with France will impact ties with the European Union (EU) because France is among the main nations of the union and the EU will stand with France.Also, the exports of textile for Pakistan would be hurt since they are done to the EU directly.He said that TLP and the government were following the same objective that no one should insult the Prophet but their methods were different.Khan said that there were violent protests in Pakistan after Salman Rushdie’s book in 1990 but those protests failed to stop the repeated instances of blasphemy in the west in the subsequent years.“It means that protests are not a solution,” he said.The Prime Minister said that his strategy was to take leaders of all Muslims countries on board on this issue and educate the west about the gravity of the blasphemy and its impact on the sentiments of the Muslims.“We should tell the European nations how much we get hurt when someone insults our Prophet,” he said adding the Muslims should emulate the Jews who successfully established the sanctity of Holocaust.Khan promised that with the help of other Muslims countries, he will convince the Europeans that their blasphemous actions hurt the Muslims.Khan said the enemies of Pakistan were trying to paint the protest as civil war.He also asked the clerics to help the government to come out of the current unrest as the economy is going upward and it was not the time to hurt the country.Earlier, Khan addressing a gathering lamented that political and religious parties in Pakistan "misused" Islam to deal damage to the country, the Dawn newspaper reported."ln our country it is a great misfortune that many times our political parties and religious parties use Islam wrongly and use it such that they deal damage to their own country," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expulsion-of-french-envoy-not-a-solution-to-blasphemy-in-the-west-imran-khan-on-radical-group-s-demand-101618845602112.html
19-04-2021||World||Britain adds India to travel 'red list' after Covid-19 surge||Britain on Monday imposed its strictest travel curbs on India after an explosion of coronavirus cases there, hours after Prime Minister Boris Johnson called off a trip to New Delhi.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said that effective from 0300 GMT on Friday, India was being added to Britain's "red list" of countries, banning all arrivals from India except for UK or Irish nationals.Those nationals, as well as foreigners resident in the UK, must pay hefty amounts to stay in a government-approved quarantine hotel for 10 days on their return from red list nations, which include Pakistan and Bangladesh."We've made the difficult but vital decision to add India to the red list," Hancock told parliament, after the government had faced days of criticism for holding off the decision, pending Johnson's trip.The decision was in light of surging case numbers and the emergence of a new Covid-19 variant in India, the health minister said, after the capital New Delhi entered a week-long lockdown.In the event, the UK and Indian governments earlier Monday called off Johnson's visit, which was set for next week after already being postponed in January.It would have been Johnson's first major foreign visit since he took power in 2019."In the light of the current coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be able to travel to India next week," the two governments said in a joint statement.They said that Johnson and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would instead speak later this month "to agree and launch their ambitious plans for the future partnership between the UK and India"."They will remain in regular contact beyond this, and look forward to meeting in person later this year."Johnson's office had last week announced the visit would be shortened. It was originally organised to span three days and set to begin on April 26.It had initially been heralded as an opportunity for Britain to refocus its international trade policy in the wake of Brexit as it pursues a so-called "global Britain" strategy.But spiking coronavirus cases, hospitalisations and deaths in Britain earlier this year led to its delay.Now, surging infections in India -- where officials have recorded five consecutive days of more than 200,000 cases -- have led to its entire cancellation.A total of 103 cases of the Indian variant have been identified in Britain, said Hancock.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-adds-india-to-travel-red-list-after-covid-19-surge-101618844401711.html

19-04-2021||World||Japan asks Myanmar junta to release arrested journalist||TOKYO (AP) — Japan's government said Monday it is asking Myanmar to release a Japanese journalist who was arrested by security forces in its largest city of Yangon the previous day.Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters that his government is asking Myanmar authorities to explain the arrest and release him as soon as possible.He did not identify the detainee, but Japanese media said he is Yuki Kitazumi, a former Nikkei business newspaper reporter currently based in Yangon as a freelance journalist.“We will continue asking the Myanmar side for his early release, while doing our utmost for the protection of Japanese citizens in that country,” Kato said.Japan's Foreign Ministry later said the journalist was arrested at his home on Sunday night and is being detained at Yangon's Insein Prison, where political prisoners are frequently held. It said Japanese Embassy officials have not been given access to him.Kyodo News agency reported that he was arrested on suspicion of spreading “fake” news.Kitazumi has posted reports and views about developments in Myanmar on Facebook. Hours before his arrest, he posted a video showing Myanmar citizens gathering at a Tokyo temple to pay tribute to people killed in the Myanmar military junta's crackdown on protests against its Feb. 1 seizure of power from an elected government.Kitazumi was detained briefly by police in late February while covering pro-democracy protests in Myanmar.Japan has stepped up its criticism of the military government's deadly crackdown on opposition but has taken a milder approach than the United States and some other countries that imposed sanctions against members of the junta.On Saturday, the junta released more than 23,000 prisoners to mark the traditional new year's holiday. At least three had been political prisoners, but it wasn't immediately clear if any activists detained during the post-coup crackdown were freed.According to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests, government forces have killed at least 728 protesters and bystanders since the takeover. The group says 3,141 people, including ousted civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi, are in detention.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-asks-myanmar-junta-to-release-arrested-journalist-101618828543694.html
19-04-2021||World||'Britcoin' digital currency being considered by UK||Britain stepped up efforts on Monday to look at the case for a digital pound in response to the challenge posed by cryptocurencies such as bitcoin, and outlined plans to make its financial market more attractive after Brexit."We're launching a new taskforce between the Treasury and the Bank of England to coordinate exploratory work on a potential central bank digital currency (CBDC)," Britain's finance minister Rishi Sunak told a financial industry conference."Alongside this we will set up a new financial market infrastructure 'sandbox' for firms innovating with technologies like distributed ledger technologies," he added.The BoE said that it and the government had not yet made a decision on whether to introduce a CBDC in the UK, and that it would engage widely with stakeholders on the benefits, risks and practicalities of doing so.Any digital currency would be designed to exist alongside physical cash and existing bank deposits, rather than to replace them, the central bank said.The taskforce will monitor developments overseas to ensure the UK remains at the forefront of global innovation on digital currencies, it added.China is a front-runner to launch a CBDC, which could help authorities modernise financial systems, meet the threat from cryptocurrencies and speed up domestic and international payments.Last week, the European Central Bank said it was studying an electronic form of cash to complement banknotes and coins but any launch was still several years away.DARK TRADINGSince Britain's departure from the European Union's orbit on Dec. 31, the financial sector has faced restrictions on serving EU customers, and the British government is seeking to make London a more attractive global financial centre.The government will propose removing restrictions inherited from the EU, including on who can trade shares in London and the double volume cap.This would help Britain attract more "dark" or anonymous trading by big investors after Amsterdam toppled London as Europe's top share trading centre in January."The consultation process aims to deliver a rulebook that is fair, outcomes-based and supports competitiveness, whilst ensuring the UK maintains the highest regulatory standards," Sunak said.Britain will also propose changes to prospectuses, a document companies must publish when listing on an exchange or issuing new shares.The aim would be to ensure the rules are "not overly burdensome", Sunak said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britcoin-digital-currency-being-considered-by-uk-101618825829232.html

It is forecast to slowly move northwestward and then veer eastward away from the northern Philippines around Thursday.Vicente Malano, administrator of the government weather agency, said a high-pressure area extending from China to Japan was blocking the typhoon from blowing inland.The typhoon’s wide band of rainclouds and strong winds nevertheless flooded at least 22 villages and caused power outages in four provinces. More than 3,200 people and 43 ferries and cargo ships were stranded in seaports after the coast guard suspended sea travel as the typhoon blew nearer, the government disaster-response agency and the coast guard said.More than 18,000 families or 68,490 people were evacuated to emergency shelters as a precaution in nine provinces, the disaster agency said. Mayors said they have to open more evacuation centers to ensure social distancing during the pandemic.“It’s really tough, it’s toxic, but we have no choice,” Mayor Ann Gemma Ongjoco of Guinobatan town in Albay province said by telephone. She said even churches were used to shelter more than 6,100 villagers in her town, including many from communities threatened by mudflows from Mayon, one of the most active volcanoes in the archipelago.The Philippines is a coronavirus hotspot in Southeast Asia, with health officials reporting 945,745 infections and 16,048 deaths.About 20 typhoons and storms lash the Philippines each year. It also sits in the so-called Pacific “Ring of Fire,” a seismically sensitive region often hit by earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, making the impoverished nation one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/approaching-typhoon-surigae-displaces-68-000-people-in-philippines-101618824884182.html

[L1N2MB022]The Financial Times first reported the meeting."We have seen media reports about talks between Iran and Saudi Arabia, although the reports sometimes had contradictory quotes," Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh told a weekly news conference."What is important is that the Islamic Republic of Iran has always welcomed dialogue with the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and considers it in the interest of the people of the two countries, as well as peace and stability in the region," he added.Saudi authorities have not responded to a Reuters request for comment on the talks.One of the sources said the meeting, arranged by Iraq's prime minister who visited Saudi Arabia earlier this month, had focused on Yemen, where a military coalition led by Riyadh has been battling the Iran-aligned Houthi movement.Sunni power Saudi Arabia had opposed the inernational nuclear accord with Shi'ite Iran for not tackling Tehran's missiles programme and regional behaviour.It has called for a stronger deal this time around at talks in Vienna aimed at bringing the United States and Iran back into compliance with the pact, which then U.S. President Donald Trump quit in 2018. Tehran breached several nuclear restrictions after Trump reimposed sanctions.President Joe Biden's administration is also pressing for a ceasefire in Yemen which is grappling with what the United Nations describes as the world's largest humanitarian crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-always-welcomes-dialogue-with-riyadh-foreign-ministry-says-101618821514137.html
19-04-2021||World||Russia hits back as US warns of response if opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies on hunger strike||Russia hit back defiantly after the US warned of “consequences” if jailed opposition leader Alexey Navalny dies on hunger strike, deepening the conflict over the dissident who’s already survived an alleged assassination attempt.“It’s obvious that Russia’s development as a strong, sovereign state is of no interest” to the West, Vyacheslav Volodin, speaker of the lower house of parliament and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, said on Telegram Monday. Russia should brace for measures aimed at its vital energy sector and industry, he said.Amid fears of more potential sanctions, the ruble traded 0.5% weaker against the dollar as of 9:57 a.m. in Moscow, the worst performer in emerging markets after the Indian rupee.The US and Europe are pressing Putin to ensure proper medical care for Navalny, who began a hunger strike in prison March 31 to demand access to his personal doctors for acute back and leg pains. The opposition leader’s supporters on Sunday called for protests across Russia on April 21, the day Putin is due to give his annual state-of-the-nation address, after warning that the Kremlin’s most outspoken critic may be only days from death.“We have communicated to the Russian government...they will be held accountable by the international community,” US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said on CNN’s “State of the Union” on Sunday.“We are looking at a variety of different costs that we would impose, and I’m not going to telegraph that publicly at this point. But we have communicated that there will be consequences if Mr. Navalny dies,” Sullivan said.Navalny has been imprisoned since March 11 at the notorious IK-2 prison camp about 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Moscow for breaking parole rules while recuperating in Germany from a near-fatal poisoning in Siberia that he and Western governments blame on the Kremlin. Russian authorities deny any involvement.European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen called for the prisoner’s “immediate and unconditional release.” Navalny’s fate is in Putin’s hands, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Sunday, while German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas told the daily Bild that Berlin “urgently” demands he receive adequate medical care.Anastasia Vasilieva, who heads the Alliance of Doctors union that is backed by Navalny, posted a copy of his blood-test results showing what she said were “critical” levels of potassium. “This signifies kidney failure, which can lead at any time to a severe disruption to his heartbeat” including the possibility of heart failure, she said on Twitter.In a post on his Instagram account Friday, Navalny’s allies reported that a prison official had warned him that a blood test indicated a “serious deterioration” in his health and that he would be force-fed if he didn’t end the protest.US SanctionsPresident Joe Biden on Thursday ordered a raft of new sanctions against Russia, including restrictions on buying new sovereign debt, in response to allegations that Moscow was behind a hack on SolarWinds Corp. and interfered with last year’s US election.Yet the moves were calibrated to punish the Kremlin for past behavior while keeping relations from deteriorating further, especially as tensions grow over a Russian military build-up near Ukraine. Biden has offered to meet Putin later this year, an invitation Russia said it responded to “positively.”Asked about Navalny’s condition on Saturday, Biden told reporters “It’s totally, totally unfair.”Russia’s Federal Penitentiary Service didn’t respond to requests for comment. Officials have said previously that Navalny has received all necessary medical attention.Biden pressed Putin in a phone call on Tuesday about the poisoning of the opposition leader, which US intelligence has publicly blamed on Russia’s Federal Security Service. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron also quizzed Putin about Navalny in a March 30 phone call.Macron called for “clear red lines” in dealing with Russia in an interview with CBS’s Face the Nation broadcast on Sunday. “It’s a failure of our collective credibility vis-à-vis Russia,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-hits-back-as-us-warns-of-response-if-opposition-leader-alexey-navalny-dies-on-hunger-strike-101618824092225.html
19-04-2021||World||Attorneys at police officer Chauvin trial in Floyd death make final pitch||Attorneys in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged with killing George Floyd are set to make their closing arguments Monday, each side seeking to distill three weeks of testimony to persuade jurors to deliver their view of the right verdict.For prosecutors, Derek Chauvin recklessly squeezed the life from Floyd as he and two other officers pinned him to the street for 9 minutes, 29 seconds outside a corner market, despite Floyd's repeated cries that he couldn't breathe — actions they say warrant conviction not just for manslaughter but also on two murder counts.For the defense, Floyd, who was Black, put himself at risk by swallowing fentanyl and methamphetamine, then resisted officers trying to arrest him — factors that compounded his vulnerability to a diseased heart and raise sufficient doubt that Chauvin, who is white, should be acquitted.Each side will pull key testimony to support their narrative for what killed Floyd in a case that roiled America 11 months ago and continues to resonate. The anonymous jury will later deliver verdicts in a courthouse surrounded by concrete barriers and razor wire, in an anxious city heavily fortified by National Guard members and just days after fresh outrage erupted over the police killing of a 20-year-old Black man in a nearby suburb.The attorneys aren't limited by time, though legal experts say overlong arguments risk losing jurors' attention and may be less effective. Prosecutors Steve Schleicher and Jerry Blackwell will share the closing, with Schleicher leading off and Blackwell coming on for the last-word rebuttal of defense attorney Eric Nelson's closing.Chauvin, 45, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Experts expect Schleicher to walk jurors through the elements of the charges. All three require the jury to conclude that Chauvin's actions were a “substantial causal factor” in Floyd's death — and that his use of force was unreasonable.Schleicher can remind jurors of key testimony from a myriad prosecution medical experts who testified that Floyd died of asphyxiation caused by being pinned to the pavement. He and Blackwell can point to plentiful testimony from use-of-force experts who said Chauvin's actions were clearly improper, as well as Minneapolis Police Department officials saying they were outside his training.Video played a huge role at trial, both in buttressing the expert testimony and in driving home the emotional impact of Floyd's anguish and death. Prosecutors can re-play video during their closings, and experts say they expect it.Guilty verdicts must be unanimous, which means Nelson needs to raise doubt in the minds of just a single juror on the various counts. His closing is certain to return to the themes of his cross-examination of prosecution witnesses and the brief defense case he mounted.Nelson is sure to highlight how the county medical examiner, Dr. Andrew Baker, did not conclude that Floyd died of asphyxia — putting him at odds with the prosecution's medical experts, even though Baker did call Floyd's death a homicide and testify that he believes Floyd's heart gave out in part due to being pinned to the ground.Nelson is also certain to remind the jury of Floyd's drug use, perhaps with the same language he frequently used during the testimony phase — with questions that emphasized words such as “illicit." Despite the long duration of Floyd's restraint, he's likely to again portray Chauvin's use of force as dictated by “fluid” and “dynamic” factors that shouldn't be second-guessed, including the prospect that Chauvin was distracted by a threatening group of bystanders.Nelson is also likely to question perhaps the strongest single part of the state's case — the video of Floyd's arrest, including bystander Darnella Frazier's video that largely established public perceptions of events. Nelson argued that camera angles can be deceptive, and used other views to suggest to jurors that Chauvin's knee wasn't on Floyd's neck at all times.“If I was Nelson, I’d do a lot of things, because a lot of things need to be done,” Joe Friedberg, a local defense attorney not involved in the case, said. “He’s in desperate trouble here.”Fourteen jurors heard testimony, two of them alternates. If Judge Peter Cahill follows the usual practice of dismissing the last two chosen as alternates, the 12 who will deliberate will include six white and six Black or multiracial jurors.Second-degree murder requires prosecutors to prove Chauvin intended to harm Floyd. Third-degree murder requires proof that Chauvin's actions were “eminently dangerous” and done with indifference to loss of life. Second-degree manslaughter requires jurors to believe that he caused Floyd's death through negligence and consciously took the chance of causing severe injury or death.Each count carries a different maximum sentence: 40 years for second-degree unintentional murder, 25 years for third-degree murder, and 10 years for second-degree manslaughter. Sentencing guidelines call for far less time, including 12 1/2 years on either murder count.___Webber reported from Fenton, Mich.___Find AP’s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/attorneys-at-police-officer-chauvin-trial-in-floyd-death-make-final-pitch-101618824215074.html
19-04-2021||World||Radical Pakistan party releases 11 police hostages after anti-France protests||Eleven Pakistani police officers seized by supporters of a radical Islamist group as part of their campaign to get the French ambassador expelled have been released, officials said Monday.The officers were grabbed as hostages Sunday by supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) during violent protests in Lahore.Video circulating on social media -- and confirmed unofficially by police as genuine -- showed some of them bloodied and bruised, with bandages around their heads.Interior Minister Sheikh Rashid Ahmed said the police had been released early Monday after "negotiations" with the TLP, which the government banned last week after effectively labelling it a terrorist organisation.The officers had been held at a TLP mosque stronghold in Lahore, which is now packed with supporters and surrounded by police."Negotiations have been started with TLP; the first round completed successfully," said Rashid in a video on Twitter."They have released 11 policemen who were made hostages."He said a second round of negotiations would take place later Monday, although it is not clear what they will discuss.Previously the TLP had set an April 20 deadline for the expulsion of the French ambassador.The group has been behind an anti-France campaign for months since President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad -- an act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.Protests paralyse citiesLast week the embassy in Pakistan advised its nationals to leave the country -- a call that appears to have gone largely unheeded."The TLP people have gone inside the Mosque and the police have also stepped back," said Rashid."Hopefully, the rest of the issues will be settled in the second round."Rioting has rocked the country for the past week since the leader of the TLP was detained in Lahore after calling for a march on the capital.The protests have paralysed cities and led to the deaths of six policemen.TLP leaders say several of the party's supporters were killed in Sunday's clashes."We won't bury them until the French ambassador is kicked out," Allama Muhammad Shafiq Amini, a TLP leader in the city, said in a video statement.Prime Minister Imran Khan's government has struggled to bring TLP to heel over the years, but this week announced an outright ban against the group -- effectively labelling it a terrorist outfit.Still, on Saturday he suggested the party hadn't been banned for its ideology, but rather its methods."Let me make clear to people here & abroad: Our govt only took action against TLP under our anti-terrorist law when they challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers," he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/radical-pakistan-party-releases-11-police-hostages-after-anti-france-protests-101618824065001.html

"We responded this evening to a traffic congestion and during that congestion, numerous shots were fired," the spokesman said.One victim was shot in the head, while another suffered multiple gunshot wounds, according to local news outlet Love Shreveport-Bossier.Sunday's incidents came with the United States already on edge over a surge in shootings in recent weeks. A gunman killed eight workers and himself at an Indianapolis FedEx center on Thursday night, with at least seven deadly mass shootings reported in the United States over the past month.In Shreveport, located in northwest Louisiana, multiple police units were dispatched to the scene of the incident, which took place around 9 p.m. local time on Sunday on Hearne Avenue, according to the KSLA report. Victims were taken to Ochsners LSU Health and other local hospitals, the report added.Reuters was not immediately able to contact local police. The Shreveport mayor's office didn't immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.Earlier on Sunday three people died at an apartment complex in Austin, Texas and authorities were hunting for a former deputy sheriff wanted in connection with the fatal shooting. Separately, three people were killed and two wounded in a shooting at a bar in Kenosha County, Wisconsin, in the early hours of Sunday.The spate of shootings has increased public pressure to tighten gun regulations. Most Americans support tougher gun laws, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling, but Washington has done little to address the problem in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-people-shot-in-louisiana-incident-3rd-multiple-shooting-in-one-day-101618806891996.html
19-04-2021||World||UK PM Boris Johnson cancels India visit due to current Covid-19 situation||UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Monday called off a planned visit to India this week because of the Covid-19 situation, the second time this year he has deferred a trip to the country due to the pandemic.The UK government had decided last week to reduce the length of Johnson’s visit following discussions with the Indian side. The Indian mission in London had announced the visit was to begin on April 25.“In the light of the current Coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be able to travel to India next week. Instead, Prime Ministers [Narendra] Modi and Johnson will speak later this month to agree and launch their ambitious plans for the future partnership between the UK and India,” said a spokesperson for the UK prime minister’s office.External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi added the decision to call off the visit had been made by mutual agreement. “The two sides will be holding a virtual meeting in the coming days to launch plans for a transformed India-UK relationship,” he said.Hours after the announcement regarding the cancellation of the visit, UK secretary of state for health Matt Hancock told Parliament the government had included India in the “red list” of countries facing travel restrictions.Johnson told reporters in London that he and Modi had “basically come to the conclusion that, very sadly, I won’t be able to go ahead with the trip”. He added, “I do think it’s only sensible to postpone given what’s happening in India – the shape of the pandemic there.”He said the UK’s relationship with India is of “huge importance” and that he would hold a virtual meeting with Modi on April 26. “We’ll be trying to do as much as we can virtually. Of course, it will be frustrating but we’ll try and replicate as much as we can remotely and then look forward to doing it in person as and when circumstances allow and hopefully before the [COP26] Summit in November and hopefully we’ll get Narendra Modi over for the G7 in June,” he said.In January, Johnson cancelled a visit to India to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in order to remain in Britain to focus on his government’s response to a new Coronavirus variant that was spreading rapidly at the time.While unveiling an integrated review of defence, development and foreign policy in March, the UK announced Johnson would travel to India at the end of April as part of Britain's tilt towards the Indo-Pacific. It had been expected that the bulk of Johnson’s engagements would have been in New Delhi on April 26, and that the two sides would make some key announcements and sign some agreements.Monday’s development came against the backdrop of mounting criticism in Britain for Johnson’s plans to go ahead with the trip to New Delhi at a time when India is witnessing a massive surge in Covid-19 infections. The country recorded more than 270,000 cases and more than 1,600 deaths on Sunday.Making a statement on the Covid-19 situation in the UK Parliament, Hancock said 103 cases of the Indian “double mutant” Covid-19 variant had been detected so far.“After studying the data and on a precautionary basis, we’ve made the difficult but vital decision to add India to the red list. This means anyone who is not a UK or Irish resident or a British citizen, cannot enter the UK if they’ve been in India in the previous 10 days,” Hancock said.British citizens who have been in India before their arrival will need to complete hotel quarantine of 10 days, and the rules will come into force from Friday.On Sunday, the main opposition Labour Party joined calls for Johnson to cancel his visit. “I can’t see why the prime minister can’t conduct his business with the Indian government via Zoom,” said Labour’s shadow communities secretary Steve Reed.“The prime minister, like all of us in public life, needs to try and set an example.

Only a small percentage of the population had these adverse effects for AstraZeneca," Health Undersecretary Maria Rosario Vergeire told a regular news conference, referring to countries where blood clots were reported.Health authorities will release guidelines to include different precautions on the use of the AstraZeneca shots, Vergeire added.The European Medicines Agency had earlier recommended to include blood clots as a rare side effect of the AstraZeneca vaccine.The Southeast Asian nation has yet to record blood clots as side effect. It suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine for under 60s on April 8.The Philippines, a country of 108 million people, is battling one of the worst outbreaks in Asia but has administered less than 1.5 million shots of Covid-19 vaccines, 86% of which were first doses.It has recorded 936,133 Covid-19 cases and 15,960 deaths due to the virus.The Philippines has received 525,600 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through the COVAX international vaccine-share facility. More than 900,000 more were to be shipped in May or June, according to health ministry data.Vaccines from China's Sinovac Biotech accounts for 83% of doses so far delivered to the Philippines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-lifts-suspension-on-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-for-under-60s-101618818039200.html
19-04-2021||World||Joe Biden pressed on emissions goal as climate summit nears||When President Joe Biden convenes a virtual climate summit on Thursday, he faces a vexing task: how to put forward a nonbinding but symbolic goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that will have a tangible impact not only on climate change efforts in the US but throughout the world.The emissions target, eagerly awaited by all sides of the climate debate, will signal how aggressively Biden wants to move on climate change, a divisive and expensive issue that has riled Republicans to complain about job-killing government overreach even as some on the left worry Biden has not gone far enough to address a profound threat to the planet.The climate crisis poses a complex political challenge for Biden, since the problem is harder to see and far more difficult to produce measurable results on than either the pandemic relief package or the infrastructure bill.The target Biden chooses “is setting the tone for the level of ambition and the pace of emission reductions over the next decade,″ said Kate Larsen, a former White House adviser who helped develop President Barack Obama’s climate action plan.The number has to be achievable by 2030 but aggressive enough to satisfy scientists and advocates who call the coming decade a crucial, make-or-break moment for slowing climate change, Larsen and other experts said.Scientists, environmental groups and even business leaders are calling on Biden to set a target that would cut US greenhouse gas emissions by at least 50% below 2005 levels by 2030.The 50% target, which most experts consider a likely outcome of intense deliberations underway at the White House, would nearly double the nation’s previous commitment and require dramatic changes in the power and transportation sectors, including significant increases in renewable energy such as wind and solar power and steep cuts in emissions from fossil fuels such as coal and oil.Anything short of that goal could undermine Biden’s promise to prevent temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, experts say, while likely stirring up sharp criticism from international allies and Biden’s own supportersThe target is significant, not just as a visible goal for the US to achieve after four years of climate inaction under President Donald Trump, but also for “leveraging other countries,'' Larsen said. “That helps domestically in the battle that comes after, which is implementing policies to achieve that target. We can make a better case politically at home if other countries are acting at the same level of ambition as the US″The 2030 goal, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution, or NDC, is a key part of the Paris climate agreement, which Biden rejoined on his first day in office. It’s also an important marker as Biden moves toward his ultimate goal of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050.“Clearly the science demands at least 50%” in reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said Jake Schmidt, a climate expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a leading environmental group.The 50% target “is ambitious, but it is achievable,'' he said in an interview. It's also a good climate message, he said: “People know what 50% means — it's half.''Whatever target Biden picks, the climate summit itself “proves the US is back in rejoining the international effort″ to address climate change, said Larsen, now a director at the Rhodium Group, an independent research firm.The summit is “the starting gun for climate diplomacy” after a four-year “hiatus” under Trump, she said. John Kerry, Biden's climate envoy, has been pressing global leaders in person and online ahead of the summit for commitments and alliances on climate efforts.Nathaniel Keohane, another former Obama White House adviser and now a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund, said experts have coalesced around the need to reduce emissions by at least 50% by 2030.“The number has to start with 5,” he said, adding, “We've done the math. We need at least 50%.''The 2030 target is just one in a sometimes overlapping set of goals that Biden has outlined on climate. He also has said he expects to adopt a clean energy standard that would make electricity carbon-free by 2035, along with the wider goal of net-zero carbon emissions economy-wide by 2050.Biden's climate adviser, Gina McCarthy, acknowledged that the sheer volume of numbers can be confusing. At a forum last week, she and former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg said climate activists should focus on actions in the next decade.“Let’s stop talking about 2050,'' said McCarthy, who is leading White House efforts to develop US climate commitments for 2030.Bloomberg, 79, was even more blunt: 2050 “is a good number for people who give speeches, but I don’t know anyone giving those speeches who’s going to be alive in 2050.''Some Republican lawmakers call the focus on reducing US emissions counter-productive, saying Biden's plan would raise energy costs and kill American jobs while allowing Russia, China and other countries to increase greenhouse gas emissions.“The Biden administration will set punishing targets for the United States, while our adversaries keep the status quo. That won’t solve climate change,'' said Sen. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, the top Republican on the Senate Energy Committee. The United States already leads the world in reducing carbon emissions, Barrasso said, adding that Biden should try to “make American energy as clean as we can, as fast as we can, without raising costs for consumers.”Some on the left think Biden is not going far enough.Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat who has called for a massive Green New Deal, said Biden deserves “a lot of credit” for his infrastructure plan's vision and scope, but said it falls far short of what is needed to meaningfully combat the climate crisis. She and her supporters are calling for at least $10 trillion in federal spending over the next decade to address climate change and other problems.McCarthy disputed the notion that Biden has backtracked from campaign promises to lead on climate.“We’re always either doing too little or too much,'' she told reporters earlier this month. “But rest assured that the president put a (spending) number out here that he felt was not just defensible but required to meet this moment in time.''Much of the proposed spending to address climate change is included in Biden’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure bill.If Republicans think less money should be spent on clean energy and infrastructure, McCarthy added, “then we’ll have those conversations.”Marcella Burke, a former Trump administration official who now is an energy lawyer in Houston, gives Biden an “A-Plus for enthusiasm” on climate, but an incomplete on details. “We've had a lot of goals, but not a lot of strategy announced to get there,'' she said. "So the jury is still out.''||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-pressed-on-emissions-goal-as-climate-summit-nears-101618810096964.html

19-04-2021||World||Emotions run high as Australia-New Zealand travel bubble opens||Emotions ran high Monday as excited passengers set off on the first flights to take advantage of a quarantine-free travel bubble between Australia and New Zealand, allowing families split when borders closed almost 400 days ago to finally reunite."(I'll) yell, scream, cry, hug, kiss, (feel) happy -- all of these emotions at once," Denise O'Donoghue, 63, told AFP at Sydney airport as she prepared to board her flight.The arrangement means that for the first time since the pandemic closed borders worldwide, passengers can fly in either direction across the Tasman Sea without undergoing mandatory Covid-19 quarantine when they arrive."It's a very big day and exciting for families and friends," said New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who hailed the success of both countries in containing the virus as a key factor in allowing the travel corridor.Australia was New Zealand's largest source of international tourists before the pandemic, accounting for about 1.5 million arrivals or 40 percent of total visitors in 2019.But on the first day of the bubble, most of the travelers were returning New Zealanders, with tourists expected to start arriving in large numbers during the upcoming Australian school holidays.The bubble's opening received saturation coverage from media in both countries, with live television reporting from airports providing regular updates on the progress of flights.On a grass embankment at the foot of Wellington Airport's runway, the words 'WELCOME WHANAU' (family) were spelled out in giant letters.In the airport terminal, Maori dancers performed a traditional powhiri welcoming ceremony for the arrivals.Lorraine Wratt, a New Zealander stranded by the pandemic while visiting family in Australia, told AFP it was "wonderful" to be able to travel again."We're very excited to be heading back home but we're gonna miss our family (in Australia) big time," she said."We came to Australia on December 11 to spend Christmas with our children... planning to go back in February, it's been a bit of a nightmare."'Back to normal'Australia is home to hundreds of thousands of expatriate New Zealanders and before coronavirus many regularly shuttled back and forth across the Tasman on three-hour flights."It's like it's one big country, so it's very good to open the borders, it will help all the families," Mehat El Masri told AFP as he waited to see his Sydney-based son Shady for the first time in 16 months."We appreciate it. We're doing very well in New Zealand and Australia with precautions and keeping things under control... we're fortunate compared to the rest of the world."O'Donoghue said the travel bubble's opening made her feel the world was returning to some sort of normality."I'll be going back, they'll be coming over, we'll just be back to normal," she said."What normal's going to be from now on I don't know, but I'm just really, really excited today."Air New Zealand executive Craig Suckling said the atmosphere at Sydney airport before departure was electric."It was quite the emotional rollercoaster here in Sydney," he said."The check-in area was a hive of activity and at the boarding gate, customers were eager to get on."The airline's chief executive Greg Foran said it was also a "monumental" day for those involved in the hard-hit tourism industry."(It's) a real turning point for the airline. It's day one of our revival," he said.Australia has previously flagged the possibility of travel bubbles with Singapore, South Korea, Japan and Taiwan, while New Zealand is working to allow unrestricted access to small Pacific states such as the Cook Islands and Tuvalu.Morrison has also raised the prospect that by year's end, Australians who have received a Covid-19 vaccination may be able to travel internationally then self isolate at home upon return, rather than facing two weeks quarantine in a hotel.But the leaders of both countries warned further border changes in the wake of the trans-Tasman bubble would be a slow, carefully planned process."The idea that on one day everything just opens, that's not how this is going to happen," Morrison said."It will happen cautiously and carefully, working very hard on the medical and health protections."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/emotions-run-high-as-australia-new-zealand-travel-bubble-opens-101618806598855.html
19-04-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth's handwritten note on Prince Philip's coffin harks back to her childhood: Report||Britain's Queen Elizabeth II left a handwritten note on her late husband Prince Philip's coffin as the royal family gathered on Saturday at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle for the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral, the People Magazine reported. The note was signed with the Queen's childhood nickname "Lilibet" and the report said Prince Philip is thought to be the last person to have referred to the monarch by that name. The palace refused to elaborate further on the "private detail", the magazine added.Prince Philip, the Duke of Edinburgh, died on April 9 at the age of 99. At the time of his death, the Queen and he had been married for over 73 years in a lifetime of service to the crown.Sitting by herself apart from family members at her husband's funeral on Saturday, the Queen cut a regal but solitary figure, wearing a face mask and dressed all in black, except for the diamond brooch that flashed on her left shoulder—a piece she had often worn on engagements with her husband. The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometres) west of London, but was shown live on television. Just 30 mourners were allowed to attend the funeral service.The United Kingdom observed a minute's silence at 3pm (local time) nationwide, honouring the late duke. Gunfire signalled the start of the funeral service, steeped in military and royal tradition, but, reflecting Philip’s military ties, both as the ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of the Royal Navy who served with distinction during World War II.The monarch's four children—Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward were present, as were the Queen and Philip’s eight grandchildren. William and Harry were part of the nine-member royal contingent, although their cousin, Peter Phillips, walked between them. After the service, they walked back to the castle together, seeming to chat amiably. Their appearance at the service stirred memories of the 1997 funeral of Princess Diana, when William and Harry, then 15 and 12, walked behind their mother’s coffin accompanied by Philip.The Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, who could not attend Prince Philip's funeral service held at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle on Saturday due to medical reasons, also sent a handwritten note and a personalised wreath of flowers to be laid at his services. The wreath was a special tribute from Meghan as the flowers were picked from Crossley's personal garden, made up of Eryngium to represent the Royal Marines and Acanthus mollis, the national flower of Greece, the country in which the Duke of Edinburgh was born.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-queen-left-a-wistful-handwritten-note-on-late-husband-s-coffin-report-101618802773468.html

It was dedicated to the bereaved “who could not accompany their relatives when they died and for whom important and comforting rituals of mourning were not possible”.Germany’s confirmed death toll from Covid-19 stood at 79,914 on Sunday, an increase of 67 over the previous day. It is the fifth highest total in Europe, after the UK, Italy, Russia and France.Germany had a comparatively small number of deaths in the pandemic’s first phase, but saw much higher infection levels in the fall and winter. In January, more than 1,000 deaths per day were reported at times in the country of 83 million people.Fauci expects US decision on J&J vaccine by FridayA decision on whether to end a US pause in vaccinations with the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 shot is likely by Friday, top US pandemic adviser Anthony Fauci has said. A government-convened expert panel has been assessing the vaccine’s possible links to a clotting disorder seen in a half-dozen relatively young women.Fauci told ABC that by Friday “we should have an answer as to where we’re going with it. I would think that we’re not going to go beyond Friday in the extension of this pause”.The Gaza Strip recorded its highest-ever daily toll from Covid-19, authorities said on Sunday, as the Israeli-blockaded territory struggles with a dearth of vaccines. On Sunday, the Gaza Strip’s health ministry announced “23 deaths in the past 24 hours”, taking its toll to 761 deaths.Israel, meanwhile, has lifted a mask mandate and reopened its education system in the latest easing of restrictions following its mass vaccination drive.Canada reports 2nd case of blood clot from AZ jabA second case has emerged of a person in Canada suffering from blood clots after taking AstraZeneca’ Covid-19 vaccine.The case was reported on Saturday in the province of Alberta in an unidentified man in his 60s. He had recently received a dose of the AZ vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) under the brand Covishield.The man was “diagnosed, treated promptly and is now recovering”, Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s chief medical officer of health, tweeted. Canadian health authorities continue to urge people to get vaccinated.During the course of a media interaction following the announcement of the case, Hinshaw said, “I continue to recommend AstraZeneca for anyone who is 55 and older.” She pointed out that it was only the second case in the country after more than 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered.With inputs from Anirudh Bhattacharyya||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-mourns-80k-covid-19-deaths-101618802477273.html

Austin police said its officers were “on scene of an active shooting incident” in the northwest part of the city.Austin-Travis county emergency medical services department said three “adult patients” were dead at the scene of the shooting, which was reported shortly before noon, local time.“No additional patients have been reported or located at this time,” the department said on Twitter about an hour after the incident was first reported. Police urged residents to avoid the area.In a separate incident, three people were killed and two were seriously wounded in a shooting at a busy tavern in southeastern Wisconsin early on Sunday, officials said. Kenosha County sheriff David Beth said the suspect in the shooting at Somers House Tavern is still at large, but that he believes the public is not in danger.“We believe our suspect knew who he was targeting,” Beth said during a Sunday morning news conference. He asked that anyone with information about the shooting contact the Kenosha sheriff’s department. Kenosha is about 50km south of Milwaukee, not far from the Wisconsin-Illinois border.The suspect had been asked to leave the bar, but returned and opened fire. Beth said shots were fired inside and outside the bar, which he described as “very busy” at the time. He left open the possibility that there was more than one suspect. He said he believed at least one handgun was used.Officials were still working to determine the identities of the people who died. Beth said two people died at the scene. The third person hopped in a car with two other people, who moments later flagged down a police vehicle. The officer drove the victim to a hospital where that person was pronounced dead, Beth said.The two people who were shot and wounded were taken to area hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gun-violence-us-rocked-by-two-separate-shooting-incidents-101618800833136.html

The TLP has been behind an anti-France campaign for months since President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to republish cartoons depicting Prophet Mohammed -- an act deemed blasphemous in Pakistan.The protests have paralysed cities and led to the deaths of six policemen.“The TLP members are holding five police officers and two rangers hostage,” said Rana Arif, a police spokesman in Lahore. Firdous Ashiq Awan, a spokeswoman for the Punjab provincial government, said 12 policemen had been abducted and taken to a TLP mosque in Lahore.“Violent groups armed with petrol bombs and acid bottles stormed the Nawankot police station this morning,” she tweeted. TLP leaders say several of the party’s supporters were killed in Sunday’s clashes.An oil truck was seized and petrol bombs thrown at officers, both Arif and Awan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rangers-cops-held-hostage-by-anti-france-protesters-in-pakistan-101618800328849.html

Attendees have criticised the Chicago Police Department for a long history of misconduct, particularly in Black and Latino neighbourhoods, and called for justice for Adam, who was Latino. Stillman is white.The events also have called attention to other recent killings by police, including the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis -- Derek Chauvin is on trial for Floyd's death -- and the recent fatal shooting of another Black man, Daunte Wright, in a Minneapolis suburb.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vigil-peace-walk-in-chicago-after-police-shooting-of-13-year-old-boy-101618793518464.html

19-04-2021||World||Former sheriff's deputy on the run for fatal shooting of 3 in Texas||A manhunt was underway Sunday for a former sheriff's deputy wanted in the fatal shooting of three people in Austin, Texas, as an official said it wasn't known if the suspect was still in the city.Interim Austin Police Chief Joseph Chacon said those who live near where the shooting happened late Sunday morning no longer had to shelter in place, but he said they should “remain vigilant.” He said officials were transitioning the search for Stephen Broderick, 41, from that area to a “fugitive search.”“The victims were all known to this suspect.,” Chacon said. "At this point, we do not think this individual is out there targeting random people to shoot. That does not mean he is not dangerous.“Earlier in the day, nearby residents had been asked to shelter in place and to call their neighbors to check on them. Chacon had said earlier that officials were concerned that Broderick "might possibly take a hostage and be himself sheltered somewhere waiting for us to leave.”Chacon said Broderick is 5 feet, 7 inches (1.7 meters) tall and Black. He was wearing a gray hoodie, sunglasses and a baseball cap. Chacon said police do not know if he's in a vehicle or on foot.He said that Broderick was a former deputy with the Travis County sheriff's office, which is based in Austin.Travis County District Attorney Jose Garza said in a statement that Broderick had been arrested for sexual assault of a child last June and was released on $50,000 bond. He said that the district attorney's office on Sunday filed a motion to revoke that bond and is actively supporting law enforcement as they pursue Broderick.Sheriff's spokeswoman Kristen Dark tells the Austin American-Statesman that Broderick, a property crimes detective, resigned after the arrest.The newspaper also reports that Broderick's wife filed for a protective order and divorce shortly after his arrest.Chacon said Broderick is suspected in the killing of two Hispanic women and one Black man. He said Broderick knew the victims but didn't elaborate on how or provide a motive for the shootings. Chacon also said a child was involved but that the child has been located and is safe.Brenda Torres said she was driving by when she saw a little boy flag down a car and a Black man lying facedown on the ground.“I saw the little boy point down the street," Torres said. "There was someone lying on the ground. I thought someone had just fallen down or something. As my light turns green and I’m driving, I see cop car after cop car after cop car rushing toward where I just was.”Chacon said the three were not shot in a building but did not give any further details.Following the shooting, there was a large presence of emergency responders at the scene, including dozens of police cars, several ambulances, two SWAT trucks and two police helicopters. Later Sunday, law enforcement began leaving the area.The area includes a strip mall containing several retail stores and large apartment complexes situated near wooded rolling hills.Josh Katzowitz, who had been shopping at the nearby Trader Joe’s, said police and ambulances came “pouring in” to the area as he was leaving. He didn’t hear any shooting.“The cops had their guns out,” he said. “Some had pistols, some had rifles and they were strapping on bulletproof vests. There were all of a sudden ambulances, sirens and police cars. There were cops coming from everywhere.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-sheriff-s-deputy-on-the-run-for-fatal-shooting-of-3-in-texas-101618791514743.html

Cinthya Umanzor of the Harris County Constable Precinct 4 said.The 2019 Tesla Model S was traveling at a high rate of speed, when it failed to negotiate a curve and went off the roadway, crashing to a tree and bursting into flames, local television station KHOU-TV said.After the fire was extinguished, authorities located 2 occupants in the vehicle, with one in the front passenger seat while the other was in the back seat of the Tesla, the report said, citing Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman.Tesla and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The accident comes amid growing scrutiny over Tesla's semi-automated driving system following recent accidents and as it is preparing to launch its updated "full self-driving" software to more customers.The US auto safety agency said in March it has opened 27 investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles; at least three of the crashes occurred recently.Tesla CEO Elon Musk said in January that he expects huge profits from its full self-driving software, saying he is "highly confident the car will be able to drive itself with reliability in excess of human this year."The self-driving technology must overcome safety and regulatory hurdles to achieve commercial success.Umanzor said the two crash victims were born in 1962 and 1951.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2-dead-in-tesla-crash-in-texas-that-was-believed-to-be-driverless-101618791578094.html
19-04-2021||World||Oxford starts first study to reinfect recovered Covid-19 patients||People who have fought off the Covid-19 virus will be deliberately reinfected in a first-of-its-kind trial at the University of Oxford that may shed light on how to develop more effective vaccines against the pathogen.Researchers are looking for 64 healthy, previously Covid-infected volunteers from 18 to 30 years old to be studied under controlled, quarantined conditions for at least 17 days, the U.K. university said Monday. Participants will be infected with the original strain from Wuhan, China and followed for a year.Initial data from the Oxford study should be available within several months, helping vaccine developers look at levels and types of immunity needed to prevent reinfection, and how long protection persists. Challenge trials, involving deliberate, supervised infections, are seen as particularly helpful for answering questions like these, because they allow scientists to scrutinize the details of how the body confronts the virus and vice versa.While vaccines and previous infections provide some immune protection against the coronavirus, concerns and doubts remain about how long it lasts. A recent study indicated that as much as 10% of previously infected young adults were reinfected, underscoring the need for effective vaccines to prevent spread, and Pfizer Inc.’s chief executive officer has said that booster shots may be needed to maintain the immunity provided by the initial two doses of the company’s shot.The Oxford study “has the potential to transform our understanding by providing high-quality data on how our immune system responds to a second infection,” said Shobana Balasingam, a research adviser at the Wellcome Trust, which is providing funds. The findings could “inform not just vaccine development but also research into the range of effective treatments that are also urgently needed.”One of the goals of the study is to determine how much virus, on average, it takes to infect someone who’s had the virus earlier. In a second phase of the study, a different group of patients will be given that dose and studied for their immune responses, Oxford said.The earliest volunteers in the world’s first human challenge trial involving the coronavirus, conducted by Imperial College in London, left quarantine in late March. That trial, which intentionally infected people who hadn’t previously had the virus, was backed by 33.6 million pounds ($46.3 million) of U.K. government funding.Critics of challenge trials have pointed out the ethical dangers of infecting people without being sure of its long-term consequences. The Oxford researchers said that all those enrolled will be completely fit, well and recovered from their first Covid infection.Participants who develop Covid symptoms will be treated with an antibody drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. that’s been authorized by U.S. regulators, Oxford said. Subjects will only be discharged from the quarantine unit when they are no longer infected and not at risk of infecting others, according to the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oxford-starts-first-study-to-reinfect-recovered-covid-19-patients-101618788650163.html

Christa Stedman said early Sunday afternoon that it was still an active scene and that no arrests have been made.She said the first 911 call came in at 11:44 a.m. and that three adults were fatally shot.Stedman said she did not know the exact location where the three people were killed but that emergency personnel responded to an area that included a strip mall, several retail stores with a large apartment complex behind it.Josh Katzowitz, who had been shopping at the nearby Trader Joe’s, said police and ambulances came “pouring in” to the area as he was leaving. He didn’t hear any shooting.“The cops had their guns out,” he said. “Some had pistols, some had rifles and they were strapping on bulletproof vests. There were all of a sudden ambulances, sirens and police cars There were cops coming from everywhere.”Police said on Twitter that they were on the scene of an active shooting and asked nearby residents to shelter in place and avoid the area.Images from the scene showed a large presence of emergency responders, including dozens of police cars.

19-04-2021||World||US, China agree to cooperate on climate crisis||China and the United States, the world’s two biggest carbon polluters, agreed to cooperate to curb climate change with “seriousness and urgency” and enhance collaboration in multilateral processes, including the Paris Agreement, days before President Joe Biden hosts a virtual summit of world leaders to discuss the issue.The joint statement was issued on Sunday after a meeting between Chinese climate envoy Xie Zhenhua and his US counterpart, John Kerry, in Shanghai on Thursday and Friday, China’s ecology and environment ministry said on Sunday.“China and the US, together with other countries, are committed to cooperating with each other on tackling the climate crisis, to be addressed with the seriousness and urgency that it demands,” the statement said.This includes, it added, strengthening their “respective actions and cooperating in multilateral fronts such as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement”.The two countries will continue to discuss “concrete actions in the 2020s to reduce emissions aimed at keeping the Paris Agreement-aligned temperature limit within reach”.Kerry’s Shanghai stop, carried out under strict anti-Covid-19 protocols, was the first high-level visit of an official from US President Joe Biden’s administration to China.The China-US joint statement on fighting climate crisis together comes amid strained bilateral ties on a range of issues, including Taiwan, South China Sea, Xinjiang, and Hong Kong.The dialogue marked a resumption of exchange on climate between China and the US, the two biggest greenhouse gas emitters, halted during former US President Donald Trump’s tenure.Biden brought the US back into the Paris climate accord; Washington had withdrawn from it under Trump.“Moving forward, China and the US are firmly committed to working together and with other parties to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement,” the joint statement said.Climate cooperation between the two countries will include renewable energy, green and climate-resilient agriculture, low-carbon transportation, and emissions of methane and other non-CO2 greenhouse gases.Meeting with reporters in Seoul on Sunday, Kerry said the language in the statement is “strong” and that the two countries agreed on “critical elements on where we have to go.” But the former secretary of state said, “I learned in diplomacy that you don’t put your back on the words, you put on actions. We all need to see what happens.”Chinese vice foreign minister Le Yucheng, in an interview to Associated Press, welcomed the US’ return on international climate affairs under the Biden administration but urged it “to redouble its efforts to make up for the time lost during its absence”, referring to the time when Trump withdrew from the Paris accord.Le reiterated China’s goals to peak its carbon dioxide emission by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.China said in the joint statement that it is looking forward to the Biden-led virtual climate summit to be held this week. Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Chinese President Xi Jinping, to the April 22-23 summit.It is not yet known if Chinese President Xi Jinping will join the summit.The US and other countries are expected to announce more ambitious national targets for cutting carbon emissions ahead of or at the meeting, along with pledging financial help for climate efforts by less wealthy nations.During a video meeting with German and French leaders Friday, Xi said that climate change “should not become a geopolitical chip, a target for attacking other countries or an excuse for trade barriers”, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.On whether Xi would join the summit, Le said “the Chinese side is actively studying the matter.”(With inputs from Associated Press)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/differences-aside-china-and-us-agree-to-fight-climate-crisis-together-101618747526900.html
