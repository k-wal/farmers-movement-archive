The Chinese side firmly supports the Indian Government and people in fighting the pandemic," he wrote in the letter, a copy of which was tweeted by Chinese Ambassador to India Sun Weidong.Wang said that anti pandemic materials produced in China are entering India at a faster pace to help India fight the epidemic."The Chinese side will continue to do its utmost to provide support and help according to the needs of India. We hope and believe that under the leadership of the Indian Government, the Indian people will surely prevail over the epidemic at an early date,” he added.Wang's letter came even as the militaries of the two countries are yet to resolve the disengagement from the remaining areas of eastern Ladakh after the withdrawal from Pangong lake area in February.Meanwhile, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin on Thursday termed as "fake news" the reports of the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum's (USISPF) allegations that Beijing has stopped shipments of oxygen concentrators being procured from China to be delivered to India to meet the oxygen shortages in view of the surge of COVID-19 cases.Asked about the media reports quoting Mukesh Aghi, President and CEO of Washington based USISPF, stating China has stopped all-cargo flights delaying his organisation’s efforts to source one lakh oxygen concentrators from China to India, Wang Wenbin said it is a "fake news".Aghi was quoted as saying that in order to overcome logistics challenges, his organisation is sourcing the oxygen concentrators from China for easy transportation to India.He alleged that in view of Chinese action to stop the logistics flights to India, the concentrators are to be routed through Tokyo and Dubai resulting in delay."This is fake news…reports that China has stopped transport of oxygen generators procured by the USA to India is fake news," the spokesman said.He, however, declined to respond to questions about when state-run Sichuan Airlines which had suspended all 11 of its cargo flights to India resulting in disruption of procurement of oxygen concentrators would resume its flights.After the announcement to suspend the flights on April 26 in view of the COVID-19, the airline retracted its decision and said it is working out a new plan to resume the services. But so far it has not announced any new schedule.Asked when the airline would resume its operations, Wang Wenbin said, "I would refer you to the relevant airline"."China shows deep sympathy to India as the country struggles with rampant COVID-19 and China expresses its sincere condolences to the Indian people. We reiterate China’s willingness to help and support India as per its needs,” he said."Chinese companies have been led by the government to take actions. The first batch of oxygen concentrators have arrived in India. We would like to cooperate with India in multiple ways to provide assistance. We believe India will defeat the virus," he said.Asked how many oxygen concentrators have been sent to India, he said, “for specific numbers you may refer to websites of Chinese embassy and Consulates in India”.China’s Ambassador to India Sun Weidong in a tweet on Wednesday said Chinese medical suppliers are working overtime on orders from India, “at least 25000 orders for oxygen concentrators in recent days. Cargo planes are under plan for medical supplies. Chinese customs will facilitate relevant process”.Wu Zunyou, a chief epidemiologist with the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention told the media here, the ‘Indian strain’ of the coronavirus has been detected in some Chinese cities.The surge in COVID-19 cases in some Asian countries has again sounded the alarm that the prevention and control of COVID-19 is far from over, which, instead, is difficult, complex, recurrent and long-term, Wu said, the state-run CGTN-TV reported.According to official media reports, about 11 Chinese crew members of a cargo ship tested positive for the coronavirus after returning from India.Wu also pointed out that the mutation of the novel coronavirus has been occurring since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and will not stop as long as the pandemic continues. But the transmission of different virus variants can be stopped, Wu said."Implementing containment measures is crucial both to stop the spread of the mutant strains and to prevent the occurrence of new mutations," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/firmly-support-india-in-fight-against-covid-19-wang-yi-writes-to-jaishankar-101619714772524.html
29-04-2021||World||Facebook to pay $5 million to local journalists in newsletter push||Facebook Inc on Thursday said it will give $5 million to pay local journalists in multiyear deals as part of its new publishing platform to help independent writers attract an audience and make money through the social media network.The move is part of Facebook's answer to the trend of email newsletters, led by platforms like Substack, as it focuses on reporters "who are often the lone voice covering a given community," the company has said.The publishing platform, which Facebook announced last month, will be integrated with Facebook Pages and include a free self-publishing tool for journalists to send out newsletters or create their own website.Independent journalists in the United States can apply to the program beginning on Thursday, and priority will be given to reporters who plan to cover "Black, Indigenous, Latinx, Asian or other audiences of color," in locations that lack an existing news source, Facebook said.Journalists will be able to earn additional money from publishing stories using Facebook's tools, starting with subscriptions, and each writer can set their own price, the company added.Emily Bell, director of the Tow Center for Digital Journalism at Columbia Journalism School, tweeted Thursday that while journalists and their communities will, hopefully, benefit from Facebook's funding, the news industry will "have to reckon with the economic foundation of this Faustian pact," because Facebook has been used as a tool to oppress reporters around the world and its business relies on news workers like content moderators who are "not unionized or paid well."The growth of paid newsletters has shaken up the news media world, as high-profile journalists from outlets including the New York Times and Vox Media have left to strike out on their own on platforms such as Substack and Patreon, lured by cash advances and uncapped earning potential from subscriptions.Substack announced "Substack Local" this month, a $1 million program to pay up to 30 local reporters to build their own subscription-supported business.Facebook said it would partner with the Washington-based International Center for Journalists and National Association of Hispanic Journalists to evaluate applications, and would give the journalists selected access to experts and services to help them build a news business.The social network has long had a strained relationship with the news industry, which came to a head in February after a showdown with the Australian government over paying news outlets for content. Following the conflict, Facebook pledged to invest $1 billion in the news industry globally over the next three years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-to-pay-5-million-to-local-journalists-in-newsletter-push-101619708223816.html
29-04-2021||World||Dutch government pauses Covid-19 app over data leak fears||The Dutch government has temporarily disabled its coronavirus warning app amid data privacy concerns for people who have the app installed on phones using the Android operating system.Health Minister Hugo de Jonge announced late Wednesday that the CoronaMelder app will stop sending warnings for 48 hours while the government checks if users' data is secure.The Dutch app uses “exposure notification” technology developed by Google and Apple that generates random codes that can be exchanged by phones whose users are close to one another for long enough to possibly transmit the virus.The Dutch health ministry says that it is possible for other apps on Android phones to access data about whether its user's had been infected and its contacts with other phones.“The privacy of users is always a priority. While Google must solve the problem, I can limit the consequences. That’s why we’re taking this decision,” De Jonge said in a statement.Most EU nations have designed contact tracing apps around the same technology, the European Commission said. The Commission said that it has informed controllers of national apps in the 27-nation EU “so that Member States take the necessary steps if necessary.”According to the Dutch health ministry, Google informed the government Wednesday it has fixed the issue. The government halted messages from the app for 48 hours to check if the leak has been fixed.In a statement emailed to The Associated Press, Google said it has been “rolling out a fix for an issue where random Bluetooth identifiers used by the Exposure Notification framework on Android were temporarily accessible to a limited number of pre-installed applications.”The tech giant said that the rollout began several weeks ago and it expects the fix "to be available to all Android users in the coming days.”Google said that random Bluetooth identifiers “on their own have no practical value to bad actors, and it is extremely unlikely that developers of pre-installed apps were aware of the inadvertent availability of those identifiers.”The company added that it has no indications that any data from coronavirus exposure apps was accessed inappropriately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dutch-government-pauses-covid-19-app-over-data-leak-fears-101619700435855.html
29-04-2021||World||India’s ‘double mutant’ strain detected in some Chinese cities: Top official||China has detected the novel coronavirus strain found in India in some Chinese cities, the country’s chief epidemiologist said on Thursday.The Indian Covid-19 strain has been detected in “…some cities in my country, and everyone is very concerned, and also worried,” Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at China’s Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said at a press conference on Thursday.China wasn’t one of the 17 countries where, according to the World Health Organisation (WHO), the Indian strain of Sars-CoV-2, also known as B.1.617 or “double mutant”, had been detected.The WHO on Tuesday said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 had been detected in over 1,200 sequences “from at least 17 countries” that had been uploaded to the GISAID open-access database. “Most sequences were uploaded from India, the United Kingdom, the U.S. and Singapore,” the WHO said in its weekly epidemiological update on the pandemic.Wu’s statement comes two days ahead of Labour Day holidays beginning Saturday when hundreds of millions of people in China are expected to travel across the country. Public transport bookings have exceeded pre-pandemic 2019-levels.Though Wu did not share details about the cities where the strain was detected, his statement comes after state media reported that 11 Chinese nationals on a cargo ship tested positive for coronavirus after returning from a journey, which included a stop at the Indian port of Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh.Health officials in Zhejiang, a coastal province, said 11 cases of “imported” Covid-19 infections from India were reported from among the 20 Chinese crew members of the cargo ship in the province’s Zhoushan port.The ship, Huayang Chaoyang, had docked at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh during its journey, had also stopped at Chittagong in Bangladesh, Singapore, and Xiamen in China.The crew was tested this week after the ship docked at Zhoushan Xinya Shipyard in Zhejiang province for repairs.It’s not clear where the Chinese crew members were infected with the Indian strain of the coronavirus.In Beijing, the chief epidemiologist Wu said the surge in Covid-19 cases in some Asian countries has again underlined that the prevention and control of Covid-19 is far from over and the disease is going to be difficult, complex, recurrent, and long-term.Wu was responding to questions on the pandemic situation in India and whether Chinese authorities were taking measures to guard against it.He pointed out, according to state broadcaster, CGTN, that the mutation of the novel coronavirus has been occurring since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, and will not stop as long as the pandemic continues.But the transmission of different virus variants can be stopped, Wu said.“Implementing containment measures is crucial both to stop the spread of the mutant strains and to prevent the occurrence of new mutations.”China’s national health commission (NHC) said on Thursday that all of the 20 new cases reported in the past 24 hours were imported infections originating from overseas.A total of 5,644 confirmed cases have been reported in the country, the NHC said.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed cases, fell to 14 from 17 cases a day earlier.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 90,642, while the death toll remains at 4,636.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-double-mutant-strain-detected-in-some-chinese-cities-top-official-101619701723046.html

The median estimate in a Bloomberg survey of economists was 540,000 claims. The prior week’s total was revised up to 566,000.The drop in unemployment benefits applications is the latest sign the job market is steadily returning to its pre-pandemic strength. As more businesses and states reopen in the coming months, hiring is expected to continue to accelerate. Claims data have been volatile during the pandemic amid backlogs, fraud and new programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-fell-last-week-to-fresh-pandemic-era-low-101619700072789.html
29-04-2021||World||Alexei Navalny's political network disbands ahead of 'extremism' ruling||A key aide to jailed Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny said Thursday his organisation was disbanding its national network ahead of a court ruling expected to declare it an extremist organisation.The announcement came as Navalny made his first video appearance in court since ending a hunger strike last week, appearing gaunt in a prison uniform and with a buzz haircut.During the hearing, which is part of an appeal by Navalny against a defamation sentence imposed in February for insulting a World War II veteran, the opposition figure said he had lost more weight but had started eating again."I was taken to a bathhouse yesterday... there was a mirror there, I looked at myself -- I am just a horrible skeleton," Navalny told the court, according to an audio recording released by the independent Dozhd television channel.Another court was holding a hearing Thursday into a request from prosecutors that Navalny's regional network and his Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) be recognised as extremist, equating the organisations with the Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda.If the request is met, their activities would be banned, putting members and supporters at risk of lengthy jail time.The head of the regional networks said Thursday it had already been decided to shutter the network."We are officially disbanding Navalny's network," Leonid Volkov said in a video posted on social media.He said some of the offices would continue their activities as independent organisations.Earlier this week, prosecutors ordered the network to suspend its activities ahead of the ruling and a court imposed sweeping bans on FBK.FBK was launched in 2011 and routinely releases investigations into alleged corruption by officials at all levels of government, often accompanied by YouTube videos.The regional network was founded during Navalny's presidential campaign in 2018, although the opposition figure was barred from running.It later supported his graft investigations as well as the Smart Voting strategy, which directs voters to cast their ballots for candidates best placed to defeat Kremlin-linked opponents.Navalny was arrested in January after returning to Russia from Germany, where he had spent months recovering from a poisoning attack that he says was orchestrated by President Vladimir Putin.He is serving a two-and a-half year sentence in a penal colony outside Moscow for violating parole terms on old fraud charges he and his allies say are politically motivated.The opposition figure refused food for three weeks, demanding adequate medical treatment in prison for severe back pain and numbness in his limbs.Last week he ended the 24-day hunger strike after he was examined at a civilian hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/alexei-navalny-s-political-network-disbands-ahead-of-extremism-ruling-101619693969355.html
29-04-2021||World||China launches key module of space station planned for 2022||China launched an unmanned module on Thursday containing what will become living quarters for three crew on a permanent space station that it plans to complete by the end of 2022, state media reported.The module, named "Tianhe", or "Harmony of the Heavens", was launched on the Long March 5B, China's largest carrier rocket, at 11:23 a.m. (0323 GMT) from the Wenchang Space Launch Centre on the southern island of Hainan.Tianhe is one of three main components of what would be China's first self-developed space station, rivalling the only other station in service - the International Space Station (ISS).The ISS is backed by the United States, Russia, Europe, Japan and Canada. China was barred from participating by the United States."(Tianhe) is an important pilot project in the building of a powerful nation in both technology and in space," state media quoted President Xi Jinping as saying in a congratulatory speech.Tianhe forms the main living quarters for three crew members in the Chinese space station, which will have a life span of at least 10 years.The Tianhe launch was the first of 11 missions needed to complete the space station, which will orbit Earth at an altitude of 340 to 450 km (211-280 miles).In the later missions, China will launch the two other core modules, four manned spacecraft and four cargo spacecraft.Work on the space station programme began a decade ago with the launch of a space lab Tiangong-1 in 2011, and later, Tiangong-2 in 2016.Both helped China test the programme's space rendezvous and docking capabilities.China aims to become a major space power by 2030. It has ramped up its space programme with visits to the moon, the launch of an uncrewed probe to Mars and the construction of its own space station.In contrast, the fate of the ageing ISS - in orbit for more than two decades - remains uncertain.The project is set to expire in 2024, barring funding from its partners. Russia said this month that it would quit the project from 2025.Russia is deepening ties with China in space as tensions with Washington rise.Moscow has slammed the U.S.-led Artemis moon exploration programme and instead chosen to join Beijing in setting up a lunar research outpost in the coming years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-launches-key-module-of-space-station-planned-for-2022-101619689648898.html

He added it takes about four to six weeks to evaluate the data."If all goes well, as soon as the data is evaluated, we will be able to submit the application for approval of the vaccine for all children in the respective age group in different countries," he said.BioNTech and Pfizer asked U.S. regulators this month to approve emergency use of their vaccine for adolescents aged 12 to 15.Sahin was quoted by Spiegel as saying the company was "in the final stages before submission" to European regulators for children aged 12 and older.A trial published at the end of March found the companies' COVID-19 vaccine was safe, effective and produces robust antibody responses in adolescents.The Pfizer/BioNTech two-shot vaccine is already authorized for use in those aged 16 and above.Young people are less likely to suffer severe cases of COVID-19 and more likely to have asymptomatic infection, allowing them to unwittingly transmit COVID-19 to others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biontech-expects-vaccine-trial-results-for-babies-by-september-101619689050732.html
29-04-2021||World||This French biotech may be dark horse of vaccine race with 'variant-proof' shot||As the battle with Covid-19 rages around the world, a small French biotech has a possible solution for the long-term war against the virus and the rapidly spreading mutations.The company, Valneva SE, has a vaccine that could be more variant-proof, giving it an edge over other shots in what may be an annual campaign against a disease that’s already killed more than 3 million people. The first participant in its phase three trials will be dosed this week. If successful, that could lead to an approved shot in the fall.Valneva’s shot is the only candidate in clinical trials in Europe that uses a tried-and-true vaccine technology involving an inactivated version of the whole virus it’s targeting. Inactivated vaccines — a century-old approach adopted for flu and polio — take a sample of the disease that has been killed and use it to stimulate an immune response without creating infection.With all the other Covid-19 vaccines in the region focused on the virus’s spike protein, the shot could protect against variants that might compromise others, making it the perfect booster.The company already has a deal with the U.K. to supply up to 190 million doses. Kate Bingham, former head of the U.K.’s Vaccine Taskforce, says that if the shot is successful it will probably be used as a winter booster for older adults.“Having that broader antigenic real estate from a whole virus vaccine really matters,” she said. “Viruses mutate. So by having a broader immune response, which you get with a whole vaccine, you can potentially provide that ongoing protection.”The healthcare implications in a post-Covid world are huge. And for Valneva, with a $100 million listing planned on Nasdaq this year, the financial stakes are high. The U.K. contract is worth up to 1.4 billion euros ($1.7 billion), more than 10 times its annual revenues last year. The company said Thursday that it will sell about 7.1 million shares in the offering, and use the proceeds to fund the Covid vaccine as well as the development of other products in its pipeline.The path to success is not straightforward, though. Due to the more onerous development involved with an inactivated approach, the Valneva vaccine was always going to be later into the clinic than other shots, which means its advanced trials are starting in the U.K. when more than half the country has already been vaccinated.As a result, the vaccine is being tested head-to-head with a shot from AstraZeneca Plc and the University of Oxford, rather than a dummy placebo, and must show an equal or superior antibody response.“There is no development without risk,” said Chief Executive Officer Thomas Lingelbach, who doesn’t know how the chance of regulatory approval would be affected if the shot was even slightly less effective than the Astra vaccine. “To be honest with you I don’t even like to think about that scenario.”It’s not the first time the 57-year-old has taken a risk.In summer 2012, when he was CEO of Austrian biotech Intercell AG, Lingelbach met Franck Grimaud, the chief executive of French company Vivalis, at one of Vienna’s oldest restaurants. Both businesses were struggling, and a London banker had suggested the pair get together to discuss a possible tie-up.By the end of their meal at Ofenloch, they decided that together they could become a key specialist vaccine company focused on developing inoculations for diseases with limited preventive or therapeutic treatment options.“In one evening we put everything on the table, where we are strong, where we are weak, and why it would make sense to join,” said Grimaud, who is now Valneva’s president and chief business officer. “We did what we said during this meeting.”When the pandemic hit last year, the company had two approved travel vaccines in its portfolio, one for Japanese encephalitis and another for cholera. Two more, against Lyme disease and Chikungunya, a virus contracted from mosquitoes, were in the clinical phase. As soon as it became clear Covid-19 wasn’t going away quickly, the Valneva executives saw an opportunity to capitalize on the company’s experience.With Pfizer Inc., Moderna Inc. and Oxford pursuing messenger RNA and adenovirus vaccines, there was a gap for an inactivated approach. In April 2020, as much of Europe went into lockdown and infections climbed rapidly, the company started work on a shot using its Japanese encephalitis platform.The idea was it would be “complementary to the other vaccines, either in terms of sub-population — immunosuppressed, pregnant women, children, or, and we see it more and more emerging, the fact that inactivated vaccines could make sense as a booster,” said Grimaud, 55.The U.K. quickly signed up to buy the shot and invested in a Valneva manufacturing site in Scotland. Human trials started in December and reported positive data this month — producing significant levels of antibodies in more than 90% of participants and raising no safety concerns.Another potential deal with the European Commission, in the works since the third quarter of 2020, ended this month. The company is now focusing on bilateral deals with individual EU countries.Lingelbach won’t go into details but alludes to problems European officials had with the U.K. getting priority treatment — a factor baked into the British deal from the start. A spokesman for the European Commission said it’s aware of Valneva's position and in discussion with member states on how to proceed. The company didn’t meet certain conditions for a deal, he said.“Despite a lot of effort we have not made progress,” Lingelbach said. “It has gone in circles, and circles and circles.”The company has also had discussions with Australia and Canada about possible orders.Other inactivated Covid-19 vaccines exist beyond Europe. China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and Sinopharm have also used the approach. While the Sinovac vaccine initially posted an efficacy figure of about 50% — lower than other vaccines and around the minimum regulatory threshold needed — more real-world data suggests the number could be higher. Sinopharm’s inactivated shots have both reported efficacy above 70%.In an ideal world, the Valneva vaccine would be tested against another inactivated shot, said Lingelbach, but because there isn’t an approved one in the West the Astra vaccine was the next best comparator. Adjustments have had to be made to take account of different dosing schedules and the age restriction on the Astra shot in the U.K.Alongside the possibility that the Covid vaccine could be a regular booster shot providing sustainable revenue, the company is also hoping its Lyme and Chikungunya vaccines will both be in use by 2025, moving the company into a different league.Valneva has added hundreds of staff and plans to go from output of about three million vaccines a year to more than 100 million next year if the Covid shot is successful.“It’s not the same game,” said Grimaud. It’s “what makes us wake up every morning, but sometimes not sleep at night as well.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/this-french-biotech-may-be-dark-horse-of-vaccine-race-with-variant-proof-shot-101619686521666.html
29-04-2021||World||US pushes ahead with nuclear plans despite watchdog concerns||The Biden administration appears to be picking up where former President Donald Trump left off as the federal agency that oversees U.S. nuclear research and bomb-making has approved the first design phase for a multibillion-dollar project to manufacture key components for the nation’s nuclear arsenal.The National Nuclear Security Administration in a decision announced Wednesday stated that planning and construction could cost upwards of $4 billion initially. The agency doesn’t articulate what exactly that money would be spent on nor does it include the cost of other preparations that would be needed for Los Alamos National Laboratory to begin producing 30 plutonium cores per year.The push to resume production of the nuclear triggers has spanned multiple presidential administrations, with supporters arguing that the U.S. needs to ensure the stability and reliance of its arsenal given growing global security concerns. The nuclear agency also has said most of the cores in the stockpile date back to the 1970s and 1980s.Democratic members of New Mexico's congressional delegation have supported production at Los Alamos given the billions of dollars in federal funding and thousands of jobs that are at stake. But watchdog groups have been sounding alarms over the potential for more security and safety lapses at the northern New Mexico lab and the potential for environmental contamination.Another concern is the nuclear waste that would be generated by the work.Watchdog groups say the cost estimate outlined by the agency in its decision is roughly double the projections made just last year.Greg Mello with the Los Alamos Study Group said the ballooning budget and uncertainty over whether the lab can meet the federal government's mandated production schedule “throw further doubt on the wisdom of proceeding with industrial pit production” at Los Alamos.“LANL’s facilities are simply too old and inherently unsafe, its location too impractical,” he said. “Even with a much smaller stockpile, LANL could not undertake this mission successfully.”Some groups have threatened to sue the U.S. Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, saying a more comprehensive review should have been done on the plans to produce plutonium cores Los Alamos and at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. They argue that nearby communities already have been saddled with legacy contamination from previous defense work.Jay Coghlan of Nuclear Watch New Mexico called the federal government's plans “unnecessary and provocative,” saying more production will result in more waste and help to fuel a new arms race.The nuclear agency in a statement said it expects to set cost and schedule baselines in 2023 as part of the ongoing process. It also plans to continue reviewing the project “to improve the fidelity” of price and timeline estimates.Lab Director Thom Mason is scheduled Thursday evening to host a community meeting to talk about the lab's work, which also includes projects related to space exploration, the coronavirus pandemic, water supplies in the arid West and wildfires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pushes-ahead-with-nuclear-plans-despite-watchdog-concerns-101619685599650.html

29-04-2021||World||US eyes major rollback in Iran sanctions to revive nuclear deal||The Biden administration is considering a near wholesale rollback of some of the most stringent Trump-era sanctions imposed on Iran in a bid to get the Islamic Republic to return to compliance with a landmark 2015 nuclear accord, according to current and former US officials and others familiar with the matter.As indirect talks continue this week in Vienna to explore the possibility of reviving the nuclear deal, American officials have become increasingly expansive about what they might be prepared to offer Iran, which has been driving a hard line on sanctions relief, demanding that all US penalties be removed, according to these people.American officials have refused to discuss which sanctions are being considered for removal. But they have said they are open to lifting any sanctions that are inconsistent with the nuclear deal or that deny Iran the relief it would be entitled to should it return to compliance with the accord.Because of the complex nature of the sanctions architecture, that could include non-nuclear sanctions, such as those tied to terrorism, missile development and human rights.Biden administration officials say this is necessary because of what they describe as a deliberate attempt by the Trump administration to stymie any return to the deal. Under the 2015 agreement, the United States was required to lift sanctions tied to Iran's nuclear programme, but not non-nuclear sanctions.Administration officials deny they will remove all non-nuclear sanctions, but have declined to identify those which they believe Trump improperly imposed on terrorism and other grounds.“Any return to the JCPOA would require sanctions relief, but we are considering removing only those sanctions that are inconsistent with the JCPOA,” said State Department spokesman Ned Price.“Even if we rejoin the JCPOA — which remains a hypothetical — we would retain and continue to implement sanctions on Iran for activities not covered by the JCPOA, including Iran's missile proliferation, support for terrorism, and human rights abuses.”When President Donald Trump re-imposed sanctions after withdrawing from the deal in 2018, he not only put the nuclear sanctions back in but also added layers of terrorism and other sanctions on many of the same entities. In addition, the Trump administration imposed an array of new sanctions on previously unsanctioned entities.This has put the current administration in an awkward position: Iran is demanding the removal of all sanctions. If the US doesn't lift at least some of them, Iran says it won't agree to halt its nuclear activities barred by the deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA.But if the Biden administration makes concessions that go beyond the nuclear-specific sanctions, Republican critics and others, including Israel and Gulf Arab states, are likely to seize on them as proof that the administration is caving to Iran. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has led the charge among Trump alumni to denounce any easing of sanctions.Former Trump administration officials say all the sanctions are legitimate. Gabriel Noronha, a former State Department senior adviser on Iran, said all the Trump-era sanctions had been approved by career Justice Department lawyers and would have been rejected if they weren't legitimate.But a senior State Department official involved in the negotiations said officials now “have to go through every sanction to look at whether they were legitimately or not legitimately imposed.”The official, who like the others spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the private talks, also said the US would be prepared to lift sanctions that would otherwise deny Iran the benefits of the deal. Those sanctions could include restrictions on Iran's ability to access the international financial system, including dealing in dollar-based transactions.“There are sanctions that are inconsistent with the JCPOA and as we have said, if Iran resumes its compliance with the nuclear deal ... we would be prepared to lift those sanctions that are inconsistent with the JCPOA,” Price said last week. He declined to elaborate on what might be “inconsistent” with the deal.Those comments suggest that sanctions imposed on Iran's Central Bank, its national oil and shipping companies, its manufacturing, construction and financial sectors are on the block. Deal critics briefed on aspects of the Vienna negotiations say they suspect that is indeed the case.That's because the bank, oil, shipping and other sanctions, all ostensibly imposed by the Trump administration for terrorism, ballistic missile and human rights concerns, also affect nuclear sanctions relief.Current officials say no decisions have yet been made and nothing will be agreed in Vienna until everything regarding sanctions relief and Iran's return to compliance with the nuclear deal has been settled.But critics of the nuclear deal fear the administration will go beyond even what has been suggested by the administration's oblique comments. They suspect that sanctions on people, companies, government agencies or other entities identified for nuclear sanctions relief in the 2015 deal will be cleared; even if they were subsequently penalized on other grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-eyes-major-rollback-in-iran-sanctions-to-revive-nuclear-deal-101619681432609.html

29-04-2021||World||10 Chinese sailors on cargo ship infected with Indian variant of Covid-19||At least 10 Chinese nationals on a cargo ship docked at a port in eastern China have been found to be infected with a Covid-19 variant from India, health authorities said on Thursday.Chinese authorities didn’t share details of whether they were infected with the variant of the coronavirus currently prevalent in India.Health officials in Zhejiang, a coastal province, said 11 cases of “imported” Covid-19 infections, including 10 from India, were reported in the last 24 hours - all among the 20 Chinese crew members of the ship - from Zhoushan port.There is one asymptomatic Covid-19 case as well, the health authorities said on social media, a state media report said on Thursday.According to a state media report, the ship Huayang Chaoyang had docked at Kakinada in Andhra Pradesh earlier this year besides stopping over at Chittagong in Bangladesh, Singapore, and Xiamen in China.The ship had docked at Zhoushan Xinya Shipyard for repairs when the crew were tested and 11 were found to be Covid-19 positive.It’s not clear how the Chinese crew members were infected with an Indian variant of the coronavirus.The World Health Organization (WHO) on Tuesday said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19, which is said to be contributing to a surge in cases across India, has been found in 17 countries. China was not among the countries named.China’s national health commission (NHC) said in a statement on Thursday that all of the 20 new cases reported in the past 24 hours were infections originating from overseas.A total of 5,644 confirmed imported cases have been reported in the country, the NHC said.The number of new asymptomatic cases, which China does not classify as confirmed infections, had fallen to 14 from 17 a day earlier.The total number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in mainland China now stands at 90,642, while the death toll is 4,636.While direct commercial passenger flights between India and China have been discontinued for more than a year, Beijing also banned special flights from India in November after several positive Covid-19 cases were detected on one such flight.The Chinese embassy and consulates in India have effectively stopped issuing visas to Indians. Thousands of Indians, including a large number of students studying in China, have been stranded in their home country for more than a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/10-chinese-sailors-on-cargo-ship-infected-with-indian-variant-of-covid19-101619677782055.html

He said that his party would not allow the oppression of farmers in Sindh and the relief price would be ₹2,000 per 40kg in the province."Today, for the first time in the history of the country, the support price of wheat is not the same in all the provinces and Imran Khan is responsible for this oppression of the farmers of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan," he alleged.The PPP chairman also underscored the prices of fertilisers, seeds, pesticides, agricultural machinery and electricity that have gone up by 150 per centReminding the people that the federal government had already created two wheat crises in three years, he said that it was due to the poor planning of Prime Minister Imran Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government that today only two to two-and-a-half weeks of wheat stock was available in the country."If the crisis is not dealt with, the country may once again face a shortage of flour," he said.According to Dawn, Bilawal lamented that Pakistan, which was known as a wheat-producing country, is now importing wheat, adding that the ruler of Pakistan (Imran Khan) was unfortunately not even familiar with "alphabets of the word agriculture".Meanwhile, in a separate statement, PPP's parliamentary leader in the Senate Sherry Rehman expressed concern over the government's plan to split Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) into two companies, Dawn reported."The Tabahi Sarkar (destructive government) has literally crashed PIA by compromising several Pakistani pilots with clean licences, got the airline grounded in EU capitals after the 'Licencegate', sold PIA assets abroad via crony shell firms and are now cannibalising 'old PIA' to create new business ventures. This is a new low," she said.Around 2,000 PIA employees had been forced to take voluntary redundancy and now the plan was to lay off half of its 14,000 employees, the Senator added."Why did the government recently mislead the people by claiming PIA losses have been brought down? If this was the case then what losses are they talking about now? The national flag carrier posted a net loss of ₹34.6 billion (USD 226 million) in 2020, its loan has caused an overall loss of ₹460bn, the iconic Roosevelt Hotel in New York has been sold and our profitable international routes were given to competitors," she said.Rehman blamed the government's incompetence over PIA's losses and said that PIA flights had been banned in Europe and the US because of the Pakistan aviation minister's "callous statement".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-approaching-another-flour-crisis-warns-bilawal-bhutto-101619676717671.html
29-04-2021||World||Biden pledges NATO-like military presence in Indo-Pacific||The US will “maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific” just as it does with NATO in Europe, and it will retain an “over-the-horizon” capability as it leaves Afghanistan in September, President Joe Biden has said in his first address to a joint session of Congress.In a 65-minute speech to a chamber sparsely populated in view of the Covid-19 pandemic, Biden recalled major accomplishments of his first 100 days in office such as a rescue plan and laid out his agenda for the remainder of his term that many experts described as the most progressive for a Democratic president in decades.“America is on the move again,” he said as he started his speech that was focused mostly on domestic issues, such as the handling of the pandemic, economic recovery, healthcare expansion, gun rights reforms, immigration policy, eradication of child poverty, raising the minimum wage to $15, equal pay for women, among others.Biden also spoke on key foreign policy issues such as America’s relations with China, the main competitor, and the pull-out of troops from Afghanistan that he has pledged to wrap up by September 11 - the 10the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks in the US.“We will maintain a strong military presence in the Indo-Pacific just as we do with NATO in Europe – not to start conflict – but to prevent conflict,” the US president said he told China’s President Xi Jinping when the latter had called to congratulate him.Biden never fails to bring up that conversation, and he mentioned it again, saying it had lasted two hours.No details were available immediately of plans to boost US military presence in the region, as the area of responsibility of the Indo-Pacific Command, with a look-in from the Africa Command and the Central Command in the Biden administration’s expanded vision of the region as the Western Indian Ocean Region (WIOR).Former US president Donald Trump had also spoken of a stronger military presence in the Indo-Pacific, but at the expense of American presence in Europe, by moving troops from Germany. Trump didn’t stay long enough in office to get that done, and the redeployment was abandoned by the Biden administration.Reasserting his tough stand on China, Biden, a veteran of foreign policy issues going back decades in the US Senate, said, “America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and industries, like subsidies for state-owned enterprises and the theft of American technologies and intellectual property.”On Afghanistan, a major policy issue for the Biden administration that India is following closely, the American president said, “After 20 years of American valour and sacrifice, it’s time to bring our troops home. Even as we do, we will maintain an over-the-horizon capability to suppress future threats to the homeland.”That should give New Delhi some comfort as worried as it has been with Biden’s decision to pull troops out of Afghanistan without a residual force, something that he himself had advocated against as a candidate for the White House.“But make no mistake - the terrorist threat has evolved beyond Afghanistan since 2001, and we will remain vigilant against threats to the United States, wherever they come from,” Biden said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-pledges-nato-like-military-presence-in-indopacific-101619675381637.html

29-04-2021||World||25% global Covid-19 deaths occurred in Americas, says Pan American Health Organization||The uncontrolled spread of the coronavirus through all Americas accounted for a major part of global deaths last week, with one in four COVID-19 deaths in the world taking place here, says Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) Director Carissa Etienne."One in four COVID deaths reported worldwide last week took place right here, in the Americas. Nearly every country in Central America is reporting a rise in infections," CNN cited her press conference on Wednesday.For the first time, Canada's infection rates have surpassed the US COVID-19 infection rates, the PAHO director informed.The surge of infections is being led by new COVID-19 variants, which slow vaccination rollouts, due to lack of vaccine availability, are also providing major setbacks for a number of countries in the Americas.Many health systems across South and Central America are struggling to cope with the influx of patients, Etienne said, adding that hospitalisations are "at an all-time high" in Costa Rica, Guatemala's hospitals have reached maximum capacity and hospitals in several major Colombian cities are running out of intensive care beds.Peru, Bolivia, Argentina and Uruguay are among the nations that are reporting rising coronavirus infections, according to CNN.Brazil has long been among the worst-hit nations in the Americas, with the second-highest number of COVID-19 deaths in the world after the US. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, who is generally known as a longtime coronavirus sceptic, is now facing a government probe over his handling of the pandemic.As of this week, more than 317 million vaccine doses have been administered across 49 countries and territories in the region, according to Etienne.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/25-global-covid-19-deaths-occurred-in-americas-says-pan-american-health-organization-101619665748546.html

A president has to represent the essence of our country,” he added.The relations between the US and China are at an all-time low. The two countries are currently engaged in a bitter confrontation over various issues, including trade, Beijing's aggressive military moves in the disputed South China Sea and human rights in Hong Kong and Xinjiang region.China claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counter claims.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea. Beijing has built up and militarised many of the islands and reefs it controls in the region. Both areas are stated to be rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.In his remarks at the first virtual Summit of Quad leaders, President Biden last month said that a "free and open Indo-Pacific is essential" to all and the US was committed to working with its partners and allies in the region to achieve stability.Biden had described Quad – involving the US, India, Australia and Japan - as a new mechanism to enhance cooperation and raise mutual ambition as the member states address accelerating climate change.The Quad member states have been resolving to uphold a rules-based international order in the Indo-Pacific amid growing Chinese assertiveness in the region.India and three other Quad member nations - the US, Australia and Japan – early this month joined France in a three-day naval exercises in the eastern Indian Ocean in reflection of their growing maritime cooperation amid China's growing efforts to expand influence in the region.The Indian Ocean, considered the backyard of the Indian Navy, is critical for India's strategic interests. China has been making concerted efforts to increase its presence in the region, including Pakistan and Sri Lanka.The US has repeatedly stressed that China is a grave threat to its national security.In December, US Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe said China is the greatest global threat to democracy and freedom since the end of World War II.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-maintain-strong-military-presence-in-indo-pacific-to-prevent-conflict-biden-101619664350666.html
29-04-2021||World||Biden speech takeaways: Government is good, and so are jobs||President Joe Biden is using his first address before a joint session of Congress to make the case that his administration has made progress during the first 100 days he's been in office, confronting the public health and economic maelstrom caused by coronavirus pandemic.Biden is also using the prime-time address to make his pitch directly to Americans for his expansive — and expensive — vision to rebuild the nation’s roads, bridges, water pipes and other infrastructure, bolster public education an d extend other benefits for a wide swath of Americans.Here are some key takeaways from the president’s address:BIDEN'S FOUR-LETTER WORD: JOBSBiden uttered the word “jobs” a whopping 43 times, according to his prepared text.It’s perhaps no surprise for an administration that has made beating backing the pandemic and getting Americans back to work the central guideposts in the early going of the administration.Biden noted that the economy has gained some 1.3 million new jobs in the first few months of his administration — more than any in the first 100 days of any presidency. But he quickly pivoted to the need to pass his American Jobs Plan if the country is going to sustain momentum and get back to the historic low levels of unemployment prior to the pandemic.He also aimed to frame his push for the U.S. to meet its international obligations to slow the impact of climate change as, ultimately, a jobs plan.“For too long, we have failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the climate crisis,” Biden said. “Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think about climate change, I think jobs.”WHO TURNED THE TIDE?Biden said “America's house was on fire” when he took office, citing the devastating COVID-19 pandemic, its damaging economic impacts and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the Capitol.“Now — after just 100 days — I can report to the nation: America is on the move again,” Biden said, adding the nation is now “turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.”It’s a tried and true strategy by the president to take credit for the more hopeful moment, as the coronavirus vaccines have provided a path out of the pandemic.Republicans, meanwhile, made it clear they see things differently, with Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C., implicitly crediting President Donald Trump for the Biden’s good fortune.“This administration inherited a tide that had already turned,” he said in prepared remarks from the official GOP response to Biden’s address. “The coronavirus is on the run!”From polling, it’s clear Biden’s view is winning the day — at least thus far — with more Americans approving of his job performance than ever did of Trump, with strong marks even from Republicans for handling the pandemic.MAKING THE CASE FOR BIG GOVERNMENTBiden made the full-throated case for an American embrace of big government.The president ticked off details of some of his plan for $1.8 trillion in spending to expand preschool, create a national family and medical leave program, distribute childcare subsidies and more.The plan comes on top of his proposal for $2.3 trillion in spending to rebuild roads and bridges, expand broadband access and launch other infrastructure projects.Republicans have shown little interest in Biden’s spending plan. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has argued that Biden’s plans are a “Trojan horse” that will lead to middle-class tax hikes.But Biden and his aides say all of this new spending is wise investment in Americans — and doable in time of low interest rates. Much of it can be paid through raising taxes on the wealthy and would go a long way toward addressing the frailties of life for the middle class and working poor exposed by the pandemic, Biden argues.While achieving bipartisan backing in Washington for the proposals is a longshot, Biden seems to betting he can win support across the electorate.He even made a thinly-veiled bid to blue-collar and non-college-educated white men who voted for Trump in November, noting that 90% of the infrastructure jobs that will be created by his spending plans don’t require a college degree and 75% don’t require an associate’s degree.“The Americans Jobs Plan is a blue-collar blueprint to build America,” Biden said. “And it recognizes something I’ve always said: Wall Street didn’t build this country. The middle class built this country. And unions built the middle class.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-speech-takeaways-government-is-good-and-so-are-jobs-101619661019778.html
29-04-2021||World||Biden to the nation: 'America is rising anew"||President Joe Biden declared Wednesday night in his first address to a joint session of Congress that “America is rising anew" on the verge of overcoming the historic pandemic. Looking to the future, he urged a $1.8 trillion investment in children, families and education that would fundamentally transform roles the government plays in American life.Biden marked his first 100 days in office as the nation emerges from a menacing mix of crises, making his case before a pared-down gathering of mask-wearing legislators because of pandemic restrictions. The speech took place in a setting unlike any other presidential address in the familiar venue, the U.S. Capitol still surrounded by fencing after insurrectionists in January protesting his election stormed to the doors of the House chamber where he gave his address.The nationally televised ritual of a president standing before Congress for the first time was one of the most watched moments of Biden's presidency, raising the stakes for his ability to sell his plans to voters of both parties, even if Republican lawmakers prove resistant.“America is ready for takeoff. We are working again. Dreaming again. Discovering again. Leading the world again. We have shown each other and the world: There is no quit in America,” Biden said. “100 days ago, America’s house was on fire. We had to act.”This year’s scene at the front of the House chamber had a historic look: For the first time, a female vice president, Kamala Harris, was seated behind the chief executive. And she was next to another woman, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, both clad in pastel.The first ovation came as Biden greeted, “Madam Vice President.” He added “No president has ever said those words from this podium, and it’s about time.”The entire House setting was unlike that for any of Biden’s predecessors, with members of Congress spread out, a sole Supreme Court justice in attendance and many Republicans citing “scheduling conflicts” to stay away. There was no need for a “designated survivor,” with so many Cabinet members not there, and the chamber was so sparsely populated that individual claps could be heard echoing off the walls.Biden repeatedly hammered home how his plans would put Americans back to work, restoring the millions of jobs lost to the virus. He laid out a sweeping proposal for universal preschool, two years of free community college, $225 billion for child care and monthly payments of at least $250 to parents. His ideas target frailties that were uncovered by the pandemic, and he argues that that economic growth will best come from taxing the rich to help the middle class and the poor.“I can report to the nation: America is on the move again,” Biden said. “Turning peril into possibility. Crisis into opportunity. Setback into strength.”For Biden, whose moment has been nearly a half century in the making, his speech also provided an update on combating the Covid-19 crisis he was elected to tame, showcasing hundreds of millions of vaccinations and relief checks delivered to help offset the devastation wrought by a virus that has killed more than 573,000 people in the United States. He also championed his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, a staggering figure to be financed by higher taxes on corporations.Seizing an opportunity born of calamity, Biden has embraced major action over incremental change. But he will be forced to thread a needle between Republicans who cry government overreach and some Democrats who fear he won’t go big enough.The Democratic president's strategy is to sidestep polarization and appeal directly to voters. His prime-time speech underscored a trio of central campaign promises: to manage the deadly pandemic, to turn down the tension in Washington in the aftermath of the insurrection and to restore faith in government as an effective force for good.Biden also was addressing an issue rarely confronted by an American president, namely that in order to compete with autocracies like China, the nation needs “to prove that democracy still works” after his predecessor's baseless claims of election fraud and the ensuing attack on the U.S. Capitol.“In our first 100 days together, we have acted to restore the people’s faith in our democracy to deliver," he said in the excerpts, pointing to actions against the pandemic and resulting economic slide.Unimpressed, Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina was to say in the Republicans' designated response that Biden was claiming too much credit.“This administration inherited a tide that had already turned," Scott said in excerpts released in advance. “The coronavirus is on the run.”No American politician has more familiarity with the presidential address to Congress than Biden. He spent three decades in the audience as a senator and eight years as vice president seated behind President Barack Obama during the annual address.Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday, “President Biden ran as a moderate, but I’m hard pressed to think of anything at all that he’s done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation."Yet the desire for swift action is born from political necessity. Biden understands that the time for passing his agenda could be perilously short given that presidents' parties historically lose congressional seats in the midterm elections, less than two years away. The Democrats’ margins are already razor-thin.He spoke against a backdrop of the weakening but still lethal pandemic, staggering unemployment and a roiling debate about police violence against Blacks. Biden was also using his address to touch on the broader national reckoning over race in America, and to call on Congress to act on prescription drug pricing, gun control and modernizing the nation’s immigration system.In his first three months in office, Biden has signed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill — passed without a single GOP vote — and has shepherded direct payments of $1,400 per person to more than 160 million households. Hundreds of billions of dollars in aid will soon arrive for state and local governments, enough money that overall U.S. growth this year could eclipse 6% — a level not seen since 1984. Administration officials are betting that it will be enough to bring back all 8.4 million jobs lost to the pandemic by next year.New in his Wednesday speech was a “families” plan that could cement Biden's legacy with $1.8 trillion worth of spending over 10 years.A significant amount would ensure that eligible families receive at least $250 monthly per child through 2025, extending the enhanced tax credit that was part of Biden’s Covid-19 aid. There would be more than $400 billion for subsidized child care and free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds.Another combined $425 billion would go to permanently reduce health insurance premiums for people who receive coverage through the Affordable Care Act, as well a national paid family and medical leave program. Further spending would be directed toward Pell Grants, historically Black and tribal institutions and allow people to could attend community college tuition-free for two years.Funding all of this would be a series of tax increases on the wealthy that would raise about $1.5 trillion over a decade.Biden wants to boost IRS enforcement and require disclosures by financial institutions, specifically targeting the rich. The White House estimates that would bring in $700 billion over 10 years. He would raise the top tax rate on the most affluent families from 37% to 39.6%. People earning in excess of $1 million a year would see their rate on capital gains — the profits from a sale of a stock or home — nearly double from 20% to 39.6%, which would mean the wealthiest Americans could no longer pay at a lower rate than many families who identify as middle class.Republican lawmakers in Congress so far have balked at the price tags, complicating the chances of passage in a deeply divided Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-the-nation-america-is-rising-anew-101619659911771.html
29-04-2021||World||Kamala Harris, Nancy Pelosi to make history as first women to share stage in Joe Biden's address||Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi are set to make history Wednesday as the first women — one of them Black and Indian American — to share the stage in Congress during a presidential address.The two began the night with another historic moment: An elbow-bump hello, a pandemic spin on the traditional handshake. Both stood side by side behind the dais in the House chamber, chatting with each other and occasionally waving to lawmakers as the group waited for President Joe Biden to arrive.Biden is set to deliver his first prime-time speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night flanked by Pelosi and Harris, two California Democrats.“It's pretty exciting. And it's wonderful to make history. It's about time,” Pelosi said hours before the speech during an interview on MSNBC.Pelosi already knows what it feels like to sit on the rostrum in the House chamber and introduce a president for their speeches. She has sat there for several addresses by Presidents George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump.Women's advocates said seeing Harris and Pelosi seated together behind Biden will be a “beautiful moment.” But they noted that electing a woman to sit in the Oval Office remains to be achieved, along with the addition of an equal rights amendment to the Constitution.Biden helped usher the moment along by pledging to pick a woman for his running mate and selecting Harris, then a U.S. senator from California.“This is a great start and we have to continue to move forward to give women their equal due," said Christian Nunes, president of the National Organization for Women.Pelosi made history by becoming the first female House speaker during Republican Bush's presidency. He acknowledged the moment by noting during his address to Congress after Pelosi's election that he had the privilege of being the first president to open with the words “madam speaker.”Pelosi, 81, reclaimed the powerful leadership post during Republican Trump's presidency and sat behind him during his final two speeches to Congress, famously ripping up her copy of Trump's remarks in 2020 as cameras continued to roll after he was finished addressing lawmakers.Harris, 56, made history last year when she became the first woman and first Black and Indian American person elected vice president. In her role as president of the Senate, she joins Pelosi to preside over the joint session of Congress.Debbie Walsh, director of the Center for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, said Wednesday night will show men, women, boys and girls that women can attain and hold high-level positions and that they are as entitled to them as men are.Walsh also noted Biden's promise to put a woman on his ticket, and pointed as well to the diversity of his Cabinet. She said Biden was likely to begin the speech by turning around to face Pelosi and Harris and feeling proud — not just personally, “but I also think proud for the country and proud for his party and I think he will clearly see the historic implications of this and the role that he played in making that happen.”“For all of us who care about women’s public leadership, we still look forward to the day when the person standing at the podium, in front, is a woman,” Walsh added. “But for now this is a particularly gratifying moment.”Harris' office declined comment Wednesday on her historic role in the president's address, preferring to let the moment speak for itself.Apart from the speech Wednesday, Harris and Pelosi have notched another first in US and women's history. They are first and second, respectively, in the line of presidential succession.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-nancy-pelosi-to-make-history-as-first-women-to-share-stage-in-joe-biden-s-address-101619659112325.html

29-04-2021||World||EU report accuses Russia, China of sowing mistrust in Western Covid-19 vaccines||Russian and Chinese media are systematically seeking to sow mistrust in Western Covid-19 vaccines in their latest disinformation campaigns aimed at dividing the West, a European report said on Wednesday.From December to April, the two countries' state media outlets pushed fake news online in multiple languages sensationalising vaccine safety concerns, making unfounded links between jabs and deaths in Europe and promoting Russian and Chinese vaccines as superior, the EU study said.The Kremlin and Beijing deny all disinformation allegations by the EU, which produces regular reports and seeks to work with Google, Facebook, Twitter and Microsoft to limit the spread of fake news.Russian and Chinese vaccine diplomacy "follows a zero-sum game logic and is combined with disinformation and manipulation efforts to undermine trust in Western-made vaccines," said the EU study released by the bloc's disinformation unit, part of its EEAS foreign policy arm."Both Russia and China are using state-controlled media, networks of proxy media outlets and social media, including official diplomatic social media accounts, to achieve these goals," the report said, citing 100 Russian examples this year.The EU and NATO regularly accuse Russia of covert action, including disinformation, to try to destabilise the West by exploiting divisions in society."A disinformation report that has no factual basis is in itself an example of disinformation," the Chinese mission to the EU said in a statement dated Thursday in response to the report.Russia denies any such tactics and President Vladimir Putin has accused foreign foes of targeting Russia by spreading fake news about the coronavirus.Vaccine supply issues with AstraZeneca, as well as very rare side effects with AstraZeneca and the Johnson & Johnson vaccines have been seized upon, the report said."Both Chinese official channels and pro-Kremlin media have amplified content on alleged side-effects of the Western vaccines, misrepresenting and sensationalising international media reports and associating deaths to the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Norway, Spain and elsewhere," the report said.Last year, China sought to block an EU report alleging that Beijing was spreading disinformation about the coronavirus outbreak, according to a Reuters investigation.While the EU has not vaccinated its 450 million citizens as fast as Britain, which is no longer a member of the bloc, shots are now gaining speed, led by U.S. drugmaker Pfizer's shots and its German partner BioNTech.Russian media reported that "Brexit saved the UK from the 'vaccine chaos' engulfing the EU," the EU said. "Such narratives indicate an effort to sow division within the EU," it added.In the report, released online at https://euvsdisinfo.eu, the EU said Russia's official Sputnik V Twitter account sought to undermine public trust in the European Medicines Agency.Sputnik V responded that the disinformation campaign is against Russia and its vaccine, not the other way around."We will continue to fight disinformation campaign against Sputnik V in the interests of protecting lives around the world and avoiding vaccine monopoly that some vaccine producers may strive for," it said on Twitter.The Twitter account is managed by the Russian sovereign wealth fund, the Russian Direct Investment Fund, which is responsible for marketing and promoting the Sputnik V vaccine.China meanwhile promoted its vaccines as a "global public good" and "presenting them as more suitable for developing countries and also the Western Balkans," the report found. Western Balkan countries are seen as future EU members.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-report-accuses-russia-china-of-sowing-mistrust-in-western-covid-19-vaccines-101619657119178.html
29-04-2021||World||Australia to investigate 2 deaths for possible Covid-19 vaccine links||Australia's medicines regulator will investigate two deaths for possible links to the COVID-19 vaccine, raising fresh concerns as the country seeks to accelerate an immunisation programme that has widely missed its initial vaccination targets."All reports ... of death following vaccination are reviewed to assess the likelihood that the vaccine contributed to the event or medical condition that led to a fatal outcome," the Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) said on Thursday.Two men died in the country's most populous state of New South Wales (NSW) days after getting their coronavirus vaccine shots, Australian media reported.A 71-year-old man with several underlying health conditions died days after getting AstraZeneca's vaccine, Seven News reported. A 55-year-old man died eight days after getting his vaccine, a regional newspaper in NSW's northwest town of Tamworth said in a report, citing his family.The reporting of an adverse event after vaccination does not mean it was caused by the doses, TGA said in an emailed reply. It did not specify when the deaths happened, citing patient confidentiality reasons, or the type of shots they received.Australia's immunisation drive includes AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines but earlier this month authorities abandoned a goal to vaccinate its near 26 million population by the end of 2021 after finding possible links between the AstraZeneca vaccine and blood clots.Australia, which had banked on the AstraZeneca vaccine for the majority of its shots, recommended the doses should only be given to people above 50 years, throwing its vaccination programme into disarray.Two weeks ago, the country reported its first death from blood clots linked to the AstraZeneca vaccine after the medicines regulator said a 48-year-old woman's fatality was "likely" linked to the shot.Australia has largely avoided the high COVID-19 numbers seen in other developed countries, with just over 29,700 cases and 910 deaths since the pandemic began, but its vaccination rollout has hit several roadblocks.More than 2 million total vaccine doses have been administered as of Tuesday, far short of the 4 million pledged by the end of March.(Reporting by Renju Jose; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-to-investigate-2-deaths-for-possible-covid-19-vaccine-links-101619658537499.html

It felt like every day was a funeral and watching someone die every day," Brandon Mitchell -- who, with eleven other jurors, found the white police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of murdering Floyd -- told CNN.Eight days after the historic verdict, the 31-year-old Black man decided to come out of anonymity to encourage African-Americans to serve on juries.Like voting, it "can help spark change," he explained on Fox.The experience was "rough," said the Minneapolis high school basketball coach."It was extremely draining... We had to watch video at least five, six times a day" of George Floyd's ordeal, which ended beneath the police officer's knee, he said on gospel star Erica Campbell's podcast."A lot of times, I turn my head and try not to watch," he said, adding that some of the testimony -- including from Floyd's brother -- had been extremely upsetting.But once it came time for the jury to deliberate, he had no doubt. "I feel like the evidence was overwhelming," he told CNN.Still, it took four or five hours for the jury to agree.One juror was being "delicate" with the process and questioning the wording of the instructions, Mitchell said on ABC.But in the end the verdict was unanimous, he said, telling Campbell's podcast that all were "on the same page" with the decision.The twelve jurors found Chauvin guilty of the three charges against him, a decision greeted by joy in Minneapolis and which was welcomed by officials including President Joe Biden.The former police officer was immediately taken into custody. His sentencing, which was scheduled for June 16, will finally take place on June 25.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/watching-someone-die-every-day-george-floyd-juror-describes-harrowing-trial-101619657032242.html
29-04-2021||World||'Wrote things I didn't mean': Man linked to US Capitol riot convicted of threats to lawmakers||A social media agitator was convicted on federal charges of threatening to kill members of Congress in a verdict that rejected his claims it was harmless rhetoric.A jury found Brendan Hunt guilty at the close of a weeklong trial in federal court in Brooklyn on Wednesday.Hunt, 37, did not deny creating a series of menacing-sounding posts. But he testified that they were often put together while impaired from smoking pot with a bong and drinking beer, and never thought they would be taken seriously.“I wrote a lot of things I didn't mean,” Hunt said, calling himself “immature” and “very irresponsible.”He added: “I just feel terrible about how I expressed myself.”The verdict came in a case where prosecutors linked Hunt to the siege at the US Capitol on Jan. 6 to his brand of extremism. He wasn't there, but admitted posting videos and other materials expressing support for the violent mob.Hunt — a staunch supporter of former President Donald Trump, avid comic book collector and an analyst for the New York court system — had pleaded not guilty to charges alleging, in part, that he called for the “public execution” of Democratic US Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and US Sen. Charles Schumer.Prosecutors say it was part of a monthlong online campaign to urge violence against members of Congress that culminated with a January 8 video titled: “Kill your senators. Slaughter them all.”Defence attorneys had called the charges overblown. They argued Hunt's posts were protected free speech and that there was no proof that he was a legitimate threat.The trial featured testimony from a Capitol Police officer about the mayhem on January 6.A message was left with one of Hunt's lawyers on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/wrote-things-i-didn-t-mean-man-linked-to-us-capitol-riot-convicted-of-threats-to-lawmakers-101619656499918.html

29-04-2021||World||Facebook reports soaring quarterly ad revenue, stock jumps||Facebook's stock jumped Wednesday into record territory after the social media giant reported stronger-than-expected results for the first quarter thanks to soaring ad revenue.CEO Mark Zuckerberg said the extra money means the company will invest more in new areas of potential growth — including augmented and virtual reality, commerce, business messaging and content creators, such as people who make videos, write newsletters and host podcasts.“I believe that augmented and virtual reality are going to enable a deeper sense of presence and social connection than any existing platform," he said in a conference call with analysts. He added that this accounts for a “major part" of Facebook's research and development budget growth.Facebook is also expanding its e-commerce offerings and the use of its messaging services for businesses. As for the creator economy, the company is getting into audio, podcasts and independent publishing similar to Substack.The company said it earned $9.5 billion, or $3.30 per share, in the January-March period. That's up 94% from $4.9 billion, or $1.71 per share, a year earlier.Revenue grew 48% to $26.17 billion from $17.44 billion.Analysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $2.35 per share and revenue of $23.73 billion, according to a poll by FactSet.The average price of ads on Facebook grew 30% from a year earlier, while the number of ads increased by 12%.Facebook had 2.85 billion monthly users, on average, in March. That's up 10% from a year earlier. Its family of apps — Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp — had monthly users of 3.45 billion in March. That's the number of people who logged in to at least one of the apps during the month.In January, the company predicted uncertainty for 2021, saying its revenue in the latter half of the year could face significant pressure. Because revenue grew so quickly in the second half of 2020, Facebook could have trouble keeping up that pace. This uncertainty is now baked into the company's forecast, so it didn't come as a surprise to investors.Shares of the Menlo Park, California-based company rose 6% to $325.75 in after-hours trading. If the gains hold in Thursday's regular trading session, it will mark a record high for the stock, which is up 12% so far this year.On Monday, Apple rolled out a new privacy feature, dubbed “App Tracking Transparency,” as part of an update to the operating system powering the iPhone and iPad. It came after a seven-month delay during which the iPhone maker and Facebook attacked each other's business models and motives for decisions that affect billions of people around the world.Until the new feature, Facebook and other apps have been able to automatically conduct their surveillance on iPhones unless users took the time and trouble to go into their settings to prevent it — something not many people did.While Facebook spent months fighting the change, Zuckerberg recently suggested that the new privacy controls could actually help his company in the long run. His rationale: The inability to automatically track iPhone users may prod more companies to sell their products directly on Facebook and Instagram if they can’t collect enough personal information to effectively target ads within their own apps. This would help Facebook's bottom line, of course.Facebook said Wednesday it expects its second-quarter 2021 revenue growth to stay stable or “modestly accelerate” compared with the growth rate in the first quarter. The Apple update is already factored into this guidance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-reports-soaring-quarterly-ad-revenue-stock-jumps-101619654427246.html

The Japanese government maintains the islands are an inherent part of Japan's territory. China and Taiwan claim them."The report ... supplements and improves the basic geographic data of the Diaoyu Islands and its affiliated islands, and provides important support for the management of the Diaoyu Islands' resources and environmental protection," the ministry said.The report includes high-definition topographic maps of the land features as well as their surrounding seabed up to 30m (98 feet) below the surface.The ministry said the maps were based on historical survey data, as well as high-resolution satellite remote sensing surveys.The report also included some photos of the island and islets taken from survey vessels sailing close to the site.Recently, tensions between China and Japan have escalated amid increased activity by Beijing in the disputed East China Sea.Last month, Japan said China's coastguard had expanded its presence in the contested waters by entering twice a month and as frequently as twice a week near the Japanese-controlled Senkaku Islands.Early this month, Japan Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi urged China to halt its illegal intrusions into its territorial waters around the Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea.Meanwhile, China's defence ministry has urged Japan to stop making provocative moves and refrain from attacking China over the disputed islands after the defence ministries of both countries held a virtual meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-issues-landscape-survey-of-diaoyu-islands-amid-tensions-with-japan-101619654009133.html

The critic branded the movie “a flop” and wrote that the film’s noir-inspired visuals and use of shadows “gives one the creeps and wishes “they’d let a little sunshine in”.“It’s interesting. It’s different. In fact, it’s bizarre enough to become a museum piece. But its sacrifice of simplicity to eccentricity robs it of distinction and general entertainment value,” the review said.The piece, according to IndieWire, was uploaded on Rotten Tomatoes in line with the launch of the RT Archives, an archival hub introduced in November 2020, which houses and preserves editorial content related to classic and historic films.Not just Citizen Kane, classics such as A Night at the Opera, Double Indemnity, Home of the Brave, Victim, Mädchen in Uniform, The Dirty Dozen, and Gilda were issued new scores as part of the archival initiative.Citizen Kane, or rather its making, was the subject of David Fincher’s multiple Oscar-nominated and two-time winner Mank. The movie, which won the Academy Award for best cinematography and best production design, focused on on Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz.Widely considered to be one of the greatest movies ever made, Citizen Kane topped five consecutive British Film Institute Sight & Sound polls of critics, and ranked first in the American Film Institute’s 100 Years ... 100 Movies list in 1998 and in 2007. It won the Oscar for best writing and was nominated in nine categories, but the film famously lost the best picture award to John Ford’s family drama How Green Was My Valley.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aflop1941-review-brings-down-citizen-kane-s-perfect-score-101619653958206.html

The second phase saw a program to help the poor and vulnerable communities deeply affected by the pandemic.And the third phase was about economic stabilisation and it included a bank-supported project for medium small and micro enterprises (MSMEs), Malpass added.By the end of June 2020, the World Bank had approved USD2.75 billion in emergency lending to support India’s response to the Covid-19 crisis.The World Bank will provide USD250m in financing to help India build a social protection system that can respond to disasters and expand the ability of its safety nets to cater to diverse needs across states and vulnerable groups.It is also preparing a project that will help raise and accelerate MSME productivity by strengthening institutions and markets.Job creation is also a special focus under its infrastructure projects, the bank said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-bank-welcomes-us-french-covid-19-assistance-to-india-101619653756451.html
29-04-2021||World||UK urged to adopt furlough-style benefits after Covid crisis||The UK government should expand its social safety net to expand furlough-type payments to those who lose their jobs even after the pandemic, said a prominent research group campaigning for those on low pay.The Resolution Foundation said the government should introduce a form of earnings insurance, where unemployment support is paid at 80% of previous pay for three months. The measure would cost 3.25 billion pounds ($4.5 billion) a year if the jobless rate was similar to the level in 2009 and less than 1 billion pounds if it were near 2019 levels.That policy would echo the payments made to those temporarily laid off during the pandemic, a move credited with prevent a wave of joblessness in the past year. It would help address criticisms of the U.K. welfare system, which is one of the least generous in the developed world, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.It would “mean those losing their jobs are automatically protected in future economic downturns, rather than having to rely on governments redesigning unemployment support in every crisis,” the Resolution Foundation said Thursday.Households took on more debt and suffered a bigger hit to incomes during the pandemic than those in France and Germany partly because the British system is so rigid even though payments know as Universal Credit were increased during the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-urged-to-adopt-furlough-style-benefits-after-covid-crisis-101619652657603.html
29-04-2021||World||Stories coming out of India heart-wrenching, : US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy||Stories of the Covid-19 outbreak coming out of India are just absolutely "heart-wrenching" and "horrifying", America's Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said here.Indian-American Murthy, who has become the US Surgeon General for the second time, has lost seven of his family members, both in the United States and India."We talk to our family there on a daily basis. They are really struggling. The stories coming out of India are just absolutely heart-wrenching, and they're horrifying, where it's the kind of circumstance that we hope never comes to be in our country or in our communities," Murthy told the media on Wednesday."But what India is seeing now are more than 350,000 people a day getting infected. They're seeing the hospital systems in many cities on the brink, unable to meet the full demands, and they're running out of oxygen. They're in a very, very difficult place right now," he said.Responding to a question, Murthy said he was very pleased to see the United States step up and extend help to India in its hour of crisis."The US government will also be sending strike teams from the CDC and the USAID, Agency for International Development, to help India by working with their teams to strengthen laboratory capacity, to help with infection prevention and control," he added."This is what we have to do broadly across the world, because global pandemics require global cooperation and mutual support. And we know that when there's uncontrolled spread of the virus in any part of the world, that means that variants can arise, variants which may over time become resistant to the protection that we get from vaccines, which could mean a real problem for us here in the United States," Murthy said.He said that it is in America’s interests to make sure that countries around the world are protected, that they have vaccine, and the ability to limit the spread of infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stories-coming-out-of-india-heart-wrenching-us-surgeon-general-vivek-murthy-101619652704603.html

The mission had been included in the country’s 14th five-year plan.The hydropower project is expected to have an electricity generation capacity of 70 gigawatts, which is nearly three times that of the Three Gorges Dam on the Yangtze River.Rising in Tibet, the Yarlung Zangbo flows into Arunachal Pradesh as Siang, and then as Brahmaputra in Assam before flowing into Bangladesh.The project has run into a recently-formed and unstable mountain lake with some 600 million cubic metres of water, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post (SCMP) reported on Wednesday.The lake was formed in 2018 following a landslide caused by a melting glacier in the Sedongpu Basin in eastern TAR’s Milin County.“With the river spilling over the top at present, the dam could collapse at any time,” the SCMP report said. The lake in the Sedongpu Basin “sits just a few dozen kilometres upstream from the planned construction site of the super hydropower plant. With so much water hanging overhead, no construction workers can move in to clear the ground”.“The situation is very difficult. There is not any immediate solution yet,” said Xing Aiguo, a professor of civil engineering at Shanghai Jiao Tong University who was involved in one of the studies to look into possible solutions.The climate crisis makes the region prone to similar disasters.“The development and utilisation of natural resources and energy in the Yarlung Tsangpo River must fully consider the situation of avalanches and debris flows in the Sedongpu valley,” Liu Chuanzheng, a government researcher with the Consultative Centre of Geohazard Mitigation under the natural resources ministry in Beijing, wrote in an official report on the landslide published in the journal Geology in China, 2019.At present, scientists and experts are trying to find a solution to the problem.With Arunachal Pradesh being a lower riparian state and with the possibility of the project’s impact on water security in India’s northeastern states, New Delhi would be closely following the developments around the hydropower plant.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-dam-project-near-arunachal-pradesh-jeopardised-by-unstable-glacial-lake-101619638779508.html
29-04-2021||World||Italian PM Mario Draghi announces support for India’s Covid-19 response||Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi on Wednesday said his country is prepared to send an oxygen generation system with specialised personnel as part of the European Union’s (EU) efforts to bolster India’s response to a second wave of Coronavirus infections. The EU activated its Civil Protection Mechanism, which responds to emergencies in Europe and beyond, on Sunday in response to a request from India. The 27-member bloc is rushing a range of equipment and medical supplies to assist India. “I wish to express my solidarity to the people of India for the suffering caused by the new wave of the pandemic. Italy will not miss supporting at this time of distress,” Draghi said. “Through our Civil Protection Department, we are ready for sending an oxygen production system, made available by the Piedmont Region, for supplies to a traditional hospital or a field structure. A team of specialised personnel is also ready to start for ensuring operation of the equipment,” he said. Once Italy’s proposal is accepted by the EU’s Civil Protection Mechanism, the mission can start under the coordination of the EU and in cooperation with the foreign and defence ministries, Operational Interforce Command and Special Commissioner for Covid-19 Pandemic, an official statement said. Other EU members have announced a wide range of support measures this week. France will send eight large oxygen generating plants that can each meet the needs of a 250-bed hospital and five large containers of liquid oxygen, while Germany is providing a mobile oxygen production plant that will be made available to India for three months and 120 ventilators. Ireland has sent 700 oxygen concentrators while Belgium is sending 9,000 doses of Remdesivir. Romania is sending 80 oxygen concentrators and 75 oxygen cylinders, and Portugal is providing 5,503 vials of Remdesivir and 20,000 litres of oxygen per week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italian-pm-mario-draghi-announces-support-for-india-s-covid-19-response-101619635719335.html
