Posts on Chinese social media were blocked as well.According to a Reuters report, a livestream of the Oscars ceremony in Shanghai hosted by alumni of Zhao’s alma mater ran into China’s censors with the organiser saying access to his virtual private network (VPN) service was blocked for nearly two hours.“One of the exceedingly rare pieces of coverage, on private news site 163.com, actually used the occasion of her victory as an opportunity to not-so-subtly assert one of China’s most important - and contentious - geopolitical priorities,” Hollywood Report said in an article.Until Zhao’s 2013 remarks resurfaced recently, her work had been praised by Xinhua.“The evocative feature film, Nomadland, the latest effort by insightful Chinese female director, Chloe Zhao, is sweeping the awards circuit in the United States, putting her on the fast track for Oscar contention… Zhao has a unique vision which is serving her in good stead now,” Xinhua had written about her back in December.But state-backed opinion on her quickly changed after the interview was shared on Chinese social media.Much later on Monday, the tabloid Global Times published reports on Zhao’s victory, almost grudgingly praising her work.“No matter how much controversy Zhao previously caused in China, the nominations as well as the awards she won at the Golden Globes, Oscars and other international film festivals show her talent is great and should be praised,” Xiao Fuqiu, a film critic based in Shanghai, told the tabloid.Zhao’s acceptance speech at the Oscars showed her Chinese cultural roots when she quoted classic Chinese philosophical ethos, saying people are born with goodness and kindness within them.“The speech that Zhao gave shows the positive influence of Chinese culture and could help her win more support among Chinese moviegoers,” said Xiao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-censors-zhao-s-historic-oscar-win-over-controversial-interview-in-2013-101619458458704.html
26-04-2021||World||US Supreme Court to take up right to carry gun for self-defense||The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear an appeal to expand gun rights in the United States in a New York case over the right to carry a firearm in public for self-defense.The case marks the court’s first foray into gun rights since Justice Amy Coney Barrett came on board in October, making a 6-3 conservative majority.The justices said Monday they will review a lower-court ruling that upheld New York’s restrictive gun permit law. The court's decision to take on the case follows mass shootings in recent weeks in Indiana, Georgia, Colorado and California and comes amid congressional efforts to tighten gun laws. President Joe Biden also has announced several executive actions to combat what he called an “epidemic and an international embarrassment” of gun violence in America.The case is especially significant during the coronavirus pandemic, said Eric Tirschwell, the legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. “Gun violence has only worsened during the pandemic, and a ruling that opened the door to weakening our gun laws could make it even harder for cities and states to grapple with this public health crisis,” Tirschwell said.The court had turned down review of the issue in June, before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death.New York is among eight states that limit who has the right to carry a weapon in public. The others are: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island.In the rest of the country, gun owners have little trouble legally carrying their weapons when they go out.Paul Clement, representing challengers to New York’s permit law, said the court should use the case to settle the issue once and for all. “Thus, the nation is split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in the vast middle of the nation, and those same rights disregarded near the coasts,” Clement wrote on behalf of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association and two New York residents.Calling on the court to reject the appeal, the state said its law promotes public safety and crime reduction and neither bans people from carrying guns nor allows everyone to do so.Federal courts have largely upheld the permit limits. Last month an 11-judge panel of the federal appeals court in San Francisco rejected a challenge to Hawaii’s permit regulations in an opinion written by a conservative judge, Jay Bybee.“Our review of more than 700 years of English and American legal history reveals a strong theme: government has the power to regulate arms in the public square,” Bybee wrote in a 7-4 decision for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.The issue of carrying a gun for self-defense has been seen for several years as the next major step for gun rights at the Supreme Court, following decisions in 2008 and 2010 that established a nationwide right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.In June, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, complained that rather than take on the constitutional issue, “the Court simply looks the other way.”But Barrett has a more expansive view of gun rights than Ginsburg. She wrote a dissent in 2019, when she was a judge on the federal appeals court in Chicago, that argued that a conviction for a nonviolent felony — in this case, mail fraud — shouldn’t automatically disqualify someone from owning a gun.She said that her colleagues in the majority were treating the Second Amendment as a “second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-to-take-up-right-to-carry-gun-for-selfdefense-101619455775344.html
26-04-2021||World||Germany, Australia working to rush equipment, ventilators for India’s Covid-19 response||Germany and Australia are working to rush equipment such as an oxygen production plant and ventilators to India to bolster the country’s Covid-19 response in the wake of record-breaking Coronavirus infections over the past few days. The German Army will provide a large oxygen production plant and efforts are on to transport the broad-spectrum antiviral medication Remdesivir and other medicines from emergency stocks, German ambassador Walter Lindner said on Monday. The Australian government is considering donating non-invasive ventilators to India from stocks created at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, health minister Greg Hunt was quoted as saying by ABC News. The National Security Committee of Australia’s Cabinet will meet on Tuesday to finalise the assistance for India. In a separate development, Anthony Fauci, the Biden administration’s chief medical advisor, said the US could “actively consider” providing vaccines from its stock of 30 million AstraZeneca Covid-19 shots to India. On Monday, India set a global record for the rise in Coronavirus infections for the fifth consecutive day, with 352,991 cases reported since Sunday. The number of deaths too rose to an all-time high of 2,812, according to official data. Lindner said Germany understands the urgency of the situation and authorities are “working day and night” to airlift critical equipment and medical supplies to India. People across Europe have been moved by the scenes of loss emerging from India, he said. The German Army will ship a large oxygen production plant and other authorities are working to provide respirators, ventilators and huge quantities of Remdesivir and other medicines from German emergency stocks. In the private sector, Tata and Linde Group have partnered to provide more than 20 oxygen tanks to increase transport capacity between oxygen producers and Covid-19 hot spots, while more than 20 oxygen plants being purchased by the Indian side from a company in southern Germany will be airlifted by the Indian Air Force, Lindner said. Cooperation between UNICEF and Germany, which was started last year, will be intensified to provide cooling chains for vaccines, he added. Australian health minister Hunt said a specific request had been received from India for the physical supply of oxygen and authorities would check if any oxygen supplies could be donated. The government could donate non-invasive ventilators from Australia’s national stockpile that was created last year. “We are in a strong position on that front because we don’t need them [ventilators] at this point in time,” Hunt said. A cleared picture on the aid from Australia is expected after the meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday. Fauci told ABC News’ This Week programme that the US needs to do more to help India’s current Covid-19 response. “I don’t think you can walk away from that,” he said. He said discussions were underway “about really ramping up what we can do on the ground – oxygen supplies, drugs, tests, PPE, as well as taking the look into the intermediate and long run about how we can get vaccines to these individuals, both immediately now, as well as in the situation where you help them to be able to essentially make vaccines themselves”. Asked specifically if the Biden administration could help India with its stock of about 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which hasn’t been approved for use in the US, Fauci replied: “You know, I think that’s going to be something that is up for active consideration...I don’t want to be speaking for policy right now with you, but I mean, that’s something that certainly is going to be actively considered.” People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that critical equipment and supplies was coming into India as a mix of donations – such as the assistance being provided by Germany, Australia and the US – and commercial purchases, such as the oxygen tanks airlifted Singapore and United Arab Emirates. The people said China’s offer to provide support hadn’t been taken up so far, and pointed out that tweets and statements by Chinese officials about equipment being sent to India – such as a tweet from the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka about 800 oxygen concentrators airlifted from Hong Kong to New Delhi on Sunday – involved commercial purchases made by Indian firms. Chinese embassy spokesperson Wang Xiaojian said in a statement that China “will encourage and guide Chinese companies to actively cooperate with India to facilitate acquiring medical supplies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-australia-working-to-rush-equipment-ventilators-for-india-s-covid-19-response-101619456238588.html
26-04-2021||World||Myanmar junta postpones court proceedings against Aung San Suu Kyi||Myanmar's junta again postponed court proceedings against deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday, her lawyers said as they fight for permission to visit her 12 weeks after she was detained.The country has been in turmoil since the military ousted the Nobel laureate in a February 1 coup, shunting the country back into junta rule after a brief experiment with democracy.Large swathes of the population have taken to the streets in protest, with security forces unleashing a brutal campaign to quell the massive uprising.Meanwhile Suu Kyi has been under house arrest, with the junta charging her under six cases -- including for sedition and having unlicensed walkie-talkies.But movement on her case was once again delayed until May 10, her lawyer Min Min Soe said Monday after a hearing.Twelve weeks since Suu Kyi was detained, Min Min Soe said they still have not received permission to meet their client face-to-face -- one of many hurdles the team has faced."When the judge asked (police) which stage they have reached, they replied they couldn't tell specifically," she told AFP, adding that Suu Kyi was frustrated by the slow pace."I think she is not getting access to watch news and TV. I do not think she knows the current situation happening in the country," she said.Besides not being able to meet with Suu Kyi, junta-imposed mobile data shutdowns have also prevented video-conferencing in previous hearings.The most serious charge Suu Kyi faces falls under Myanmar's official secrets law, with a hearing due in Yangon on May 6.'Eradicate the fascist army'Nationwide protests continued Monday, with demonstrators in the south holding signs that said "Free our leaders" and waving red flags emblazoned with a golden peacock -- the symbol of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party.In commercial hub Yangon, dozens of protesters took part in a flash mob which lasted only 10 minutes -- a lightning-quick show of resistance to avoid confrontation with security forces.Waving a three-finger salute, they chanted "Eradicate the fascist army!"The junta has justified its power grab by claiming it is protecting democracy, alleging electoral fraud in November elections which the NLD won in a landslide.Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing had travelled to Jakarta over the weekend for a top-level meeting with the 10-country bloc of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- his first overseas trip since his power grab.The meeting produced a "consensus statement" that called for the cessation of violence, but stopped short of demanding a release of political prisoners.It drew condemnation from much of Myanmar's civil society -- already angered by ASEAN's invitation to the general."The statement does not include what the civilians are asking for -- respect for their basic human rights, democracy and peace," said the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a local monitoring group that has tracked post-coup Myanmar's escalating death toll."People in Burma are not asking for humanitarian aid, but for the international community to stand for the truth," it said, referring to Myanmar by its former name.According to AAPP's latest figures, security forces have killed more than 750 people.The junta has given a much lower death toll and blames the violence on "rioters".State-run television news on Monday night called AAPP an "illegal association", and action will be taken against it.It also reported that one member of the security forces was killed in Chin state, when their convoy was attacked by people with homemade guns.'Solve its own problems'Also present in Indonesia over the weekend was the UN special envoy to Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener -- who has so far been denied a visit to the country.According to UN sources, Burgener spoke with senior General Min Aung Hlaing briefly on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting.A spokesperson from Indonesian Foreign Ministry confirmed that she was "in communication" but no further detail was provided.The special envoy had previously implored the UN Special Council to take action against the generals, warning that "a bloodbath is imminent" if the international community continues to stall.So far, western powers like the US, EU and Britain have imposed sanctions targeting military top brass and army-affiliated businesses.But Myanmar's allies Russia and China have been seen to be blocking efforts for a wider response, such as imposing an arms embargo, according to the EU foreign policy chief.On Monday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia is following Myanmar's situation "with great attention"."However, Russia is bound by long-standing relations with Burma, and we are keen on it," he said, adding that Myanmar must "solve its own problems".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-postpones-court-proceedings-against-aung-san-suu-kyi-101619455114480.html

They are currently isolating at home.Health Minister Roberto Speranza on Sunday announced a new ban on anyone entering Italy who has been in India in the past 14 days.India is battling a catastrophic, record-breaking outbreak that has overwhelmed hospitals and set crematoriums working at full capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-covid-variant-detected-in-northern-italy-101619453846951.html
26-04-2021||World||New Covid-19 cases in United States declining; 7 day average goes below 60,000||The rate of new Covid cases is declining in the United States, with the most recent seven-day averages dipping below the 60,000 mark for the first time in over a month as experts hailed the impact of vaccines.Data from the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention showed that as of April 24, the rolling average was 57,123 cases, and a month-long mini bump was now over.It comes as the number of people vaccinated continued to rise, though the rate is beginning to taper off as domestic demand slows.Almost 140 million people have now received one dose, or 42 percent of the whole population.Writing on Twitter, Ashish Jha, dean of Brown University School of Public Health, said he believed this time the decline would be permanent, "Because in mid-March, when last mini-surge began, 21% of the population had been vaccinated. Today, we're twice that."He said that 42 percent with one shot wasn't "enough," but added: "42% close to number at which we should see steady declines in infections. In Israel, once 45% of population was fully vaccinated, case numbers started to plummet."Experts are however worried by the vaccination rate, which peaked earlier this month at an average of more than 3 million doses per day and is now down to 2.6 million per day.Many people who wished to get vaccinated have received jabs, though some access issues persist, particularly among communities of color.On the other hand, vaccine skepticism remains high among some demographics, including political conservatives.A government survey last month found the 10 states with the largest share of people who said they definitely or probably won't get vaccinated are all conservative-leaning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-cases-in-united-states-declining-7-day-average-goes-below-60000-101619451424363.html
26-04-2021||World||Gap between Sputnik-V doses can be increased from 3 weeks to 3 months, say makers||The director of Russia’s Gamaleya Research Centre, which developed the Sputnik V vaccine against coronavirus disease (Covid-19), said it is possible to increase the minimum interval between the first and second doses from the previously approved 21 days to three months. Alexander Gintsburg also highlighted that the interval will not affect the immune response spurred by the vaccine and in some cases may even prolong or enhance the effect of the vaccine.“Regarding the Sputnik V vaccine designed by our Gamaleya Research Centre, we believe it is possible to increase the minimum interval between the first and second vaccine shots from the earlier approved 21 days up to three months. Extending the interval will not affect the vaccine-induced immune response, and, in some cases, will enhance and prolong it,” Ginstburg was quoted as saying in a statement released on Sputnik V’s official website. Gintsburg, however, left the decision to increase the interval of the doses on the respective national regulators.“We also believe that, given the exceptionally high demand for the vaccine among the population, this decision would significantly expedite immunization. We believe that it is up to each national regulator to decide whether to retain the 21-day interval between shots or to extend it to up to 3 months,” Gintsburg added.The research centre said that the observation was aided by the mass vaccination camps which were continuously testing data on vaccination in Russia as well as other countries. It also cited reports from the Argentine health ministry which had also witnessed results after prolonging the interval between the doses. The South American nation heavily relied on the Sputnik V vaccine as it faced difficulties in getting other vaccines, news agency Reuters reported last week.Sputnik V was also granted emergency use approval by an expert panel earlier this month. The vaccine will be used along with Covaxin and Covishield to battle the surging Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gap-between-sputnik-v-doses-can-be-increased-say-makers-101619445514281.html

"Nazanin Zaghari was sentenced to one year in prison and a one year ban from leaving the country on charges of propaganda against the Islamic Republic," Kermani told the website.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be wrong to send her back to prison."I don't think it's right at all that Nazanin should be sentenced to any more time in jail," Johnson told reporters during a campaign appearance. He added that Britain was working with the United States on the issue of dual-nationals jailed in Iran.Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation charity, was arrested at a Tehran airport in April 2016 and later convicted of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment.She was released from house arrest last month at the end of a five-year sentence, but immediately ordered back into court to face the new propaganda charges.Iran’s judiciary was not immediately available to comment about Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence. Kermani said he would appeal the new sentence within 21 days under Iranian law.Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family and the foundation, a charity that operates independently of media firm Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters, deny the charges. She spent four years in jail before being released into house arrest in March 2020 during the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-sentences-british-iranian-aid-worker-to-one-year-jail-101619443017713.html
26-04-2021||World||European Union initiates legal action against Covid vaccine maker Astra-Zeneca||The European Union's executive branch said Monday that it has launched legal action against coronavirus vaccine-maker AstraZeneca for failing to respect the terms of its contract with the 27-nation bloc.The AstraZeneca vaccine has been central to Europe’s immunization campaign, and a linchpin in the global strategy to get vaccines to poorer countries. But the slow pace of deliveries has frustrated the Europeans and has been blamed in part for holding up the EU's vaccine rollout.European Commission spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker said that Brussels launched the legal action against AstraZeneca last Friday “on the basis of breaches of the advance purchase agreement.”He said the reason for the legal action was that “some terms of the contract have not been respected” and that “the company has not been in a position to come up with a reliable strategy to ensure a timely delivery of doses.”AstraZeneca’s contract with the EU foresaw an initial 300 million doses for distribution among member countries, with an option for a further 100 million.But only 30 million doses were delivered in the first quarter of 2021, and the company says it can provide 70 million in the second quarter, rather than the 180 million it had promised.AstraZeneca has previously said that its contract with the EU contained vaccine delivery targets, not firm commitments, and that the company was unable to meet them because of early problems with rapidly expanding its production capacity.Last month, the Commission launched a dispute resolution mechanism aimed at amicably addressing its differences with the company. Brussels said that its focus is to ensure timely deliveries of vaccines.It since said that its option for extra AstraZeneca doses will not be taken up.Last week, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that a new vaccine contract is set to be concluded with BioNTech-Pfizer for 1.8 billion doses for the 2021-23 period. She said the deal will ensure doses for booster shots, vaccines adapted to new variants, and, potentially, vaccines for children and teenagers.Von der Leyen said that the EU, home to around 450 million people, has “already passed 123 million vaccinations" and is on track to have vaccinated 70% of all adults by July. Previously the target had been September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-initiates-legal-action-against-covid-vaccine-maker-astrazeneca-101619442550251.html
26-04-2021||World||Top Chinese cargo airline suspends flights to India||The largest cargo flight operator from China to India, the Chinese state-owned Sichuan Airlines has suspended its services to India for 15 days because of the surge in Covid-19 cases.It is likely to disrupt frantic efforts by Indian private companies to import medical supplies including oxygen concentrators to fight the pandemic from China.The suspension comes despite Beijing’s repeated offers of “support and assistance” to India to fight the pandemic.The airlines operated 10 flights on six routes to four India cities comprising Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore.In a letter to the sales agents on Monday, the Sichuan Chuanhang Logistics Co. Ltd, part of the Sichuan Airlines said the airline has suspended its cargo flights on all six routes - Xi’an-Delhi, Xi’an-Mumbai, Chengdu-Chennai, Chongqing-Chennai, Chengdu-Bangalore, and Chongqing-Delhi - for 15 days,The airlines said “…in the face of sudden changes in the epidemic situation (in India), in order to reduce the number of imported cases, it is decided” to suspend the flights.The airlines added the India route has “always been the core strategic route for Sichuan Airlines” but added that the Indian Covid-19 outbreak had not only caused “…a record number of deaths but also caused a surge in imported cases in China, many places in the world have grounded flights to India.”The Chinese foreign ministry, however, did not offer any comment on the suspension of cargo flights from the Chinese mainland to India.“With regard to the operation of airlines, I will refer you to the relevant airlines for more information,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said when asked to comment on the development.The ministry also did not confirm or deny a tweet by the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka, which said 800 oxygen concentrators have been airlifted from Hong Kong to Delhi with another 10,000 to be dispatched in the coming week.“800 Oxygen Concentrators have been airlifted today from #HongKong to #Delhi; 10,000 more in a week. #China is keeping in touch with #India for urgent needs. Stay Strong,” the tweet published by the Chinese embassy in Colombo early on Monday said.When asked to comment on the tweet, Wang only said: “As I said, China is willing to provide necessary support and help to India in its fight against the virus. If India raises specific demands, we will provide help and support to the best of our capability.”“We have stated that we are ready to help India fight the virus in the first opportunity available. (The) two sides are in communication regarding this,” Wang said at the ministry briefing.“China has been following closely the epidemic situation in India. We show our sincerest sympathies to the worsening situation in India,” Wang said.“About India’s readiness to buy medical supplies from China, I understand this is a commercial activity. If India raises specific demands, China is ready to provide help and support to the best of capability,” he added.To a question on three other Quad members (the US, Australia, and Japan) not helping the fourth member, India, during this crisis, Wang said countries should work together to fight the virus.“With regard to some mechanisms that you mentioned, we hope we can also follow this principle and work towards building a community with a shared future and to provide support and help to other countries in their fight (the) virus and show their true responsibilities and obligations.”Wang reiterated that the Covid-19 outbreak is a common challenge for mankind.“On this issue, countries should work together. We have to fight the virus together. We also made it clear that China stands ready to provide support and help to India in fighting coronavirus. We hope that all countries should unite as one, to defeat the virus, which is a common enemy for mankind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-chinese-cargo-airline-suspends-flights-to-india-101619436915377.html
26-04-2021||World||Covid-19 infections surge in Nepal, fuelled by mutant strains from India||Authorities in Nepal were grappling to contain the rapid rise of Covid-19 cases with experts fearing that thousands of people in the Himalayan state have caught the more infectious mutant strains emerging out of India.Nepal, which shares a long porous border with India, reported 3,032 new infections on Sunday, the highest daily surge recorded this year. It took the total caseload since the pandemic first struck Nepal to 300,119, and there have so far been 3,164 deaths, according to government data."We have detected the UK variant and the double mutant variant detected in India," Krishna Prasad Paudel, the director of Nepal's Epidemiology and Disease Control Department Paudel told Reuters, adding that experts were checking for other variants too. Nepal launched its vaccination campaign in January and gave shots to 1.9 million people, all provided by India and China. But health experts feared that continuation of the vaccination drive was uncertain after officials had failed to procure more vaccine shots from India or any other source.Over 90 developing nations, including Nepal, rely on India, home to the Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine maker, for the doses to protect their own populations, but India has now prioritised its own needs as a second wave of the epidemic there has run out of control."The virus is mutating very fast...what started in India has now entered Nepal too," said Rabindra Pandey, a public health expert, adding that if the trend continued for a week then new patients will be unable to find any beds as hospitals were already stretched.Wedged between China and India, Nepal shares a 1,751-kilometre (1,094 miles) border with its southern neighbour India. The border was closed for some time duping a lockdown last year, when the first wave of the epidemic struck, but it has since been reopened.Nepal's former king Gyanendra and his wife, who tested positive for the virus after returning from India where they attended a religious festival, were undergoing treatment at a private facility in Kathmandu."The situation is really frightening," said Prakash Thapa, a doctor at Bheri hospital in Nepalgunj, a city in the southwest plains bordering India.He said the hospital was inundated with coronavirus patients requiring intensive care and ventilators."This time even children and young people are brought in critical condition and patients are even sleeping on the floor and corridors," he said.Nepal's ruling Communist party has been embroiled in a power struggle for months, and Prime Minister K.P.

26-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Britain to now vaccinate people above the age of 44 and above||Everyone aged 44 and above in Britain will now be able to book their Covid-19 jab starting on Monday as the UK’s National Health Service (NHS) vaccine programme expands further to more younger age groups.Around half a million 44-year-olds will receive a text message inviting them to get their jab through the National Booking Service, with England’s top doctor urging people to come forward for their jab when they are invited.The move to the next age cohort in the vaccination programme comes alongside the latest NHS figures showing that more than two-thirds of people aged 45 to 49 have now been vaccinated as the programme moves through age and risk-based cohorts."Now that 95 per cent of all over 50s have had their first jab, and more than two-thirds of those aged 45-49, we are opening up vaccinations to 44-year olds,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.'The biggest vaccination programme in NHS history has delivered 45.5 million doses so far across the UK, and we are on track to offer a jab to all adults by the end of July. I encourage everyone who is 44 to book an appointment to get the jab – it will protect you and your loved ones, and help put this pandemic behind us,” he said.The NHS said the decision to move to the next group of people aged between 40 and 43 will be set out in the coming days with the NHS vaccinating in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advice and as supply allows."Thanks to NHS staff, people aged 45-49 have been hot on the heels of millions of people most at risk who were quick to take up the offer of a vaccine with more than two thirds getting their lifesaving jab, marking another medically important milestone in the biggest vaccination campaign in NHS history,” said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England Chief Executive.“When the time comes, and you get that text, book an appointment to get your vaccine – it is the best protection you and your loved ones will receive from this deadly virus,” he said.Since the UK’s vaccination rollout began in December 2020, more than 28 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, 63.8 per cent of the total population of adults aged over 18.NHS staff have also carried out more than 10 million second doses and has been reminding people to attend their second dose to ensure they receive maximum protection.NHS Medical Director, Professor Stephen Powis, said: “It is testament to the hard work of NHS staff that we are now able to vaccinate people in the next age group.“If you are aged 44, when you are invited to do so, please do book your jab as appointments become available – it is simple, effective and provides vital protection against the coronavirus.”The NHS currently vaccinates against Covid-19 using three approved vaccines, Pfizer/BionTech, Moderna, and Oxford/AstraZeneca. People who cannot go online can call the service on 119 instead to book their jab.Text invitations appear as an alert from “NHSvaccine”, including a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment.Vaccinations are now being administered at more than 1,600 sites across the country, including churches, mosques, temples, museums and rugby grounds, to ensure the vast majority of people live within 10 miles of at least one vaccination service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-britain-to-now-vaccinate-people-above-the-age-of-44-and-above-101619427291653.html

Reuters is unable to confirm the death toll, as the junta has significantly curbed media freedoms, and many journalists have been detained.A civil disobedience campaign of strikes has crippled the economy and raised the prospect of hunger, international aid agencies have warned.Pro-democracy activists have called for an intensification of their effort from Monday by refusing to pay electricity bills and agricultural loans, and for children to stop going to school."All of us, people in townships, wards and then regions and states must work together to make a successful boycott against the military junta," activist Khant Wai Phyo said in a speech at a protest in the central town of Monywa on Sunday."We don't participate in their systems, we don't cooperate with them.”A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment.Activists criticised a five-point agreement that came out of the ASEAN meeting, to end violence, start a dialogue among all parties, accept aid, and appoint a special ASEAN envoy who would be allowed to visit Myanmar.The agreement did not mention political prisoners although the statement said the meeting heard calls for their release.Suu Kyi, 75, has been charged with various offences including violating a colonial-era official secrets act that could see her jailed for 14 years.She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, and has led Myanmar’s struggle against military rule for decades. The won a second term in a November, and even though the election commission said the vote was fair the military, whose candidates suffered humiliating defeats, alleged it was a fraudulent election.Suu Kyi is due to appear via video link for another hearing in her case on Monday.She has only been allowed to talk with her lawyers via video link in the presence of security officials and it is not known if she is even aware of the turmoil that has engulfed the country since the military seized power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-activists-call-for-new-non-cooperation-campaign-101619415021668.html

"It was a circuit-breaker we needed to limit community spread and keep our community healthy."Two million people in Perth and Peel's near 150,000 residents were ordered to stay home until 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, except for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping or exercise.People can leave their homes when the lockdown ends but will have to wear masks at all times. Home gatherings will be limited to 20 guests while restaurants and supermarkets will need to follow strict social-distancing rules.These interim restrictions will remain until Friday night, McGowan said, when they would be reviewed.Snap lockdowns, speedy tracking systems and border closures have helped Australia keep its Covid-19 numbers relatively low, with just over 29,600 cases and 910 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-perth-to-exit-covid-19-lockdown-101619415367726.html
26-04-2021||World||UK denies report that PM Johnson said 'let the bodies pile high'||A newspaper report that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that he would rather bodies piled "high in their thousands" than order a third lockdown is not true, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday.Johnson is facing a stream of allegations in British newspapers about everything from his muddled initial handling of the Covid-19 crisis to questions over who financed the redecoration of his Downing Street flat.The Daily Mail newspaper said Johnson said at an October meeting at Downing Street: "No more ****ing lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands.""It's not true - it's been categorically denied by practically everyone," Wallace told Sky when asked about the reported remark, adding that Johnson was focused on the Covid response."We're getting into the sort of comedy chapter now of these gossip stories - you know unnamed sources by unnamed advisers talking about unnamed events. You know - look - none of this is serious," Wallace said.The Daily Mail did not immediately respond to a request for comment.After Downing Street named Johnson's former chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, as the source of leaks about the prime minister, Cummings hit back on Friday, denying he was the source and casting Johnson as incompetent and lacking in integrity.Cummings, architect of the Brexit campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, left Johnson's staff suddenly late last year having previously been his most influential adviser over Brexit and a 2019 election campaign.Cummings said Johnson's plans to have donors secretly pay for the renovation of his Downing Street plan were "unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations".Asked about the refurbishment plans in March, Johnson's spokeswoman said all donations, gifts and benefits were properly declared and no party funds were being used to pay for the upgrades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-denies-report-that-pm-johnson-said-let-the-bodies-pile-high-101619420522948.html
26-04-2021||World||Determined to help India in Covid fight: US President Joe Biden||US President Joe Biden on Sunday said the assistance offered by his country to India to combat a devastating surge in Covid-19 cases is in exchange for the help provided by India last year when America was struggling to tackle the outbreak.He also said Washington was “determined” to help New Delhi, pushing back on narrative that America was late to come to India’s rescue.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” Biden wrote in a tweet on Sunday, retweeting a post from his National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who announced the assistance after a phone call with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval.People familiar with discussions leading up to the announcement on both sides echoed the framing of the assistance as a gesture between partners, with the US returning the favour.Biden did not specify in the tweet, but he meant the assistance announced by his administration on Sunday was similar in nature - and reciprocal - to the lifting of an export ban by India to release a consignment of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April last year on a request from then president Donald Trump.HCQ, an antimalarial drug, was being used as a prophylactic in some cases against the coronavirus. Trump, however, had touted it as a “game changer” in his bid to control the outbreak, which he saw as a drag on his re-election chances.Trump pushed Modi to release a consignment of HCQ last April despite the export ban, with a threat of retaliation. India made an exception for Trump and released the consignment. He himself later took a course of the drug after a possible exposure to the virus.The exception made by Modi then was similar to the one made by Biden now to release raw materials for vaccines being made in India, in contravention of restrictions in force since February, when Biden had invoked the Defense Production Act to make it mandatory for American suppliers of such raw materials to prioritise orders placed by American buyers over those by outsiders.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India in its time of need,” US national security council spokesperson Emily Horne said, announcing US support and supplies for India.People familiar with these talks and developments said the first shipments of US supplies announced on Sunday could arrive in India as early as this week, including the most urgent of them all: oxygen, which has been in short supply in hospitals across India.The United States and India are looking are four options on how best to address the immediate crisis. They are looking at oxygen concentrators, fan-like devices that enhance oxygen in an enclosed room; oxygen generator plants, small units that supply oxygen to hospitals; oxygen cylinders, which are in short supply in India; and containers to ship oxygen, which are like cryogenic containers supplied to India by Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-is-returning-the-favour-with-covid-19-aid-package-for-india-says-biden-101619418010611.html

Two of the races -- one in the northern island of Hokkaido and another in Hiroshima -- were to replace ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers who stepped down over graft charges. The LDP didn’t field a candidate in the Hokkaido election.The opposition also won a third election in the central prefecture of Nagano, held after the death of a lawmaker from Covid-19. Despite the losses, the LDP-led coalition kept its majority in both houses of parliament.While Suga’s LDP is unlikely to be toppled in the near future, the losses could weaken support for the prime minister, who has come under fire since he took office last year over scandals and his handling of the pandemic. He faces a party leadership poll in September and must also call a general election by October.Japan Shuts Tokyo Bars, Bans Sports Fans in New Virus EmergencyNone of the opposition parties boasts support of more than single figures.

The International Monetary Fund has projected a 5.3% expansion.But since those forecasts were made there have been signs of an acceleration in the pace of recovery with the country now having given a first coronavirus vaccine to more than half of its total population."The UK economy is rebounding sharply from the Covid crisis," Goldman Sachs said."The April flash PMI was much stronger than expected in the UK, with the services PMI moving strongly further into expansionary territory," it said.The bank also noted a much-stronger-than-expected 5.4% monthly jump in retail sales in March.The note did not provide a comparison forecast for U.S. economic growth this year. In February, Goldman said it expected U.S. GDP would grow by 6.8% in 2021 as President Joe Biden pushed ahead with a huge fiscal stimulus programme.Britain's economy shrank by nearly 10% last year as it was hit by longer coronavirus lockdowns than many of its peers. By comparison, the U.S. economy shrank by an estimated 3.5%, according to the IMF.On Saturday, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent was quoted as saying he expected "very rapid growth at least over the next couple of quarters" as the country lifts its coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-economy-set-to-grow-faster-than-the-us-this-year-goldman-sachs-101619403662379.html

The government has said the real number of cases is likely significantly higher.Mexico's state-run vaccine manufacturer, Birmex, is working with Russia on a plan to bottle Sputnik V in Mexico, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said last week, just as Argentina produced test batches of the two-shot vaccine."Birmex is working jointly with Russian institutions so that Mexico can bottle the vaccine," Ebrard told Russian media outlets on Friday. "There is already significant progress."Health ministry official Ruy Lopez told reporters on Sunday that the government's aim is to ramp up distribution of Sputnik V not only in Mexico, but also other parts of Latin America.Russia has shipped 1.1 million Sputnik V doses to Mexico to date, far fewer doses than those originally slated to have arrived by now.Mexico's Health Ministry said in late February it expected to receive 7.4 million doses of Sputnik V by April and an additional 16.6 million shots in May. Mexico has signed an agreement to acquire a total of 24 million doses.Mexico is increasingly aiming to bottle vaccines domestically following delays from providers, and has already bottled 2.6 million shots of China's CanSino vaccine.It also plans to bottle AstraZeneca shots using vaccine material produced in Argentina. But the first doses are not expected until May due to delays at the Mexican production laboratory.Ebrard's visit to Moscow will last through Wednesday and include a meeting with his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.The minister will also visit China, India and the United States as part of his government's efforts to make sure that its supply agreements for vaccines against Covid-19 are honored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-minister-visits-russia-vying-to-bring-vaccine-production-home-101619400714118.html

He was taken to Harlem Hospital in critical but stable condition, police said.Surveillance video released by the police appears to show the attacker stomping on the victim's head. The police department's hate crimes task force is investigating the attack, the latest in a troubling rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in New York and around the country.Police have not specified a motive in the attack.Mayor Bill de Blasio called it “outrageous” on Twitter. “Make no mistake, we will find the perpetrator and they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” de Blasio said Saturday.UPDATE: The @NYPDHateCrimes task force has a solid lead on the vile acts of anti-Semitism in the Bronx and we will take swift action against the perpetrators.If you have any more information on this case, contact the NYPD right away. https://t.co/CC15V2KMSaThe attack recalled last month's assault near Times Square in which a woman who immigrated from the Philippines was knocked to the ground and stomped on by an attacker who shouted anti-Asian slurs. A parolee convicted of killing his mother nearly two decades ago was arrested in that attack.The U.S. Senate passed legslation last week aimed at fighting the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders.

The United States will also send therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits and ventilators.Also Read | Covid-19: India going through 'very terrible' situation, says Dr Anthony FauciWashington was under mounting pressure to help India, the world's largest democracy, after Britain, France and Germany pledged aid over the weekend.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi urged all citizens to be vaccinated and exercise caution, as the country set a global record for new COVID-19 infections in a single day. (Graphic on global case and deaths) https://tmsnrt.rs/34pvUyiThe United States was also pursuing options to provide India with oxygen generation and related supplies, Horne said.U.S. Representative Ro Khanna, Democratic vice-chair of the Congressional India Caucus, welcomed the announcement but urged Biden to go further and give India the United States' unused COVID-19 vaccines doses from AstraZeneca Plc."Let's use the U.S. military and get as much oxygen and AstraZeneca doses to India as fast as we can," he said.The top U.S. infectious disease official, Dr. Anthony Fauci, told ABC News on Sunday such a move was "something that certainly is going to be actively considered."AstraZeneca's vaccine is not yet approved in the United States, which has stockpiled millions of doses, and top U.S. health officials have said they have enough doses of approved versions by three other drugmakers to inoculate all Americans in coming weeks. The nation's top business lobbying group has also pushed the administration to send AstraZeneca's vials to countries grappling with rising cases.The White House had no comment on the possibility of providing AstraZeneca doses to India.Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said the engagement of top Biden administration officials reflected a welcome "seriousness of purpose" in addressing the crisis in India, but details were lacking.He said the messaging around any loan of AstraZeneca doses should be carefully prepared to avoid the impression that Washington would be offloading "something that it doesn't want."Senior U.S. officials have expressed concern that new variants of the virus emerging in India could undermine progress made in the United States in fighting the pandemic.The new wave of infections also threatens the economic recovery of India, the sixth-largest economy in the world.Horne said the United States would send a team of experts to work with India from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and U.S. Agency for International Development.In addition to the immediate aid, the U.S. Development Finance Corporation will fund a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for Indian vaccine maker Biological E Ltd, or BioE, enabling the company to produce at least 1 billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines by the end of 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-will-consider-sending-astrazeneca-vaccine-to-india-says-anthony-fauci-101619396795885.html

The speech will be co-hosted by UN. permanent representatives of Argentina, Japan, Norway and South Africa.The Biden administration will mark its first 100 days in office this week. President Joe Biden is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday and is certain to highlight the headway his administration has made in responding to the worst public health crisis in the US in more than a century.Harris, according to the excerpts, will broadly outline how the administration thinks the US and other nations should consider focusing their attention. The steps include improving accessibility to health systems, investing in science, health workers and the well-being of women, and surging capacity for personal protective equipment and vaccine and test manufacturing.Harris says much has been learned over the last year about pandemic preparedness and response but that it would be unwise to rest easy.“We have been reminded that the status quo is not nearly good enough, and that innovation is indeed the path forward,” Harris says.Biden’s ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, is also scheduled to deliver remarks at Monday’s virtual event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-kamala-harris-to-tell-un-body-it-s-time-to-prepare-for-next-pandemic-report-101619393989344.html
26-04-2021||World||Biden, Harris assure India of support in fight against Covid-19||US President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris have assured India and its people of providing all assistance, including urgently sending necessary medical life-saving supplies and equipment, to help the country combat the deadly coronavirus crisis.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” Biden said in a tweet.The President was spending his weekend at his home in Delaware but is believed to be following up the developments in India.“The US is working closely with the Indian government to rapidly deploy additional support and supplies during an alarming Covid-19 outbreak. As we provide assistance, we pray for the people of India —including its courageous healthcare workers,” Harris said in a tweet.The tweets by Biden and Harris are the first reactions by the top American leadership after the recent outbreak of deadly Covid-19 pandemic in India. The two have been criticizsed by friends of India in the US, including some of their own party leaders, for slow response to the American help to their natural ally.Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said she has been in close touch with Foreign Secretary Harshvardhan Shringla and India’s Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu in recent days on the issue.“The American people stand in solidarity with our friends in India during these difficult times. We are rapidly providing therapeutics, ventilators, PPE, raw material for vaccines, and more,” Sherman said.Earlier on Sunday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval during which the White House announced that it is urgently sending medical supplies and equipment to save lives in India.The Indian-American community, which had been critical of the Biden administration so far, welcomed the move.“Great to see our US India partnership at work at this critical time,” Indiaspora said after Biden’s tweet.“Good first steps,” Indian-American Democratic bundler Shekar Narasimhan said after Sullivan announced details of the assistance to India.In a tweet, he described it as “moving the needle”.“I am also counting on private and corporate actions to make a difference. Many have a big stake in India and it’s not just Indian Americans,” he said.India’s Ambassador to US Sandhu thanked both US Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Sullivan for their prompt response. “Thank you Sullivan for your reach out and support. We will fight the global pandemic through our collective action!” he said in a tweet.“Thank you Secretary Blinken for your solidarity and support. Together, we will fight the global pandemic!” Sandhu said in another tweet.Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, Congressional India Caucus Vice Chair and Member of the House Armed Services Committee, applauded the Biden administration.“International cooperation and humanitarian assistance are the hallmarks of a truly progressive foreign policy. In the face of apocalyptic numbers of Covid-19 cases & new variants exploding in India, I applaud the Biden administration's decision to put people over profits and provide additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), oxygen, and other medical supplies to India,” Khanna said.“I am also pleased to see the deployment of raw materials for India to produce more vaccines and USAID’s work with the CDC to expedite the mobilisation of emergency resources for India through the Global Fund. This must be done with the utmost speed and urgency,” he said.Khanna said the Biden administration can still do more, like give India “our stockpile” of AstraZeneca vaccines that won’t be used in the US and have already opened up to Mexico and Canada. “And we should facilitate the Indian diaspora in America to help assist hospitals in India.”Khanna said the administration should also call on Pfizer and Moderna to provide an intellectual property waiver for six months to a year as India grapples with the Covid-19 crisis. It will buy them an inordinate amount of goodwill in one of the largest emerging markets, he added.“The White House should also convene Indian business leaders to make the case for why this is in these companies’ long-term strategic interest. Many Indian American business leaders such as Vinod Khosla are happy to make the case to them why this is a good business decision. Mr. Khosla has committed to financially help any hospitals in India in need of supplies and will also be speaking with the India Caucus leadership to discuss what else can be done to assist,” Khanna said.In a statement, Khanna said he is looking forward to joining the India Caucus leadership on a call with Indian Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu to discuss what additional steps the US can take to help India during this “incredibly difficult time”.“This is a very tough time for the Indian people and underscores the continued threat of Covid-19. These new strains of the virus are gravely alarming and could pose a threat here in America and across the globe if we do not do all we can to contain the virus and its new variants,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-harris-assure-india-of-support-in-fight-against-covid19-101619390918721.html
26-04-2021||World||35 years on, the ruins of Chernobyl draw warnings, tourists||The vast and empty Chernobyl Exclusion Zone around the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident is a baleful monument to human mistakes. Yet 35 years after a power plant reactor exploded, Ukrainians also look to it for inspiration, solace and income.Reactor No. 4 at the power plant 110km north of the capital Kyiv exploded and caught fire deep in the night on April 26, 1986, shattering the building and spewing radioactive material high into the sky.Soviet authorities made the catastrophe even worse by failing to tell the public what had happened — although the nearby plant workers’ town of Pripyat was evacuated the next day, the 2 million residents of Kyiv weren’t informed despite the fallout danger. The world learned of the disaster only after heightened radiation was detected in Sweden.Eventually, more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the vicinity and a 2,600-square-kilometer exclusion zone was established where the only activity was workers disposing of waste and tending to a hastily built sarcophagus covering the reactor. Radiation continued to leak from the reactor building until 2019, when the entire building was covered by an enormous arch-shaped shelter. As robots inside the shelter began dismantling the reactor, officials felt new optimism about the zone.“This is a place of tragedy and memory, but it is also a place where you can see how a person can overcome the consequences of a global catastrophe,” said Bohdan Borukhovskyi, Ukraine’s deputy environment minister.“We want a new narrative to appear — it was not a zone of exclusion, but a zone of development and revival,” he said. For him, that narrative includes encouraging tourism.“Our tourism is unique, it is not a classic concept of tourism,” he said. “This is an area of meditation and reflection, an area where you can see the impact of human error, but you can also see the human heroism that corrects it.”The Chernobyl zone saw its tourism increase twofold after the lauded TV miniseries of 2019 and officials hope that level of interest will continue.One of the prime draws for tourists is to see the ruins of Pripyat, the once-modern town of 50,000 now being taken over by decay and vegetation. Work is underway to build paths to make it easier for visitors to navigate the ruins. The Chernobyl plant is out of service, but there is still much work to be done at the decommissioned plant.“We are doing everything possible so that this territory, where it is now impossible for people to live, is used with benefit and gives the country a profit,” said Serhiy Kostyuk, head of the agency that manages the exclusion zone.Although the radiation level in the zone is low enough that tourists can visit and workers can carry out their jobs, permanent residence is banned. However, more than 100 people still live in the zone that extends 30 kilometers around the nuclear power plant, despite orders to leave the site.Among them is 85-year-old former teacher Yevgeny Markevich, who said “It’s a great happiness to live at home, but it’s sad that it’s not as it used to be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/35-years-on-the-ruins-of-chernobyl-draw-warningstourists-101619387562187.html
26-04-2021||World||US says it will provide India with raw material for vaccines||The US said on Sunday it will provide India raw materials urgently needed for making the Covishield vaccine and supply equipment such as ventilators and oxygen generation gear to support the country’s response to a massive surge in Covid-19 cases.The pledge, made by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, came against the backdrop of calls from lawmakers and businesses for the Biden administration to do more and criticism from some quarters for what is being seen as Washington’s lethargic reaction.“Just as India sent assistance to the US as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the US is determined to help India in its time of need,” US national security council spokesperson Emily Horne said after the conversation between the NSAs.The European Union (EU) and Germany too said on Sunday they were mobilising aid to support India, while the UK announced it was sending more than 600 pieces of medical equipment, including ventilators and oxygen concentrator devices. The first package from Britain will arrive in New Delhi on Tuesday, with further shipments later in the week.Canada, Iran and Pakistan said they were ready to supply equipment and medical supplies to help India tackle the crisis caused by a second wave of infections.The US has “identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India”, US national security council spokesperson Horne said.Therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) will also be immediately made available to treat patients and protect frontline health workers. The US is “pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis”, she said.The US will deploy an expert team of public health advisors from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID to work with the US embassy, India’s health ministry and Epidemic Intelligence Service staff, while USAID will work with CDC to fast-track mobilisation of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund.The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is funding an expansion of the manufacturing capability of Indian vaccine manufacturer BioE to produce at least a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022, Horne said.While speaking to Doval, Sullivan expressed deep sympathy for the Indian people and affirmed America’s solidarity with India, “the two countries with the greatest number of Covid-19 cases in the world”. Building on the seven-decade health partnership between the two sides, Sullivan and Doval resolved the two countries will continue to jointly fight the global pandemic.Earlier, Sullivan and secretary of state Antony Blinken had expressed the Biden administration’s support for India in separate tweets. “Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific COVID-19 outbreak. We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India’s health care heroes,” Blinken tweeted.The Biden administration has faced mounting calls to do more on several fronts related to the crisis in India.Lawmakers from the House of Representatives and Senate – all Democrats – called on the administration to back a proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization to grant a temporary waiver from intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines to make them easily accessible.There was also the issue of raw materials for making Covid-19 vaccines, raised by Indian companies with popular support. US suppliers of these items are required to prioritise orders from American buyers after President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act.The Serum Institute of India had called for the US to “lift the embargo” on raw materials and the matter was discussed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar with Blinken, while foreign secretary Harsh Shringla raised it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman.US experts believed the Biden administration could have done more. “Tweetments are good, action is better. Time is crucial here,” said Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to the tweets by Blinken and Sullivan.The US Chamber of Commerce called on the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots will more than meet its needs. The US has also not authorised the AstraZeneca shot.Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley tech billionaire and investor, and Raja Krishnamurthi, an Indian American Democratic lawmaker, echoed that call. Khosla offered to fund oxygen supplies for India. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply,” he tweeted.Janez Lenarčič, the EU commissioner for crisis management, said on Sunday the bloc’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) was coordinating with member states to rapidly provide urgently needed oxygen and medicines to India.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who caused a stir in New Delhi last week with her criticism of the slowdown of vaccine exports from India, expressed solidarity in the “common fight” against Covid-19 and said Germany was preparing a “mission of support”. Lenarčič, responsible for EU’s humanitarian aid and the European emergency response coordinator, said the support was being provided in response to a request from India.“Upon request for assistance by #India, we have activated the #EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The [EU] will do its utmost to mobilise assistance to support people of [India],” he tweeted.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that details of aid to be provided by EU and Germany were in the final stages of being worked out and a clearer picture would be available by Monday.Canada’s public services minister Anita Anand told a news conference on Saturday that Ottawa has communicated its willingness to assist New Delhi. “We will stand ready with PPE (personal protective equipment) and ventilators and any items that might be useful for the government of India,” she said. Anand was quoted by the outlet Global News as saying that the Canadian government was in touch with India and through its envoy in New Delhi, Nadir Patel, “about a number of options that may be on the table for us to assist”.In a statement issued late on Saturday, Pakistan’s foreign ministry offered to provide relief support to India, including ventilators, bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi PAP), digital X-ray machines, PPEs and related items, as a gesture of solidarity.“The concerned authorities of Pakistan and India can work out modalities for quick delivery of the relief items. They can also explore possible ways of further cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic,” the statement said.Iran’s health minister Saeed Namaki offered help in a letter sent to his Indian counterpart Harsh Vardhan. “The government and people of Iran are ready to spare no technical assistance, expertise and equipment in these difficult days and at the height of the plight of the dear citizens of India with the Covid-19 epidemic,” he said.“We hope that the exchange of experiences with scientific, research and production centres of the two countries can create a brighter future for the two countries with a long history of scientific, cultural and production exchanges,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-it-will-provide-india-with-raw-material-for-vaccines-101619381265227.html
