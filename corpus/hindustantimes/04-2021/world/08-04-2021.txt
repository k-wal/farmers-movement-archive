His announcement came the same day as yet another, this one in South Carolina, where five people were killed.Biden emphasized the scope of the problem: Between the mass killings in Atlanta massage businesses and the Colorado grocery store shooting last month, there were more than 850 additional shootings that killed 250 and injured 500 in the US, he said.But Thursday's announcement underscores the limitations of Biden's executive power to act on guns. His orders tighten regulations on homemade guns and provide more resources for gun-violence prevention but fall far short of the sweeping gun-control agenda he laid out on the campaign trail.Indeed, Biden again urged Congress to act, calling on the Senate to take up House-passed measures closing background check loopholes. He also said Congress should pass the Violence Against Women Act, eliminate legal exemptions for gun manufacturers and ban assault weapons and high capacity magazines. Biden said“This is not a partisan issue among the American people," Biden insisted.While Biden asserted that he's “willing to work with anyone to get it done,” gun control measures face slim prospects in an evenly divided Senate, where Republicans remain near-unified against most proposals.Biden was joined at the event by Vice President Kamala Harris and Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland said he was “under no illusions about how hard it is to solve the problem of gun violence” and emphasized a need for a “collective effort to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and save lives.”The Justice Department cannot solve the problem by itself, he said, but "there is work for the department to do, and we intend to do it.”Biden is tightening regulations of buyers of “ghost guns” — homemade firearms that usually are assembled from parts and milled with a metal-cutting machine and often lack serial numbers used to trace them. It’s legal to build a gun in a home or a workshop and there is no federal requirement for a background check.The Justice Department will issue a proposed rule requiring such gun kits be treated as firearms under the Gun Control Act, which would require that the parts be made with serial numbers and that buyers receive background checks.Months before Biden was elected, the federal government had already been working on a proposed rule that would change the definition of a firearm to include lower receivers, the essential piece of a semiautomatic rifle, in an effort to combat the proliferation of ghost guns and to stave off losing court battles over the issue.The process had been in the works in the waning months of the Trump administration, according to four people familiar with the matter. Justice Department leaders and officials at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had been working on language for a proposed rule since at least the summer of 2020, the people said.A second proposed rule, expected within 60 days, will tighten regulations on pistol-stabilizing braces, like the one used by the Boulder, Colorado, shooter in a rampage last month that left 10 dead. The rule will designate pistols used with stabilizing braces as short-barreled rifles, which require a federal license to own and are subject to a more thorough application process and a $200 tax.The department also is publishing model legislation within 60 days that is intended to make it easier for states to adopt their own “red flag” laws. Such laws allow for individuals to petition a court to allow the police to confiscate weapons from a person deemed to be a danger to themselves or others.The department also will begin to provide more data on firearms trafficking, starting with a new comprehensive report on the issue. The administration says that hasn’t been done in more than two decades.The Biden administration will also make investments in community violence intervention programs, which are aimed at reducing gun violence in urban communities, across five federal agencies.The president argued that gun violence was also a massive economic strain, citing the costs from hospital visits, legal fees, and the cost of keeping people in prison and providing therapy to victims and others. A majority of firearm deaths are from suicides.Biden is also nominating David Chipman, a former federal agent and adviser at the gun control group Giffords, to be director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.The ATF is currently run by an acting director, Regina Lombardo. Gun-control advocates have emphasized the significance of this position in enforcing gun laws, and Chipman is certain to win praise from this group. During his time as a senior policy adviser with Giffords, he spent considerable effort pushing for greater regulation and enforcement on ghost guns, changes to the background check system and measures to reduce the trafficking of illegal firearms.Chipman spent 25 years as an agent at the ATF, where he worked on stopping a trafficking ring that sent illegal firearms from Virginia to New York, and served on the ATF’s SWAT team. Chipman is a gun owner.He is an explosives expert and was among the team involved in investigating the Oklahoma City bombing and the first World Trade Center bombing. He also was involved in investigating a series of church bombings in Alabama in the 1990s. He retired from the ATF in 2012.During his campaign, Biden promised to prioritize new gun control measures as president, including enacting universal background check legislation, banning online sales of firearms and the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. But gun-control advocates have said that while they were heartened by signs from the White House that they took the issue seriously, they've been disappointed by the lack of early action.With the announcement of the new measures, advocates did laud Biden's first moves.“Each of these executive actions will start to address the epidemic of gun violence that has raged throughout the pandemic, and begin to make good on President Biden’s promise to be the strongest gun safety president in history,” said John Feinblatt, president of Everytown for Gun Safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prez-joe-biden-tightens-some-gun-controls-says-much-more-needed-101617903682171.html
08-04-2021||World||Nepal: 4 Maoist Centre ministers relieved of Parliament membership||Four ministers in Prime Minister K P Sharma Oli-led Cabinet, who belonged to the CPN-Maoist Centre led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal ‘Prachanda’, were relieved of their Parliament membership on Thursday.Energy Minister Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Industry Minister Lekhraj Bhatta, Urban Development Minister Prabhu Sah and Labour Minister Gaurishankar Chaudhary lost their positions as lawmakers upon the recommendation of their party.Reading out a notice during Thursday's meeting of the House of Representatives, Speaker Agni Prasad Sapkota said that the four ministers have been relieved of their position as lawmakers after the decision of the CPN-Maoist Centre.The four leaders, however, can continue as ministers in the Oli-led Cabinet for six more months. But, they should retain their post if they wish to continue more than that, according to prevailing laws.Rayamajhi, Bhatta, Sah and Chaudhary did not return to the CPN-Maoist Centre even after the revival of their party in February this year.Instead, they decided to join the Oli-led CPN-UML, where they have been enjoying Cabinet berths.Prime Minister Oli's dissolution of the House of Representatives in December last year triggered a political crisis in Nepal. However, in a landmark ruling, the Supreme Court in February reinstated the lower house of Parliament.The political scenario in the country worsened after the Supreme Court last month nullified CPN-MC's merger with CPN-UML. The two parties had merged in May 2018 to form a unified Nepal Communist Party following the victory of their alliance in the 2017 general elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-4-maoist-centre-ministers-relieved-of-parliament-membership-101617903618984.html
08-04-2021||World||UK, Ireland leaders urge 'calm' after Northern Ireland violence||British Prime Minister Boris Johnson and his Irish counterpart Micheal Martin on Thursday called for "calm" in Northern Ireland after holding talks following days of violence in the British province.Martin and Johnson "spoke this afternoon about the concerning developments in Northern Ireland", where they stressed that "violence is unacceptable" and "called for calm", according to the Irish leader's office."The way forward is through dialogue and working the institutions of the Good Friday Agreement. They agreed that the two governments would continue to stay in contact," added the statement.Leaders in Northern Ireland had earlier jointly condemned days of rioting stemming from the territory's pro-UK community, including a petrol-bomb attack on a moving bus, as police said they were probing possible paramilitary involvement.It was the worst unrest in Belfast in recent years, which erupted amid anger over apparent economic dislocation due to Brexit and existing tensions between the pro-UK unionist and pro-Irish nationalist communities.The UK province's devolved legislative assembly interrupted its Easter break to pass an emergency motion condemning the unrest.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-ireland-leaders-urge-calm-after-northern-ireland-violence-101617903265458.html
08-04-2021||World||In a first, Biden unveils limited gun control measures||US President Joe Biden on Thursday announced limited gun control reforms through six actions in the aftermath of three deadly mass shootings including the killing of Asian-Americans in Atlanta and shoppers at a grocery store in Colorado.“Gun violence in this country is an epidemic. We say it again, gun violence in this country is an epidemic,” Biden said at a White House event to announce the executive actions, in the presence of survivors of gun violence and relatives of victims. “And it’s an international embarrassment,” he added.The justice department will be required to propose a rule within the next 30 days to stop the proliferation of “ghost guns” that are bought in parts and can be assembled into a weapon within 30 minutes, according to one of the actions. The next will ask the justice department to announce a rule that will subject stabilisation braces that can turn pistols into mini rifles to the National Firearms Act, that are more stringent.The justice department will also be required to publish a model “red flag” legislation for states that allows for a person to be denied access to firearms if petitioned by family members or police. The remaining two actions called for increased investment in evidence-based community violence intervention and the publication of an annual report on firearm trafficking, which has not been done since 2000.These actions did not address the issue of assault rifles, which have been used most commonly in mass shootings.The president is backing a legislation passed recently by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives that seeks to expand background checks for gun deals, covering transactions made on the internet, and closes certain loopholes in the current law. He called for the passage of the bill.“Every day in this country 360 people are shot, every single day 106 of them die, every day,” Biden said, reeling off numbers. “Our flag was still flying at half-staff for the victims of the horrific murder, primarily Asian-American people in Georgia … 10 more lives were taken in a mass murder in Colorado.”“You probably didn’t hear between those points in less than one week apart more than 850 additional shootings; 850, that took the lives of more than 250 people and left 500 injured. This is an epidemic, for God’s sake, and it has to stop.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-first-biden-unveils-limited-gun-control-measures-101617902327720.html
08-04-2021||World||‘International embarrassment’: Biden introduces limited gun control measures||President Joe Biden announced a set of executive actions Thursday to curb gun violence, urging Congress to adopt stricter laws and rebutting arguments that his new measures impinge on Americans’ second amendment rights.“Gun violence in this country is an epidemic, and it’s an international embarrassment,” Biden said in the Rose Garden of the White House.Recent shootings that left 18 dead in Colorado and Georgia have thrust gun violence back into the spotlight, with gun-control advocates calling on the president to make the issue a top legislative priority. The actions unveiled Thursday reflect the limited power the president has to regulate guns without action on Capitol Hill.Biden has called on Congress to pass gun control legislation, but he has also acknowledged that Republican opposition makes progress unlikely. He said he first wants to focus on beating the coronavirus pandemic and boosting an economic recovery.In addition to the orders, Biden announced his plan to nominate David Chipman to lead the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF -- an agency that has been without a permanent director since 2015.One of the executive actions would take steps to stop the proliferation of so-called ghost guns, which come in kits and can be assembled in as little as 30 minutes. The weapons can’t be traced by law enforcement because they lack serial numbers. Two high-profile shootings in California were carried out using ghost guns but they have otherwise not been commonly used in mass shootings.“Anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit,” Biden said.The ATF said in a December 2020 search warrant application that about 10,000 ghost guns were recovered by law enforcement in 2019.The White House also said Thursday that the Justice Department will issue a new rule clarifying that when a shoulder brace is used to effectively turn a pistol into a short-barreled rifle, the gun is subject to the requirements of the National Firearms Act. Authorities say the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, shootings -- in which 10 people were killed -- used a pistol with an arm brace that made the weapon more stable and accurate.In addition, the Justice Department will publish model “red flag” legislation for states, which would allow petitions to courts to take away firearms from people who present a danger to themselves and others. Such measures can’t be enacted at the federal level without Congress, but administration officials have said they hope their move encourages states to pass new laws right away.A gunman last month killed eight people, including six Asian women, at spas during a string of shootings in the Atlanta area.The president also said he is allocating federal funds for community violence intervention and prevention programs aimed at heading off conflicts that can lead to violence in urban communities. Biden’s proposed American Jobs Plan includes $5 billion over eight years for community intervention programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/international-embarrassment-biden-introduces-limited-gun-control-measures-101617900315114.html

Video of the arrest, widely viewed on social media, showed Chauvin pinning Floyd's neck to the ground with his knees for more than nine minutes as Floyd begged for his life, repeatedly gasping: "I can't breathe."The way that Chauvin and other officers pushed Floyd into the street as they arrested him was like putting the left side of his body "in a vice," Tobin testified. Tobin appeared to confirm the findings of the county medical examiner, who ruled Floyd's death a homicide caused by police restraint.Floyd's death prompted protests against racism and police brutality in many cities across the United States and around the world.Here are important moments from the ninth day of witness testimony:DR. MARTIN TOBIN, EXPERT IN THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEMAfter giving the jury a brief overview of how oxygen enters the body through air sacs deep in the lungs, Tobin said the way police restrained Floyd meant he could not take in enough oxygen leading to his heart to stop beating, which he said could be described as asphyxia."The cause of the low level of oxygen was shallow breathing," Tobin said.This resulted from a combination of forces applied by police, including placing Floyd prone on the street, handcuffing his hands behind his back and the officer kneeling on his back and neck.Tobin unbuttoned his shirt collar at one point and asked jurors to do the same as he felt his neck, describing how Chauvin's knee compressed the delicate tissue of the hypopharynx, blocking that part of the respiratory system in the lower part of the throat.Tobin calculated that at times Chauvin was exerting 91.5 pounds (41.5 kg) of downward pressure on Floyd's neck."All of those forces are going to result in the low tidal volume, which gives you the shallow breaths that we saw here, and so the air will not be able to reach those air sacs," Tobin said.Chauvin and the three other officers were attempting to arrest Floyd on suspicion of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a food store. They were fired the following day.Tobin discussed frames from the video that he said showed Floyd trying to push his chest up from the street using his fingers and his face as leverage as he struggled for breath. The way Chauvin and another officer, Alex Kueng, manipulated the handcuffs also limited Floyd's breathing, he testified."They're pushing the handcuffs into his back and pushing them high, then on the other side you have the street. The street is playing the crucial part," Tobin said. "It's like the left side is in a vice."Kueng and two other officers are set to face a trial later in the year on charges of aiding and abetting Chauvin in killing Floyd.Tobin told the jury he declined to take an offered fee from the Minnesota attorney general's office in part because it was his first time testifying as an expert witness in a trial.In introducing Tobin, prosecutor Jerry Blackwell held up the 1,500-page textbook "Principles and Practice of Mechanical Ventilation" written by Tobin, and he agreed when Blackwell asked if the medical journal Lancet had called it the "bible" on the topic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lack-of-oxygen-killed-george-floyd-doctor-testifies-at-chauvin-murder-trial-101617899809487.html

Morgan, who had to step down as a presenter of ITV breakfast show "Good Morning Britain" after his comments on Markle, said that he, as a taxpayer, doesn’t want to pay for a racist.During a tell-all interview with iconic talk show host Oprah Winfrey last month, Meghan Markle had claimed that the British royal family refused to make her son a prince partly due to conversations about how dark his skin might be. Markle refused to explicitly name the person because it would be “damaging” to them but Harry later clarified that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip were never part of those conversations.“Was there a problem about the skin colour of this child in the eyes of the Royal? If it were, if this is how it was done, then I want to know who that Royal is because I'm paying for them as a British taxpayer. I don't want to be paying for a racist,” Morgan said in an interview with Extra's Billy Bush aired on Wednesday.Also Read | Meghan Markle filed formal complaint about UK TV host Piers Morgan commentsPiers Morgan has been a vocal critic of Meghan Markle ever since she cut off contact with the tabloid newspaper editor after she met Prince Harry. After Markle’s interview was aired on CBS, Morgan said that he did not believe her when the Duchess of Sussex said at one point she "didn't want to be alive anymore". Morgan’s comment sparked a deluge of complaints to Britain's broadcasting regulator Ofcom."On Monday, I said I didn't believe Meghan Markle in her Oprah interview. I've had time to reflect on this opinion, and I still don't," he later wrote on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-tv-host-piers-morgan-renews-call-for-meghan-harry-to-name-the-racist-royal-101617895962528.html
08-04-2021||World||In U-turn, US to now provide $235mn to Palestine as aid||The United States is resuming financial assistance to Palestine with at least $235 million, reversing a 2018 decision by then president Donald Trump to discontinue it.“US foreign assistance for the Palestinian people serves important US interests and values,” Secretary of State Antony Blinken said on Wednesday. “It provides critical relief to those in great need, fosters economic development, and supports Israeli-Palestinian understanding, security coordination and stability.”The revival of assistance to Palestine is yet another reversal of a Trump-era foreign policy decision, joining a growing list that includes efforts currently under way for the US to rejoin (the Iran deal (the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action). The US has also rejoined the Paris Agreement on climate and World Health Organization.The bulk of the US assistance for Palestine - $150 million - will go through the UN Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which was set up 72 years ago to help displaced Palestinian people. Another $75 million will go towards economic and development assistance in the West Bank and Gaza and $10 million for peace-building programmes, Blinken said. These payments will be disbursed by the US Agency for International Development (USAID).“The United States is committed to advancing prosperity, security, and freedom for both Israelis and Palestinians in tangible ways in the immediate term, which is important in its own right, but also as a means to advance towards a negotiated two-state solution,” said the secretary of state.The Palestinian Authority, which is headquartered in Ramallah, welcomed the move. “This is a positive, important and constructive step in the direction of rectifying Palestinian-American relations, which the Trump administration destroyed,” said Ahmad Majdalani, the social development minister of the Palestinian Authority, according to reports. “We believe it can be built upon by dealing with some other outstanding issues.”The United Nations, which runs UNRWA, also welcomed the US announcement. “We hope that others will now follow suit. There were a number of countries that had greatly reduced or halted contributions to UNRWA. We hope that the American decision will lead others to rejoin as UNRWA donors,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.Trump ended the assistance in 2018 as part of his overall tilt towards Israel. He had also recognised Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and Israel’s sovereignty over Golan Heights, which it had seized from Syria in 1967.Israel has criticised the resumption of aid. Gilad Erdan, its ambassador to the US and the UN, called it “anti-Israel and anti-Semitic”. “I have expressed my disappointment and objection to the decision to renew UNRWA’s funding without first ensuring that certain reforms, including stopping the incitement and removing anti-Semitic content from its educational curriculum, are carried out,” Ambassador Erdan said.Congressional Republicans have also opposed the aid resumption and said they will scrutinise the package for violation of American laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-u-turn-us-to-now-provide-235mn-to-palestine-as-aid-101617895367119.html

The support we have received from India has contributed immensely to the socio-economic development of Seychelles," said President Ramkalawan at a high-level virtual event with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Lauding India's support on the Covid-19 vaccine front, President Ramkalawan said Seychelles is nearing its target of achieving 70 per cent of heard immunity by the end of this month due to the precious donation of vaccines by India."What better example of Indian solidarity than your spontaneous donation of 50,000 doses of Covishield vaccine. If we are nearing our target of achieving 70 per cent of heard immunity by Apr 2021 and have re-opened our country to business, it is due to this precious donation," he added.Also Read: India hands over ₹100 cr patrol boat to boost Seychelles’ maritime securityThe high-level virtual event saw the joint-inauguration of the New Magistrates' Court Building in Seychelles, new naval ship, one MW solar power plant, 10 HICDPs (High Impact Community Development Projects).The Magistrates' Court Building project is a landmark project and will help bring magistrate courts spread over different locations in Mahe into a single building. It is situated next to the Supreme Court of Seychelles built by Chinese assistance in 2013.The vessel that was inaugurated is a 48.9-meter fast-patrol vessel built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineering Ltd. (GRSE), at a cost of ₹100 crore. The ship will be used for multi-purpose operations such as patrolling, anti-smuggling, anti-poaching and search and rescue (SAR).The FPV was delivered to Seychelles with the assistance of the Indian Navy on March 16 and was handed over by Prime Minister Modi to the Seychelles Coast Guard during the virtual event. Christened as 'PS Zoroaster', the FPV is the fourth ship to be gifted by India to Seychelles. The other vessels gifted by India include PS Topaz (2005), PS Constant (2014), Patrol Boat Hermes (2016).These HICDP projects are aimed at implementing small people-oriented projects which contribute significantly towards the socio-economic development and improvement of local communities. Twenty-nine projects have so far been taken up for execution under the MoU.The one MW solar project is in addition to the installation of solar systems at 146 government building rooftops and domestic households which has already been completed and commissioned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-modi-seychelles-president-jointly-e-inaugurate-magistrates-court-building-101617894473488.html
08-04-2021||World||India hands over ₹100 cr patrol boat to boost Seychelles’ maritime security||India on Thursday formally handed over a ₹100-crore patrol vessel to Seychelles, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi saying the Indian Ocean archipelago is central to New Delhi’s vision for security and development in the region. Besides the donation of the PS Zoroaster to the Seychelles Coast Guard, Modi and President Wavel Ramkalawan inaugurated the new magistrates’ court building in Mahé constructed with a $3.5-million grant, a 1 MW solar power plant built at a cost of $3.4 million, and 10 community development projects during a virtual event. India has been working closely with countries in the Indian Ocean, especially the Maldives and Seychelles, to bolster maritime security through the supply of aircraft and patrol vessels. The PS Zoroaster is the fourth made-in-India patrol boat to be gifted to Seychelles since 2005, and more than 50% of Seychelles’ maritime and air assets have been provided by India. The 48.9-metre patrol boat was built by Garden Reach Shipbuilders and Engineering at a cost of ₹100 crore and has a top speed of 35 knots and an endurance of 1,500 nautical miles. The vessel will be used for multi-purpose operations, such as patrolling, anti-smuggling and anti-poaching operations, and search and rescue. “India is committed to strengthening the maritime security of Seychelles...This vessel will help Seychelles to protect its maritime resources,” Modi said at the virtual event. Seychelles, he added, is central to India’s vision of “SAGAR” or “Security and Growth for All in the Region”, and India will help develop the archipelago’s security capabilities and meet its infrastructural and developmental needs. Ramkalawan, who has his roots in Gopalganj district of Bihar, said the vessel will play a key role in counter-narcotics operations within Seychelles’ vast maritime zone and contribute to regional stability and security. “In India, we have a reliable and trusted partner. India has never failed us, India stands by us and Seychelles stands by India,” Ramkalawan said, adding that India’s “precious donation” of 50,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines had helped his country in moving towards the goals of achieving 70% herd immunity by the end of April and opening up the economy. The magistrates’ court building brings together several courts that were spread over Mahé and is located next to the Supreme Court of Seychelles, built with Chinese assistance in 2013. This is the first India-backed construction project in the archipelago and was completed amid the pandemic. The building has eight courtrooms, separate holding cells for men, women and children, and multi-functional conference rooms and video rooms. India has so far taken up 29 small people-oriented development projects in Seychelles, while the 1MW solar project was built in addition to installing solar systems at 146 government buildings and domestic households. The solar plant will meet the electricity needs of around 400 houses round the year. The virtual event was the first interaction between Modi and Ramkalawan, who came to power in the October 2020 elections. Seychelles was the first destination in Modi’s tour of Indian Ocean countries in 2015.

08-04-2021||World||Leaders condemn 'deplorable' Northern Ireland rioting||Leaders in Northern Ireland on Thursday jointly condemned days of rioting stemming from the territory's pro-UK community, including a petrol-bomb attack on a moving bus, as police said they were probing possible paramilitary involvement.The British and Irish governments also denounced what was the worst unrest seen in Belfast in recent years, which erupted amid anger over apparent economic dislocation as a result of Brexit and existing tensions between the pro-UK unionist and pro-Irish nationalist communities."Destruction, violence and the threat of violence are completely unacceptable and unjustifiable, no matter what concerns may exist in communities," said the Northern Ireland executive -- made up of unionist, nationalist and centrist parties."While our political positions are very different on many issues, we are all united in our support for law and order."Northern Ireland's legislative assembly interrupted its Easter break to pass an emergency motion condemning the unrest.Pro-Irish nationalist and centrist leaders identified Brexit as one root cause and criticised London for breaking promises to the unionists.For her part, unionist First Minister Arlene Foster refrained from her recent criticisms of the nationalist party Sinn Fein, condemning "rioting, criminality and wanton destruction"."It is not in the name of the people who live in the areas," she told lawmakers.- 'Sectarian violence' -In the latest disorder Wednesday, gates were set alight on a "peace line" -- walls separating pro-Irish nationalist and pro-UK unionist communities -- and police said crowds from either side broke through to attack each other with petrol bombs, missiles and fireworks.Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) temporary assistant chief constable Jonathan Roberts said the scale and nature of the violence was unprecedented in recent years."The fact that it was sectarian violence and there was large groups on both sides... again is not something we have seen for a number of years," he told reporters.The six nights of violent incidents have left 55 police officers injured, he noted, as well as a press photographer and the driver of the bus fire-bombed Wednesday.Roberts said children as young as 13 were suspected of involvement following encouragement from adults, and the large volume of petrol bombs used suggested "a level of pre-planning".The PSNI is probing if Northern Ireland's notorious paramilitary groups were involved in the unrest."Whether or not paramilitary groups were involved remains an active line of investigation," Roberts added.- Johnson's 'fantasy' promises -Northern Ireland endured 30 years of sectarian conflict that killed 3,500 people.Unionist paramilitaries, British security forces and armed nationalists -- seeking to unite the territory with the Republic of Ireland -- waged battle until a landmark peace deal in 1998.The accord let unionists and nationalists coexist by blurring the status of the region, dissolving border checks with fellow European Union member Ireland.But Britain's shock Brexit vote in 2016 to quit the EU revived the need for border checks. A special "protocol" was agreed that shifted the controls away from the land border, but many unionists accuse London of selling them out.There is also outrage within the unionist community after the authorities decided not to prosecute Sinn Fein leaders for attending a large funeral last year of a former paramilitary leader, in apparent breach of Covid restrictions.- 'Defuse tensions' -Johnson's Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis was due to fly to Belfast Thursday, where he is to meet leaders from the main parties, including Foster and deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn Fein, as well as faith and community advocates.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted that he was "deeply concerned", saying "the way to resolve differences is through dialogue, not violence or criminality".Irish premier Micheal Martin also condemned the unrest, calling on "all sides to work together to defuse tensions and restore calm".At Thursday's Northern Irish Assembly debate Naomi Long, justice minister for the centrist Alliance Party, spoke of feeling "some sympathy to those people out there who feel betrayed" by the British government's Brexit policy.She charged that Johnson had made "fantasy" promises of "sunlit uplands" after Britain quit the EU.Meanwhile, with some unionist leaders demanding the EU protocol be scrapped, European Commission spokesman Eric Mamer also condemned the unrest "in the strongest possible terms".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-condemn-deplorable-northern-ireland-rioting-101617890060970.html
08-04-2021||World||African Union drops plans to buy Covid-19 vaccines from Serum Institute of India||The African Union has dropped its plans to buy coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccines from the Serum Institute of India (SII) and is instead exploring options with Johnson & Johnson, news agency Reuters reported on Thursday, citing the Africa Centre for Disease Control and Prevention. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, codenamed AZD1222 and sold by the Serum Institute under the brand name 'Covishield', has been facing concern from experts worldwide after a few rare blood clotting-events were reported in several European countries.European drug regulators say there’s some evidence of a link between AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine and a rare type of blood clots, though occurrences are low, according to a Bloomberg report. It’s up to individual countries to set guidelines, which means there’s no unified response, something that may confuse, or even worry, people due to receive the shot. Some countries are still using it on all adults for now, others are restricting to certain age groups, and a few have stopped it completely.The African Union has said that the Serum Institute of India will still supply the AstraZeneca vaccine to the continent through the COVAX vaccine-sharing facility, but additional supplies would be sought from Johnson & Johnson. John Nkengasong, the head of the Africa CDC, said however that the possible link between the Anglo-Swedish vaccine and the blood clot reports had nothing to do with the Union's decision. The Africa Union, a continental body consisting of the 55 member states that make up the countries of the African continent, has shifted its efforts to the Johnson & Johnson vaccine, Nkengasong said, citing the deal signed last week to secure up to 400 million doses beginning in the third quarter of this year.Additionally, the Serum Institute of India has fully refunded South Africa for 500,000 doses of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine which the country did not want and which had not yet been delivered, the country's health minister Zweli Mkhize said on Thursday, as per Reuters. South Africa, too, is expected to get more than 1 million vaccine doses from Johnson & Johnson in April as the country looks to ramp up its vaccination drive, the news agency cited the minister as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/african-union-drops-plans-to-buy-covid-19-vaccines-from-serum-institute-of-india-101617886355578.html
08-04-2021||World||Janet Yellen tells world's big economies: Spend big, danger lurks||U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen on Thursday warned of the risk of a permanence divergence in the global economy in the wake of the Covid-19 crisis, and urged major economies to inject significant new fiscal support to secure a robust recovery.In a statement to the steering committees of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, Yellen underscored the need for major economies to continue supporting developing countries as they grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change and high debt burdens.She urged the World Bank to help countries, particularly the world's poorest, get timely access to Covid-19 vaccines, and backed accelerated negotiation to replenish the World Bank's International Development Association fund for the poorest countries - a goal the bank aims to reach by December.The United States had pledged $4 billion to the COVAX global vaccine distribution initiative, Yellen said, urging others to join in.She signalled that Washington, which so far has only loaned vaccines to Mexico and Canada, could provide excess doses to other countries in the future."The United States will continue to work with partners to increase vaccine supplies, explore sharing excess vaccines, and make sure financing does not become an obstacle for global vaccination," Yellen said, without providing any details.Yellen's comments reflect the Biden administration's focus on strong international cooperation to tackle global challenges - a sharp departure from the "go-it-alone" approach pursued by former President Donald Trump's administration."The (Covid-19) crisis has exacerbated the trend of rising income inequality, raising concerns about a divergent path within and across countries. We also face the existential threat of climate change. We can only resolve these problems through strong international cooperation," Yellen said in remarks prepared for her first meeting with the IMF's International Monetary and Financial Committee and the World Bank's Development Committee.The former head of the Federal Reserve said substantial fiscal and monetary support from major economies had improved the global economic outlook significantly, but more efforts were needed.Washington was implementing a $1.9 trillion Covid-19 relief plan and was working on another large infrastructure package, Yellen said, urging other major economies to take similar actions."The job is not yet done, given high uncertainty and the risk of permanent scarring," she said. "I urge major economies to not just avoid removing support too early, but to strive to provide significant amounts of new fiscal support to secure a robust recovery."Yellen said developing countries should work with the IMF and World Bank on economic policies and structural reforms and seek full-fledged IMF financing programs, which carry conditions, where necessary. Some countries may need deeper debt treatment, she added.She called on all creditors to "fully and transparently" implement the Group of 20's common framework for debt treatments to avoid "unnecessary delays that can prolong debt overhangs and exacerbate growth shocks."She also urged the World Bank to lead on "transformative climate investments" and to continue to set an aggressive agenda on climate and the green recovery from the crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/janet-yellen-tells-world-s-big-economies-spend-big-danger-lurks-101617888696749.html

Iran, also battling a record rate of infection, is another recent recipient.The 102 countries reached so far include 61 benefiting from a mechanism essentially financed by donors.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on Monday called it a "travesty" that some countries still did not have enough vaccines to begin inoculating health workers and the most vulnerable.GAVI said last month that it planned to deliver 237 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine - which has been produced at cost for a few dollars a dose, and does not require the advanced refrigeration of some other coronavirus vaccines - to 142 countries by the end of May."COVAX may be on track to deliver to all participating economies in the first half of the year, yet we still face a daunting challenge as we seek to end the acute stage of the pandemic," GAVI chief executive Seth Berkley said in the statement.Nonetheless, COVAX still expects to deliver at least 2 billion doses this year 2021, and to diversify the offering beyond the AstraZeneca/Oxford and Pfizer/BioNTech shots it is currently supplying.(Reporting by Stephanie Nebehay; Editing by Kevin Liffey)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covax-vaccines-reach-more-than-100-countries-despite-supply-snags-101617888960978.html

That bill, titled the Endless Frontier Act, was first proposed in 2020 and calls for $110 billion over five years to advance U.S. technology efforts.The package of Senate legislation reflects bipartisan hard-line sentiment on Beijing in Congress.It is intended to address economic competition with China, but also humanitarian and democratic values, such as the treatment of the minority Muslim Uighurs, suppression of dissent in Hong Kong and aggression in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-panel-to-consider-major-china-competition-bill-on-april-14-report-101617887201438.html
08-04-2021||World||US jobless claims up to 744,000 as Covid-19 still forces layoffs||The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits rose last week to 744,000, signaling that many employers are still cutting jobs even as more people are vaccinated against Covid-19, consumers gain confidence and the government distributes aid throughout the economy.The Labor Department said Thursday that applications increased by 16,000 from 728,000 a week earlier. Jobless claims have declined sharply since the virus slammed into the economy in March of last year. But they remain high by historical standards: Before the pandemic erupted, weekly applications typically remained below 220,000 a week.For the week ending March 27, 3.7 million people were receiving traditional state unemployment benefits, the government said. If you include supplemental federal programs that were established last year to help the unemployed endure the health crisis, a total of 18.2 million are receiving some form of jobless aid the week of March 20.Economists monitor weekly jobless claims for early signs of where the job market is headed. Applications are usually a proxy for layoffs: They typically decline as the economy improves. Or they rise as employers retrench in response to sluggish consumer demand.During the pandemic, though, the numbers have become a less reliable barometer. States have struggled to clear backlogs of unemployment applications, and suspected fraud has clouded the actual volume of job cuts.By nearly all measures, though, the economy has been strengthening. During March, employers added 916,000 jobs, the most since August, and the unemployment rate declined from 6.2% to 6%. In February, the pace of job openings reached its highest level on record. Last month, consumer confidence posted its highest reading in a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-jobless-claims-up-to-744-000-as-covid-19-still-forces-layoffs-101617887185448.html

During a television interview, Oxford-educated Khan blamed “fahashi” (vulgarity) for the rise in rape cases in the country, advising women to cover up to prevent the “temptation”.“This entire concept of purdah (covering up or segregating) is to avoid temptation, not everyone has the willpower to avoid it," he had said.Jemima Goldsmith, Khan’s first wife, quoted Quran to say the onus is on men. “Say to the believing men that they restrain their eyes and guard their private parts: Quran 24:31. The onus is on men,” the British filmmaker wrote on Twitter. Goldsmith, who was married to Khan from 1995 to 2004, added, “I’m hoping this is a misquote/mistranslation. The Imran I knew used to say, ‘Put a veil on the man’s eyes not on the woman’.”I'm hoping this is a misquote/ mistranslation. The Imran I knew used to say, "Put a veil on the man's eyes not on the woman." https://t.co/NekU0QklnLReham Khan, who was married to the Pakistan leader for ten months in 2015, joined Goldsmith and rights activist in criticising Imran Khan for his controversial remark.

"Not only does this betray a baffling ignorance of where, why and how rape occurs, but it also lays the blame on rape survivors, who, as the government must know, can range from young children to victims of honour crimes," the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent rights watchdog, said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-s-ex-wives-slam-pak-pm-for-linking-rape-to-how-women-dress-101617885293874.html
08-04-2021||World||Pope tells IMF, World Bank to cut the debt of poor countries||Pope Francis has told world financial chiefs that poor countries hit by the economic impact of the coronavirus need to have their debt burden reduced and be given a greater say in global decision making.In a letter to the participants of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank's annual spring meeting, the pope said the pandemic had forced the world to come to terms with interrelated socioeconomic, ecological, and political crises."The notion of recovery cannot be content to a return to an unequal and unsustainable model of economic and social life, where a tiny minority of the world's population owns half of its wealth," the pontiff said in the letter dated April 4.He called for a new "global plan" that "necessarily means giving poorer and less developed nations an effective share in decision-making and facilitating access to the international market."A spirit of global solidarity "demands at the least a significant reduction in the debt burden of the poorest nations, which has been exacerbated by the pandemic," he said.Financial chiefs of the Group of 20 large economies on Wednesday extended a suspension of debt servicing costs for developing countries but fell short of cancelling debt or expanding debt relief as requested by non-profit organisations.Financial markets need to be underpinned by laws and regulations that ensure they work for the common good, the pope said, calling for "a justly financed vaccine solidarity.""We cannot allow the law of the marketplace to take precedence over the law of love and the health of all," he said.With inoculation campaigns in poor African countries lagging far behind those of the rich world, particularly the United States and Britain, the pope appealed to political and business leaders to provide "vaccines for all, especially for the most vulnerable and needy."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-tells-imf-world-bank-to-cut-the-debt-of-poor-countries-101617882160091.html
08-04-2021||World||Ahead of talks in Turkey, Afghan side for ‘conditions-based’ approach with Taliban||As the Afghanistan government prepares for talks with the Taliban in Turkey this month, the Afghan side is hoping the US will adopt a “conditions-based” approach instead of a time-bound framework for its dealings with the Taliban, people familiar with developments have said. Afghan government representatives and the Taliban are expected to hold talks in Istanbul on April 16 as part of the US administration’s fresh push to put in place a ceasefire and create conditions for a transition in Kabul. The talks are part of a four-point plan outlined in a letter sent by US secretary of state Antony Blinken to President Ashraf Ghani in February. The Biden administration is yet to take a call on pulling out all American troops from Afghanistan by May 1, the deadline set by the previous Trump administration in an agreement signed with the Taliban last year. The White House has said it will be tough to meet the deadline and that President Joe Biden is continuing consultations with his national security team and partner countries. “The US should adopt a conditions-based approach with the Taliban and not a time-bound approach. The agreement signed by the Trump administration imposed conditions with huge consequences on the Afghan side, which wasn’t even party to the agreement signed last year,” one of the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. Also Read | US faults NATO ally Turkey with range of human rights issues“More time is needed to address the security situation and anyway, the Afghan forces are now in the lead in the operations being conducted on the ground,” the person added. The Indian government has not commented publicly on the issue of the May 1 deadline but the Indian side has in the past informed the US side that the troop drawdown in Afghanistan must be done in a planned and orderly manner to ensure that it doesn’t create a vacuum that can be exploited by the Taliban and foreign terror groups operating in the war-torn country, including the Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed. The Afghan side believes there has been no change in the attitude of the Taliban, which is believed to be behind a wave of targeted assassinations and bombings in Afghan cities that have claimed scores of lives. “The Taliban have also not cut their links with al-Qaeda or other foreign groups operating in Afghanistan as they were required to do under the agreement with the US,” said a second person. “The removal of sanctions and other restrictions on the Taliban has also reduced the leverage that can be used against them,” the first person said. Some experts believe one of the focus areas of the upcoming talks in Istanbul will be an extension of the deadline for withdrawal of US troops. Besides the talks in Turkey, the Biden administration intends to ask the UN to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of India, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and the US to forge a unified approach for a settlement in Afghanistan. One of the factors behind the decision to ask Turkey to host the peace talks is the country’s perceived leverage and close relations with Pakistan, which exercises a great deal of control over the Taliban, the people cited above said. “The Doha process has run its course and several countries were interested in hosting the next round of talks, including Indonesia, Uzbekistan, the United Arab Emirates and Turkey, which was considered to be more suitable,” the first person said. Germany and Norway, which have played a role in facilitating peace talks between Afghan groups, have shown an interest in having a role in the upcoming talks in Istanbul, either in the form of formal participation or as observers, the people said. In recent years, Germany had even offered to host intra-Afghan talks. While addressing the Heart of Asia-Istanbul Process meeting in Tajikistan on March 30, President Ghani outline his vision for a peaceful settlement – a ceasefire and a negotiated political settlement with the Taliban to be endorsed by a Loya Jirga or traditional assembly, consensus on forming a transitional government within the framework of the Afghan Constitution, and a time-bound plan for holding an internationally monitored presidential election.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ahead-of-talks-in-turkey-afghan-side-for-conditions-based-approach-with-taliban-101617884985798.html

There is no delayed meeting as you cited,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said.“I have no information about the upcoming talks,” he said, responding to a related question. “I want to stress that the merits of the situation at (the) India- China border are very clear and the responsibility does not rest with the Chinese side.”“We hope the Indian side will work with China to follow through the important consensus of our two leaders, abide by relevant agreements and treaties to de-escalate the tension at the border,” Zhao added.To a question on whether China will consider India’s proposal of restoring the status quo of April 2020, Zhao said: “For the proposal you mentioned I believe it should be talked in the meetings and I already made clear my position on the border issue just now.”On March 12, Indian and Chinese diplomats had agreed to ensure stability in the Ladakh sector of the LAC and to convene the 11th meeting of senior military commanders soon to take forward disengagement and de-escalation at friction points on the disputed border.Those outcomes were agreed upon during a virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs between the two countries.According to India’s external affairs ministry, it had been agreed at the WMCC meet to convene the 11th meeting of the senior military commanders “at an early date so that two sides could work towards complete disengagement from the remaining friction areas”.The Chinese readout on the same meeting had noted that the two sides had positively evaluated the disengagement at Pangong Lake and had a candid and in-depth exchange of views on promoting resolution in other areas.It added that the two sides had agreed to stabilise the situation on the border and avoid any “repetition of the situation on the ground in accordance with the five-point consensus reached at the Moscow meeting of the two foreign ministers and the spirit of their February 25 phone call”.The two neighbours have been locked in a standoff since May last year after Chinese troops impeded patrols by Indian forces.A brutal clash at Galwan Valley last June - which left 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops dead and was the first incident on the LAC involving fatalities since 1975 - took bilateral ties to an all-time low.India has insisted that China’s actions on the LAC have seriously damaged bilateral ties and normalcy can be restored only by disengagement, de-escalation and restoration of the status quo on the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talks-with-india-to-resolve-lac-tension-not-delayed-china-101617883594567.html
08-04-2021||World||Netherlands: Man arrested over 'plot' to attack Covid-19 vaccination center||Police in the Netherlands have arrested a 37-year-old man on suspicion of plotting a crime with “terrorist intent” for allegedly planning to set off what they described as a “firework bomb” at a coronavirus vaccination center, prosecutors said Thursday.The man, whose identity was not released in line with Dutch privacy guidelines, was arrested March 18. He allegedly wanted to attack the former town hall in the northern port of Den Helder, 90 kilometers (55 miles) north of Amsterdam, which is being used as a vaccination center.Prosecutors said the alleged plot is being treated as a terror act because it “aimed to instill serious fear among the population and to disrupt the economic and social structures of the country.”The suspect “sought to sabotage a crucial government process, the nationally coordinated vaccination program, in an extremely violent manner,” the prosecution statement said. “This also affects public health: The fewer people can be vaccinated, the more victims the virus will claim.”The suspect has been detained since his arrest as investigations continue into possible accomplices, prosecutors said.Early last month, a blast caused by what police called a “homemade device” smashed windows at a coronavirus testing center in a small Dutch town. Nobody was hurt in the explosion. In January, rioters torched a coronavirus test facility in the fishing village of Urk on the first night of a 9 p.m.-to-4:30 a.m. nationwide curfew imposed as part of the government’s latest coronavirus lockdown.The Netherlands remains in a months-long lockdown amid stubbornly high coronavirus infection numbers. Restaurants, bars, museums and other public places remain closed, although the government is experimenting with relaxing some restrictions for people who can prove they have been vaccinated or have tested negative for COVID-19.___Follow AP’s pandemic coverage at:https://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-pandemichttps://apnews.com/hub/coronavirus-vaccinehttps://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-man-arrested-over-plot-to-attack-covid-19-vaccination-center-101617882851735.html

McCain, a guided missile destroyer, throughout its passage on Wednesday, Zhang Chunhui, spokesperson for the Chinese military’s eastern theatre command, said.The US move sent the “wrong signal” to Taiwan’s government and “wilfully disrupted the regional situation by endangering peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait”, Zhang said.China firmly opposed the move and Chinese forces will respond with “strict precautions and vigilance’, he added.Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian said the American ships engaging in “provocations” “send a seriously wrong signal to the forces of Taiwan independence, threatening peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait”.“Would a Chinese warship go to the Gulf of Mexico to make a show of strength?” he added.Earlier, the US Navy’s 7th fleet said the warship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait was made according to international law. “The Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer USS John S McCain (DDG 56) conducted a routine Taiwan Strait transit April 7 (local time) through international waters in accordance with international law. The ship’s transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the US’s commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. The United States military will continue to fly, sail, and operate anywhere international law allows,” Lt Mark Langford, 7th Fleet spokesperson, said.The same US warship had transited through the Taiwan Strait in February, triggering protests from Beijing.China claims the democratically-run Taiwan as its own territory and has repeatedly protested over Washington stepping-up support for the island, including arms sales and sailing warships through the Taiwan Strait.The PLA itself has increased its presence in the waters surrounding Taiwan, and even deployed an aircraft carrier last week.Taiwan’s defence ministry on Wednesday said 15 Chinese aircraft, including 12 fighters, entered its air defence identification zone, with an anti-submarine aircraft flying to the south through the Bashi Channel between Taiwan and the Philippines.Taiwan’s air force sent up aircraft to intercept and warn the Chinese away, the Reuters news agency quoted the Taiwanese defence ministry as saying.The PLA’s air force carried out its largest air drill around the island March-end, deploying more than 36 aircraft during the exercise.“The large-scale exercise showed that the PLA is capable of surrounding the island of Taiwan and blocking it from receiving foreign reinforcements, and also sent a strong warning to the coast guard agreement the US signed with the island on Friday,” analysts told state media.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-accuses-us-for-tensions-over-taiwan-101617881554250.html
08-04-2021||World||Africa CDC says vaccine passports 'inappropriate' for now. Here's why||The head of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Thursday described Covid-19 vaccine passports as “inappropriate" while poor countries lag behind others in acquiring the shots.“Our position is very simple. That any imposition of a vaccination passport will create huge inequities and will further exacerbate them,” Dr. John Nkengasong told a briefing.“We are already in a situation where we don't have vaccines, and it will be extremely unfortunate that countries impose a travel requirement of immunization certificates whereas the rest of the world has not had the chance to have access to vaccines."Vaccine passports are documents that show that travelers have been vaccinated against Covid-19 or recently tested negative for the virus. Technology companies and travel-related trade groups in some wealthy countries are developing and testing out passports to encourage travel.The matter of vaccine passports has been a hotly debated topic around the world, including in the United States and Israel. One question relates to whether governments, employers, and organizers of large gatherings have a right to know about a person’s virus status. Many disagree over what the right balance is between a person’s right to medical privacy and the collective right of groups of people not to be infected with a dangerous disease.Critics also point out that such vaccine passports will enable discrimination against poor nations that do not have ready access to vaccines.Only 2% of all vaccine doses administered globally have been in Africa, according to the World Health Organization.The Africa CDC warned last week that the continent is unlikely to meet its vaccination targets amid supply delays from a key manufacturer. Africa has been mostly reliant on the global COVAX initiative, which aims to ensure that low- and middle-income countries have fair access to the shots. But the Serum Institute of India recently announced that as many as 90 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine destined for COVAX worldwide will be delayed through the end of April as India’s government grapples with a spike in infections at home.Amid delays in COVAX shipments, the African Union's Vaccine Acquisition Trust signed a deal last week with Johnson & Johnson for 220 million doses of its vaccine to be delivered by the third quarter of this year, with an option to acquire an additional 180 million doses through 2022.Africa's target is to vaccinate 60% of its 1.3 billion people by the end of 2022. That goal still may not be met without widespread use of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which is widely seen as key to the global strategy to stamp out the coronavirus pandemic. The vaccine from the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker is cheaper and easier to store than many others.Africa has confirmed more than 4.3 million cases, including 114,000 deaths, representing about 3.3% of the global caseload. But some experts worry that the continent will suffer greatly in the long term if more of its people are not vaccinated in efforts to achieve so-called herd immunity, when enough people are protected through infection or vaccination to make it difficult for a virus to continue to spread. That means about 1.5 billion vaccine doses for Africa, or less if the one-dose Johnson & Johnson vaccine is widely used.“In terms of trade and travel, the world will be watching to see which nations achieve herd immunity and are safe,” Ugandan health entrepreneur Dr. Ian Clarke wrote in a recent column in the local Sunday Vision newspaper. “If Uganda stays as a pocket of Covid-19 while other countries have developed herd immunity, we can expect travel advisories from embassies that it is not safe to visit Uganda.”In a sign of what could come next, Kenya reacted angrily to the British government's decision to ban most travelers from the East African country because a significant number of them are testing positive for a variant first found in South Africa. Britain's travel restrictions begin Friday.Kenya has retaliated by making it mandatory for all passengers originating from or transiting through U.K. airports to undergo 14 days of quarantine at a government facility at their own cost. Authorities also charged in a statement that the British government's decision “seems to be motivated by a discriminatory policy against certain countries and peoples.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/africa-cdc-says-vaccine-passports-inappropriate-for-now-here-s-why-101617880301172.html
08-04-2021||World||Australia backs Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine over AstraZeneca for under-50s||Australia recommends the use of Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine for people younger than 50 in preference to the shot made by AstraZeneca, the government said on Thursday, changing its advice for those deemed most at risk.The move, after Europe’s drug regulator found a possible link between the Anglo-Swedish vaccine and rare blood clotting issues, is a huge hurdle for Australia's faltering inoculation effort, which relies heavily on the AstraZeneca vaccine.Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly said Australia would advise health providers to only give a first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine to adults younger than 50 when the benefit clearly outweighs the risks.Those who have already had a first Astrazeneca dose without any serious adverse events "can safely be given their second dose," he added.On Wednesday the European Medicines Agency said it found rare cases of blood clots among some adult vaccine recipients, but added that the advantages still outweighed the risks.Kelly said despite the risks being extremely low, Australian experts have changed their advice for those at greatest risk.Australia has ordered 20 million doses of the Pfizer vaccine and Prime Minister Scott Morrison said Canberra was in talks to increase the order.It will continue to give the AstraZeneca vaccine to people aged over 70, but those above 50 who opt for the Pfizer vaccine will have to wait, the government said.The European regulator's latest findings spurred Britain to recommend an alternative vaccine for people younger than 30, while Italy suggested limiting AstraZeneca shots to those older than 60.Australia's immunisation campaign, which is more than 80% behind its original schedule, relies heavily on the AstraZeneca vaccine for a population of nearly 26 million.It had pledged to administer at least 4 million first doses by the end of March, but could only deliver 670,000, with the government blaming the delay on issues over supply from Europe.It had been looking to ramp up the immunisation effort, underpinned by plans to make 50 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in Australia, produced by CSL Ltd.Australia began vaccinations much later than some other nations because of its few infections, which stand at just under 29,400, with 909 deaths, since the pandemic began.Neighbouring New Zealand has barred entry to all travellers from India, including its own citizens, over the next two weeks after numerous arrivals from the South Asian nation tested positive.It is the first time New Zealand has barred its own citizens and residents, although both it and Australia shut their borders to non-citizens very early in the pandemic to rein in outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-backs-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-over-astrazeneca-for-under50s-101617880294482.html

It is leading the global expansion in renewable energy like solar and wind power, and has in the last few years begun early planning for venturing into hydrogen.Many provinces and cities are scrambling to map out hydrogen plans and are calling for state subsidies to help spur the sector.The capital forecasts its hydrogen use for road transport and power generation to reach 50 tonnes a day by 2023, and 135 tonnes by 2025, Beijing Daily reported, citing a local government draft plan for 2021-2025.Part of the new hydrogen vehicle fleet would be those deployed for the 2022 Winter Olympics Games due to take place in and near Beijing, before being expanded to ply highways in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region to replace heavy-duty trucks powered by diesel fuel.Between 2021 and 2025, some 4,400 trucks are expected to shift to fuel cells, displacing 145,000 tonnes of diesel consumption annually, the report said.At the end of 2020, China had fewer than 10,000 trucks and buses powered by hydrogen, with annual use of the fuel at 3,000 tonnes, the world's second-largest after the United States.Beijing-based commercial vehicle maker Beiqi Foton Motor said last September it aimed to sell 4,000 hydrogen vehicles by 2023, and 15,000 such vehicles by 2025.Beijing will source part of the hydrogen production from Yanshan Petrochemical Corp, owned by state refiner Sinopec Corp , which wants to become China's No.1 hydrogen player.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-capital-envisages-10-000-fuel-cell-vehicles-by-2025-101617878657311.html
08-04-2021||World||A city wrestled down an addiction crisis. Then came Covid-19||Larrecsa Cox steered past the used tire shop, where a young man collapsed a few days before, the syringe he’d used to shoot heroin still clenched in his fist.She wound toward his house in the hills outside of town. The man had been revived by paramedics, and Cox leads a team with a mission of finding every overdose survivor to save them from the next one.The man’s mother stood in pink slippers in the rain to meet her. People have been dying all around her.“People I’ve known all my life since I was born, it takes both hands to count them,” she said. “In the last six months, they’re gone.”As the Covid-19 pandemic killed more than a half-million Americans, it also quietly inflamed what was before it one of the country’s greatest public health crises: addiction. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that more than 88,000 people died of drug overdoses in the 12 months ending in August 2020 — the latest figures available. That is the highest number of overdose deaths ever recorded in a year.The devastation is an indictment of the public health infrastructure, which failed to fight the dueling crises of Covid-19 and addiction, said Dr. Michael Kilkenny, who runs the health department in Cabell County, which includes Huntington.Simultaneously, Kilkenny said, disruptions in health care exacerbated the collateral consequences of drug use — HIV, hepatitis C, deadly bacterial infections that chew flesh to the bone and cause people in their 20s to have open-heart surgeries. There were 38 HIV infections tied to injection drug use last year in this county of fewer than 100,000 people — more than in 2019 in New York City.Huntington was once ground zero for the addiction epidemic. On the afternoon of August 15, 2016, 28 people overdosed in four hours in Huntington. Connie Priddy, a nurse with the county’s Emergency Medical Services, describes it as their “day of reckoning.”By 2017, the county had an average of six overdoses a day. Some businesses changed out their bathroom lightbulbs to blue — to make it harder for drug users to find a vein.They couldn’t ignore it anymore. The county got two grants and selected Cox, a paramedic, to lead a crew of addiction specialists, faith leaders and police officers who crisscross the county, tracking down people who overdosed. “Facing addiction? We can help,” reads the decal plastered on the side of the Ford Explorer.If the people they find are ready for treatment, they get them there. If they aren’t, they give them the overdose-reversal medication naloxone and other supplies to try to help them survive in the meantime.A white board in their office lists the names of clients they’ve ushered into treatment — about 30% of those they’re able to track down. After two years, the county’s overdose calls dropped by 50 percent.The federal government honored Huntington as a model city. Other places came to study their success.The first couple months of the pandemic were quiet, said Priddy, who coordinates the team and tracks their data. Then came May. There were 142 EMS calls for overdoses, nearly as many as in the worst of their crisis.By the end of 2020, Cabell County’s EMS calls for overdoses had increased 14% over the year before.“That makes us sick,” Priddy said, but she’s heard from colleagues in other counties that their spike was twice as high.The CDC estimates that across the country overdose deaths increased nearly 27% in the 12-month span ending in August 2020. In West Virginia, fatal overdoses increased by more than 38%.Report after report arrived on Cox’s desk. In October, she saw a name of a woman she knew well and lost her breath: Kayla Carter.Carter had a brilliant mind for math and loved the stars. Her family always thought she’d grow up to work for NASA.Instead, she was addicted to opioids by the time she turned 20.“We went through living hell,” said her mother, Lola.Carter overdosed dozens of times. At 30 years old, she already walked with a cane that she painted her favorite color, pink. Infection coursed through her body. She had Hepatitis C and HIV.In 2018, HIV started spreading among injection drug users here. Kilkenny said the county ramped up testing, treatment and the needle exchange program that offers clean syringes to drug users, recommended by the CDC. Cases subsided.But they’ve surged again.As Huntington tries to beat back the damage the pandemic has done, Priddy said it feels like their own state is working against them. The state legislature is pushing a bill to strictly limit needle exchange programs, citing the dangers of discarded syringes.Syringe programs have been the subject of decades of scientific study. The CDC describes them as “safe, effective, and cost-saving,” — they do not increase drug use, studies have found, and they dramatically cut the spread of HIV.Priddy sent her legislator a message imploring that if they restrict syringe exchanges, many more will die.Carter was hospitalized last summer with endocarditis, a heart infection from using dirty needles. Her parents stood at her bedside and thought she looked 100 years old. They cried all the way home.She stayed off drugs when she got out of the hospital. She gained 30 pounds. She said she was sorry for all she’d missed: babies born, birthday parties, funerals. They thought they had her back.Then she stopped answering calls. Her mother went to her apartment and found her dead on her bathroom floor.They are still waiting for the medical examiner’s report, but her father Jeff, a retired paramedic, would rather never see it. It brings him comfort to think she died from complications from her surgeries, and not that she relapsed and overdosed.Now the box of her ashes sits in their living room. Her mother talks to them every night, then cries herself to sleep.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-city-wrestled-down-an-addiction-crisis-then-came-covid19-101617877702400.html
08-04-2021||World||Are some Covid-19 vaccines more effective than others?||Are some Covid-19 vaccines more effective than others?It's hard to tell since they weren't directly compared in studies. But experts say the vaccines are alike on what matters most: preventing hospitalisations and deaths.“Luckily, all these vaccines look like they're protecting us from severe disease,” said Dr. Monica Gandhi of the University of California, San Francisco, citing study results for five vaccines used around the world and a sixth that's still in review.And real-world evidence as millions of people receive the vaccines show they're all working very well.Still, people might wonder if one is better than another since studies conducted before the vaccines were rolled out found varying levels of effectiveness. The problem is they don't offer apples-to-apples comparisons.Consider the two-dose vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna, found to be about 95 per cent effective at preventing illness. Studies for those shots counted a Covid-19 case whether it was mild, moderate or severe — and were conducted before worrisome mutated versions of the virus began circulating.Then Johnson & Johnson tested a single-dose vaccine and didn't count mild illnesses. J&J's shot was 66 per cent protective against moderate to severe illness in a large international study. In just the US, where there's less spread of variants, it was 72 per cent effective. More importantly, once the vaccine's effect kicked in it prevented hospitalisation and death.AstraZeneca's two-dose vaccine used in many countries has faced questions about the exact degree of its effectiveness indicated by studies. But experts agree those shots, too, protect against the worst outcomes.Around the world, hospitalizations are dropping in countries where vaccines have been rolling out including Israel, England and Scotland — regardless of which shots are given. And the US government's first look at real-world data among essential workers provided further evidence that the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are highly protective -- 90 per cent -- against infections whether there were symptoms or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/are-some-covid-19-vaccines-more-effective-than-others-101617866158346.html
08-04-2021||World||Covid-19: China's rapid vaccination strategy leads to shortage in supply||China’s ambitious effort to vaccinate 560 million people -- 40% of its population -- by the end of June is running into a supply shortage, forcing health authorities to extend the intervals between two doses, and leaving some people unable to book their second shots.The supply bottleneck comes as China’s vaccination roll out accelerates to nearly 5 million doses a day, the fastest in the world, though the proportion of its vast population covered still lags the U.S., Israel and other leading inoculating nations.While China gets its vaccine supply from domestic manufacturers, thus giving it more control than most countries which are struggling to secure doses, the accelerated pace is pushing the limits of what its homegrown makers can churn out, said people familiar with the matter.This partly drove a decision at the end of March by China’s National Health Commission to issue guidelines on vaccination that said the interval between the first and second dose can be stretched to as long as eight weeks, said the people, who asked not to be identified as they’re not authorized to speak publicly.This is over twice as long as the dose interval used during clinical trials of the vaccines made by state-owned China National Biotec Group and Beijing-based Sinovac Biotech Ltd.Among Western vaccines, dose intervals for mRNA shots range from 21 days to 28 days, while the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends a maximum of six weeks. In the U.K., AstraZeneca Plc.’s vaccine is advised to be administered with an interval of between four to 12 weeks.The moves underscore the mammoth effort ahead of China, which has virtually eliminated the pathogen domestically and yet risks falling behind other countries -- particularly geopolitical rivals like the U.S. -- in achieving herd immunity and re-opening its economy and borders. In recent weeks, a hardening propaganda campaign that links vaccination to maintaining China’s global prestige in containing the coronavirus has raised take-up rates considerably, but it’s still vaccinating just five out of every 100 people, compared to 27 in the U.S. and 56 in Israel, according to Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker.The National Health Commission did not respond to questions sent by fax.The supply shortage is being exacerbated by Beijing’s pledge to make its shots a global public good to help end the pandemic. More than 100 million doses have been donated and sold overseas and more will be exported as Chinese makers are on track to be included in the WHO-backed Covax program to provide immunization access to poorer nations.China has also offered vaccines to the International Olympics Committee for the upcoming Tokyo Games, while carrying out discussions with European countries looking for supply.The supply shortage appears to be felt unevenly across China. Beijing, the capital, does not appear to have any supply concerns and has raced ahead with over half of its population dosed. Meanwhile, financial center Shanghai -- whose population is also over 20 million people -- has raised Sinovac dose intervals from 14 to 21 days due to supply concerns, said one of the people. To date, Shanghai has given out only 5.5 million doses.In southern Guangdong province, China’s manufacturing hub, the local government has selected five key cities of Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Foshan, Dongguan and Zhuhai to prioritize for vaccination while halting new doses in all other cities, said a person familiar with the situation there.In the central Chinese city of Wuhan, the local CDC branch notified some residential compounds to temporarily suspend vaccinations because shots are running out, said people familiar with the situation there.Given supply constraints, the 40% vaccination target is a nationwide one and doesn’t mean coverage will be even across places, said one person familiar with authorities’ thinking. Densely populated megacities along the developed eastern part of China are being prioritized for vaccination, while remote, sparsely inhabited western provinces will be further behind in the line.In recent days, some people have complained on social media platforms that they’ve been unable to book appointments for second shots.In northeastern Jilin province, resident Wang Yuemei said she’s been told by local officials that she can’t get a vaccination appointment. Some cities in northeastern China are barring people from getting first doses, as their remaining supply will be rationed for those who have already taken a first shot and are waiting for a second, said people familiar with the situation there.“They said it’s due to the shortage of the vaccine. I’m in a wait-and-see mode because even if I get a first shot, there’s a chance I can’t get the second,” said Wang, 42. “This already happened to one of my family members who has passed his set date for the second shot but is still told to keep waiting.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-s-rapid-vaccination-strategy-leads-to-shortage-in-supply-101617876558272.html

Here are the Top 10||YouTube remains the most popular social media platform in the United States, a new report by the Pew Research Center has revealed. Facebook takes the second place, followed by Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn, according to the American think-tank's 2021 survey report. Snapchat, Twitter, WhatsApp, TikTok, and Reddit are next in the list, respectively, while Nextdoor, a neighbourhood-focused platform, has also registered its presence in the list.The Pew Research Center's "Social Media Use in 2021" report reveals some interesting facts about the American social media landscape. While YouTube and Facebook continue to dominate internet culture, a trend that has been continuing over the past five years, the number of US adults using Facebook remained almost the same since 2018. YouTube, on the other hand, has reported an 8% growth in American users since 2019. Reddit is the only other social media platform that reported significant growth — registering a 7% rise in users since 2019.Here are the top 10 social media platforms in the US, as per the Pew Research Center's 2021 survey report (listed along with the percentage of US adults who acknowledged using them):1 . YouTube (81%)2 . Facebook (69%)3 . Instagram (40%)4 . Pinterest (31%)5 . LinkedIn (28%)6 . Snapchat (25%)7 . Twitter (23%)8 . WhatsApp (23%)9 . TikTok (21%)10 . Reddit (18%)Nextdoor has also found a place in the list, with 13% of US adults saying they use the platform for connecting with users in the neighbourhood.Age groupsInstagram, Snapchat, and TikTok remain popular among young adults aged 18 to 29 years, according to Pew Center's report. Facebook, although used by around 70% of the younger users, is also accessed by 50% of users aged 50-64. YouTube, being the most popular social media platform in America, has a fairly decent user base across all age groups, with 49% of older users and 95% of younger users accessing the platform.Identities and demographicsFacebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn are also popular across most demographic groups and identities, with the 2021 social media survey showing that Hispanic (52%) and Black Americans (49%) use Instagram more than White Americans (35%). This trend holds true for most other social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and TikTok, as well. Only in the case of LinkedIn were White Americans found statistically more likely to use.Similarly, Pinterest is a social media platform preferred mostly by women (46%) over men (16%).GrowthA particularly notable feature of the 2021 social media survey is the fact that the growth in Facebook's userbase has plateaued over the last five years, even though it remains the second most popular social media platform for US adults. The situation is almost the same for Instagram, Pinterest, LinkedIn, Twitter, Snapchat, and WhatsApp, the userbase for all of which have remained statistically unchanged since 2019.On the other hand, Reddit's userbase has grown from 11% in 2019 to 18% in 2021.

The country may not be well-known as economic powerhouse, but when it comes to giving vaccine shots, over 60 per cent of Bhutan's population has received a first jab.Surprisingly, the Himalayan kingdom started its two-dose vaccination drive just 11 days ago. It is using the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine donated by India.By Wednesday, 470,000 people out of 770,000 (61.03%) had been administered the first shot.Ninda Dema, a 30-year-old woman born in the year of the Monkey as per the Buddhist astrology, became the country’s first to receive the shot on March 27. She was given the vaccine jab at a school-turned-vaccination centre in the capital Thimphu.“Let this small step of mine today help us all prevail through this illness,” Ninda was quoted by the Kuensel newspaper as saying after being selected to take the first jab.And in just nine days, Bhutan has achieved what many other countries couldn't.When Bhutan's campaign launched on March 27, it set the speedy target of vaccinating over half a million adults - in just one week.With this record, Bhutan has left Israel behind which has given both shots of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to more than half of its population.The country has recorded 896 Covid-19 infections and one death so far.

They said they received instruction from the capital, so they are not going to let me in,” he told the Daily Telegraph, calling the move a “coup.”British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab on Thursday condemned the “bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime,” and praised the ambassador's “courage.” But it was unclear what, if anything, the UK could do about the move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-ambassador-to-uk-says-he-is-locked-out-of-embassy-101617871538669.html
08-04-2021||World||Biden plans to crack down on 'ghost guns' with action on Thursday||President Joe Biden on Thursday will unveil his administration's first steps to curb gun violence, including a plan to reduce the proliferation of "ghost guns," after a slew of mass shootings have put pressure on him to act.Biden will announce that the Justice Department intends to issue a proposed rule within 30 days to help reduce the increasing prevalence of untraceable, self-assembled "ghost guns," a White House official told reporters. The details of the rule were not immediately clear.The department also will issue proposed rules within 60 days that make clear that devices marketed as "stabilizing braces" that effectively turn pistols into rifles will be subject to the National Firearms Act, which requires the registration of firearms, the official said.Other measures include investment in community violence prevention, the planned release of a model "red flag law" that states can use to draft their own versions, and plans for a Justice Department report on arms trafficking. Red flag laws allow courts and local law enforcement to remove guns from people deemed a risk to communities.Gun control is a divisive issue in the United States, which has experienced a significant number of deadly mass shootings at schools and other public venues for decades. The U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms.The administration has been working on gun control measures for months that would limit gun violence without starting a legal battle that could lead to courts quickly dismantling the policies.The official said Biden would continue to advocate for legislation and called the administration's planned actions on Thursday initial steps."The president will not wait for Congress to act before the administration takes our own steps, fully within the administration's authority and the Second Amendment, to save lives," she said.Recent mass shootings in Georgia and Colorado have put pressure on the White House to act on its own. Legislation is not likely to pass swiftly through Congress.The top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, criticized Biden's move."President Biden plans to announce his attempts to trample over our constitutional 2A rights by executive fiat," McCarthy said in a tweet. "He is soft on crime, but infringes on the rights of law-abiding citizens."The proposal is also likely to face legal challenges. The National Rifle Association (NRA) said in a statement it will fight Biden's executive actions."Biden has made clear his sights are set on restricting the rights of law-abiding gun owners while ignoring criminals and foregoing substantive measures that will actually keep Americans safe," spokeswoman Amy Hunter said.It will force Americans to give up guns and states to enforce confiscation orders, Hunter added.ATF PICKThe U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) has said more than 30% of the illegal weapons it has confiscated in some areas of California are "ghost guns," not currently regulated as firearms requiring background checks.Biden had chosen David Chipman, a former ATF special agent, to serve as the agency's director, White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki told reporters on Wednesday. Gun control activists and some of Biden's fellow Democrats in Congress had pleaded with the White House to name someone to the post.Chipman is an adviser to Giffords, a gun violence prevention organization spearheaded by former U.S. Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who survived a 2011 mass shooting in Arizona.The NRA said it will oppose Chipman's nomination.The list of initiatives to be unveiled on Thursday leave out a number of Biden's campaign promises, many of which require congressional action, including opening gun makers up to lawsuits over murders committed using their weapons, banning assault weapons altogether, and requiring background checks for most gun sales.Biden had also promised other actions he said he could take unilaterally, such as banning assault weapons from being imported, as well as fielding suggestions on how to reform the ATF and the federal gun safety background check system within his first 100 days in office, a period that ends on April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-plans-to-crack-down-on-ghost-guns-with-action-on-thursday-101617871499302.html
08-04-2021||World||Japan: Tokyo seeks government permission to impose emergency Covid-19 curbs||Tokyo has asked Japan's central government for permission to implement emergency measures to curb a surge in a rapidly spreading and more contagious coronavirus variant, just over three months before the start of the Olympics.Tokyo came out of a state of emergency on March 21. Its governor, Yuriko Koike, told reporters Thursday that she asked the government to allow her to issue binding orders under a new virus prevention law enacted in February that include penalty for business owners who defy measures and compensation for those who comply.Tokyo's step follows Osaka in western Japan, which declared a medical emergency after its hospitals became overwhelmed with new cases.Tokyo reported 545 cases Thursday, highest since early February. Koike said she is alarmed by the rapid spread of the new variants, especially one initially detected in Britain.“It would be a matter of time before Tokyo faces a situation similar to Osaka,” Koike said.She said timing and details of the new measures, including shorter hours for restaurants and bars, will be decided later, possibly on Friday.The latest surge started in western Japan, including Osaka, where the daily toll hit a record 878 and Gov. Hirofumi Yoshimura asked that the Olympic torch relay scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday be held at a park and not on the public road. He said more than 70% of hospital beds have been occupied, a threshold for a local medical alert.Infections have also surged elsewhere in the country. With Japan's vaccination drive still at an early stage, the surge may cause further cancelations of Olympic-related events.Inoculations started mid-February with medical workers, but still account for less than 1% of the population. Vaccinations of elderly people are to start next week and the rest will likely have to wait until around July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-tokyo-seeks-government-permission-to-impose-emergency-covid-19-curbs-101617870887505.html

They also pointed out that the mobility metrics they measured “can be used by public health officials and governments to estimate the level of restrictions needed to control the spread of Sars-CoV-2 and guide, in real-time, the implementation and intensity of non-pharmaceutical public health interventions to control the Covid-19 pandemic.”The authors also pointed out that such interventions “remain the primary means of controlling” Covid-19 until “vaccination coverage is sufficient to achieve herd immunity”.With the surge in cases, Canada’s largest province Ontario announced stay-at-home orders that came into effect on Thursday, while other provinces have also introduced more restrictive measures to combat the deadly virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-study-finds-10-rise-in-mobility-rate-sparks-25-spike-in-weekly-cases-101617866373475.html
08-04-2021||World||India’s farm laws, Kashmir’s status to come up at Canada-based NDP’s convention||Condemnation of the Indian government over last year’s farm deregulation laws that have sparked protests, as well as the 2019 revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s semiautonomous status are among the resolutions that feature on the agenda of the Canada-based New Democratic Party’s (NDP) national convention starting on Friday.The resolutions at the three-day affair will be voted upon by the delegates, and if accepted, will become the party’s policy.The resolution for “International solidarity with Indian farmers” was moved by members of the party from Brampton East. The NDP is led by Jagmeet Singh, who was denied a visa by the Indian government in December 2013. At that time, he was a member of the provincial parliament (MPP) in Ontario, making him perhaps the first-ever sitting member of a Western legislature to have been barred from travelling to India. Later, in March 2018, he was forced to disavow all “acts of terrorism” even as he was in the eye of a storm over his appearance at a 2015 event in San Francisco, during which he spoke at a platform in the backdrop of a poster of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, considered in India as the person who gave the Khalistan movement a violent spin in the 1980s.While he contested elections in 2019 to the House of Commons from Burnaby South in British Columbia, the town of Brampton, in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), is Singh’s home base and his brother Gurratan Singh is an Ontario MPP from the region.The resolution calls for “the federal government to condemn India’s actions and take a firm stand in standing up for farmers and the human rights abuses being carried out by the Indian government” and demands “international accountability to protect the rights of farmers to peacefully protest without duress”. Also, two resolutions on Jammu and Kashmir feature in the section “Redefining Canada’s place in the world”. One expresses solidarity with the people of the region who the resolution claims have been “denied their right to self-determination” by both India and Pakistan. The second one claims the revocation of Article 370 has led to “renewing the dispute over Kashmir with Pakistan and China that resulted in heightened diplomatic, military and civil unrest, including widespread human rights abuses, in the area”.Many of the resolutions to be considered by the party have already come in for sharp criticism for being impractical. Among them are the phasing out of the Canadian Armed Forces; defunding, disarming and disbanding police forces in the country including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police; Canada’s withdrawal from Nato; abolishing billionaires; and nationalising the auto industry, big banks and insurance companies.Without referring to the India-specific resolutions, columnist Terry Glavin wrote in the daily Ottawa Citizen on Wednesday that to read through the resolutions in the chapter on “Redefining Canada’s place in the world”, was to be “left with the impression, if you’re a reasonably literate observer of the world, that these people have lost their damn minds”. On Monday, columnist John Ivison wrote in the daily National Post that “the sheer number of impractical and preposterous ideas suggests not so much an irrational fringe, as an institution that is in danger of being taken over by its moonstruck inmates”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-farm-laws-kashmir-s-status-to-come-up-at-canada-based-ndp-s-convention-101617864873552.html
08-04-2021||World||Mysterious plumes of methane gas appear over Bangladesh||One of the countries most vulnerable to climate change has also been revealed as a major contributor of methane, a greenhouse gas that’s about 80 times more potent in its first two decades in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide. The 12 highest methane emission rates detected this year by Kayrros SAS have occurred over Bangladesh, according to the Paris-based company, one of several that specialize in analyzing satellite observations to locate leaks. “It has the strongest sustained emissions we've seen to date where we can’t clearly identify the source,” said Stephane Germain, president of GHGSat Inc, which also picked up the plumes.Bluefield Technologies Inc., which analyzed European Space Agency data to identify a large methane plume in Florida in May, also detected the concentrations over Bangladesh. “Our analysis shows that Bangladesh has some of the highest methane emissions in the world that can be detected by satellites,” said Yotam Ariel, the company’s founder.Scientists are just beginning to pinpoint the biggest sources of methane. Observations from space can be seasonal due to cloud cover, precipitation and varying light intensity. Satellites can also have difficulty tracking offshore emissions and releases in higher latitudes such as the Arctic, where Russia has extensive oil and gas operations. Because of these limitations existing data isn’t yet globally comprehensive.But the emissions over Bangladesh are drawing attention. Its low elevation and high population density make it particularly vulnerable to extreme weather events and rising oceans. The country chairs the Climate Vulnerable Forum, whose 48 members represent 1.2 billion people most threatened by climate change. “We’re aware of the problems,” Bangladesh’s Environment and Climate Change Minister Shahab Uddin said in an interview. The bulk of the methane likely came from rice paddies, he said. When farmers flood their fields, bacteria in the waterlogged soil can produce large quantities of the gas. “The other source is the landfill gas,” Uddin said, released when trash breaks down. “We’re working to take mitigation measures.” Domesticated livestock, leaks from the oil and gas industry, landfills and coal mining are just some of the human activities that result in methane emissions, according to the Global Methane Initiative. At least a quarter of today's global warming is caused by man-made methane emissions, the Environmental Defense Fund estimates.Methane concentrations in Bangladesh likely originate from a combination of sources including paddy fields, landfills, leaky natural gas pipelines and coal stockpiles, according to Kayrros. The company uses data from the ESA’s Sentinel-5P and Sentinel-2 satellites. It ran a dispersion simulation that takes into account atmospheric conditions such as wind, that can move methane plumes away from their source.Methane is a particular concern for those working to slow the pace of climate change. The gas is odorless and colorless, making leaks extremely difficult to detect. Halting accidental emissions from energy infrastructure is some of the lowest-hanging fruit because companies stand to benefit from cleaning up operations. They’re losing product that could have been sold and risk reputational damage as investors such as BlackRock Inc. demand higher standards.“The methane concentrations we see over Bangladesh are a signal and deserve more study,” said Steven Hamburg, chief scientist at the EDF, which plans to launch its own satellite to track methane emissions next year. “It will require more work to make reliable quantitative estimates of emissions and determine sources.”The ability to attribute leaks to individual operators is getting closer as more satellites are launched that offer greater precision and more frequent coverage. GHGSat in February said it tracked methane leaks from at least eight natural gas pipelines and unlit flares in Central Turkmenistan that released as much as 10,000 kilograms per hour.EDF’s PermianMap project, which combines data from satellites and other ground-based observations to attribute and aggregate emissions by operator in one of the world’s most active fossil fuel basins, is a sign of the transparency to come. “The ability to attribute methane emissions at an asset level is here now,” said GHGSat’s Germain. “The challenge is to increase the frequency of the observations with more satellites.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mysterious-plumes-of-methane-gas-appear-over-bangladesh-101617862519027.html
08-04-2021||World||Britain slams 'bullying' Myanmar over London embassy standoff||Britain on Thursday condemned "bullying" by the Myanmar junta after the country's ambassador to London was ousted in an extraordinary diplomatic coup after calling for the release of civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Diplomats loyal to the Myanmar military authorities seized control of the embassy on Wednesday, leaving ambassador Kyaw Zwar Minn locked out in the street.The ambassador said the defence attache had taken over the mission in "a kind of coup", two months after the military seized power in Myanmar.Daily protests demanding a return of democracy have rocked the country and brought a brutal response from the armed forces, with almost 600 civilians killed according to a local monitoring group.The coup prompted several high-profile diplomatic defections, including the country's ambassador to the United Nations.The junta recalled Kyaw Zwar Minn last month after he issued a statement urging them to release Suu Kyi and deposed civilian President Win Myint.British foreign minister Dominic Raab tweeted his support for the ambassador."We condemn the bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime in London yesterday, and I pay tribute to Kyaw Zwar Minn for his courage," Raab wrote."The UK continues to call for an end to the coup and the appalling violence, and a swift restoration of democracy."Protesters gathered outside the mission on Wednesday evening with the ousted ambassador, who told the Daily Telegraph that "when I left the embassy, they stormed inside the embassy and took it.""They said they received instruction from the capital, so they are not going to let me in," he added, calling on the British government to intervene.Asked who had taken over, he replied: "Defence attache, they occupy my embassy".According to The Times newspaper, the ambassador said the defence attache had sought to install his former deputy, as charge d'affaires.AFP has tried to contact Myanmar's military authorities for comment on the incident, but has not yet received a response.- Heartthrob actor held -Myanmar's security forces have struggled to quell protests and a civil disobedience movement aimed at stopping the military from running the country.They have used rubber bullets and live rounds to break up rallies and used night raids to arrest suspected dissidents.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) says at least 598 civilians have been killed and nearly 2,900 detained.AAPP said that 12 people were killed on Wednesday alone.As part of its efforts to suppress the movement, the junta has issued a wanted notice for some 120 celebrities accused of fanning the protests by lending their support.On Thursday, the military arrested leading actor, model and heartthrob Paing Takhon in a dawn raid at his mother's home in Yangon.The 24-year-old -- a star in both Myanmar and neighbouring Thailand -- has been active in the protest movement both in person at rallies and through his massive social media following.In February, he posted pictures of himself in a white tracksuit with a megaphone, hard hat and a white fluffy dog strapped to his chest at a protest.- UN meeting -International powers have voiced anger and dismay at the junta's brutal approach, but the UN Security Council has stopped short of considering sanctions, with both China and Russia against the move.A group representing the ousted civilian government on Wednesday began talks with UN investigators, saying it had gathered more than 270,000 pieces of evidence showing rights abuses by the junta.A lawyer for the Committee for Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH) -- a group of MPs from Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party -- met the investigators to discuss alleged atrocities.The CRPH says it has evidence of more than 540 extrajudicial executions and 10 deaths of prisoners in custody as well as torture and illegal detentions.The military has defended seizing power, pointing to allegations of voting fraud in the November election which Suu Kyi's party won comfortably, and says it is responding proportionately to the demonstrations.Junta chief General Min Aung Hlaing accused the protesters of wanting to "destroy the country" and said only 248 protesters had been killed, along with 16 police officers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-slams-bullying-myanmar-over-london-embassy-standoff-101617863087694.html
08-04-2021||World||US sanctions Pakistan-based transnational human smuggling network||The US treasury department on Wednesday sanctioned a Pakistan-based transnational human smuggling network that brought in an unspecified number of migrants illegally since at least 2015 - some of whom could pose a national security risk.The sanctions pointed to the possibility of a previously unnoticed South Asian route. The Pakistan-based network, with links to Afghanistan, appears similar to the one operating out of India, which is referred to as the “game” because of the risk of discovery and deportation. They seemingly use similar routes through South American and Central American countries, costing clients ₹25-30 lakh each ($33,596-$40,305) - $20,000 for the Pakistani route, according to the US treasury.Pakistani national Abid Ali Khan is the key figure sanctioned by the US treasury department along with his network, the Abid Ali Khan Transnational Criminal Organisation (TCO). Afghan national Redi Hussein Khal Gul served as Khan’s secretary and Pakistanis Shakeel Karim and Mohammed Choudry Ikram Waraich, who is based in West Asia, took care of the country-hopping travel.“Treasury’s designation of this human smuggling organisation as a significant Transnational Criminal Organisation is an important step, taken alongside our partners, towards disrupting Abid Ali Khan’s operations based in Pakistan and around the world,” said Andrea Gacki, director of the office of foreign assets control.Top homeland security agent in Miami, Anthony Salisbury, who led the investigation, said the Abid Khan network is “exploiting systemic vulnerabilities in order to move people with nefarious motivations into the United States and elsewhere”.The Abid Khan network, run since 2015 according to the US treasury department, started operating in Pakistan and Afghanistan. No specifics were cited about the exit route, nor anything about how the migrants were transported to South America for long and arduous journey over land to the US.“The Abid Ali Khan TCO frequently utilises a common route of travel that begins in Pakistan or Afghanistan, transiting through certain South and Central American countries before arriving at the southern border of the United States,” the US treasury department said in the sanction’s announcement.There is a possibility that Pakistani and Afghan clients of this network could be following a route also used by Indian smugglers.A farmer from Punjab who played the “game” in 2013 for ₹26.5 lakh ($35,596), told HT earlier that he and his group “first flew to Dubai and then to Moscow in Russia”. They never left the airports in both cities.From Moscow, they flew over the Pacific to El Salvador, where Indians can get visas on arrival. It could not be immediately ascertained if this is true also for the Pak-Afghan smuggling route.From the landing point of choice in South America, the trail for Indians takes a somewhat established path. Another Indian migrant who could not pull it off, said he had first landed in Brazil, from where he had worked his way up north through Bolivia, Peru, Ecuador, Columbia, Panama and Costa Rica.Human smuggling of this kind is known to be a lucrative business. “Based on migrants’ accounts of how much they paid smugglers, media reports have estimated Latin American smuggling networks generate at least $150 million and as much as $350 million a year - not counting payments to corrupt officials, local agents or others on the US-Mexico border who exploit the desperation of migrants,” the US treasury department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-sanctions-pakistan-based-transnational-human-smuggling-network-101617862413097.html
08-04-2021||World||Joe Biden likely to extend US troop presence in Afghanistan||Without coming right out and saying it, President Joe Biden seems ready to let lapse a May 1 deadline for completing a withdrawal of US troops from Afghanistan.Orderly withdrawals take time, and Biden is running out of it.Biden has inched so close to the deadline that his indecision amounts almost to a decision to put off, at least for a number of months, a pullout of the remaining 2,500 troops and continue supporting the Afghan military at the risk of a Taliban backlash.Removing all of the troops and their equipment in the next three weeks — along with coalition partners who can't get out on their own — would be difficult logistically, as Biden himself suggested in late March.“It's going to be hard to meet the May 1 deadline,” he said. “Just in terms of tactical reasons, it's hard to get those troops out.” Tellingly, he added, “And if we leave, we're going to do so in a safe and orderly way.”Also Read | In Afghanistan, India must embrace the role of peacemakerJames Stavidis, a retired Navy admiral who served as NATO's top commander from 2009 to 2013, says it would be unwise at this point to get out quickly.“Sometimes not making a decision becomes a decision, which seems the case with the May 1 deadline,” Stavidis said in an email exchange Wednesday.“The most prudent course of action feels like a six-month extension and an attempt to get the Taliban truly meeting their promises — essentially permitting a legitimate conditions based' withdrawal in the fall.”There are crosscurrents of pressure on Biden. On the one hand, he has argued for years, including during his time as vice president, when President Barack Obama ordered a huge buildup of US forces, that Afghanistan is better handled as a smaller-scale counterterrorism mission. Countering Russia and China has since emerged as a higher priority.On the other hand, current and former military officers have argued that leaving now, with the Taliban in a position of relative strength and the Afghan government in a fragile state, would risk losing what has been gained in 20 years of fighting.Also Read | In Kabul, be ready for political uncertainty"A withdrawal would not only leave America more vulnerable to terrorist threats; it would also have catastrophic effects in Afghanistan and the region that would not be in the interest of any of the key actors, including the Taliban,” a bipartisan experts group known as the Afghan Study Group concluded in a February report.The group, whose co-chair, retired Gen Joseph Dunford, is a former commander of US forces in Afghanistan and former chairman of the Joint Chiefs, recommended Biden extend the deadline beyond May, preferably with some sort of agreement by the Taliban.If the troops stay, Afghanistan will become Biden's war. His decisions, now and in coming months, could determine the legacy of a 2001 US invasion that was designed as a response to al-Qaida's Sept. 11 attacks, for which the extremist group led by Osama bin Laden used Afghanistan as a haven.Biden said during the 2020 campaign that if elected he might keep a counterterrorism force in Afghanistan but also would “end the war responsibly” to ensure US forces never have to return. The peace talks that began last fall between the Taliban and the Afghan government are seen as the best hope, but they have produced little so far.Postponing the US withdrawal carries the risk of the Taliban resuming attacks on US and coalition forces, possibly escalating the war. In a February 2020 agreement with the administration of President Donald Trump, the Taliban agreed to halt such attacks and hold peace talks with the Afghan government, in exchange for a US commitment to a complete withdrawal by May 2021.When he entered the White House in January, Biden knew of the looming deadline and had time to meet it if he had chosen to do so. It became a steep logistical hurdle only because he put off a decision in favour of consulting at length inside his administration and with allies.Flying thousands of troops and their equipment out of Afghanistan in the next three weeks under the potential threat of Taliban resistance is not technically impossible, although it would appear to violate Biden's promise not to rush.Biden undertook a review of the February 2020 agreement shortly after taking office, and as recently as Tuesday aides said he was still contemplating a way ahead in Afghanistan. White House press secretary Jen Psaki stressed that May 1 was a deadline set by the prior administration and that a decision was complicated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-likely-to-extend-us-troop-presence-in-afghanistan-101617857732867.html
08-04-2021||World||US expects 'difficult and long' conversations with Iran on nuclear programme||The US has said that it expects that the indirect talks with Iran on its nuclear programme in Vienna will be difficult and a long process.The European Union-brokered Iran nuclear talks, which began in Vienna on Tuesday, is being attended by diplomats from the UK, China, France, Germany, Russia and Tehran.The US and Iran last week said that they would begin negotiations through intermediaries in a bid to get both the countries back into the landmark 2015 nuclear accord which limits Tehran’s atomic programme. Former president Donald Trump pulled the US out of the deal in 2018.As the key talks began in Vienna, White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters at her daily news conference, “We expect this to be -- these conversations to be difficult. We expect this to be a long process. And we're very much at just the beginning period.”Special envoy Robert Malley is leading the US in the indirect talks with Iran that are being conducted by the European Union.“The talks are continuing today in Vienna. It’s only the second day of talks. You may have seen a tweet from one of the European officials attending who called this -- said, “There's unity and ambition,” and that was their description of the conversations,” she said.“This is just a constructive early step. We're at the early part of the process here. The primary issues, as you know, that will be discussed are both steps that would need to be taken for Iran to come back into compliance and the sanctions relief steps that the United States would need to take,” Psaki said.State Department Spokesperson Ned Price on Tuesday said that he does not expect any immediate breakthrough."We recognise this to be potentially the start of a process, knowing that we do have a long – a potentially long road ahead. We’ve always said this will be hard, and I think that’s also worth underscoring. It will be hard for several reasons. It will be hard because of logistics. These talks are indirect, and as a result, the mechanics of them can be cumbersome. It will be hard because these are very technical and complex issues,” he said.These are not strategic talks, he said.The American team on the ground in Vienna has had consultations with European allies as well as with Russian and Chinese partners. They in turn have met with the Iranian delegation, he said.“So in all of this, we have heard more about Iran's position. Our partners have in turn heard from us more about our position, which they have then relayed to the Iranians. And in short, this is what we had hoped to accomplish at the outset, really nothing more and nothing less,” Price said.Under the 2015 nuclear deal, Iran had agreed to greatly limit its nuclear programme through 2025. However, Trump argued that this gave the Iranians a pathway to nuclear weapons.The 2015 accord is aimed at preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Tehran denies it is seeking such an arsenal.Iran has stepped up its nuclear work in violation of the accord after US sanctions were reimposed as part of Trump's "maximum pressure" policy to weaken the Iranian regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-expects-difficult-and-long-conversations-with-iran-on-nuclear-programme-101617858409694.html
08-04-2021||World||Jill Biden shines fresh spotlight on military family programme||Jill Biden on Wednesday delivered on her promise to prioritise the struggles of military families by reviving a decade-old initiative that challenged Americans to do something as simple as mow the lawn or drop off a meal for a family with a loved one in the armed forces.Biden said military families are as important to the United States as a rudder is to a ship and that national security will be served by attending to their physical, social and emotional health.“How can we hope to keep our military strong if we don't give our families, survivors and caregivers what they need to thrive?" she asked at the White House.Biden said the reiteration of Joining Forces , education for the more than 2 million children of enlisted parents and veterans, and the overall health and well-being of these families.Just 1 per cent of the country serves in the all-volunteer military, she said. She also cited a Defense Department estimate of a 22 per cent unemployment rate for military spouses.Some military spouses face employment headaches after moves to a new base in a new state, especially in professions that require licensing, which ends up costing time and money. They and their children can have trouble adjusting to a new home or school, or making new friends.“Service members cannot be focused on their mission if their families don't have what they need to thrive at home,” said the first lady, who is the daughter and mother of service members. “And we can't expect to keep the best and brightest if our service members are forced to choose between their love of country and the hopes and dreams they have for their families.”“We have to help you carry this weight," she said.She cited commitments from the departments of Defense, Education and Labour, saying the work was just beginning. “Our effort will take all of our government working together, and we expect every agency to step up and be part of it," she said.The first lady was joined virtually Wednesday by military families, advocates and others from around the world, a total of more than 100 people appearing in individual boxes on screens behind her on the stage at the White House.She later visited the Military OneSource call center, a Department of Defense-funded operation that provides a range of counseling and other support for services for members and their families 24 hours a day, seven days a week.Biden toured the facility in Arlington, Virginia, one of three locations around the country, and listened to a military spouse and a member of the Army offer testimonials about the guidance they received after they sought assistance from Military OneSource."Thanks for helping our military members and their families," she said after meeting some of the workers who answer the calls. “I don't know if people thank you enough.”She spent her first weeks as first lady conducting listening sessions with the spouses of senior Defense Department officials and military leaders, military family advocates and military children. Last month, she toured US bases in Washington state and California, where she met with families and students.She had promised during the 2020 presidential campaign to revive Joining Forces. Shortly before President Joe Biden took office, the first lady named Rory Brosius as the initiative's executive director. Brosius previously served as the program's deputy director.Jill Biden's father, Donald Jacobs, was a Navy signalman in World War II who went to college on the GI Bill. Her late son, Beau, a father of two children, served in the Delaware Army National Guard, including a year in Iraq. Beau Biden died of brain cancer in 2015 at age 46.Jill Biden's other causes are education and cancer research. She is a longtime English professor at community colleges.Joining Forces was rolled out in 2011 under President Barack Obama's administration and was led by then-first lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden, when Joe Biden was vice president. The mission was to encourage the public and private sectors to support service members, veterans, their families and their caregivers with a focus on education, employment and wellness.After leaving the White House in 2017, Jill Biden continued to work with military families through the Biden Foundation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jill-biden-shines-fresh-spotlight-on-military-family-programme-101617853164670.html
08-04-2021||World||US begins study assessing allergic reactions to Pfizer, Moderna Covid vaccines||US' National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced on Wednesday that it is launching a study to determine the risk of allergic reactions to the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines among certain individuals.A clinical trial is underway to determine whether people who are highly allergic or have a mast cell disorder are at increased risk for an immediate and systemic allergic reaction to the Moderna or Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines."The public understandably has been concerned about reports of rare, severe allergic reactions to the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines," said Anthony S Fauci, MD, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health. "The information gathered during this trial will help doctors advise people who are highly allergic or have a mast cell disorder about the risks and benefits of receiving these two vaccines. However, for most people, the benefits of COVID-19 vaccination far outweigh the risks."Data from the study, which is sponsored and funded by the NIAID, is expected to be released in late summer.The study team will enroll 3,400 adults aged between 18 and 69 years at up to 35 academic allergy-research centres nationwide. About 60 percent of study participants, group 1, must have either a history of severe allergic reactions or a diagnosis of a mast cell disorder, while 40 per cent of participants, group 2, will not.Study staff will collect blood, urine and nasal swabs from participants before each injection, and blood and urine after each injection.If a significant number of systemic allergic reactions to either or both vaccines occur during the trial, investigators will analyse these biological samples to examine possible mechanisms for the reactions and whether certain genetic patterns are associated with higher risk.The Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccines are the first two coronavirus vaccines authorised by the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use and already have been given to millions of Americans.Most of the rare, severe allergic reactions to these vaccines have occurred in people with a history of allergies. A substantial number of these people had previously experienced a life-threatening allergic reaction called anaphylaxis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-begins-study-assessing-allergic-reactions-to-pfizer-moderna-covid-vaccines-101617852906762.html

It is saving lives.”In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed support for a snap lockdown to stem rising cases.Hard-hit France imposed tighter measures this week, while Ukraine reported record new fatalities and hospitalisations despite tightening measures.AstraZeneca’s UK vaccine trial on children pausedVaccinations of children in a study of the Covid-19 shot developed by AstraZeneca and the University of Oxford have been paused. No safety issues have arisen in the children’s trial, the university has said.The action comes after a growing number of reports of rare brain blood clots in younger adults have led some countries, including several in the EU, to suspend use of the vaccine in certain age groups.Germany halted use of the Astra-Oxford vaccine for people younger than 60 last week, while Canada has limited its use to those more than 55 years old.CDC: Strain found in UK is most common in USA variant of the coronavirus first identified in Britain is now the most common strain circulating in the US. The director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Dr Rochelle Walensky, said the strain, known as B.1.1.7, is “now the most common lineage circulating in United States”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-eu-regulator-says-az-clot-risk-rare-as-countries-battle-surges-101617848844251.html
08-04-2021||World||Covid-19 prevalence in UK dropped in March, but decline flattening off: Study||The prevalence of Covid-19 infections in England dropped steeply in March, a closely watched survey said on Thursday, but in a note of caution it also showed that the drop in infections had slowed.The REACT study, run by Imperial College London, found that infections fell by approximately 60% from the last study in February, with only 1 in 500 people infected.However, the study found that the speed of decline started to plateau in mid-March. Schools reopened on March 8, and Covid-19 restrictions will be loosened further next week, with the reopening of all shops and outdoor hospitality venues."We have seen a gratifying fall in infections since our last survey in February... This is hugely encouraging and shows we’re headed in the right direction," Paul Elliott, director of the REACT programme, said."However, in our most recent data there has been a flattening off in the infection rate with an R (reproduction) number now around one. This shows that we need to continue to approach the situation with caution and keep sticking to the rules."Overall, national prevalence in England dropped from 0.49% in February to 0.20% in March.The REACT study is one of the biggest Covid-19 surveys of its kind in England, with over 140,000 volunteers tested in England between March 11 and March 30 in the latest round.The study found that the correlation between infections and deaths was diverging, possibly an effect of Britain's Covid-19 vaccination programme, which has seen over 31 million people receive a first Covid-19 vaccine dose."These findings are promising and illustrate the significant impact that lockdown, combined with our phenomenal vaccination programme, is having on the prevalence of this dreadful virus," health minister Matt Hancock said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-prevalence-in-uk-dropped-in-march-but-decline-flattening-off-study-101617841725050.html
08-04-2021||World||UK variant of Covid-19 now most common strain in United States, says CDC||The highly contagious variant of Covid-19 first discovered in the United Kingdom has become the most common strain of the virus in the United States as cases continue to climb, a top U.S. health official said on Wednesday.The strain, known as B.1.1.7, was identified in Britain last fall and has since been detected in 52 jurisdictions in the United States, U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky told reporters at a White House briefing.U.S. public health officials have urged Americans to get vaccinated as soon as possible in part to prevent new variants of the novel coronavirus from spreading.The United States has also detected cases of a variant first discovered in South Africa that is thought to be resistant to some Covid-19 vaccines and treatments. That strain has been found in 36 U.S. jurisdictions, according to federal data last updated on Tuesday.The United States is administering about 3 million Covid-19 vaccine doses per day on average over the past week, up 8% over the previous seven-day average, Walensky said.Vaccine supply has increased significantly in the United States in recent weeks as Johnson & Johnson has begun making millions of doses of its recently authorized shots. Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna have also recently boosted their vaccine production capacity.U.S. President Joe Biden has doubled his goal for shots administered in his first 100 days in office from 100 million to 200 million and urged states to begin giving shots to all adults by mid-April.Still, daily U.S. cases of novel coronavirus are averaging 63,000 over the past seven days, up 2.3% from the previous seven-day average, Walensky said.Walensky said that the CDC has identified a number of Covid-19 outbreaks tied to youth sporting events and that communities experiencing high case counts should avoid holding such events. Testing should also happen twice a week, she said.White House Covid-19 adviser Andy Slavitt also told reporters that the U.S. government is expanding its community health center program, which it set up in recent weeks to help get vaccines into underserved communities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-variant-of-covid-19-now-most-common-strain-in-united-states-says-cdc-101617840857859.html
08-04-2021||World||Scientists call for new investigation into Covid-19 origins: Report||A group of international scientists called for a new investigation into the origins of Covid-19 on Wednesday after China and the World Health Organization (WHO) released a scrutinized report last week concluding that the virus most likely came from wildlife instead of a laboratory.Twenty-four scientists from Europe, the US, Australia and Japan issued an open letter, which was obtained by The New York Times, that analyzed steps to complete a more comprehensive investigation, as reported by The Hill."Calling for a full investigation into the origins of the pandemic by the best available means is not intended to point fingers at any one country. Its purpose is to leave no stone unturned in seeking to understand how this catastrophe began so we can prioritize efforts to address our greatest shortcomings for the benefit of all people and all nations," the letter read.The Hill reported that the letter, which followed a previous open letter criticizing the WHO report, pointed out that "critical records and biological samples that could provide essential insights into pandemic origins remain inaccessible."The scientists requested a probe involving biosecurity and biosafety experts conducted either by WHO or another group of nations to study the origins of Covid-19, which was first reported in Wuhan, China, in 2019.The WHO report determined that the possibility the virus came from a lab was "extremely unlikely," noting there was "no record" any lab had closely related viruses.Jamie Metzl, an author, senior fellow of the Atlantic Council, an international policy think tank and signatory of the scientists' letter, said the renewed calls for a more thorough investigation reflected the need for greater monitoring of and restrictions on what viruses can be studied in labs around the world."This is not about ganging up on China," Metzl said according to The New York Times.WHO Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said later that the mission's consideration of a possible lab leak was not "extensive enough."Metzl said he couldn't agree more and said that in the future, such a review should include US labs. But, he said, the pandemic is of utmost urgency and he wants to start right away with China."It absolutely makes sense to establish a global regulatory system overseeing aggressive work with dangerous or deadly pathogens everywhere," he said.India, last week, said that it fully supports the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom's expectation that future collaborative studies will include more timely and comprehensive data sharing but raised concerns over China's delaying tactics and lack of access to "complete, original data and samples".Tedros, who has been accused of complacency towards China, hardened his tone acknowledging the concerns about China's refusal to share raw data about early Covid-19 cases.The United States, Australia, Canada, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia and Israel said in a statement that they "fully" supported the WHO's efforts to bring an end to the pandemic, including understanding how it "started and spread".But they added it was "essential that we voice our shared concerns that the international expert study on the source of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was significantly delayed and lacked access to complete, original data and samples".US Department of State Spokesperson Ned Price on Wednesday (local time) said that what is evident from Washington's review of the report is that it lacks crucial data, it lacks information, and it lacks access. "It represents a picture that is partial and, in our view, incomplete. That's not just our view. Many other countries share that view," he said during a briefing.China has been criticised widely across the world for its role in the spread of the novel coronavirus that has infected over 132 million people across the world. More than 2.8 million people have lost their lives to the virus, as per Johns Hopkins University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/scientists-call-for-new-investigation-into-covid-19-origins-report-101617841407868.html
08-04-2021||World||Brazil detects first case of South African Covid-19 variant||Brazil has recorded its first confirmed case of the highly contagious coronavirus variant discovered in South Africa, a fresh danger sign for a country already ravaged by the world's worst daily death toll and scrambling to make space for burials.Scientists warned on Wednesday that yet another new variant could be emerging in Brazil's inland city of Belo Horizonte.The Federal University of Minas Gerais said in a statement that two samples taken in the city included a previously unseen set of 18 mutations, including some in the same genes modified by the South African variant and Brazil's already prevalent variant, known as P.1.The detection of additional variants adds to concerns that a brutal Covid-19 wave battering Brazil may keep breaking grim records for weeks to come. On Tuesday, the health Ministry reported a single-day record of 4,195 deaths, followed by another 3,829 fatalities on Wednesday.Sao Paulo, the country's biggest city, on Wednesday said it would begin opening some 600 new graves per day, well beyond the record of 426 burials in a day on March 30. The city is also preparing plans for a "vertical cemetery," a crypt with 26,000 drawer-like graves that can be built in 90 days once approved.The outbreak in South America's largest country may overtake the United States to become the world's deadliest, some medical experts predict.The woman in Sao Paulo state now confirmed as infected by the South African virus variant was first identified by the Butantan biomedical institute as a possible case of a new local variant. Further analysis confirmed it as the first known local case of the variant widely circulating in South Africa and elsewhere.Scientists fear a showdown between the South African variant and Brazil's P.1 variant, both of which are more contagious and possibly more deadly than the original version of the coronavirus, worsening Covid-19 surges."It could be a huge duel," said Maria Carolina Sabbaga, one of Butantan's coordinators for studying new variants. "I think P.1 has already taken over. I'm not sure if the South African will overtake P.1, let's see."The South African variant in studies appears to lessen protection from current vaccines.José Patané, a Butantan researcher, said the variant most likely arrived in Brazil after traveling through Europe toward the end of 2020.The first local diagnosis, a woman in her 30s in the city of Sorocaba, had not traveled abroad or come into contact with someone who did, indicating local community transmission, researchers said.SLOW VACCINE ROLLOUTA possible surge of the South African variant could further complicate Brazil's slow vaccine rollout.Brazil's Covid-19 immunization program is built around the vaccines from AstraZeneca Plc and China's Sinovac Biotech Ltd, which have proven effective against the Brazilian variant in preliminary studies, according to officials.Research released on Wednesday showed the Sinovac shot was 50% effective at preventing symptomatic Covid-19 in a study of nearly 68,000 health workers in Manaus, where the P.1 strain first emerged as the predominant variant. The results support preliminary findings of separate research reported by Reuters last month.Immunizations have been slow to ramp up in Brazil after the government dragged its feet last year in acquiring vaccines while other countries raced to secure supplies.President Jair Bolsonaro has shifted his tone on vaccines, touting shots he had until recently disdained. But the far-right former army captain still opposes social distancing and mask requirements that health experts see as essential for curbing virus transmission.Under pressure from business leaders desperate to vaccinate their workforces and reopen operations, the lower house of Congress approved a controversial bill to allow private-sector vaccine purchases. After the lower house concluded voting on amendments Wednesday, the bill will now go to the Senate for consideration.The proposal would allow businesses to acquire vaccines to inoculate their employees as long as they donate the same number of shots to the public health system. Under current rules, businesses could only do that once the country has fully vaccinated risk groups outlined in a national immunization plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-detects-first-case-of-south-african-covid-19-variant-101617840468873.html

They, in turn, have met with the Iranian delegation," he said.Sputnik reported that a US delegation is attending an in-person meeting by the JCPOA members in Vienna to discuss steps needed to fully restore the nuclear agreement.The US representatives had meetings with counterparts from China, France, Germany, Russia and the United Kingdom, but are not expected to engage in direct talks with Iran's team.In 2015, Iran signed the JCPOA with the P5 1 group of countries. The agreement required Iran to scale back its nuclear program and downgrade its uranium reserves in exchange for sanctions relief. In 2018, the US withdrew from the JCPOA and began imposing sanctions on Iran in violation of the nuclear agreement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-prepared-to-lift-sanctions-imposed-on-iran-inconsistent-with-jcpoa-101617840322508.html

Most of the cases were in women aged under 60.But EMA chief Emer Cooke said no particular risk factor had been identified and the clots may be linked to an immune response to the vaccine."The benefits of the AstraZeneca vaccine in preventing Covid-19 overall outweigh the risk of side effects," she told a news conference."It is saving lives."- 'Plausible but not confirmed' -The World Health Organization's vaccine experts on Wednesday echoed EMA's findings, saying a causal relationship between the vaccine and blood clots was "plausible but is not confirmed"."We believe the benefit-risk balance is very much in favour of the vaccine," said the WHO in response to an AFP query.AstraZeneca itself said two studies by British and European regulators "reaffirmed" that the benefits of its vaccine "far outweigh the risks".Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands are among countries not recommending the shot for younger people.Britain's decision to offer an alternative jab if possible to most people under 30 came after data showed 79 blood clots and 19 deaths among people who had received one of 20 million AstraZeneca doses administered in the UK.AstraZeneca's vaccine has been administered in at least 111 countries, more than any of its rivals, according to AFP data. It is being used both in wealthier countries and poor nations, largely as part of the Covax scheme to ensure equitable access to vaccines.The controversy surrounding the jab has marred a global vaccine rollout that will help countries emerge from a pandemic that has ravaged the world's economy and subjected much of humanity to some form of confinement.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed support for a snap lockdown to stem rising cases, after decentralised measures failed to quell outbreaks.Hard-hit France imposed tighter measures this week, as French Open organisers announced the tennis tournament would be delayed by one week until May 30 in the hopes of accomodating more fans.Ukraine on Wednesday reported record new deaths and hospitalisations after tightening measures in the capital.Canada's most populous province of Ontario was ordered into a four-week lockdown, while Qatar reimposed strict measures.India, which registered a 24-hour record of almost 116,000 new cases on Wednesday, said it too would rollout tougher curbs with new curfews in place in 20 cities, including the capital New Delhi.Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro however doubled down on his opposition to lockdown measures, despite the country registering its deadliest day yet on Tuesday with more than 4,000 deaths."We're not going to accept these policies of 'stay home, close everything, lock down,'" he said.- Amnesty slams hoarding -Australia was facing vaccine woes of its own, after just 700,000 of a contracted 3.8 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine were delivered.Prime Minister Scott Morrison blamed the EU for the shortages, accusing the bloc of "strict export controls".More than 694 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered globally, according to an AFP tally, with just a handful of countries leading the pack by a wide margin.Israel has inoculated 61 percent of its people with one dose, while the US has administered 33 percent with a first shot.Amnesty International said in its annual report that wealthy countries are failing a test of global solidarity by hoarding Covid vaccines.Echoing calls to help hard-hit nations, G20 finance ministers and central bankers agreed to extend a moratorium on debt interest payments for the poorest countries.Meanwhile in the United Kingdom, where around 60 percent of adults have received a first dose, health workers started rolling out the Moderna jab, the third approved after AstraZeneca and Pfizer."I'm an unpaid carer for my grandmother so it is very important to me that I get it, so I can care for her properly and safely," said 24-year-old Elle Taylor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-clot-risk-very-rare-says-eu-regulator-as-nations-battle-covid-19-surge-101617839918848.html

The EMA insisted that the benefits of the shot still largely outweigh the risks.Nevertheless, Belgium imposed a ban on administering it to younger people.“We will keep it this way for the next four weeks and reassess it then,” said Belgian Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke.

The group focuses on tightening gun control measures.Chipman was a special agent for the ATF for 25 years. During his career with the bureau, he disrupted a gun trafficking ring that operated between Virginia and New York City and became special agent in charge of the ATF’s firearms programs, according to his biography on Giffords.“It is far too easy for violent people to get their hands on deadly weapons,” Chipman said at a September 2019 congressional hearing. “The American people overwhelmingly want Congress to act now to make their communities safer. Assault weapons are a class of semiautomatic firearms originally intended for military use designed to kill people quickly and efficiently. These weapons are often the weapon of choice for mass shooters.”Chipman would have to win Senate confirmation to assume the role of ATF director. Giffords’ husband is Senator Mark Kelly, an Arizona Democrat who was elected in November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-taps-gun-control-backer-as-alcohol-ttobacco-firearms-boss-101617838994504.html
08-04-2021||World||Trump's tariffs on China helped protect US jobs: Commerce Secretary Raimondo||US Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said on Wednesday that steel and aluminum tariffs imposed by former President Donald Trump's administration have helped protect jobs in the United States and she will aggressively use all available tools to counter China's unfair trade practices going forward.Speaking at a White House Briefing, Raimondo said that President Joe Biden's American Jobs plan is to "make sure that every American has the opportunity to get a decent well-paying job with dignity.""It's a historic investment in America intended to create tens of millions of jobs, rebuild our country's infrastructure, and position the United States to out-compete China... We need to play offense and defense. The jobs package is offense -- investment in America so that we can play offense. A lot of the tools that commerce has are defense; entities lists, tariffs, etc... We are in the middle of an overall review on the China policy," she said."My broad view is that what we do on offense, is more important than what we need to do on the defense. In order to compete with China, we need to rebuild America... We have to work with our allies and find common ground where we can," the secretary added."The 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum have in fact helped save American jobs in steel and aluminum industries. So what do with the tariffs? We have to now level the playing field. No one can now out-compete the American worker if the playing field is leveled," she said furtherRaimondo emphasized that she will use all available tools in her power to aggressively protect US jobs from unfair trade practices by China."China's actions are uncompetitive, conversive, underhanded. They have proven that they will do whatever it takes. I plan to use all the tools in my toolbox as aggressively as possible to protect American workers and businesses from unfair Chinese practices," the commerce secretary said.The Commerce Department had overseen the restrictions on China via an "Entity List" created by the Trump administration. It was responsible for broad national-security-based tariffs the United States imposed on steel and aluminum from key trading partners, including the European Union, as reported by Sputnik.Toward the end of his term last year, then-President Trump also went after Chinese social media and payment applications TikTok and WeChat, trying to force their sale to US entities. Those moves were later struck down by US courts.Under the Trump administration, ties between the two countries had deteriorated over issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang, encroachment on the special status of Hong Kong, accusations of unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China's military aggression in various parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumps-tariffs-on-china-helped-protect-us-jobs-commerce-secretary-raimondo-101617838573030.html

British authorities recommended that people under 30 be offered alternatives to AstraZeneca. But the EMA advised no such age restrictions, leaving it up to its member-countries to decide whether to limit its use.Several countries have already imposed limits on who can receive the vaccine, and any restrictions are closely watched since the vaccine, which is cheaper and easier to store than many others, is critical to global immunization campaigns and is a pillar of the UN-backed program known as COVAX that aims to get vaccines to some of the world’s poorest countries.“This is a course correction, there’s no question about that,” Jonathan Van-Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said during a news briefing.Van-Tam said the effect on Britain’s vaccination timetable — one of the speediest in the world — should be “zero or negligible,” assuming the National Health Service receives expected deliveries of other vaccines, including those produced by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.EU and UK regulators held simultaneous news conferences Wednesday to announce the results of investigations into reports of blood clots that sparked concern about the rollout of the AstraZeneca vaccine.The EU agency described the clots as “very rare” side effects. Dr Sabine Straus, chair of its Safety Committee, said the best data was from Germany, where there was one report of the clots for every 100,000 doses given, although she noted far fewer reports in the UK. Still, that’s less than the clot risk that healthy women face from birth control pills, noted another expert, Dr. Peter Arlett.The agency said most of the cases reported were in women under 60 within two weeks of vaccination, though it was unable to identify specific risk factors based on current information. Experts reviewed several dozen cases that came mainly from Europe and the UK, where around 25 million people have received the AstraZeneca vaccine.“The risk of mortality from Covid is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects,” said Emer Cooke, the EMA's executive director.Arlett said there is no information suggesting an increased risk from the other major Covid-19 vaccines.In a statement, AstraZeneca said both UK and EU regulators had requested their vaccine labels be updated to warn of these “extremely rare potential side effect(s).”“Both of these reviews reaffirmed the vaccine offers a high-level of protection against all severities of Covid-19 and that these benefits continue to far outweigh the risks,” it said.The EMA’s investigation focused on unusual types of blood clots that have occurred along with low blood platelets. One rare clot type appears in multiple blood vessels and the other in veins that drain blood from the brain.“We are not advising a stop to any vaccination for any individual in any age group,” said Wei Shen Lim, who chairs Britain’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization. “We are advising a preference for one vaccine over another vaccine for a particular age group ... out of the utmost caution rather than because we have any serious safety concerns.”In March, more than a dozen countries, mostly in Europe, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the EMA said countries should continue using the vaccine.Britain, which relies heavily on AstraZeneca, however, continued to use it.The suspensions were seen as particularly damaging for AstraZeneca because they came after repeated missteps in how the company reported data on the vaccine's effectiveness and concerns over how well its shot worked in older people. That has led to frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine, raising worries that AstraZeneca’s credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic.Dr. Peter English, who formerly chaired the British Medical Association’s Public Health Medicine Committee, said the back-and-forth over the AstraZeneca vaccine could have serious consequences.“We can’t afford not to use this vaccine if we are going to end the pandemic,” he said.In some countries, authorities have already noted hesitancy toward the AstraZeneca shot.“People come and they are reluctant to take the AstraZeneca vaccine, they ask us if we also use anything else,” said Florentina Nastase, a doctor and coordinator at a vaccination center in Bucharest, Romania. “There were cases in which people didn’t show up, there were cases when people came to the center and saw that we use only AstraZeneca and refused (to be inoculated).”Meanwhile, the governor of Italy’s northern Veneto region said earlier Wednesday that any decision to change the guidance on AstraZeneca would cause major disruptions to immunizations — at a time when Europe is already struggling to ramp them up — and could create more confusion about the shot.“Put yourself in the place of citizens — it is hard to understand anything,” Luca Zaia told reporters.The latest suspension of AstraZeneca came in Spain's Castilla y León region, where health chief Verónica Casado said Wednesday that “the principle of prudence” drove her to put a temporary hold on the vaccine that she still backed as being both effective and necessary.On Wednesday, South Korea said it would temporarily suspend the use of AstraZeneca’s vaccine in people 60 and younger. In that age group, the country is only currently vaccinating health workers and people in long-term care settings.Officials in Italy and Spain also said Wednesday that AstraZeneca would be recommended for people over 60 years of age.After the EMA's announcement, Belgium's health minister, Frank Vandenbroucke, declared a four-week ban on administering the AstraZeneca vaccine to people under 56, but said that would have little impact on the vaccination campaign, since few from that age group are in line to get the shots this month.“For the vast majority of people the benefits of the Oxford AZ vaccine far outweigh any extremely small risk,'' said Dr. Anthony Harnden, the deputy chair of Britain’s vaccination committee. "And the Oxford AZ vaccine will continue to save many from suffering the devastating effects that can result from a Covid infection.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-advises-limiting-astrazeneca-vaccine-in-under-30s-amid-blood-clot-worry-101617833330096.html
08-04-2021||World||Former US Vice President Mike Pence memoir set for 2023 release||Former Vice President Mike Pence has a book deal. His autobiography, currently untitled, is scheduled to come out in 2023.“I am grateful to have the opportunity to tell the story of my life in public service to the American people, from serving in Congress, to the Indiana Governor’s office and as Vice President of the United States,” Pence said in a statement. “I look forward to working with the outstanding team at Simon & Schuster to invite readers on a journey from a small town in Indiana to Washington, DC.”According to Pence’s agent, David Vigiliano, “all major publishers” competed for the book, and the deal was worth “well into seven figures.” A top editor from a rival publishing house confirmed that amount. The editor was not authorized to discuss negotiations and asked not to be identified.Simon & Schuster announced Wednesday that it also signed Pence to a second book but did not immediately provide details. Pence is the first major Trump administration official to have an announced deal since the president left office in January, although former White House advisor Kellyanne Conway and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo are among those reportedly working on books.At this time in 2017, former President Barack Obama; former first lady Michelle Obama; former Vice President Joe Biden and his wife, Jill Biden; and former Secretary of State John Kerry were among the recently departed Obama administration officials who had agreed to book deals. Several top publishing executives have told The Associated Press that they were not interested in a Trump memoir, citing the siege of the US Capitol on Jan. 6 by Trump’s supporters. Publishers also have expressed wariness about other members of the Trump administration, worrying about a backlash from readers, authors and employees.A Pence memoir will likely be subject to similar tensions the former Vice President has faced since he refused then-President Donald Trump’s demands that he help overturn the election results. Among Democrats and others who opposed Trump, Pence is widely seen as Trump’s loyal and complicit ally. Meanwhile, Trump supporters, and Trump himself, denounced him for not intervening Jan. 6 in Congress’ formal certification of Biden’s presidential victory.The certification — which Pence had no power to change — was delayed for hours after hundreds of Trump supporters, some chanting “Hang Mike Pence,” stormed the US Capitol.Simon & Schuster Vice President and Publisher Dana Canedy said that Pence’s book would be “revelatory,” without specifically saying whether he would address the events of Jan. 6.“Vice President Pence’s life and work, his journey as a Christian, the challenges and triumphs he has faced, and the lessons he has learned, tells an American story of extraordinary public service during a time of unrivaled public interest in our government and politics,” Canedy said. “His revelatory autobiography will be the definitive book on one of the most consequential presidencies in American history.”A Simon & Schuster spokesperson declined comment on what Pence planned to say about Jan. 6, and referred back to Canedy’s statement.The signing of Pence comes three months after Simon & Schuster dropped a book by Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri, who had supported the rally in Washington which preceded the overrunning of the Capitol. Simon & Schuster has published several anti-Trump books over the past two years, including former National Security Advisor John Bolton’s “The Room Where It Happened” and niece Mary Trump’s “Too Much and Never Enough.” Its other authors have included Trump supporter Sean Hannity; the candidate Trump defeated in 2016, Hillary Clinton, and Trump himself.Pence's book deal continues the former vice president's re-emergence since January. On Wednesday, he launched an advocacy group, Advancing American Freedom, which will promote the Trump administration's record and could serve as a springboard for a Pence presidential run in 2024. The advisory board includes anti-abortion rights advocate Marjorie Dannenfelser and Ed Meese, who was President Ronald Reagan’s attorney general, and such former Trump administration officials as Conway, economic adviser Larry Kudlow and U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-us-vice-president-mike-pence-memoir-set-for-2023-release-101617833085135.html

They are from the Myanmar military," he said."They said they received instruction from the capital, so they are not going to let me in," he added."They are not able to do this. The British government won't allow this one, you'll see that."Britain's Foreign Office would not confirm or deny the reports.Metropolitan Police said that they were "aware of a protest" outside the building in the Mayfair neighbourhood, and that public order officers were in attendance.Britain has been a strong critic of the Myanmar military since it seized power there in February, and last week ramped up sanctions against business conglomerates wholly or partially overseen by generals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protests-after-reports-myanmar-military-stormed-london-embassy-101617824905385.html

This would be the first visit by a top Japanese leader to India since the Covid-19 outbreak last year, and also the first since a planned summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his former Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in Guwahati in December 2019 was called off because of protests against the Citizenship (Amendment) Act. Modi and Suga have spoken several times on phone amid the pandemic and also participated in the first virtual summit of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad on March 12 along with US President Joe Biden and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Both India and Japan are committed to efforts to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific and this is expected to be a key part of the agenda for Suga’s visit, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. The exact dates for Suga’s visit are being finalised through diplomatic channels though a final decision will also hinge on the Covid-19 situation, the people said. Like India, which has been engaged in a standoff with China on the Line of Actual Control (LAC) for almost a year, Japan has its own concerns over aggressive Chinese actions in the waters off Senkaku Islands in the East China Sea. The joint statement issued after the Quad Summit has said the four members of the group will “facilitate collaboration, including in maritime security, to meet challenges to the rules-based maritime order in the East and South China Seas”. Japan has invested ₹1,600 crore in development projects across India’s northeastern states and is also working closely with India on infrastructure projects in third countries such as Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. India and Japan also signed the Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) last September for reciprocal provision of supplies and services between their defence forces. Suga, who will visit Washington for talks with Biden on April 16, is keen to bolster cooperation with the US, Australia and India to counter China’s growing assertiveness in the region, the people said. Suga is also expected to visit the Philippines, which too has been coping with China’s aggressive actions in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/to-bolster-cooperation-in-indo-pacific-and-counter-china-japan-pm-suga-to-visit-india-101617820289620.html
