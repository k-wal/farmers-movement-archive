The Indian assistance was a consignment of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine sent in 2020 at the request of then US president Donald Trump.US Secretary of defence Lloyd Austin tweeted a video of a US C-17 transport plane landing in New Delhi with relief supplies. “The landing of this C-17 in Delhi is a tribute to all of the women and men who banded together to deliver medical & oxygen supplies to our friends and partners in India. Great job.”The United States had pledged assistance worth $100 millions, which includes oxygen plants and cylinders, personal protective equipment such as N95 mass and therapeutics like remdesivir. It has also cleared the export of raw materials needed by Indian vaccine maker Serum Institute of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-steps-up-efforts-to-support-india-s-covid-fight-101619803669119.html
30-04-2021||World||Fired 65 employees for racist, discriminatory conduct over the last year: Boeing||Boeing Co said on Friday it fired 65 employees over the last year for engaging in or being part of racist, discriminatory or hateful conduct.In a company-wide report that reveals the first demographic breakdown of its workforce, the planemaker said the employees were terminated between June 2020 and April 21, 2021.American companies have come under pressure from investors to publicly disclose information about diversity among employees in the wake of racial justice and movements such as Black Lives Matter.Boeing said about 69% of its U.S. workforce was made of white employees and 31% from other races, including about 6.4% Black employees. Boeing has previously said it aims to take the number of Black employees up by 20%.Boeing, which has seen the ranks of its senior female executives shrink in recent years, also said data showed women made up 13.6% of its executive council, a drop from about 30% over the past year.Part of the reason for the gender gap in the council is its expansion to 22 members, with just three female executives, from 13 members, with four female executives, as of March 1, 2020.Overall, women represented between 23% and 25% of Boeing U.S. and non-U.S. workforce, the company said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fired-65-employees-for-racist-discriminatory-conduct-over-the-last-year-boeing-101619802382476.html
30-04-2021||World||US retains India on list of IPR violators||The United States has retained India on its list of most egregious violators of intellectual property rights even though it noted gradual progress in the online sphere. And, it pointed to global concerns about counterfeits of Covid-19 related materials coming from China, including testing kits and masks.“India has remained inconsistent in its progress on intellectual property (IP) protection and enforcement,” said the US trade representative’s annual Special 301 report for 2021 released on Friday. “While India’s enforcement of IP in the online sphere has gradually improved, a lack of concrete benefits for innovators and creators persists, which continue to undermine their efforts.”India was among nine US trading partners on the “priority watch list”, which is the category for worst IP violators, according to the United States Trade Representative (USTR). The others are Argentina, Chile, China, Indonesia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine and Venezuela.“These countries will be the subject of particularly intense bilateral engagement during the coming year,” the report said.Overall, 23 countries are on the “watch list”.Among other IP issue with China, the report noted global concern with Chinese counterfeiting of Covid-19 related materials. “This past year, countries reported significant quantities of Covid-19 testing kits, personal protective equipment (PPE) such as N-95 and equivalent masks, and sanitisers, detergents, and disinfectants from China that were determined to be counterfeit.”The United States has made IP protection and enforcement a key element of trading relations with India and has been pushing it for a long time to do more. “India remains one of the world’s most challenging major economies with respect to protection and enforcement of IP,” said the USTR’s report. Patents were of “particular concern” because of “potential threat of patent revocations, lack of presumption of patent validity, and the narrow patentability criteria under the India Patents Act burden companies across different sectors”.The Special 301 report said businesses there is a lack of effective systemic protection against the “unfair commercial use, and unauthorised disclosure, of undisclosed test or other data generated to obtain marketing approval” for pharmaceutical and agricultural chemical products.IP enforcement is “inadequate” and trademark counterfeiting remains “problematic”, the report noted. And copyright holders continue to report “high levels of piracy, particularly online”.But India has also made “meaningful progress” in promoting IP protection and enforcement in some areas over the past year, according to report, but “it failed to resolve recent and long-standing challenges, and it created new concerns for right holders”.Among positive developments, the report noted India’s partnership in the Quad vaccine partnership. India is expected to manufacture 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines under partnership funded by Japan and the United States, with Australia taking up the last-mile distribution responsibility. The vaccines are meant for Indo-Pacific region countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-retains-india-on-list-of-ipr-violators-101619802589272.html
30-04-2021||World||UK allows dancing without distancing at nightclub test event||Several thousand music fans on Friday became the first people in Britain in more than a year to legally dance, drink and listen to music in a nightclub, as part of a test to see whether social distancing measures can be eased without triggering new coronavirus outbreaks.The afternoon-admission gig at a warehouse in Liverpool, northwest England, is one of a series of pilot events sponsored by the U.K. government and closely monitored by public health officials. The 3,000 attendees, all local residents, were to be tested before and after the event, while researchers will study air quality and movement in the venue.Once inside, clubbers could dance to DJs including Lewis Boardman and Jayda G. with no restrictions on mixing with others.“Today is going to be monumental,” said DJ Yousef, co-founder of Liverpool’s Circus nightclub, which organized the event.“Once you go over the threshold, the whole point of today is to go back to pre-COVID conditions, which of course is no social distancing, no masks. You can interact with people you don’t know,” he told the BBC. He said the reaction of ticket-buyers to that news had been “disbelief” as well as excitement.“We are very excited," Leah Lawless, 18, said as she waited with her friends to get in to the warehouse. She said the past year had been "hard. It's been boring, a bit sad, depressing and not the best.”A second clubbing event will be held in the same venue on Saturday, and 5,000 fans will attend a concert headlined by the band Blossoms at Liverpool’s Sefton Park on Sunday. The test events will culminate at Wembley Stadium on May 15, where a one-quarter capacity crowd of 21,000 will watch the FA Cup soccer final.Britain has recorded more than 127,000 coronavirus deaths, Europe’s highest toll. But a fast-moving vaccination campaign has given almost two-thirds of adults at least one shot, and the government is gradually lifting the restrictions on social and economic life that were in place over much of the last 14 months.Most shops and services are open, but indoor drinking, dining and entertainment will not resume before May 17 at the earliest. Some social distancing rules will be in place until at least June 21.Experiences elsewhere in Europe are encouraging. Organizers of a Barcelona concert last month attended by 4,500 mask-wearing fans who had been screened for the virus say the event produced no significant outbreaks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-allows-dancing-without-distancing-at-nightclub-test-event-101619802355222.html
30-04-2021||World||US embassy in Moscow limits services after Russia hiring ban||The U.S. Embassy in Moscow said Friday it will sharply curtail its consular activities due to a Russian ban on hiring local residents to work there.The embassy said in a statement that starting May 12, it will only provide emergency U.S. citizen services and a very limited number of immigrant visas for such life-or-death emergencies.It noted that non-immigrant visa processing for non-diplomatic travel will cease and it will stop offering routine notarial services, consular reports of birth abroad or passport renewal services for the foreseeable future.Moscow has moved to ban the U.S. Embassy and consular offices from hiring Russian and third-country nationals as part of its retaliation to a set of new U.S. sanctions imposed over Russian interference in the 2020 U.S. presidential election and involvement in the SolarWind hack of federal agencies — activities Moscow has denied.The U.S. ordered 10 Russian diplomats out, targeted dozens of companies and people and imposed new curbs on Russia’s ability to borrow money. Russia quickly retaliated by ordering 10 U.S. diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former U.S. officials and tightening requirements for U.S. Embassy operations.The U.S. Embassy warned that the provision of emergency services to U.S. citizens in Russia may also be “delayed or limited due to staff’s constrained ability to travel outside of Moscow.”It said it was unable to answer specific questions about Russian residency or Russian visas and strongly urged any U.S. citizens present in Russia with expired visas to depart before a June 15 deadline set by the Russian government.“We regret that the actions of the Russian government have forced us to reduce our consular workforce by 75%, and will endeavor to offer to U.S. citizens as many services as possible,” the embassy said.The Russian Foreign Ministry commented on Facebook, charging that the decision to limit consular activities indicated that the U.S. diplomatic and consular activities are “archaic and inefficient.”The ministry suggested that Washington expand its American staff to replace the local hires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-embassy-in-moscow-limits-services-after-russia-hiring-ban-101619799773396.html

A ministry of health spokesman said around 40 people had been taken to hospital, some in a critical condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blast-kills-27-people-in-afghanistan-s-eastern-logar-province-report-101619798774659.html

Swarms of flies spread near the reservoir and thousands of fish were decomposing in already dirty waters."This phenomenon appeared on the shore of the lake several days ago," said Ahmad Askar, a local activist. "The fish started floating up, and in abnormal quantities...It's unacceptable."At least 40 tonnes have turned up dead in a few days, numbers which Askar and fishermen in Qaraoun described as unprecedented. They called on the Litani river authority to find the cause and go after anyone dumping wastewater into the lake.The river authority said this week that the fish were toxic and carried a virus, urging people to avoid fishing all along the Litani due to "an aggravated disaster that threatens public health".The pollution prompted a ban since 2018 on fishing in the reservoir, which was created in 1959 with a large dam to collect water for hydropower and irrigation.Last month, volunteers removed clumps of sticky tar from some beaches along the Lebanese coast after an oil spill which environmentalists warned would harm marine life.Ecological disasters are the last thing Lebanon needs as it suffers through an alarming financial collapse and the aftermath of a huge explosion that devastated Beirut port last August.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-40-tonnes-of-dead-fish-wash-up-on-shore-of-polluted-lebanese-lake-101619792158371.html

Although only 31, she has been in the job for a decade."I have been working for so long, but now because of Covid situation it has become very difficult for us to operate but still we try to give good care and get the patients into hospitals," she said."We feel very good doing this but sometimes we also feel scared. However, despite all that we try to forget everything else and keeping nice feelings in our hearts, just think of doing good."Wearing a white protective suit and mask, Patel gently holds the hand of an elderly woman lying on a stretcher in an ambulance and monitors her oxygen levels.Her family is supportive of her work, she says, but she is afraid of bringing the virus home."Sometimes they feel scared that I work in such risky conditions and then come home in the evening... but still they support me and I also feel good that they appreciate me for working in this field."Before the pandemic, Patel and an ambulance driver would typically take about two hours to attend to an emergency, including transporting patients to hospital and giving them the necessary care.Now, the rise in the number of Covid-19 patients and acute shortage of beds in the hospitals means she sometimes spends several hours taking care of the sick in the ambulance while waiting for hospitals to accept them.India, the world's second-most populous nation, is in deep crisis, with hospitals and morgues overwhelmed by the pandemic, medicines and oxygen in short supply and strict curbs on movement in its biggest cities.The authorities reported 386,452 new cases and 3,498 deaths in the last 24 hours, but medical experts believe actual Covid-19 numbers may be five to 10 times greater than the official tally.But Patel has no choice but to get on with her work. At a government hospital, she waits for doctors to admit a patient she has brought.The man, who is lying on the floor with an oxygen tank next to him, had difficulty breathing but his oxygen levels had now improved, Patel said."Right now I have brought him to a government hospital but there is a wait over here. So we will have to wait."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/just-think-of-doing-good-indian-paramedics-battle-deluge-of-covid-19-patients-101619785623245.html
30-04-2021||World||Pfizer, BioNTech seek Covid-19 vaccine authorization for kids||Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech have submitted a request to the European drug regulator for the approval of their coronavirus vaccine to be extended to include children 12 to 15 years old, in a move that could offer younger and less at-risk populations in Europe access to the shot for the first time.In a statement Friday, the two pharmaceuticals said their submission to the European Medicines Agency is based on an advanced study in more than 2,000 adolescents that showed their vaccine to be safe and effective. The children will continue to be monitored for longer-term protection and safety for another two years.BioNTech and Pfizer have previously requested their emergency use authorization with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration also be extended to children 12 to 15 years old.German Health Minister Jens Spahn welcomed the news that the vaccine might soon get the green light for older children.“This can make a further real difference to our vaccine campaign, if approval is granted,” he said on the sidelines of a visit to a vaccine manufacturing plant in the German town of Reinbek.The COVID-19 vaccine made by Pfizer and BioNTech was the first one to be granted a greenlight by the EMA last December, when it was licensed for anyone 16 and over across the 27-nation EU bloc.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-seek-covid-19-vaccine-authorization-for-kids-101619785612033.html

30-04-2021||World||Chinese President Xi Jinping offers help to India in its fight against Covid-19||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Friday expressed serious concern on the coronavirus pandemic in India and offered to help fight the outbreak in a message to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Xi expressed his condolences to Modi on the current pandemic situation in India.“China is willing to strengthen anti-pandemic cooperation with India, and provide support and help to the country,” official news agency Xinhua quoted Xi as saying.“I am very concerned about the recent outbreak of new coronary pneumonia in India and would like to express sincere condolences to the Indian government and people on behalf of the Chinese government and Chinese people, and on my own behalf,” Xi said in the message.The Chinese President added that human beings are a community of destiny, and only through solidarity and cooperation can the nations of the world finally overcome the epidemic.“China is ready to strengthen anti-epidemic cooperation with India and provide support and assistance to India. I am confident that under the leadership of the Indian government, the people of India will be able to overcome the epidemic,” Xi added.Earlier in the day, the Chinese foreign ministry said local companies have exported more than 3,800 tonnes of medical supplies and over 26,000 ventilators to India in April to help fight the surging Covid-19 pandemic in the country.The Chinese customs department is also providing clearance to transport liquid oxygen storage tanks and oxygen generators to India from many cities, foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said, adding that Chinese provincial governments, NGOs and individual companies are also raising anti-epidemic material that India needs urgently.As it turns out, the medical and equipment supplies from China to India are mostly being done between companies as New Delhi and Beijing are yet to open a government-to-government route for such dealings.India is yet to even officially acknowledge China’s offer of help, which was first made by the Chinese foreign ministry through a media briefing last week.Friday’s update from the foreign ministry came a day after state councilor and foreign minister Wang Yi promised external affairs minister, S Jaishankar, that China will do the utmost in supporting India’s fight against current outbreak in India at a faster pace.In a letter to Jaishankar, Wang said that the Chinese side “shares empathy for the challenges facing India and expresses sincere sympathy”.Following up on minister Wang’s promise, foreign ministry spokesperson Wang said China has always been paying close attention to the development of the epidemic situation in India.Wang said many sections of Chinese society have taken action to collect material to send to India and to “deliver them to the Indian people as soon as possible”.According to statistics provided by Wang, since April, China has exported more than 26,000 ventilators and oxygen generators, more than 15,000 monitors, and nearly 3,800 tons of medical materials and medicines to India.China’s relevant anti-epidemic material and medical equipment companies are working hard, working overtime, and speeding up production, Wang said, adding that over the next few days, more anti-epidemic resources will continue to be sent to India to support its anti-epidemic efforts.Wang added that many donations in this context are being made through unofficial channels.The spokesperson added the cargo routes from China to India are operating normally.In the past two weeks, many cargo flights of Chinese airlines from China to India have operated, he said without giving details.Wang added that Chinese authorities have provided and are providing customs clearance for India to transport liquid oxygen storage tanks, oxygen generators and other materials back from many cities in China.China, he said, will continue to maintain a smooth channel for exports of materials to India.In his letter to Jaishankar, foreign minister Wang said that anti-pandemic materials produced in China were entering India at a faster pace to help it fight the epidemic.“The Chinese side will continue to do its utmost to provide support and help according to the needs of India. We hope and believe that under the leadership of the Indian government, the Indian people will surely prevail over the epidemic at an early date,” he added.China’s Ambassador to India Sun Weidong in a tweet on Wednesday said Chinese medical suppliers are working overtime on orders from India, “at least 25,000 orders for oxygen concentrators in recent days. Cargo planes are under plan for medical supplies. Chinese customs will facilitate relevant process”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/faster-customs-clearance-to-medical-consignment-to-india-china-101619778048582.html
30-04-2021||World||Airlines add flights out of ravaged India to bring citizens home||International and domestic airlines are adding flights out of India to bring home residents and citizens as the nation’s coronavirus outbreak goes from bad to worse.Air India Ltd. plans to increase its weekly frequency of flights to the U.S. to 32 starting May 11, up from the current 29. That compares with about 33 weekly flights before Covid. Korean Air Lines Co. and Asiana Airlines Inc. meanwhile are planning to charter flights from India to help South Koreans there wanting to return. Both carriers, which had previously halted all scheduled services to the South Asian nation because of the pandemic, are working with regulators to finalize the flights’ details.India now has the world’s fastest-growing Covid caseload with 18.8 million confirmed instances. The nation set another record Friday with 386,452 additional cases. Deaths rose by 3,498 to 208,330. The political and financial capitals of New Delhi and Mumbai are in lockdown and this week, the U.S. told its citizens to get out of India as soon as possible.The ferocious surge in new cases has also reversed one of the airline industry’s biggest travel comebacks. Carriers in India had reached 87% of their pre-pandemic seat capacity through early April, based on a Bloomberg analysis of data from flight tracker OAG, but that progress has now unraveled led by a pullback in domestic flights, which make up the vast majority of the market.As the outbreak overwhelms the nation’s hospitals and crematoriums, an upturn in air travel won’t happen until the latest crisis is contained, Rob Morris, the head of consultancy at U.K. aviation advisory firm Cirium, said earlier this week.The U.S. released a Level 4 travel advisory, the highest of its kind issued by the State Department.“U.S. citizens are reporting being denied admittance to hospitals in some cities due to a lack of space,” the website of the U.S. Embassy and Consulates in India said in a health alert. All routine U.S. citizen services and visa services at the U.S. Consulate General Chennai have been canceled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/airlines-add-flights-out-of-ravaged-india-to-bring-citizens-home-101619776384942.html
30-04-2021||World||Boris Johnson's phone number was online for 15 years: Report||The British government downplayed allegations Friday of a security risk after it was reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s cell phone number was openly available on the internet for 15 years.Celebrity website Popbitch revealed that the number was on a think tank press release from 2006, when Johnson was an opposition lawmaker and the Conservative Party’s higher education spokesman.Callers to the number on Thursday night heard an automated message saying the phone was “switched off." By Friday it appeared to no longer be in use.Home Office minister Victoria Atkins insisted that the prime minister "knows his responsibilities when it comes to national security,” and criticized media for revealing the fact that the number was in the public domain.But former National Security Adviser Peter Ricketts said that if the number was widely available it could be used for eavesdropping by hostile states, “and possibly other non-state actors as well, like sophisticated criminal gangs.”Johnson is already facing questions about his text and WhatsApp message exchanges with business leaders and lobbyists.He has denied doing anything wrong when he exchanged text messages last year with industrialist James Dyson and promised he would “fix” the tax rules for him if Dyson agreed to make ventilators for the National Health Service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boris-johnson-s-phone-number-was-online-for-15-years-report-101619776499261.html
30-04-2021||World||AstraZeneca reports $275 million sales of Covid-19 shot, expects hit to ease||AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine delivered $275 million in first-quarter sales while shaving three cents per share from earnings, the drugmaker said on Friday as it posted better-than-expected results and forecast second half growth.This is the first time the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker has given financial details of the distribution and sales of the vaccine, which it developed with Oxford University. It has said it will not make a profit from the shot during the pandemic.The vaccine revenue included delivery of about 68 million doses, AstraZeneca said, adding that sales in Europe, where it faces a legal case, were $224 million, in emerging markets $43 million and $8 million in the rest of the world.Sales of $275 million for 68 million doses equates to a price tag of around $4 per shot.The results come after a bruising start to the year as the drugmaker struggles with production of its vaccine and faces a legal battle after cutting deliveries to Europe, while regulators probe rare blood clots in people who got the shot.Shares in AstraZeneca rose 3% to 7,621 pence at 0744 GMT. The stock, which hit record highs in July 2020 due to optimism around the vaccine, ended last year 4% lower."This is good enough," Barclays analysts in a note.VACCINE RACEAstraZeneca was one of the leaders in the global race to develop a COVID-19 vaccine. Its cheap and easily transportable shot was hailed as a milestone in the fight against the crisis, but has since faced a series of setbacks.In presentation slides, AstraZeneca said it was ramping up vaccine supplies and production yields were improving, without giving any details.Pfizer, whose Covid-19 vaccine is several times more costly per dose than AstraZeneca's, in February forecast $15 billion for its share of sales from the vaccine, co-developed with partner BioNTech, with analysts expecting as much as $18 billion on average.BioNTech expects close to 10 billion euros ($12.1 billion) in revenues from committed vaccine deliveries this year but raised the prospect of more supply deals.Moderna in February said it was expecting sales of $18.4 billion from its own vaccine this year.Before AstraZeneca's earnings, market researcher GlobalData said it expected annual sales of $278 million this year and next for the drugmaker's coronavirus vaccine, branded Vaxzevria.AstraZeneca said it would submit an application for U.S. emergency use in the coming weeks, adding global data from late-stage trials and emerging real-world data after a roll-out.The vaccine's efficacy data has been questioned in the past.CORE RESILIENTWhile the coronavirus continues to have a mixed impact on drugmakers, AstraZeneca's core business has proved resilient.The drugmaker stuck to its forecast for 2021 on Friday and predicted better times ahead.Its guidance does not include any impact from sales of the vaccine and its $39 billion purchase of Alexion, which is expected to close in the third quarter."We expect the impact of COVID to reduce and anticipate a performance acceleration in the second half of 2021," AstraZeneca Chief Executive Pascal Soriot said in statement.Total revenue of $7.32 billion for the three months to March exceeded analysts' expectations of $6.94 billion, while core earnings of $1.63 cents per share beat a consensus of $1.48.Quarterly sales growth was driven by best-selling lung cancer drug Tagrisso, up 17% to $1.15 billion, while revenues from heart and diabetes drug Farxiga jumped to a better-than-expected $625 million, on new prescriptions for heart failure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-reports-275-million-sales-of-covid-19-shot-expects-hit-to-ease-101619773134384.html

Se has over 25,000 Instagram followers.Although first-time violators of Bali's mask-wearing rule face fines of 1 million rupiah ($70) for foreigners and deportation after a second offense, the police wanted them removed off the island immediately.“It’s only proper to sanction them more severely, not just with a fine but also deportation,” said Bali’s civil service police unit head Dewa Nyoman Rai Dharmadi. “They are not only violating, but deliberately provoking in public to defy health guidelines.”The pair had shown remorse and apologized through Lin’s Instagram video.“I made this video to entertain people because I’m a content creator and it’s my job to entertain people,” Lin said, “However, I did not realize that what I did could actually bring a lot of negative comments,” he said, advising people to always wear masks and invite everyone to help Bali regain its tourism.Jamaruli Manihuruk, who heads the Bali regional office for the Justice and Human Rights Ministry, said that Lin and Se to be deported as soon as possible after they are tested for Covid-19.“Foreigners who don’t respect the laws and regulations in Indonesia are facing deportation sanctions,” Manihuruk said. He said Lin and Se will be placed in a detention cell at the immigration office while waiting for their flight.In January, authorities in Bali deported Sergei Kosenko, a Russian social media celebrity, after he posted a video of himself driving a motorcycle with a female passenger on the back off a pier into the sea. The stunt was condemned by many Indonesians as reckless and a potentially hazardous to the environment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/two-influencers-ordered-off-bali-after-fake-mask-video-prank-101619772502016.html
30-04-2021||World||WHO should look beyond animals on Covid-19 origin, scientists say||The World Health Organization should convene another investigation into the origins of the coronavirus pandemic that looks beyond animal sources, a group of scientists said in an open letter.The signatories proposed specific steps on what any new probe should take into account. Suggestions include ensuring that a team can undertake studies without the “unnecessary presence” of government officials of the host country, removing any veto powers in the member-selection process and a mandate for broad access to data, records and samples.A joint mission including scientists from China and organized with the WHO found that the coronavirus probably spread from bats to humans via another animal, and considered a laboratory incident the least likely hypothesis. Because the study’s aim was defined as probing the zoonotic source of the virus, other theories didn’t receive the same attention and the team didn’t fully investigate labs, Peter Ben Embarek, co-leader of the trip, said after a report was published in March.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said afterward that the probe didn’t adequately analyze the possibility of a lab accident before deciding it’s most likely the pathogen spread from bats to humans via another animal. He said he is ready to deploy additional missions involving specialist experts. However, that will require China’s cooperation.The Chinese city of Wuhan, where the first Covid-19 outbreak was identified, is home to a high-security virus lab, and that proximity has prompted former U.S. President Donald Trump and others to speculate on the possibility of a leak. China has denied any connection, floating the alternative theory that the virus may have entered the country via frozen-food imports.The open letter published Friday was the third from the group. The more than 20 signatories included Steven Quay, chief executive officer at Atossa Therapeutics Inc., which develops treatments for breast cancer and Covid-19, while Jamie Metzl, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, co-organized it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-should-look-beyond-animals-on-covid-19-origin-scientists-say-101619772598877.html
30-04-2021||World||Explained: What remains as US ends Afghan 'forever war'||After 20 years, America is ending its “forever war” in Afghanistan.Announcing a firm withdrawal deadline, President Joe Biden cut through the long debate, even within the U.S. military, over whether the time was right. Starting Saturday, the last remaining 2,500 to 3,500 American troops will begin leaving, to be fully out by Sept. 11 at the latest.Another debate will likely go on far longer: Was it worth it?Since 2001, tens of thousands of Afghans and 2,442 American soldiers have been killed, millions of Afghans driven from their homes, and billions of dollars spent on war and reconstruction. As the departure begins, The Associated Press takes a look at the mission and what it accomplished.Fighting terrorIn the early days after the Sept. 11, 2001 terror attacks in the U.S., the mission seemed clear: Hunt down and punish the perpetrators.The U.S. determined that al-Qaida and its leader, Osama bin Laden, had plotted the attack from the safety of Afghanistan, protected by its radical Taliban rulers. At the time the Taliban were a pariah government, under U.N. sanctions and vilified in the West for their rule by a harsh interpretation of Islamic law.Until 9/11, the U.S. had watched Afghanistan from a distance, occasionally requesting the Taliban to hand over bin Laden and once in 1998 firing a couple of cruise missiles at an al-Qaida base in eastern Afghanistan.Now America was leading an invasion, dubbed Operation Enduring Freedom, with the mission of removing the Taliban and destroying al-Qaida.Washington turned to the only allies in Afghanistan it could — a collection of warlords, most of whom were former mujahedeen backed by the U.S. in the 1980s in the fight against the invading Soviet Union. Rallying around the U.S. after 9/11, NATO joined the coalition.Within weeks of the invasion and aerial bombardment, the U.S.-led coalition had pounded the Taliban into submission and driven them from power. Its leadership fled, its fighters lost control of the entire nation. Al-Qaida as well fled underground, crossing into neighboring Pakistan.The hunt for bin Laden took 10 years. Finally, he was tracked to his hideout in Pakistan, barely 100 kilometers (60 miles) from Islamabad. A U.S. Navy Seals team went in under cover of darkness and killed him.But in the interceding decade, America and NATO had been dragged into a dramatically expanded mission. Then-Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld at first said America was not in Afghanistan to nation-build. That would change.When the U.S. invaded Iraq in 2003, it took its eye off Afghanistan. It left it to the former warlords, pre-occupied with wealth and power. The first post-Taliban president, Hamid Karzai, raised the idea of talks with the Taliban to work out a peace, and the crushed militants put out signals they wanted to reach an accommodation.But American officials blocked any negotiations with the Taliban, convinced the insurgents could be militarily destroyed.Instead, the militants re-emerged in a long insurgency, and the U.S. found itself pouring in money and manpower to help the Afghan government fight and to rebuild the war-shattered nation. With the flood of billions of dollars, corruption only grew in the U.S.-backed government, only growing worse as the years went on.Meanwhile, al-Qaida’s ability to strike the U.S. and the West has been severely damaged. But the group has spread in branches in multiple countries fighting in insurgencies.Biden explained his decision to pull out the last 2,500-3,500 American soldiers from Afghanistan, saying America’s security concerns had evolved.“Bin Laden is dead, and al-Qaida is degraded in Iraq and Afghanistan," he said, arguing that the terror threat has “metastasized” into a global phenomenon, not to be fought with thousands of troops on the ground in one country but with new technology. The U.S., he said, must be freed to fight the 21st century’s more sophisticated challenges, including competition from Russia and China.For the situation in Afghanistan, he said he didn’t see how continued American military presence would bring a turnaround. “When will it be the right moment to leave? One more year, two more years, ten more years?” he said.“’Not now” — that’s how we got here.’”What now for Afghanistan?The U.S. and NATO leave behind an Afghanistan that is at least half run directly or indirectly by the Taliban — despite billions poured into training and arming Afghan forces to fight them. Riddled with corruption and tied to regional warlords, the U.S.-backed government is widely distrusted by many Afghans.Washington and its international allies are putting heavy pressure on the government and the Taliban to reach a peace deal. The hope is that both sides realize military victory is impossible and that peace together is the only way forward.The best case scenario is some sort of government including the Taliban that can pave the way for a drawing up a new constitutional system for the future, including some form of elections.The very possible worst case scenario is that peace talks fail, and Afghanistan is plunged into a new chapter of its decades of civil war. That new phase could be more brutal than ever, with not only the Taliban but the country’s other, multiple warlords and armed factions battling it out for power.The past 20 years since the Taliban were ousted have unquestionably seen gains for the Afghans. But they are fragile and risk being wiped away as the Americans step away — whether frittered away under a new government or crushed by continued war.Girls are allowed an education, which had been banned under the Taliban. Still, at least 3.6 million children, the majority of them girls, are not in school, according to UNICEF.Women are working and are in Parliament. Their voices are strong yet still Afghanistan’s Parliament has been unable to pass The Violence Against Women bill because religious conservatives dominate. The Georgetown Institute for Women, Peace and Security has consistently ranked Afghanistan as one of the worst countries in the world to be a woman.Before the war in 2001, the Taliban had eradicated opium production in Afghanistan, according to United Nations figures. Today, it produces more opium than every other opium-producing country combined, despite the U.S. spending millions to eradicate drug production.The opium industry in 2019, the latest available figures show, earned between $1.2 billion and $2.1 billion, outstripping the value of the country’s legal exports, according to John Sopko, the U.S. government’s watchdog on Afghan reconstruction. More than $14 million of that went into the coffers of the Taliban, who tax drug movement throughout the country.Despite billions in U.S. humanitarian and reconstruction aid, more than half the population of 36 million lives under the World Bank-set poverty line of $1.90 a day — and millions more live not much above that level. Unemployment is at 40%. The U.N. and Red Cross say nearly half of all Afghan children face the danger of hunger.The majority of Afghans hold out little hope for their future according to a 2018 Gallup poll.“Afghanistan is bordering a failed state status and is sure to enter the category immediately after the withdrawal of the foreign forces absent a better political arrangement,” said Torek Farhadi, a political analyst and former government adviser. “That is the reality of Afghanistan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-remains-as-us-ends-afghan-forever-war-101619772439141.html

30-04-2021||World||France finds first case of Covid-19 variant sweeping India||France has announced its first confirmed cases of the virus variant that is sweeping over India, just as the French president outlined a national reopening plan after six months of virus restrictions.The Health Ministry announced late Thursday night that three people tested positive for the new variant in the Bouches-du-Rhone and Lot et Garonne regions of southern France. All three had travelled to India, and are under medical observation.Authorities are seeking to trace their contacts and investigating other suspected cases, the ministry said. It noted that the variant has been detected in at least six other European countries.France last week stepped up virus controls for travellers arriving from India as well as some other countries where variants are spreading.The announcement came as French President Emmanuel Macron laid out a four-stage reopening process aimed at boosting the economy, welcoming back tourists and lifting nearly all of France's virus restrictions by June 30.The vast majority of France's virus cases now involve the more contagious, more dangerous variant first identified in Britain. France has reported one of the worlds highest virus death tolls, at more than 103,000 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-finds-first-case-of-covid-19-variant-sweeping-india-101619768774496.html

Earnings hit 15.79 dollars per diluted share.Total net sales from the quarter grew 44 per cent from the year-ago period to 108.5 billion dollars.CNN said the company's cloud unit and biggest money maker, Amazon Web Services, posted net sales of 13.5 billion dollars during the quarter, up 32 per cent year-over-year.That is an acceleration in growth from the prior quarter as more companies adopt the technology to help manage hybrid workforces.Despite a tough year-over-year comparison because of the surge in demand the pandemic caused in 2020, Amazon still expects net sales between 110 billion and 116 billion dollars, up 24 per cent to 30 per cent from the same period in the prior year during the second quarter of 2021.A day before the earnings report, Amazon announced it will spend 1 billion dollars to raise wages for more than 500,000 hourly workers by as much as 3 dollars an hour as it continues its hiring push that has elevated its global workforce beyond 1.3 million people globally.The company will not, however, increase its 15 dollars per hour minimum wage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazons-profit-soars-more-than-200-in-q1-to-usd-8-billion-101619767997986.html

Marzena Ozarek-Szilke, an anthropologist and archaeologist at the University of Warsaw, told journalists.Further analysis revealed the whole foetus and scientists working on the Warsaw Mummy Project believe the woman was between 20 and 30 years old and was 26-30 weeks pregnant."We do not know why the foetus was not taken out of the belly of the deceased during mummification," said Wojciech Ejsmond from the Polish Academy of Sciences, another project participant."That is why this mummy is truly unique. We have not been able to find any similar cases. This means that 'our' mummy is the only recognised in the world with a foetus," he said.Ozarek-Szilke speculated that there may have been an effort to "camouflage the pregnancy... or, perhaps, it had some significance related to beliefs and re-birth in the afterlife".Based on an analysis of the hieroglyphs on the sarcophagus, the mummy was originally thought to be of a male priest who lived between the first century BC and the first century AD.Scientists now believe it could be even older than that and are looking into the possible causes of death.The mummy has not been opened but one scan showed the woman had long curly hair down to her shoulders.The research has been published in the latest issue of peer-reviewed Journal of Archaeological Science."This is the first known case of a pregnant embalmed body... It opens up new possibilities of researching pregnancy in ancient times and practices related to maternity," the article said.The scans were carried out by Affidea, a medical analysis company, using equipment provided by GE, both project backers.The mummy was brought to Poland in the 19th century and became part of the antiquities collection at the University of Warsaw.It has been kept at the National Museum since 1917, where it is on show to the public alongside the sarcophagus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/polish-scientists-discover-world-s-first-pregnant-egyptian-mummy-101619766128259.html

The UN stands ready to step up our support,” Guterres tweeted on Thursday.India’s Permanent Representative to the UN Ambassador T S Tirumurti replied to Guterres’s tweet saying that India deeply appreciates “your sentiments and solidarity at this juncture. We also appreciate the support @UNinIndia is giving us,” tagging the Twitter handle of the United Nations in India.As per data by the World Health Organization, confirmed Covid-19 cases in India stand at over 18.37 million and more than 204,000 people have died due to the virus.Earlier this week, President of the UN General Assembly Volkan Bozkir had tweeted that he is “worried” about the Covid-19 situation in India, “a country which did so much to ensure #Vaccines4All in vulnerable countries. It’s time for the world to extend aid & support to India. No one’s safe until we’re all safe.”He had added that his thoughts are with the people of India at this time.The United Nations team in India is supporting the response of the country’s authorities to the Covid-19 pandemic by providing critical supplies and UN agencies are procuring thousands of oxygen concentrators, oxygen generating plants and other essential equipment as well as helping set up mobile hospital units.Deputy Spokesman for the Secretary-General, Farhan Haq had told reporters at the daily press briefing on Wednesday that the UN team in India, led by Resident Coordinator Renata Lok Dessallien, is supporting the authorities’ response to the pandemic by providing equipment and supplies, including to local governments.The WHO and UNICEF (United Nations Children’s Fund) are procuring equipment and supplies, including 7,000 oxygen concentrators and 500 nasal devices for oxygen supply, as well as oxygen generating plants, Covid-19 testing machines, and personal protective kits.WHO is also helping to set up mobile hospital units and is providing for laboratories.About 2,600 WHO field officers have been immediately deployed to support health authorities to curb the spread of the pandemic.In Maharashtra, UNICEF has engaged experts to work on risk governance. The UN team is also continuing its campaign highlighting the “three Ws: Wear a mask, Wash your Hands, Watch your distance and stay six feet apart.”“In India’s time of need, the UN is doing everything it can to rapidly provide critical equipment and supplies to central and state governments," Dessallien has said.WHO said in a press release that filling critical gaps in essential medical supplies and hospital capacities should be the top priority as India battles surge in Covid-19 cases.WHO is chartering flights to bring in 4,000 oxygen concentrators to help meet the increased demands.“The current rapid surge of Covid-19 cases has put immense pressure on the health systems, already overburdened since the start of the pandemic. We need to act with speed, expand hospital capacities and equip them with medical supplies, most needed to save lives,” Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh has said.A UN News article said the South-East Asian region has led the world in Covid-19 infections for a third straight week, mainly due to the situation in India, which has recorded 2.17 million new cases, or a 52 per cent increase.In order to make available additional hospital beds and critical equipment for India, WHO is procuring mobile field hospitals with a capacity of 20-30 beds, which could be set up in the most affected areas. The bed capacity at these field hospitals can be increased to a maximum of 50, if needed, without impacting infection prevention and control protocols, and water and sanitation, the WHO release had added.The agency is also assisting laboratories to meet the huge demand for testing, and over 2,600 WHO technical staff, working on various programmes such as polio, TB and NTD, have been repurposed to support pandemic response in India.WHO is procuring laboratory supplies, including 1.2 million reagents, to meet the huge demand and need for testing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/un-stands-ready-to-step-up-support-to-india-guterres-on-covid-outbreak-101619755494452.html

Special Envoy on Climate Change John Kerry was in India not all that long ago. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in India to discuss elements of India-US security cooperation, Price said."We have engaged with India in a multilateral context as well through the Quad, both at the ministerial level and, for the first time ever, at the leader level," he said."I have mentioned our climate cooperation, but also our health cooperation, and this was something that predates the pandemic but has intensified with the onset of the pandemic and even further with the uptick in cases that we have seen in India in recent days," Price said."So, I think it is this engagement that reflects our global comprehensive partnership," he said in response to a question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-official-says-ties-with-india-intensified-in-first-100-days-of-president-joe-biden-s-administration-101619753830120.html

It gives these family members the option to depart if they wish. Departure, again, is not required.”The United States has also extended the Level 4 “Do not travel” advisory, which Price said, was a “pro forma re-issuance” of a previously issued advisory that had “been in effect, given Covid not only in India but globally as well”.Also Read | US pushes ahead with nuclear plans despite watchdog concernsPrice refused to share details of reports of US embassy staff contracting Covid-19. CNN has reported citing sources that there has been a major outbreak at US missions in India. Two locally employed staff members have died and more than 100 tested positive. “It is fair to say that Covid has touched every – just about every element of Indian society, and of course, we do have a large diplomatic presence in India, as you might expect, given our global comprehensive partnership with India,” Price said, adding, “So while I can’t offer any specifics on US embassy employees or family members or locally employed staff, clearly this is a pandemic; this is an outbreak, a surge of cases in India that has left no part of the country untouched.”Asked about the removal and blocking of social media posts critical of the Indian government over the second wave of Covid-19 epidemic, Price said, “Of course, India is a large democracy with whom we share foundational values, and freedom of information, freedom of expression is something we support around the world.”Pushed back by a reporter who asked if freedom of expression and information extended to social media posts that incited violence, the state department spokesperson said that “hate speech, incitement to violence is something that we oppose everywhere”.“But clearly,” he added, “we support freedom of expression, while still calling out and condemning when we see incitement to violence and hate speech.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-allows-its-diplomats-in-india-to-send-families-home-101619753447040.html

30-04-2021||World||Eying 2024, Mike Pence makes 1st speech since leaving office||In his first public address since the end of the Trump administration, former Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday put down a marker for a potential return to elected office, telling an audience in early-voting South Carolina that he will use the coming months “pushing back on the liberal agenda" he says is wrong for the country.“We've got to guard our values ... by offering a positive agenda to the American people, grounded in our highest ideals,” Pence told an audience of several hundred at a Columbia dinner sponsored by a conservative Christian nonprofit that lobbies for what it considers to be “biblical values,” such as heterosexual marriage. “Now, over the coming months, I'll have more to say about all of that.”The choice of South Carolina for Pence's post-administration debut has definite political overtones, helping him develop exposure for a potential 2024 presidential bid. The state holds the first presidential primaries in the South, and candidates of both major parties typically spend more than a year in the state ahead of those votes, introducing themselves and trying to secure support.Republican candidates use South Carolina as a proving ground to test their anti-abortion-rights mettle. Thursday's event, hosted by Palmetto Family Council, also gave Pence a backdrop for some of the issues for which he long advocated as an Indiana congressman-turned-governor, such as restrictions on abortion and support for the overturn of Roe v. Wade. Palmetto Family most recently helped push through a ban on most South Carolina abortions, a law now being challenged in federal court.“We will stand with the right of every American, of every faith, to live, to work, to speak and to worship according to the dictates of their conscience," Pence said.Pence, who since leaving office has been doing work with the Heritage Foundation and Young America’s Foundation, has not indicated if he plans a future run. As vice president, he made numerous trips to South Carolina, meeting several times with Gov. Henry McMaster for coronavirus-related forums and campaigning in the state for U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace.But the question is whether Pence's former boss still looms large for the possible Republican field. Trump has not explicitly stated his plans but has teased a possible bid. On Thursday morning, asked on Fox Business about running in 2024, Trump said he’s “100%” thinking about it and would even possibly consider Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis as his running mate.Last month, another possible GOP contender, former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, said when asked about 2024 by The Associated Press that she would stand down if Trump opted to run again. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has launched an aggressive schedule, visiting states that will play a pivotal role in the 2024 primaries and signing a contract with Fox News Channel. DeSantis has been courting donors, including in Trump’s backyard, with a prominent speaking slot before the former president at a GOP fundraising retreat dinner this month at Mar-a-Lago, the Florida resort where Trump now lives.Earlier Thursday, South Carolina Democratic Chair Trav Robertson said Pence was coming to the state to "try and salvage his relationship” with Trump supporters irked that Pence didn't support efforts to block certification of the 2020 presidential election.On Thursday, Pence promised to reveal more of his ideas soon, promising that he would be challenging the Biden administration's “avalanche of liberal policies” as he ramps up speaking engagements around the country.“We have the winning agenda,” Pence told Thursday's crowd. “And now it's incumbent upon us to take that winning agenda to the American people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eying-2024-mike-pence-makes-1st-speech-since-leaving-office-101619752071647.html
30-04-2021||World||US pushes ahead with nuclear plans despite watchdog concerns||The Biden administration appears to be picking up where former President Donald Trump left off as the federal agency that oversees U.S. nuclear research and bomb-making has approved the conceptual design and cost range for infrastructure investments for a multibillion-dollar project to manufacture key components for the nation’s nuclear arsenal.The National Nuclear Security Administration in a decision announced Wednesday stated that planning and construction could cost upwards of $4 billion initially.The agency did not articulate what exactly that money would be spent on nor does it include the cost of other preparations that would be needed for Los Alamos National Laboratory to begin producing 30 plutonium cores per year.The push to resume production of the nuclear triggers has spanned multiple presidential administrations, with supporters arguing that the U.S. needs to ensure the stability and reliance of its arsenal given growing global security concerns. The nuclear agency also has said most of the cores in the stockpile date back to the 1970s and 1980s.Lab Director Thom Mason during a virtual community meeting Thursday evening fielded several questions about the project, saying the goal of the work is not to expand the arsenal but rather to extend the life of the existing stockpile.While not everyone agrees with everything the lab does, he said nuclear deterrence and nonproliferation will remain the lab's primary mission.He also pointed to current geopolitical threats.“I think we all wish that we lived in a world where nuclear weapons weren’t necessary,” he said. “But as long as we’re not in that world, the responsibility that we’re given by the Department of Defense, by Congress, by the Department of Energy is to make sure that our deterrent is safe, secure and reliable.”Democratic members of New Mexico's congressional delegation have supported production at Los Alamos because of the billions of dollars in federal funding and thousands of jobs that are at stake.But watchdog groups have been sounding alarms over the potential for more security and safety lapses at the northern New Mexico lab and the potential for environmental contamination. Another concern is the nuclear waste that would be generated by the work.The groups have said the cost estimate outlined by the agency in its decision is roughly double the projections made just last year.Greg Mello with the Los Alamos Study Group said the ballooning budget and uncertainty over whether the lab can meet the federal government's mandated production schedule “throw further doubt on the wisdom of proceeding with industrial pit production” at Los Alamos.“LANL’s facilities are simply too old and inherently unsafe, its location too impractical,” he said. “Even with a much smaller stockpile, LANL could not undertake this mission successfully.”Some groups have threatened to sue the U.S. Energy Department and the National Nuclear Security Administration, saying a more comprehensive review should have been done on the plans to produce plutonium cores at Los Alamos and at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina. They argue that nearby communities already have been saddled with legacy contamination from previous defense work.Critics are fearful that the project will result in factories that resemble the Rocky Flats facility in Colorado, which had a long history of leaks, fires and environmental violations and needed a $7 billion cleanup that took years to finish.The mission of producing the plutonium cores began at Rocky Flats in the 1950s and was eventually moved to Los Alamos in the late 1990s.Dogged by safety problems and concerns about a lack of accountability, production at Los Alamos has happened in fits and starts over the years. It’s been shut down at times, and only a handful of prototypes were made in fiscal year 2019.Jay Coghlan of Nuclear Watch New Mexico called the federal government's plans “unnecessary and provocative,” saying more production will result in more waste and help to fuel a new arms race.The nuclear agency in a statement said it expects to set cost and schedule baselines in 2023 as part of the ongoing process. It also plans to continue reviewing the project “to improve the fidelity” of price and timeline estimates.Mason said the 2021 fiscal year is certainly a record in terms of funding for the lab, with the operating budget projected to be more than $3.7 billion. That funding will likely level off in the coming years, he said, as more modernization and infrastructure projects are completed. He said future funding will depend on the administration's focus and congressional action.Mason also used Thursday's community meeting to highlight the lab's other work — which includes projects related to space exploration, the pandemic, water supplies in the West and wildfires.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pushes-ahead-with-nuclear-plans-despite-watchdog-concerns-101619749752617.html
30-04-2021||World||Indian envoy interacts with US business community on Covid-19 relief efforts||India's Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu held an interaction with members of the business community on the current Covid-19 pandemic situation in the country.The virtual meeting was hosted by the US Chamber of Commerce on Thursday.During the talks, Sandhu appraised the business community of the items that India is trying to identify and source, including oxygen concentrators, cylinders, ventilators and oxygen generation plants and Covid-19-related drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab."Appreciated the Chamber for coordinating the swift response and resource mobilization by the US business community in support of India to meet the Covid challenge," Sandhu said in a tweet.In the past few days, the US Chamber of Commerce has mobilised support, brought together partners from other industry bodies and coordinated with the US government to deliver critical medical supplies to India.Significant additional supplies of medical equipment are being dispatched by the private sector.Earlier the US Chamber had urged the Biden administration to release unused AstraZeneca vaccine doses for use in India.Sandhu said he had an “important conversation” with Albert Bourla, CEO of Pfizer.The Ambassador said he highlighted the Indian government's decisions to facilitate import of vaccines and to fast-track emergency-use authorisations for those which have already been given approval in other countries.“Discussed ways in which Pfizer could support healthcare efforts including vaccines in India, and strengthen our pandemic response,” he added.The Ambassador said two US aircraft with oxygen equipment and other Covid-related supplies are on their way to India."Thank you @POTUS (President Joe Biden) for standing shoulder-to-shoulder with India during this challenging time," Sandhu tweeted.WalMart CEO Dough McMillion had interacted with Sandhu a day earlier."My heart is breaking for our friends and associates across India as they battle a devastating surge in pandemic cases," McMillion said in a statement.Walmart is diligently working to deliver oxygen and vital equipment to communities across the country, he said.FedEx also issued a statement saying it was continuing its support to the fight against Covid-19 and had plans to send a dedicated aircraft with thousands of oxygen concentrators and critical aid for healthcare facilities in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-envoy-interacts-with-us-business-community-on-covid-19-relief-efforts-101619749810500.html

30-04-2021||World||Indian-American couple sentenced for laundering over $500K in phone scam||A United States court in Atlanta has sentenced an Indian-American couple for laundering over USD500,000 on behalf of India-based phone scammers.Chaitali Dave (36) was on Thursday sentenced to 20 months, to be followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay $320,550 in restitution.Mehulkumar Manubhai Patel (36) was sentenced to 30 months, followed by two years of supervised release and ordered to pay $259,217 in restitution.As part of their Social Security scam, India-based callers posed as federal agents in order to mislead victims into believing their Social Security numbers were involved in crimes, federal prosecutors alleged.The callers threatened arrest and loss of assets if the victims did not send money, they said.The scammers then directed the victims to mail cash to aliases used by other members of the fraud network, including Patel and Dave, the federal prosecutors added.As part of a tech support scam, the callers also induced victims to send money in the pretext of supposed technical support for their computers.According to federal prosecutors, the callers routinely misled the victims by making it appear as though the caller added money to the victims’ bank accounts. The callers then instructed the victims to mail cash to aliases used by other members of the fraud network, including Patel and Dave, they said.“These convictions should stand as a warning that my office will aggressively investigate and work to hold those accountable who collect and transmit money from Social Security imposter scam victims,” said Gail S Ennis, Inspector General for the Social Security Administration.“International call centres continue to victimise the elderly and most vulnerable members of our community,” said acting US Attorney Kurt R Erskine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-couple-sentenced-for-laundering-over-500k-in-phone-scam-101619743827338.html
30-04-2021||World||US President Joe Biden says tax hikes on rich will fund cuts for many more||President Joe Biden told voters in an Atlanta suburb that his proposed tax increases on the wealthy would finance tax cuts for many more Americans, as he took to the road to sell his plans to build infrastructure and invest in education, child care and other priorities.“This is a tax cut for more than two million families in Georgia,” Biden said of his proposals during a drive-in rally in Gwinnett County, marking his first 100 days in office.“It’s about time the very wealthy and corporations start paying their fair share,” he said. “It’s about time. Simple as that.”Biden traveled to the state -- a political battleground after major Democratic victories in November and January -- following his first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday. In the speech, he unveiled a sweeping $1.8 trillion proposal that would expand educational opportunities and child care for families, financed in part by the largest tax increases on wealthy Americans in decades.Biden defended the proposal – and a $2.25 trillion companion infrastructure plan that would be partly funded through higher corporate tax rates – as a “once in a generation investment in America” that would create millions of jobs.A 15% minimum “book tax” for US corporations, he said, would raise enough to “pay for all of this.”He also repeated a jab at the investment class included in his address to Congress. “Wall Street didn’t build this country,” he said. “You did. The middle class did. And unions built the middle class.”Biden was elected in part thanks to flipping Georgia to the Democratic column for the first time since 1992. Two Democrats, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, subsequently won a pair of runoff elections for the US Senate early this year, giving the party control of the chamber and allowing Biden to pass a $1.9 trillion relief measure without any Republican votes.“Because of you we passed one of the most consequential rescue bills in history,” Biden told his audience.The White House said more than 6.2 million adults in Georgia received stimulus checks thanks to the legislation, while the state received $8.6 billion in local and state fiscal relief.Biden had originally planned to hold his first rally in the state in March, but shootings in the Atlanta area that left eight people dead – six of whom were Asian women – led him to put off the event.Earlier Thursday, the president and first lady Jill Biden visited with Jimmy Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, at the former president’s home in Plains, Georgia. Jimmy Carter, 96, did not attend Biden’s inauguration because of health concerns during the coronavirus pandemic.The visit was closed to reporters accompanying the president and neither the Carters nor the Bidens spoke to the press afterward.Biden plans to continue promoting his spending proposals on Friday with a visit to Philadelphia’s 30th Street Station, where he’ll mark the 50th anniversary of Amtrak. When he was in the Senate, he regularly commuted from Delaware to Washington on the railroad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-joe-biden-says-tax-hikes-on-rich-will-fund-cuts-for-many-more-101619743532370.html
30-04-2021||World||US hopes its Covid-19 assistance has catalytic effect on countries coming to India's aid||The United States hopes its massive Covid-19 assistance to India has a catalytic effect on society and around the world to come to the country's aid as it fights a severe outbreak of Covid-19, officials said here.The US is delivering essential medical supplies worth more than USD 100 million to India in the coming days, State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters on Thursday.The first flight carrying relief materials left a US Air Force base in California on Wednesday."Our assistance, we hope, will have a catalytic effect on society more broadly here and around the world to come to the aid of the Indian people," Price said at his daily news conference.US state governments, private companies, non-governmental organisations, and thousands of Americans from across the country have mobilised to deliver vital oxygen-related equipment and essential supplies for Indian hospitals to support frontline healthcare workers and the people most affected during this current outbreak, he said."US government flights will start arriving in India tonight, and they will continue into next week. Just as India sent assistance to the United States when our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India and its time of need," Price added.White House Deputy Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One that the first assistance flights left the US for India on April 28.The planes carried the first tranche of the assistance, which includes oxygen cylinders, rapid diagnostic tests, and N95 masks to protect frontline workers, she said.Additional flights carrying the remaining assistance, including oxygen generators and concentrators, are scheduled to depart in the upcoming days, Jean-Pierre said.Responding to a question, Price said the rise in Covid-19 cases in India is a matter of concern.Since the start of this outbreak prior to the latest assistance, the United States had delivered some USD 19 million in support to India's public health system, he said."If we are to make progress against this current surge of cases in India, it can't be something that the Indian government tackles alone, it can't be something that the United States government tackles alone," the State Department spokesperson asserted."Everyone has a role to play, including the private sector, including the advocacy community, including civil society, and that's what you are seeking to do," Price said in response to another question.He added that the goal of both the Indian and the US governments is to ensure that this aid is put to immediate and effective use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-hopes-its-covid-19-assistance-has-catalytic-effect-on-countries-coming-to-india-s-aid-101619742643866.html
30-04-2021||World||Five US agencies may have been hacked through Ivanti flaws||The US Department of Homeland Security has determined that flaws in Ivanti Inc.’s products may have allowed hackers to breach at least five federal agencies.The Department’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, known as CISA, has been working with organizations targeted through vulnerabilities in Ivanti’s Pulse Connect Secure products and required federal civilian agencies to run a tool designed to find them.“CISA is aware of at least five federal civilian agencies who have run the Pulse Connect Secure Integrity Tool and identified indications of potential unauthorized access,” Matt Hartman, a deputy executive assistant director at CISA, said Thursday in a statement. “We are working with each agency to validate whether an intrusion has occurred and will offer incident response support accordingly.”Hartman didn’t identify the agencies. Reuters previously reported the suspected breaches in federal agencies.Hartman’s statement comes a week after CISA released an Emergency Directive requiring agencies using Pulse Connect Secure virtual private networks and other products to take steps to find and mitigate possible breaches. It also comes after another major cyber-attack on the digital supply chain in which Russian hackers inserted malicious code in software updates for Texas-based SolarWinds Corp.Nine US agencies and at least 100 companies were breached by the Russian hackers in that attack, which was made public in December.The US hasn’t attributed the cyber-activity to a specific hacking group. However, the cybersecurity firm FireEye Inc. recently found that hackers -- suspected to be based in China -- were using Pulse Secure virtual private networks to hack into dozens of organizations for apparent espionage purposes, according to Charles Carmakal, a senior vice president and chief technology officer at FireEye, who spoke to Bloomberg News in an interview last week.The Chinese Embassy in Washington didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.Ivanti said in a statement that it was working closely with CISA and cybersecurity experts “to investigate and respond quickly to malicious activity that was identified on a very limited number of customer systems.”“The Pulse team took swift action to provide mitigations directly to the limited number of impacted customers that remediates the risk to their system, and we plan to issue a software update within the next few days,” the company said.Organizations targeted by the hackers through Pulse Secure flaws spanned financial services, government and defense contracting in the U.S. and Europe, Carmakal said. Since then, analysts at FireEye have observed additional victims including transportation, energy, professional services and telecommunications organizations.“This is a pretty big deal from a national security perspective,” Carmakal said in the interview. He said there has been a significant spike in China-linked hacking in the U.S. this year, including widespread attacks that leveraged flaws in Microsoft Corp.’s Exchange software for email.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/five-us-agencies-may-have-been-hacked-through-ivanti-flaws-101619743009056.html
30-04-2021||World||We’re not to blame for border tensions with India, says Chinese defence ministry||Beijing is not responsible for the current border friction with India, the Chinese defence ministry said on Thursday even as it warned New Delhi against teaming up with foreign powers to make a show of its maritime strength.New Delhi has repeatedly dismissed Beijing’s attempts to blame India for the ongoing border tensions in eastern Ladakh, saying the People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) troops were the first to illegally trespass across the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in May last year.The Chinese foreign and defence ministries, however, have continued to blame the Indian Army for crossing the LAC.“Regarding the situations in the western section of the China-India boundary, China has explained the ins and outs in detail, and the responsibility does not lie with China,” Senior Colonel Wu Qian, Chinese defence ministry spokesperson, said on Thursday.Wu was responding to a question on a comment made by India’s Chief of Defence Staff General Bipin Rawat at the Raisina Dialogue earlier this month, where he said India had stood firm in preventing a change of status quo on the northern borders and New Delhi proved it will not get pushed under any pressure, in context of the border tensions with China.Wu “rebutted” Rawat’s statement, China’s official military portal reported. “The relevant remarks by the Indian side are completely inconsistent with the facts,” Wu said.Wu said that because of the joint efforts of China and India, the border defence troops of both sides have recently disengaged from contact in the Galwan Valley and Pangong Lake areas, and the situation in the border area has eased.Wu added that India will “cherish the hard-won situation” and work with China to safeguard peace and tranquility in the border areas.Wu also warned against “ganging up” against China in context of the “La Pérouse” naval exercise held in the Bay of Bengal in the first week of April.India and three other members of the Quad - the US, Australia and Japan - took part in the three-day drill led by France.Wu said China had taken note of the exercise and hopes that countries involved in it would do more things conducive to peace and stability “instead of forming gangs” to show off their military power and to promote regional militarisation.The La Pérouse, a multilateral joint naval exercise, was a training drill involving five countries in which eight ships took part.The defence ministry spokesperson’s statement on an exercise held in the Bay of Bengal gives an idea about Beijing’s ambitions about its maritime power and reach.His comments come days after China launched three large warships on the same day -the Hainan, China’s first Type 075 amphibious assault ship; the Dalian, a large destroyer; and the Changzheng 18, a nuclear-powered strategic ballistic missile submarine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/were-not-to-blame-for-border-tensions-with-india-says-chinese-defence-ministry-101619724644684.html
