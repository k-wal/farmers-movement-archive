The UK is “on track” to offer a first vaccine dose to all adults by the end of July, he said.The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said 79 people among the more than 20 million who have received the Astra shot in Britain had suffered rare blood clots, 19 of whom had died. But while it found a “reasonably plausible link” to the vaccine, it did not block its usage.“No effective medicine or vaccine is without risk,” MHRA Chief Executive Officer June Raine told reporters.Instead, the government’s vaccine advisory committee recommended that people aged 18 to 29 should be offered an alternative vaccine where possible.The decision was a crucial one for Boris Johnson’s government, not least because Astra’s vaccine -- which was developed with Oxford University -- is the workhorse of the program and is made in the UK Meeting the inoculation target is also central to his ambition to fully reopen the economy on June 21.UK Recommends Not Using AstraZeneca Vaccine on Those Under 30The concern now will be whether confidence has been knocked in the Astra vaccine among people aged over 30 -- just as ministers prepare to unlock restaurants and shops that have been shuttered for months next week.Shops and hairdressers in England are due to reopen on Monday, but the reopening of indoor hospitality and entertainment in mid-May, as well as international travel, is dependent on the vaccine program continuing at pace.For those under 30, the immediately available alternative to Astra is the Pfizer-BioNtech vaccine, which has been in circulation since December. The UK began the rollout of Moderna Inc.’s vaccine on Wednesday.The Johnson & Johnson vaccine, which only requires one shot rather than two like the others, could become available “over the summer,” Jonathan Van Tam, England’s deputy chief medical officer, said at the briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-govt-insists-vaccine-program-on-track-despite-astrazeneca-restriction-101617818234477.html

Celebratory music played in the background throughout the incident.In a Facebook post on Monday, De Silva said she was not divorced but separated, writing in Sinhala: "If I wasn't fit at the beginning of this tournament they could have removed me."The prize was returned to her on Tuesday at a news conference, after pageant organisers confirmed she was not a divorcee. They have also apologised to her.The winner of the Mrs Sri Lanka contest goes on to compete in the Mrs World contest. Jurie, who won that competition in 2020 in Las Vegas, could not immediately be reached for comment via her social media pages.The official Mrs. World Instagram account acknowledged De Silva's victory in a brief post with her photo on Tuesday."A true queen is not a woman who snatches another woman's crown, but a woman who secretly sets another woman's crown!!" De Silva said in her post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/crowned-de-crowned-crowned-again-chaos-at-sri-lankan-beauty-pageant-101617816221270.html

07-04-2021||World||Backlash after Pakistan PM Imran Khan links rape to how women dress||Pakistan rights campaigners have accused Prime Minister Imran Khan of "baffling ignorance" after the former playboy cricketer blamed how women dress for a rise in rape cases.In a weekend interview on live television, Oxford-educated Khan said an increase in rapes indicated the "consequences in any society where vulgarity is on the rise"."The incidents of rape of women... (have) actually very rapidly increased in society," he said.He advised women to cover up to prevent temptation."This entire concept of purdah is to avoid temptation, not everyone has the willpower to avoid it," he said, using a term that can refer to modest dress or the segregation of the sexes.Hundreds have signed a statement circulating online Wednesday calling Khan's comments "factually incorrect, insensitive and dangerous"."Fault rests solely with the rapist and the system that enables the rapist, including a culture fostered by statements such as those made by (Khan)," the statement said.The Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, an independent rights watchdog, said Tuesday it was "appalled" by the comments."Not only does this betray a baffling ignorance of where, why and how rape occurs, but it also lays the blame on rape survivors, who, as the government must know, can range from young children to victims of honour crimes," it said.Pakistan is a deeply conservative country where victims of sexual abuse are often viewed with suspicion and criminal complaints are rarely seriously investigated.Much of the country lives under an "honour" code where women who bring "shame" on the family can be subjected to violence or murder.It regularly ranks among the worst places in the world for gender equality.Nationwide protests erupted last year when a police chief admonished a gang-rape victim for driving at night without a male companion.The Franco-Pakistani mother was assaulted in front of her children on the side of a motorway after her car ran out of fuel.Last year, Khan was also criticised after another television appearance where he failed to challenge a Muslim cleric's insistence that coronavirus had been unleashed because of the wrongdoings of women.The latest controversy comes as the organisers behind International Women's Day marches battle what they have called a coordinated disinformation campaign against them, including doctored images and videos circulated online.It has led to blasphemy accusations -- a hugely sensitive issue in Pakistan where allegations have previously led mobs to attack people.The organisers of the annual rally have called for the prime minister to intervene.In his weekend TV appearance, Khan also blamed divorce rates in Britain on the "sex, drugs and rock and roll" culture that began in the 1970s, when the twice-divorced Khan was gaining a reputation in London as a playboy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/backlash-after-pakistan-pm-imran-khan-links-rape-to-how-women-dress-101617814765217.html

Mud tumbled down from surrounding hills early on Sunday, catching people at sleep. Some were swept away by flash floods after overnight rains caused rivers to burst their banks.On nearby Lembata island, the downpour triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja sent solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November to crash down on more than a dozen villages, killing at least 32 and leaving 35 unaccounted for, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.Hundreds of police, soldiers and residents dug through the debris with their bare hands, shovels and hoes searching for those buried. Relatives wailed Wednesday as they watched rescuers pull out a mud-caked body, place it on a bamboo stretcher and take it away for burial.“Please find my father and mother who are still buried ... whatever their condition,” Suzanna Tasoin cried to rescuers struggling to dig up tons of volcanic materials and rocks with farm tools at Waimatan village on Lembata island, “We want to bury them with the respect they deserve.”In all, landslides and flooding have killed at least 126 across several islands in Indonesia as well as 27 people in neighbouring East Timor. Thousands of homes have been damaged and thousands of people displaced by the weather, which is expected to continue until at least Friday as the storm moves south toward Australia.Rescue efforts were being hampered by the rains and the remoteness of the area, where roads and bridges were damaged in many places.Rescue personnel with excavators and tons of food and medicine were being deployed from Makassar city on Sulawesi island, but were hindered by bad weather and extremely high waves.Five helicopters were helping to reach isolated areas of the islands, National Disaster Mitigation Agency chief Doni Monardo told reporters late Wednesday.He said evacuees were in dire need of basic necessities such as blankets, mats, tents, baby food and medical services.The government provided tens of thousands of anti-coronavirus masks, and Monardo said authorities would set up health posts at refugee camps to test people for the virus.He said six navy ships, including a hospital ship, carrying more goods were expected to arrive on Friday to relieve overwhelmed hospitals and clinics in East Nusa Tenggara, one of Indonesia's poorest provinces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dozens-missing-death-toll-climbs-to-140-in-indonesia-landslides-101617813592708.html
07-04-2021||World||Russia ready to supply military equipment to Pakistan, hold more drills: Lavrov||Russia stands ready to supply special military equipment to Pakistan to strengthen its counter-terrorism capabilities, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said on Wednesday as Islamabad rolled out the red carpet for the visiting leader. Lavrov, who travelled to Islamabad from New Delhi, also spoke of Russia’s plans to conduct more military and naval exercises with Pakistan and to further deepen bilateral ties. Lavrov also met Pakistan Army chief Gen Qamar Bajwa and Prime Minister Imran Khan, who raised the Kashmir issue during their talks. Foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi personally received Lavrov – the first senior Russian leader to travel to Pakistan in almost a decade – at the airport on his arrival on Tuesday, signalling the importance attached to the visit by Islamabad. “We’ve confirmed that we stand ready to strengthen the anti-terrorist potential of Pakistan, including by supplying Pakistan with special military equipment. This serves the interests of all states of the region,” Lavrov said during a joint news conference with Qureshi after their meeting on Wednesday. “We also agreed that we need to further conduct exercises and drills in the mountains called Druzhba (friendship) and maritime exercises called the Arabian Monsoon,” he added. The Druzbha exercise between the Pakistani and Russian militaries, which began in 2016, usually features special forces from both sides. A Russian Army contingent visited Pakistan last November for the latest edition of the drill. Russia had angered India by supplying a limited number of Mi-35M helicopter gunships to Pakistan in 2018. Lavrov’s comments about potential supplies of special military equipment, even to bolster Pakistan’s counter-terrorism capabilities, are unlikely to go down well in New Delhi, which perceives such arms deals as a provocation. Without directly referring to the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue that includes India, Australia, Japan and the US, Lavrov took a swipe at US-backed strategies that he said were affecting stability in the Asia-Pacific region. Lavrov has been critical of the Indo-Pacific concept, which is the focus of the Quad. Noting that he and Qureshi had discussed the situation in the Asia-Pacific, Lavrov said: “Here we see uncertain processes that happen because the US promotes divisive strategies that change everything and the stability in the region. We are categorically against new division lines. Instead we promote the preservation of those structures that have been here, including the key role of Asean.” There was no immediate reaction from Indian officials to Lavrov’s comments. Enhanced defence and security cooperation also figured in Lavrov’s meeting with Pakistan Army chief Gen Bajwa. According to a readout from the Pakistani military’s media arm, Bajwa said that “Pakistan values its relations with Russia and reciprocates the desire for enhanced bilateral military cooperation”. Bajwa welcomed all initiatives to bring peace and stability to Afghanistan. “We have no hostile designs towards any country and will keep on working towards a cooperative regional framework based on sovereign equality and mutual progress,” he said. Both Qureshi and Prime Minister Khan raised the Kashmir issue in their discussions with Lavrov. Qureshi said at the joint news conference that he had told Lavrov about the “fragility of the situation on our border with India” and concerns about the situation in Jammu and Kashmir and human rights issues. However, Qureshi also acknowledged that tensions with India had reduced after the Indian and Pakistan armies recommitted themselves to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in February. During his meeting with Lavrov, Khan underlined the importance that Pakistan attaches to relations with Russia as a “key foreign policy priority”, and expressed satisfaction at “steady growth in bilateral ties, including deepening cooperation in trade, energy, security and defence”, according to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office. “With reference to the situation in [Jammu and Kashmir], the Prime Minister shared Pakistan’s perspective on issues of peace and security in South Asia, including the need for peaceful resolution of the Jammu and Kashmir dispute,” the statement said. Lavrov said at the joint news conference that he and Qureshi had touched upon the fact that India and Pakistan have started talks on the normalisation of relations. “We welcome that,” he said. The reception given to Lavrov in Islamabad was in contrast to his brief visit to New Delhi, where he only held talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. Lavrov didn’t meet the Indian prime minister - usually a part of any senior Russian leader’s visit to New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-ready-to-supply-military-equipment-to-pakistan-hold-more-drills-lavrov-101617812548628.html
07-04-2021||World||UK to offer non-AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine to under-30s over blood clot link||The U.K. recommended not using AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine on those under the age of 30 after drug regulators there and in the European Union highlighted a possible link with a rare type of blood clot in the brain.The assessments follow an increasing number of reports of side effects in people who’ve received the Astra dose. Despite this, both the U.K. and EU agencies agreed that the benefits of the shot outweigh the risks.In its latest recommendation, the European Medicines Agency said that “unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be listed as very rare side effects.” The U.K. is advising that those under 30 be offered an alternative to Astra if one is available.The latest assessments of the Astra vaccine, which was developed with the University of Oxford, comes amid increasing public wariness about the shot, with patients from Bucharest to Calais canceling scheduled appointments as they await more clarity.The warning could threaten the European Union’s vaccination campaign, which was just beginning to kick into a higher gear after a sluggish start. EU health ministers will meet this evening to discuss the path forward with AstraEMA Executive Director Emer Cooke tried to counter any public worries by pointing out that the vaccine is vital in fighting a virus that’s causing “thousands of deaths” every day. June Raine, chief executive of the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, stressed that the specific clotting side effects were very rare.“Covid-19 is a very serious disease with high hospitalization and death rates,” Cooke said at a press conference. “This vaccine has proven to be highly effective. It prevents severe disease and hospitalization and it is saving lives.”Also Read | AstraZeneca Covid vaccine possibly linked to rare blood clots: EU drug regulatorConcerns about the vaccine are centered on an unusual type of blood clot in the brain called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. It has occurred together with low levels of blood platelets after vaccination.“These clotting disorders are very rare side effects of the vaccine,” said Sabine Strauss, the head of the EMA’s safety committee. The group hasn’t identified a “definite cause” or a patient profile that would be most at risk, according to Strauss.The EMA’s safety committee based its latest analysis on a review of 84 cases of clotting, with most to the brain area, that had been reported by March 22 -- by which point 25 million people in the U.K. and Europe had received the Astra shot.By April 4, the reported clotting instances had increased to 222 -- again, with most to the brain area -- out of 34 million people who’d received the shot. Those updated figures do not change the agency’s recommendation, it said.Generally speaking, these clots occur most commonly in women between the ages of 30 and 45, EMA officials have said, a group that in the EU has been disproportionately vaccinated with Astra’s shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-offer-non-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-to-under-30s-over-blood-clot-link-101617807529451.html

The visas were issued as a special gesture by the Pakistan government in “view of the importance of Baisakhi for Punjabis and Sikhs marking the start of their new year”, the Pakistan high commission said on Wednesday.The move comes amid a perceived thaw in bilateral relations about the time that Indian and Pakistani militaries began adhering to the 2003 ceasefire on the Line of Control (LoC) in Jammu and Kashmir in February. The Pakistan government recently deferred a move to import cotton and sugar from India in order to control prices and overcome a domestic shortage after facing opposition from some federal ministers. The Pakistan high commission extended special felicitations to those celebrating Baisakhi and hoped the visiting pilgrims would have a “fulfilling yatra”.Under the framework of the India-Pakistan Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines of 1974, a large number of Sikh pilgrims from India visit Pakistan to observe various religious festivals and occasions every year. The issuance of pilgrimage visas is part of the Pakistan government’s efforts for facilitating visits to religious shrines, the high commission said. “This also reflects the commitment of the government of Pakistan to faithfully implement the bilateral Protocol on Visits to Religious Shrines,” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-issues-visas-to-over-1-100-indian-pilgrims-101617805227864.html
07-04-2021||World||AstraZeneca Covid vaccine possibly linked to rare blood clots: EU drug regulator||The EU’s drug regulator on Wednesday said that the reported cases of blood clotting should be listed as a possible side effect of AstraZeneca's vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). "One plausible explanation for the combination of blood clots and low blood platelets is an immune response, leading to a condition similar to one seen sometimes in patients treated with heparin," the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.The findings come at a time when countries around the world are trying to intensify their vaccination drive amid a fresh wave of infections. However, the health agency reiterated that the benefits of AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine in preventing the disease outweigh the overall risk. It also didn't place any age restrictions on administering the vaccine in the younger population, as some countries have done.“The risk of mortality from Covid is much greater than the risk of mortality from these side effects,” Emer Cooke, the agency's executive director, told a press briefing.Also Read | AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine risk-benefit 'still largely positive': WHOSeveral European countries have temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine amid concerns over the reports of blood clotting in vaccinated individuals. The Netherlands halted vaccination in people under the age of 60 as a "precautionary measure" following the death of a woman who had received an AstraZeneca shot. France, Germany, and Sweden are among the European nations restricting AstraZeneca use in younger people, while Denmark and Norway have completely paused its use. Last week, the UK’s medicine regulator confirmed the death of seven individuals from unusual blood clots after they were administered with AstraZeneca vaccine. At least 79 cases of blood clots were reported in Britain as of March 31, according to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), triggering fresh concerns over a possible link between cases of blood coagulation and the AstraZeneca vaccine. The UK’s drug regulator is set to address safety concerns surrounding AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine separately on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-vaccine-possibly-linked-to-blood-clot-event-eu-drug-regulator-101617804772514.html
07-04-2021||World||UK to brief on AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine as safety concerns grow||The U.K.’s drug regulator will address safety concerns surrounding AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine on Wednesday, as fears grow that the government’s inoculation targets will be put at risk.Representatives from the U.K.’s Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency and the government’s vaccine committee will speak at 3 p.m., at the same time as the European Medicines Agency holds its own press briefing.They will update on their investigations into potential links between the AstraZeneca vaccine, which was developed with Oxford University, and rare cases of brain blood clots in adults. On Tuesday, a trial of the Astra vaccine among children was paused to await the findings of the U.K. review.It comes as a vaccine by Moderna Inc. began to be rolled out in the U.K. for the first time, the third approved coronavirus shot alongside those from Astra and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE. The U.K. has ordered 17 million doses of Moderna’s two-shot vaccine, enough for 8.5 million people.The success of the vaccine program is crucial to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ambition to fully reopen the U.K. economy on June 21. The U.K. has ordered 100 million doses of the Astra vaccine, and 40 million doses of Pfizer.TargetsConcerns are growing that a setback with the Astra shot could mean the U.K. misses its target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July, although the government insists it remains on track.The pound extended losses ahead of the briefing, hitting its weakest level against the euro in a month.U.K. ministers have repeatedly said the benefits of the vaccine in preventing coronavirus far outweigh any risks.‘No Proof’“There is no proof as yet that there is any causal links on the very, very rare occasions that there have been talks about blood clots,” Business Minister Paul Scully told Sky News on Wednesday. “The AstraZeneca vaccine is safe; it has saved thousands of lives.”But some scientists have urged caution while investigations are carried out. Maggie Wearmouth, a member of the U.K.’s Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization, suggested that “perhaps slowing things down” might be wise.Speaking in a personal capacity, she told the Daily Telegraph: “The issue is about safety and public confidence. We don’t want to cover anything up that we feel that the public should be knowing.”Adam Finn from the University of Bristol, also a member of the JCVI, said it was possible that Moderna or other vaccines could be reserved for younger groups in case Astra’s use was restricted.‘On Track’Vaccination centers and pharmacies are facing a “significant reduction” in supply of doses during April, meaning that older people waiting for second doses will be prioritized over younger people getting their first shot.The pace of the rollout across England is now estimated at an average of 2.7 million doses a week until the end of July -- “considerably slower” than a previous forecast of 3.2 million a week, according to a modeling paper from scientists on a government advisory committee.“There will be a slight reduction in April, but the key thing to remember is that that doesn’t mean that we’re not on track to meet our pledges,” said Johnson’s official spokesman Jamie Davies.The U.K. remains “on track” to offer a first dose to all over-50s by April 15, and to all adults by the end of July, he added.Johnson Faces Political Fight Over U.K. Covid Passports PlanThree in five adults in the U.K. have been vaccinated so far and the most recent government data shows that more than 31.6 million people have received a first dose, and 5.5 million have had a second dose.On a visit on Tuesday to an Astra manufacturing plant in Macclesfield, northwest England, Johnson urged people to keep getting their shots: “keep going out there, get your jab, get your second jab.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-brief-on-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-as-safety-concerns-grow-101617802762388.html
07-04-2021||World||US disbursed over 150 million stimulus payments in Biden relief plan||The Biden administration has officially distributed more than 150 million stimulus checks as of Wednesday from the $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill, one of the key benchmarks the president had hoped to hit during his first 100 days in office.The Treasury Department and the Internal Revenue Service have sent out roughly 156 million payments to people, totaling roughly $372 billion, according to the Treasury Department. The majority of these latest payments went to Social Security recipients and beneficiaries, providing a cash infusion more than a year into the pandemic.During the transition, Biden aides said the president’s chief goals for his first 100 days in office included distributing relief checks, re-opening schools and heightening the pace of vaccinations. On Tuesday, the White House announced it had surpassed its goal of delivering 150 million shots to Americans since he first took office. Originally, the White House had set a goal of delivering 100 million inoculations during the first 100 days.This is the fourth block of relief checks the federal government has sent since the president signed the American Rescue Plan, and this one includes 25 million payments for a total value of $36 billion.The largest group of recipients in this batch is Social Security beneficiaries who did not file tax returns in 2019 or 2020; this includes people who receive Social Security retirement, survivor or disability benefits. Other payments went to Americans on Supplemental Security Income and Railroad Retirement Board beneficiaries.The IRS sent the checks weeks after the agency first started to process payments for other Americans, a delay which annoyed Democrats on Capitol Hill.Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee have been urging the IRS to expedite the payments, arguing they unnecessary delays hurt vulnerable Americans. The delay in payments for about 30 million Social Security beneficiaries stemmed from the Social Security Administration not sending the IRS an updated list of eligible people until March 25, according to House Democrats.The majority of people who receive their payments -- 25 million of them -- will do so through direct deposit, whereas more than 1 million people will receive paper checks. The Treasury Department and IRS started to process the payments on Friday, April 2, for an official payment date of April 7.Veterans Affairs beneficiaries are to receive their payments on April 14.The IRS has an online tool for people to check the status of their payment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-disbursed-over-150-million-stimulus-payments-in-biden-relief-plan-101617798221615.html
07-04-2021||World||North Korea tells WHO it's still coronavirus-free||Isolated North Korea has continued to claim a perfect record in keeping out the coronavirus in its latest report to the World Health Organisation.At the beginning of the pandemic more than a year ago, North Korea described its efforts to keep out the virus as a “matter of national existence.”It shut its borders, banned tourists and jetted out diplomats. It still severely limits cross-border traffic and has quarantined tens of thousands of people who have shown symptoms.But it still says it has found no case of COVID-19, a widely doubted claim given its poor health infrastructure and a porous border with China, its economic lifeline.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageIn an email to The Associated Press on Wednesday, Edwin Salvador, WHO's representative to North Korea, said the North has reported it tested 23,121 people for the coronavirus from the beginning of the pandemic to April 1 and that all results were negative. Salvador said the North said 732 people were tested between March 26 and April 1.WHO officials say the North is no longer providing the UN agency with the number of people it quarantines with suspected symptoms.North Korea said Tuesday it would skip the Tokyo Olympics to protect athletes from the “world public health crisis caused by COVID-19.”The UN-backed programme to ship COVID-19 vaccines worldwide said in February that North Korea could receive 1.9 million vaccine doses in the first half of this year.However, COVAX has since warned of global shortages because the Serum Institute of India, which is licensed to produce the AstraZeneca vaccine, is putting its supplies into domestic demand while India's virus caseload is surging.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/north-korea-tells-who-it-s-still-coronavirusfree-101617797013060.html
07-04-2021||World||US military cites rising risk of Chinese move against Taiwan||The American military is warning that China is probably accelerating its timetable for capturing control of Taiwan, the island democracy that has been the chief source of tension between Washington and Beijing for decades and is widely seen as the most likely trigger for a potentially catastrophic U.S.-China war.The worry about Taiwan comes as China wields new strength from years of military buildup. It has become more aggressive with Taiwan and more assertive in sovereignty disputes in the South China Sea. Beijing also has become more confrontational with Washington; senior Chinese officials traded sharp and unusually public barbs with Secretary of State Antony Blinken in talks in Alaska last month.A military move against Taiwan, however, would be a test of U.S. support for the island that Beijing views as a breakaway province. For the Biden administration, it could present the choice of abandoning a friendly, democratic entity or risking what could become an all-out war over a cause that is not on the radar of most Americans. The United States has long pledged to help Taiwan defend itself, but it has deliberately left unclear how far it would go in response to a Chinese attack.This accumulation of concerns meshes with the administration’s view that China is a frontline challenge for the United States and that more must be done soon — militarily, diplomatically and by other means — to deter Beijing as it seeks to supplant the United States as the predominant power in Asia. Some American military leaders see Taiwan as potentially the most immediate flashpoint.“We have indications that the risks are actually going up," Adm. Philip Davidson, the most senior U.S. military commander in the Asia-Pacific region, told a Senate panel last month, referring to a Chinese military move on Taiwan.“The threat is manifest during this decade — in fact, in the next six years,” Davidson said.Days later, Davidson's expected successor, Adm. John Aquilino, declined to back up the six-year timeframe but told senators at his confirmation hearing: "My opinion is, this problem is much closer to us than most think.”Biden administration officials have spoken less pointedly but stress the intention to deepen ties with Taiwan, eliciting warnings from Beijing against outsider interference in what it considers a domestic matter.On Wednesday, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu said the military threat against his country is increasing, and while he said it was not yet “particularly alarming,” the Chinese military in the last couple of years has been conducting what he called “real combat-type” exercises closer to the island.“We are willing to defend ourselves, that’s without any question,” Wu told reporters. “We will fight a war if we need to fight a war, and if we need to defend ourselves to the very last day, then we will defend ourselves to the very last day.“Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin calls China the “pacing threat” for the United States, and the military services are adjusting accordingly. The Marine Corps, for example, is reshaping itself with China and Russia in mind after two decades of ground-focused combat against extremists in the Middle East.Hardly an aspect of China's military modernization has failed to rile the U.S. military. Adm. Charles Richard, who as head of U.S. Strategic Command is responsible for U.S. nuclear forces, wrote in a recent essay that China is on track to be a “strategic peer” of the United States. He said China's nuclear weapons stockpile is expected to double “if not triple or quadruple" in the next 10 years, although that goes beyond the Pentagon's official view that the stockpile will “at least double” in that period.Taiwan, however, is seen as the most pressing problem.U.S. officials have noted People’s Liberation Army actions that seem designed to rattle Taiwan. For example, Chinese aerial incursions, including flying around the island, are a near-daily occurrence, serving to advertise the threat, wear down Taiwanese pilots and aircraft and learn more about Taiwan’s capabilities.Chinese officials have scoffed at Davidson's Taiwan comments. A Ministry of Defense spokesman, Col. Ren Guoqiang, urged Washington to “abandon zero-peace thinking” and do more to build mutual trust and stability. He said that “attempts by outside forces to use Taiwan to seek to restrain China, or the use by Taiwan independence forces to use military means to achieve independence, are all dead ends.”The implications of a Chinese military move against Taiwan and its 23 million people are so profound and potentially grave that Beijing and Washington have long managed a fragile middle ground — Taiwanese political autonomy that precludes control by Beijing but stops short of formal independence.Predictions of when China might decide to try to compel Taiwan to reunite with the mainland have long varied, and there is no uniform view in the United States. Larry Diamond, a senior fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, said last week he doubts Chinese leaders are ready to force the issue.“I don’t think it’s coming soon,” he said.The Trump administration made a series of moves to demonstrate a stronger commitment to Taiwan, including sending a Cabinet member to Taipei last year, making him the highest-level U.S. official to visit the island since formal diplomatic relations were severed in 1979 in deference to China. The Biden administration says it wants to cooperate with China where possible but has voiced its objections to a wide range of Chinese actions.Last week, the U.S. ambassador to the Pacific island nation of Palau, John Hennessey-Niland, became the first serving U.S. ambassador to visit Taiwan since Washington cut ties with Taipei in favor of Beijing.China is a frequent target of criticism in Congress. Concerns about countering its growing military might are reflected in passage of the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, funded at $2.2 billion for 2021. Davidson wants it to support, among other initiatives, establishing a better air defense system to protect the U.S. territory of Guam from Chinese missiles and preserving U.S. military dominance in the region.Rep. Adam Smith, a Washington Democrat and chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, is skeptical of the military's fixation on dominance.“Given the way the world works now, having one country be dominant is just hopelessly unrealistic,” he said in a recent online forum sponsored by Meridian, a nonpartisan diplomacy center. He said the U.S. military can maintain sufficient strength, in partnership with allies, to send the message: “China, don't invade Taiwan because the price you're going to pay for that isn't worth it.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-military-cites-rising-risk-of-chinese-move-against-taiwan-101617795699110.html

"It extended a very courteous welcome to both presidents and strictly adhered to international protocol."In the past, three chairs were provided when the Turkish leader visited Brussels for talks with the heads of the Commission and the European Council, which collectively represents the bloc's 27 member states.Mamer said von der Leyen decided not to make "an issue out of it" and in the conversation brought up women's rights and the Istanbul Convention on violence against women, from which Turkey withdrew last month.Ties between Brussels and Ankara have been strained since a coup attempt in 2016 prompted a crackdown on civil rights in Turkey, but they are now testing a cautious rapprochement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-commission-head-ursula-von-der-leyen-taken-aback-as-erdogan-and-her-colleague-snap-up-the-chairs-101617794901289.html
07-04-2021||World||Iranian ship said to be Revolutionary Guard base in Red Sea off Yemen attacked||An Iranian ship believed to be a base for the paramilitary Revolutionary Guard and anchored for years in the Red Sea off Yemen has been attacked, Tehran acknowledged Wednesday.Iran's Foreign Ministry confirmed the attack on the MV Saviz, suspected to have been carried out by Israel — though Tehran did not immediately blamed its regional archenemy. The assault came as Iran and world powers sat down in Vienna for the first talks about the U.S. potentially rejoining the tattered deal aimed at curbing Iran’s nuclear program, showing events outside the negotiations could derail those efforts.The ship's long presence in the region, repeatedly criticized by Saudi Arabia, has come as the West and United Nations experts say Iran has provided arms and support to Yemen's Houthi rebels in that country's yearslong war. Iran denies arming the Houthis, though components found in the rebels' weaponry link back to Tehran.Iran previously described the Saviz as aiding in “anti-piracy” efforts in the Red Sea and the Bab el-Mandeb strait, a crucial chokepoint in international shipping. A statement attributed to Foreign Ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh described the ship as a commercial vessel.“Fortunately, no casualties were reported ... and technical investigations are underway," Khatibzadeh said. "Our country will take all necessary measures through international authorities.”In an earlier state TV statement, an anchor cited a New York Times story, which quoted an anonymous U.S. official telling the newspaper that Israel informed America it carried out an attack Tuesday morning on the vessel. Israeli officials declined to comment about the assault when reached by The Associated Press, as did the Saviz's owner.Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz, while refusing to say if his country launched the attack, described Iran and its regional allies as a major threat.“Israel must continue to defend itself,” Gantz told journalists. “Any place we find an operational challenge and necessity, we will continue to act.”Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the Vienna talks a “success” while speaking to his Cabinet on Wednesday.“Today, one united statement is being heard that all sides of the nuclear deal have concluded that there is no better solution than the deal,” he said.Iran's semiofficial Tasnim news agency, believed to be close to the Guard, reported that a limpet mine planted on Saviz's hull caused the blast. A limpet mine is a type of naval mine that is attached to the side of a ship, usually by a diver. It later explodes, and can significantly damage a vessel. Iran did not blame anyone for the attack and said Iranian officials likely would offer more information in the coming days.In a statement, the U.S. military’s Central Command only said it was “aware of media reporting of an incident involving the Saviz in the Red Sea.”“We can confirm that no U.S. forces were involved in the incident,” the command said. “We have no additional information to provide.”The Saviz, owned by the state-linked Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping Lines, came to the Red Sea in late 2016, according to ship-tracking data. In the years since, it has drifted off the Dahlak archipelago, a chain of islands off the coast of the African nation of Eritrea. It likely received supply replenishments and switched crew via passing Iranian vessels using the waterway.Briefing materials from the Saudi military earlier obtained by the AP showed men on the vessel dressed in military-style fatigues, as well as small boats capable of ferrying cargo to the Yemeni coast. Those materials also included pictures showing a variety of antennas on the vessel that the Saudi government described as unusual for a commercial cargo ship, suggesting it conducted electronic surveillance. Other images showed the ship had mounts for .50-caliber machine guns.The Washington Institute for Near-East Policy has called the Saviz an “Iranian mothership” in the region, similarly describing it as an intelligence-gathering base and an armory for the Guard. Policy papers from the institute don't explain how they came to that conclusion, though its analysts routinely have access to Gulf and Israeli military sources.The Saviz had been under international sanctions until Iran's 2015 nuclear deal with world powers, which saw Tehran receive relief from sanctions in exchange for limiting its enrichment of uranium. The Trump administration later renewed American sanctions on the Saviz as part of its decision to unilaterally withdraw from the accord.In June 2019, Saudi Arabia flew a critically ill Iranian off the Saviz after Tehran made a request through the United Nations for assistance.Amid the wider tensions between the U.S. and Iran, a series of mysterious blasts have targeted ships in the region, including some the U.S. Navy blamed on Iran. Among the ships damaged recently was an Israeli-owned car carrier in an attack Netanyahu blamed on Iran. Another was an Iranian cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea.Iran also has blamed Israel for a recent series of attacks, including a mysterious explosion in July that destroyed an advanced centrifuge assembly plant at its Natanz nuclear facility. Another is the November killing of Mohsen Fakhrizadeh, a top Iranian scientist who founded the Islamic Republic’s military nuclear program two decades ago.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iranian-ship-said-to-be-revolutionary-guard-base-in-red-sea-off-yemen-attacked-101617794061344.html

If we need to open fire, we open fire."The Pratas lie at the top end of the disputed waterway, and have become a relatively new source of intrigue between Chinese-claimed Taiwan and Beijing.In recent months Taiwan has complained of repeated Chinese air force activity near the islands, which Taiwan's Coast Guard only lightly defends though there are periodic deployments of marines. There is no permanent civilian population, only occasional visiting scientists.In October, Hong Kong air traffic controllers warned off a Taiwanese civilian flight flying to the Pratas on a routine weekly supply run, forcing it to turn back.The Pratas, the closest Taiwan-controlled territory to Hong Kong, have also taken on extra significance since anti-government protests began in the Chinese-run city.Taiwan has intercepted at least one boat close to the Pratas carrying people fleeing from Hong Kong trying to make their way to Taiwan.Taiwan's other main South China Sea island is Itu Aba, also known as Taiping Island, which is part of the Spratly archipelago.Lee said they have not spotted Chinese drones there.Apart from China and Taiwan, Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam also have competing claims for islands and features in the South China Sea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/may-shoot-down-chinese-drones-in-south-china-sea-taiwan-101617793697324.html
07-04-2021||World||China’s new way to support Xinjiang ‘forced labour’ cotton: Blur out Western brand logos||Amid a huge backlash in China against Western fashion brands over Xinjiang cotton row, Chinese TV stations have found a new way to show support for the controversial way to produce cotton - blurring out Western brand logos in their programmes. According to a BBC report, the post-production editors of various shows are now censoring everything from T-shirts to shoes, leading to delay in some broadcasts.Last month, China launched a PR war on Western brands, including H&M, Nike and Adidas, that were critical of human rights abuses against Uyghurs and other minorities in the Xinjiang region. The controversy kicked off after a due diligence report of H&M, released in October 2020, was recently translated and circulated on the Chinese microblogging platform Weibo.In the report, the Swedish clothing company had referred to the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI)’s statement on cotton from Xinjiang. BCI, a non-profit group promoting sustainable cotton production, had announced the suspension of its activities, citing "increasing risks" of forced labour. H&M maintains on its website that it neither works with any garment manufacturing factories located in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region (XUAR) nor sources products from the region, one of the world's top cotton-producing areas.Also Read | A statement by Nike, H&M on Uighurs. One year later, a backlash by BeijingThe stance of Western fashion retailers over rights abuses in Xinjiang triggered massive outrage on social media. Chinese celebrities jumped on the bandwagon and severed ties with Western brands to express support for Xinjiang cotton. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told reporters at a regular briefing that Chinese people won’t allow “foreigners to eat China's rice while smashing its bowls.”Blurring out brand logos on television programmes is the latest way to show support for Xinjiang cotton which, according to BBC, has led to “unintentionally funny results.” In episodes of the show ‘Sisters Who Make Waves’, the blurred out shoes of actors and singers give an impression as if they are floating on clouds.Contestants of a reality show Chuang 2021 had worn clothes with Western logos from head to toe, eventually leaving no option for post-production editors other than blurring out entire bodies.Several leaked documents from China have revealed Beijing’s brutal and systematic crackdown on Uyghurs in which the officials have termed the action as a “struggle against terrorism, infiltration and separatism”. China has denied all of these allegations, claiming it has just taken these measures to lift Uighurs out of poverty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-new-way-to-support-xinjiang-cotton-blur-out-western-brand-logos-101617791786459.html
07-04-2021||World||China condemns 2 ex-Xinjiang officials on separatism charges||China has sentenced a former education official and a former legal official in the northwestern region of Xinjiang to death with a two-year reprieve on charges including separatism and bribe taking.Sattar Sawut and Shirzat Bawudun are the latest of many Xinjiang bureaucrats, almost all members of the Muslim Turkic Uyghur minority group, to be sentenced on national security charges in what China calls a campaign against “two-faced officials” who are seeking to undermine Chinese rule from within the system.Such sentences are usually commuted to life in prison after two years with good behavior. Both men pleaded guilty and neither would file an appeal, said Wang Langtao, vice president of Xinjiang's regional higher people's court.National security cases are heard behind behind closed doors and it wasn't exactly clear when the men had been tried or when their sentences had been handed down. Sattar Sawut was detained in 2018. It was clear when Shirzat Bawudun had been held.The court on Tuesday said Sattar Sawut, the the former head of the regional education department, “incorporated ethnic separatism, violence, terrorism, and religious extremism content into minority-language textbooks.”“Sattar Sawut took advantage of compiling and publishing ethnic language textbooks for primary and secondary schools to split the country, starting in 2002.He instructed others to pick several people with separatist thoughts to join the textbook compilation team, the court found," the official Xinhua News Agency said, citing comments by Wang at a news conference.Wang said Shirzat Bawudun, the former head of the Xinjiang regional justice department, was convicted of “splitting the country" for having colluded with the East Turkistan Islamic Movement and having “offered help to separatists and religious extremists, and collaborated with overseas separatist forces."The ETIM is listed as a terrorist group by the United Nations, although many experts question whether it exists in operational form.Shirzat Bawudun met with ETIM representatives and encouraged others to join the group, Wang said. He also “carried out illegal religious activities at his daughter's wedding" and accepted bribes totaling 11.12 million yuan (USD 1.7 million), Wang said.Following terror attacks that killed thousands, China launched a sweeping security campaign in Xinjiang, detaining more than 1 million Uyghurs, Kazakhs and members of other minority Muslim groups in prison-like reeducation centers where they are told to denounce Islam and traditional culture, learn Mandarin Chinese and swear fealty to the ruling Communist Party and its leader, Xi Jinping.That crackdown has been accompanied by the arrests of leading Uyghur academics and other public figures, mostly on charges of separatism.China denies any abuses, saying the centers were aimed at teaching job skills and deradicalizing those influenced by anti-Chinese jihadi teachings. It says its policies have prevented any new terrorist attacks taking place for more than four years.Beijing has also vociferously attacked claims of forced labor in factories and cotton fields and encouraged an unofficial public boycott of foreign companies that have spoken out on the matter.It calls US sanctions against officials associated with persecution in Xinjiang a former of political persecution that will have no effect on government policy.The court said textbooks approved by Sattar Sawut were used for 13 years, bringing “grave consequences." It said the 2003 and 2009 editions of the textbooks contained 84 passages preaching ethnic separatism, violence, terrorism and religious extremism and that several people were inspired by the books to participate in a bloody anti-government riot in the regional capital Urumqi in 2009.Others, the court said, became inspired to become “key members of a separatist group headed by former college teacher Ilham Tohti," a Uyghur economist serving a life sentence on a separatism charge since 2014.Sattar Sawut also abused his official positions to accept bribes worth 15.05 million yuan (USD 2.3 million), the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-condemns-2-ex-xinjiang-officials-on-separatism-charges-101617788850535.html
07-04-2021||World||Taiwan will fight ''to the very last day'' if China attacks||Taiwan's foreign minister on Wednesday said the island will defend itself “to the very last day” if attacked by China.Joseph Wu said China's attempts at conciliation while engaging in military intimidation are sending “mixed signals” to the island's residents.China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be won over peacefully or by force.Wu noted China flew 10 warplanes into Taiwan's air defense identification zone on Monday and deployed an aircraft carrier group for exercises near Taiwan.“We are willing to defend ourselves, that's without any question," Wu told reporters. “We fill fight a war if we need to fight a war, and if we need to defend ourselves to the very last day, then we will defend ourselves to the very last day.“China does not recognize Taiwan's democratically elected government, and leader Xi Jinping has said “unification” between the sides cannot be put off indefinitely.“On the one hand they want to charm the Taiwanese people by sending their condolences, but at the same time they are also sending their military aircraft and military vessels closer to Taiwan aimed at intimidating Taiwan's people," Wu said at a ministry briefing.“The Chinese are sending very mixed signals to the Taiwanese people and I would characterize that as self-defeating," Wu said.The vast improvements in China's military capabilities and its increasing activity around Taiwan have raised concerns in the U.S., which is legally bound to ensure Taiwan is capable of defending itself and to regard all threats to the island's security as matters of “grave concern."China's military said Monday the new naval drills were meant to help it "safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests,” terms often interpreted as being directed at Taiwan's leadership that has refused to give in to Beijing's demands that it recognize the island as part of Chinese territory.Taiwan and China split amid civil war in 1949, and most Taiwanese favor maintaining the current state of de facto independence while engaging in robust economic exchanges with the mainland.China has also created conditions for greater economic integration, while also targeting some communities such as pineapple farmers in hopes of weakening their support for the island's government.Chinese diplomatic pressure has been growing also, reducing the number of Taiwan's formal diplomatic allies to just 15 and shutting its representatives out of the World Health Assembly and other major international forums.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-will-fight-to-the-very-last-day-if-china-attacks-101617791272259.html
07-04-2021||World||Former Italian PM Berlusconi in hospital since Tuesday: Report||Former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has been in hospital since Tuesday afternoon for check-ups, two sources from his Forza Italia party said on Wednesday.One of the sources said the 84-year-old media tycoon went to the San Raffaele hospital in Milan for follow-up tests after contracting the new coronavirus in September last year.This is the second time in just a few weeks that Berlusconi finds himself in hospital after another routine check-up at the end of March. Forza Italia said at the time he had been admitted for clinical monitoring and adjustment to an ongoing therapy.Berlusconi, who underwent major heart surgery in 2016 and has also survived prostate cancer, was also admitted to hospital in January this year because of heart problems.Shares in Mediaset, the broadcaster controlled by the Berlusconi family, were up 0.8% by 0930 GMT, compared with a flat Milan blue-chip index.Traders had previously cited speculation about potential ownership changes at the group if Berlusconi's condition worsened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/former-italian-pm-berlusconi-in-hospital-since-tuesday-report-101617790900192.html
07-04-2021||World||EU agency to share results of probe into AstraZeneca Covid-19 shot||The European Union's medicines regulator will announce the conclusions of its investigation into the possible connection between AstraZeneca's coronavirus vaccine and rare blood clots later Wednesday.Earlier this week, a senior official from the European Medicines Agency, or EMA, said there was a causal link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and the rare blood clots that have been seen in dozens of people worldwide, among the tens of millions who have received at least one dose.Marco Cavaleri, head of health threats and vaccine strategy at the Amsterdam-based agency, said in comments to Rome’s Il Messaggero newspaper on Tuesday that “it is becoming more and more difficult to affirm that there isn’t a cause-and-effect relationship between AstraZeneca vaccines and the very rare cases of blood clots associated with a low level of platelets.”But Cavaleri acknowledged the agency hadn't yet figured out how exactly the vaccine might be causing these rare side effects. The agency said its evaluation “has not yet reached a conclusion and the review is currently ongoing.”The EMA, World Health Organization and numerous other health authorities have said repeatedly that the AstraZeneca vaccine is safe and effective and that the protection it offers against Covid-19 outweighs the small risks of rare blood clots.Last week, the EU medicines regulator said “there is no evidence that would support restricting the use of this vaccine in any population,” though an expert said more brain clots were being reported than would be expected, and it would continue to assess incoming data.In March, more than a dozen countries, including Germany, suspended their use of AstraZeneca over the blood clot issue. Most restarted — some with age restrictions — after the European Medicines Agency said countries should continue using the potentially life-saving vaccine.But the frequently changing advice in some countries on who can take the vaccine has raised concerns that AstraZeneca's credibility could be permanently damaged, spurring more vaccine hesitancy and prolonging the pandemic.In Britain, which has given out more doses of AstraZeneca vaccine than any other country, the medicines regulator reported there were 22 reports of rare brain and other clots, including people who had a low blood platelet level, among more than 18 million who got at least one dose.Any further doubts about the AstraZeneca vaccine would be a setback for the shot, which is critical to Europe’s immunization campaign and a linchpin in the global strategy to get vaccines to poorer countries.The AstraZeneca vaccine is cheaper and easier to use than rival vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna and has been endorsed for use in more than 50 countries, including by the 27-nation EU and WHO. US authorities are still evaluating the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agency-to-share-results-of-probe-into-astrazeneca-covid-19-shot-101617789325607.html
07-04-2021||World||Leaders of Russia and China tighten their grips, grow closer||They're not leaders for life — not technically, at least. But in political reality, the powerful tenures of China's Xi Jinping and, as of this week, Russia's Vladimir Putin are looking as if they will extend much deeper into the 21st century — even as the two superpowers whose destinies they steer gather more clout with each passing year.What's more, as they consolidate political control at home, sometimes with harsh measures, they're working together more substantively than ever in a growing challenge to the West and the world's other superpower, the United States, which elects its leader every four years.This week, Putin signed a law allowing him to potentially hold onto power until 2036. The 68-year-old Russian president, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — pushed through a constitutional vote last year allowing him to run again in 2024 when his current six-year term ends. He has overseen a systematic crackdown on dissent.In China, Xi, who came to power in 2012, has imposed even tighter controls on the already repressive political scene, emerging as one of his nation's most powerful leaders in the seven decades of Communist Party rule that began with Mao Zedong's often-brutal regime.Under Xi, the government has rounded up, imprisoned or silenced intellectuals, legal activists and other voices, cracked down on Hong Kong's opposition and used security forces to suppress calls for minority rights in Xinjiang, Tibet and Inner Mongolia.Xi has sidelined rivals, locked up critics and tightened the party's control over information. An ongoing crackdown against corruption has won popular support while also keeping potential competitors in line.His steady consolidation of power led to the removal of term limits on the Chinese presidency in 2018, demolishing a convention the party had established to prevent a repeat of the abuse produced by Mao's one-person rule.Xi further telegraphed his intention to remain in power by breaking from tradition and not indicating a preferred successor.One who appeared eager to take on the role, Sun Zhengcai, was brought down in 2017 and sentenced to life in prison on corruption charges.And in Russia, Putin's most outspoken critic, Alexei Navalny, was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — an accusation Russian authorities have denied. In February, Navalny was sentenced to 2½ years in prison.In defying the West, Putin and Xi both have tapped nationalist feelings. Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea propelled Putin's approval ratings to nearly 90 per cent before they slackened amid economic woes and unpopular pensions reform.But the impact of Putin's and Xi's enduring retention of power hardly ends at their respective nations' borders. It ripples outward into the geopolitical balance of power in countless ways.As Moscow's relations with the West sank to post-Cold War lows amid accusations of election meddling and hacking attacks, Putin has increasingly sought to strengthen ties with China.And while China so far has avoided a showdown with the West like Russia's, it is coming under growing pressure from Washington and its allies over Beijing's human rights record in Xinjiang, Hong Kong and the South China Sea.U.S. President Joe Biden has taken an increasingly tough line with both leaders, recently describing Putin as a “killer” and having his top national security aides excoriate China for a litany of issues.Such approaches suggest that Moscow and Beijing will have incentives to build an even stronger alliance.Like their nations, the two leaders themselves have fostered a closer relationship, too.Putin and Xi have developed strong personal ties to bolster a “strategic partnership” between the two former Communist rivals as they vie with the West for influence.And even though Moscow and Beijing in the past rejected the possibility of forging a military alliance, Putin said last fall that such a prospect can't be ruled out entirely.While both Putin and Xi each appear to be firmly entrenched, numerous challenges persist. The pandemic, for one, posed a major challenge for both rulers, and they took a similarly cautious approach when it struck.Putin responded last spring by introducing a sweeping six-week lockdown that severely hurt the already weak Russian economy. His approval rating plummeted to a historic low of 59%. Later, the government eased restrictions and steered clear from new lockdowns, helping reduce economic damage and shore up Putin's ratings.Xi remained out of the public eye in the first uncertain weeks, possibly fearing that any misstep could have given rivals a chance to topple him. In the end, China controlled the pandemic better than many other places, enhancing Xi's position as leader.Xi must also figure out how to satisfy ambitious young politicians who may see their careers being stymied by his lengthy tenure. And he has to demonstrate that his extended rule will not lead to the excesses of the Mao years, especially the disastrous and deeply traumatic 1966-76 Cultural Revolution.“Xi has to manage an essential paradox. He venerates Mao and is building the same cult of personality and centrality of the party,” said Daniel Blumenthal, director of Asian Studies at the American Enterprise Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/leaders-of-russia-and-china-tighten-their-grips-grow-closer-101617789326051.html

Images of the shoot circulated on social media."The individuals involved will be deported from the United Arab Emirates. No further comment shall be made on the matter," Dubai's Attorney General Essam Issa Al Humaidan said in a statement published by Dubai Media Office on Tuesday.The statement did not provide details on the nationalities of those involved.Dubai Police had on Saturday announced the arrest of those involved and warned against "such unacceptable behaviours which do not reflect the values and ethics of Emirati society".The emirate of Dubai is a regional business and tourism hub where foreign residents and visitors - drawn to its sun-drenched beaches, luxury lifestyles and business environment - vastly outnumber Emirati nationals.Foreigners have in the past fallen foul of laws in the UAE, a federation of seven Muslim emirates, on indecency and alcohol consumption, such as for kissing in public.The UAE in November amended a number of laws on issues such as cohabitation, alcohol and divorce, in a liberalising move seen as a push to make the country more attractive to foreign investment and tourism.However laws against immoral and debauched acts remain in the Federal Penal Code. Dubai Police also said the UAE has laws against sharing pornographic or other material that may prejudice public morals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dubai-orders-deportations-for-naked-balcony-photo-shoot-101617786555318.html
07-04-2021||World||Workers clear last train from deadly crash site in Taiwan||Cabin exposed, with half of its walls and roof gone, workers pulled out the last remaining train car in Taiwan's worst rail accident in seven decades.The crash site on the island's east coast was cleared, barring one car that was moved to the side of the tunnel where the train hit a construction truck that had fallen onto the track. Fifty people died and over 200 were injured in the crash on Friday.The driver of the truck, Lee Yi-hsiang, who is also the manager of the construction site above the tracks, has been detained on charges of causing death by negligence. He has apologised for the accident and promised to cooperate with investigators.While an initial report from transport safety officials said the brakes on the truck were not engaged, prosecutors declined to say what caused the vehicle to fall down the slope.Taiwan's Minister for Transportation and Communications Lin Chia-lung said Wednesday that he had offered his formal resignation to the island's president and premier.“I want to again express my deepest apologies to all the victims and their family and I will also take the political responsibility after completing all the relief work,” he said at a hearing by members of the transportation committee of the Legislative Assembly. “I will face it fully and meet it bravely.”The meeting started off with a moment of silence for the victims but quickly turned acrimonious when a group of opposition Nationalist Party politicians held up signs calling for the resignation of the minister and Premier Su Tseng-chang, shouting, “The government is a killer and must step down.”Members of the committee took turns to raise questions about the crash and rescue. One lawmaker asked Lin why certain safety improvements had not been completed since the last major train crash in 2018, which killed at least 18 people. Among those was an automatic system that would check on the condition of slopes by the railway tracks.They also raised concern over the slow reform of the indebted Taiwan Railways.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/workers-clear-last-train-from-deadly-crash-site-in-taiwan-101617785583419.html

A previous study by the same researchers found last year that 20% of COVID-19 survivors were diagnosed with a psychiatric disorder within three months.The new findings, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, analysed health records of 236,379 Covid-19 patients, mostly from the United States, and found 34% had been diagnosed with neurological or psychiatric illnesses within six months.The disorders were significantly more common in Covid-19 patients than in comparison groups of people who recovered from flu or other respiratory infections over the same time period, the scientists said, suggesting Covid-19 had a specific impact.Anxiety, at 17%, and mood disorders, at 14%, were the most common, and did not appear to be related to how mild or severe the patient's Covid-19 infection had been.Among those who had been admitted to intensive care with severe Covid-19 however, 7% had a stroke within six months, and almost 2% were diagnosed with dementia.Independent experts said the findings were worrying."This is a very important paper. It confirms beyond any reasonable doubt that Covid-19 affects both brain and mind in equal measure," said Simon Wessely, chair of psychiatry at King's College London."The impact Covid-19 is having on individuals' mental health can be severe," said Lea Milligan, chief executive of the MQ Mental Health research charity. "This is contributing to the already rising levels of mental illness and requires further, urgent research."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-third-of-covid-19-survivors-suffer-neurological-mental-disorders-study-101617785119257.html
07-04-2021||World||Google AI scientist Bengio resigns after colleagues' firings||Google research manager Samy Bengio said on Tuesday he was resigning, according to an internal email seen by Reuters, in a blow to the Alphabet Inc unit after the firings of his colleagues who questioned paper review and diversity practices.Though at least two Google engineers had earlier resigned to protest the dismissal of artificial intelligence (AI) researcher Timnit Gebru, Bengio is the highest-profile employee yet to depart.Google confirmed Bengio's resignation and his email. Bengio did not respond to requests for comment. Bloomberg earlier reported the news.A distinguished scientist at Google, Bengio spent about 14 years at the company and was among its first employees involved in a decade-old project known as Google Brain that advanced algorithms crucial to the functioning of various modern AI systems.Andrew Ng, an early Brain member who now runs software startup Landing AI, said Bengio "has been instrumental to moving forward AI technology and ethics." Another founding member, Jeff Dean, now oversees Google's thousands of researchers.Google Brain researcher Sara Hooker in a tweet described Bengio's departure as "a huge loss for Google."In the internal email Bengio had sent, he said he decided to leave Google to pursue "other exciting opportunities" and that his last day would be April 28.Google fired staff scientist Margaret Mitchell in February after alleging she transferred electronic files out of the company. It fired fellow researcher Gebru in December after she threatened to quit rather than retract a paper.Mitchell has said she tried "to raise concerns about race and gender inequity, and speak up about Google's problematic firing of Dr. Gebru." Gebru has said the company wanted to suppress her criticism of its products and its efforts to increase workforce diversity. Google has said it accepted her offer to resign.Bengio had defended the pair, who co-led a team of about a dozen people researching ethical issues related to AI software. In December, Bengio wrote on Facebook that he was stunned that Gebru, whom he was managing, was removed from the company without him being consulted.Though he did not mention the firings in his farewell note, they influenced his decision to resign, people familiar with the matter said, speaking on condition of anonymity.Bengio wrote in the email, "I learned so much with all of you, in terms of machine learning research of course, but also on how difficult yet important it is to organize a large team of researchers so as to promote long term ambitious research, exploration, rigor, diversity and inclusion."Nicolas Le Roux, a Google Brain researcher, told Reuters that Bengio had devoted himself to making the research organization more inclusive and "created a space where everyone felt welcome."Google recently moved oversight of the AI ethics team from Bengio to vice president Marian Croak. In February, Croak told staff at a town hall that Google wanted management that could focus fully on that area, saying it had just been a small part of what Bengio was supporting.Google also pledged several changes at the town hall aiming to regain researchers' trust, Reuters previously reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/google-ai-scientist-bengio-resigns-after-colleagues-firings-101617785104258.html

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis declared a local state of emergency on Saturday."We're now ending our fifth day since learning of a breach at the site, and I am in awe over the state, federal and local cooperation to ensure the safety of our residents," Manatee County Commission Chairman Vanessa Baugh said in a statement announcing the lifting of the evacuation.While the pumping operation eased the threat to homes and businesses adjacent to the reservoir, the wastewater drainage was being routed into a nearby Gulf Coast seaport, posing environmental concerns there.Ed Sherwood, executive director of the Tampa Bay Estuary Program, said pumping the nutrient-dense discharge into Port Manatee at the mouth of Tampa Bay could spawn algal blooms toxic to marine life in the estuary.(Reporting by Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/florida-evacuations-order-lifted-as-danger-from-leaky-wastewater-reservoir-fades-101617762777623.html
07-04-2021||World||A timeline of Australia's Covid-19 vaccine plan mired in European back-and-forth||Australia said on Wednesday the European Union asked it to withdraw export permit applications for exports of AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine, and its denial that it blocked shipments were simply "semantics".The dispute emphasises the challenge facing European nations to vaccinate their populations and the impact on any vaccine export restrictions on countries that had pre-ordered doses.Here's a timeline of how the shipment of 3.1 million doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine from Europe to Australia has stalled.SEPTEMBER 2020:Australia orders 3.8 million doses of Europe-manufactured COVID-19 vaccine being trialled by Oxford University and AstraZeneca Plc for early 2021 delivery that is to underpin the early stages of Australia's inoculation programme, now running behind schedule.Australia bankrolls biopharma CSL Ltd to make another 30 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine domestically, later increased to 50 million.NOVEMBER 2020:Australia also orders 10 million doses of COVID-19 vaccine being developed by Pfizer and BioNTech.JANUARY 2021:European Union grants conditional approval for AstraZeneca vaccine.Australia grants Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine approval. Prime Minister Scott Morrison says he plans to have 4 million of the country's 25 million population vaccinated by the end of March.EU introduces export controls over vaccine, citing supply shortage.AstraZeneca says only 1.2 million offshore-manufactured vaccine doses can be delivered to Australia by end-March, due to export controls.FEBRUARY 2021:First Pfizer vaccines arrive in the country; first inoculations take place.Australian health authorities approve AstraZeneca vaccine.Australia receives first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine from Europe, with 300,000 doses.AstraZeneca applies to the EU for export licence to ship another 500,000 doses, which are being made in Italy, to Australia, according to Morrison.EU tells AstraZeneca to re-submit application for just 250,000 doses. Australia agrees to a temporary reduction, Morrison says.MARCH 2021:EU blocks the shipment of 250,000 doses - that had already been negotiated down from 500,000 - to Australia, says Morrison.Australia writes to EU requesting 1 million doses of its original 3.8 million order to help with "humanitarian crisis" in neighbouring Papua New Guinea.Australia reaches end-March milestone with about 600,000 vaccine doses administered, compared to 4 million target.APRIL 6:Morrison says end-March target was missed because 3.1 million AstraZeneca vaccine doses ordered from Europe and due by end-march were not delivered.EU denies blocking vaccines to Australia other than one shipment of 250,000 AstraZeneca doses from Italy.APRIL 7:Morrison says the EU has not responded to Australia's request for 1 million AstraZeneca vaccines for Papua New Guinea and invites EU to send outstanding 3.1 million doses to confirm it has not blocked exports.Locally-manufactured AstraZeneca vaccines are being administered. A shipment of 400,000 offshore-produced AstraZeneca doses are due by the end of April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-timeline-of-australia-s-covid-19-vaccine-plan-mired-in-european-backandforth-101617765958771.html
07-04-2021||World||Moderna Covid-19 vaccine rolled out in UK for the 1st time||The U.K. will begin rolling out the Moderna Inc. vaccine on Wednesday, bolstering Britain’s Covid-19 immunization program amid concerns over AstraZeneca Plc’s shot and a shortfall of doses this month.Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the Moderna shot would first be offered in west Wales. It is the third approved vaccine to be offered in Britain, alongside shots from AstraZeneca and partners Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, and its rollout is around two weeks earlier than expected.The UK has ordered 17 million doses of Moderna’s two-shot vaccine, enough for 8.5 million people.The success of the vaccine program is crucial to Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s ambition to fully reopen the U.K. economy on June 21. On Tuesday, he sought to reassure people over the Astra vaccine amid ongoing concerns in Europe over possible side effects.It later emerged that vaccinations of children in a study of the shot developed by Astra and Oxford University have been paused while the U.K.’s drug regulator investigates rare cases of blood clots in adults. No safety issues have arisen in the children’s trial, Oxford said.“The U.K. government has secured vaccines on behalf of the entire nation and the vaccination program has shown our country working together at its best,” Hancock said in an emailed statement. “Wherever you live, when you get the call, get the jab.”‘On Track’The government has insisted it is on track to meet its target to vaccinate all adults by the end of July, despite a reduction in doses this April and a potentially slower pace than expected in the months ahead. Vaccination centers and pharmacies are facing a “significant reduction” in supply during April, NHS England warned last month -- meaning that older people waiting for second doses will be prioritized over younger people getting their first shot. The pace of the rollout across England is now estimated by the Cabinet Office at an average of 2.7 million doses a week until the end of July -- “considerably slower” than a previous forecast of 3.2 million a week, according to a modeling paper from scientists on a government advisory committee published Monday.Johnson’s official spokesman Jamie Davies said the government “never talked about details around supplies and deliveries” of vaccines.“There will be a slight reduction in April but the key thing to remember is that that doesn’t mean that we’re not on track to meet our pledges,” Davies told reporters on Tuesday. The U.K. remains “on track” to offer a first dose to all over-50s by April 15, and to all adults by the end of July, he said.The rollout of the Moderna shot in the U.K. is earlier than expected. Vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi told the BBC on Tuesday it would happen “around the third week of April”.Three in five adults in the U.K. have been vaccinated so far, Hancock said on Twitter. The most recent government data shows that more than 31.6 million people have received a first dose, and 5.5 million have had a second dose.Speaking on a visit to an Astra manufacturing plant in Macclesfield, northwest England, Johnson urged people to listen to the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, the U.K.’s drug watchdog.“Their advice to people is to keep going out there, get your jab, get your second jab,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-covid-19-vaccine-being-rolled-out-in-uk-for-the-1st-time-101617752420285.html
07-04-2021||World||China's capital is color-coding buildings to boost Covid-19 vaccination levels||Beijing is putting up color-coded signs on buildings in its financial district to indicate what percentage of workers inside have received Covid-19 vaccines, a move aimed at accelerating the Chinese capital’s immunization rollout amid intensifying government pressure.The financial district is leading the campaign to to ‘green code’ its buildings, putting up green circular signs that indicate more than 80% of those working in the building have been vaccinated. Yellow notices are for those with 40% to 80% immunization rates, while red logos indicate fewer than 40% of people are protected.While no penalties or specific consequences have been announced for low vaccination rates, many buildings have organized on-site immunization drives to make it easier for workers to get their shots. The stepped up efforts are adding extra pressure to local officials and employers amid fears that lagging vaccination rates may put reopening the economy at risk.China has set a goal of vaccinating 40% of its total population, or some 560 million people, by end of June. Tens of millions of workers at state-owned enterprises, party members, and college students are required to get immunized unless they provide a medical reason, while the government is offering incentives including small gifts and free rides to vaccination appointments to encourage the shots.The office signs build on a system China introduced last year that requires people to show a green code, indicating they are at low risk of having been exposed to Covid-19, before being permitted to enter almost all public venues, including restaurants, shops, and hotels. The assessment comes from built-in smartphone apps designed by China’s two biggest Internet companies that pull personal data from phone carriers and government departments.China has given about 4.5 million doses of vaccine on average each day for the past week. That’s close to the 5 million a day needed to reach an additional 417 million people, the number that will allow it to meet its vaccine goal before July.While the pace is significantly faster than the 3 million doses per day given on average in the U.S., it’s a much smaller proportion of the population. Only five doses per 100 people have been given so far in China, trailing the 56 per 100 people in Israel and 26 per 100 in the U.S., Bloomberg’s vaccine tracker shows.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-capital-is-color-coding-buildings-to-boost-covid-19-vaccination-levels-101617777979892.html

Mud tumbled down from surrounding hills early on Sunday, catching people at sleep.On nearby Lembata island, the downpour triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja sent solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November to crash down on more than a dozen villages, killing at least 28 and leaving 44 unaccounted for, according to the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.Hundreds of police, soldiers and residents dug through the debris with their bare hands, shovels and hoes searching for those buried. On Tuesday, relatives wailed as they watched rescuers pull out a mud-caked body, place it on a bamboo stretcher and take it away for burial.In all, landslides and flooding have killed at least 119 across several islands in Indonesia as well as 27 people in neighboring East Timor. Thousands of homes have been damaged and thousands of people displaced by the weather, which is expected to continue until at least Friday as the storm moves south toward Australia.Rescue efforts were being hampered by the rains and the remoteness of the area, where roads and bridges were damaged in many places.Rescue personnel with excavators and tons of food and medicine were being deployed from Makassar city on Sulawesi island, but were hindered by a lack of sea transportation. National Disaster Mitigation Agency chief Doni Monardo called on the private sector to support relief efforts.Three helicopters began reaching isolated areas of the islands on Tuesday, and President Joko Widodo held a Cabinet meeting in Jakarta to speed up the operation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-landslides-death-toll-rises-to-119-dozens-missing-101617770702996.html

This followed earlier data showing improvement in the services sectors in the U.S. and China.The International Monetary Fund said on Tuesday unprecedented public spending to fight COVID-19 would push global growth to 6% this year, a rate unseen since the 1970s.Optimism on a wider rollout of vaccines also boosted prices with U.S. President Joe Biden moving up the COVID-19 vaccine eligibility target for all American adults to April 19.U.S. crude oil stockpiles fell more than expected in the week ended April 2, while fuel inventories rose, according to three market sources, citing American Petroleum Institute (API) figures ahead of government data on Wednesday.Oil production in the U.S. is expected to fall by 270,000 barrels per day (bpd) in 2021 to 11.04 million bpd, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) said on Tuesday, a steeper decline than its previous monthly forecast for a drop of 160,000 bpd.Iran and world powers held what they described as "constructive" talks on Tuesday and agreed to form working groups to discuss potentially reviving the 2015 nuclear deal that could lead to Washington lifting sanctions on Iran's energy sector and increasing oil supply.Oil prices dropped earlier this week after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and allies, known as OPEC+, agreed to gradually ease oil output cuts from May."Crude prices seem poised to consolidate as energy traders need to see how exactly OPEC+ follows through with their plan to boost output, and if the EU will near virus immunity by the end of June," said Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA.(Reporting by Jessica Jaganathan; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/oil-prices-rise-on-stronger-economic-outlook-us-stockpile-draw-101617770659969.html
07-04-2021||World||Kim Jong Un says North Korea facing its 'worst-ever situation'||North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has acknowledged his country was facing the “worst-ever situation” as he addressed thousands of grassroots members of his ruling party during a major political conference in Pyongyang.Experts say Kim is facing perhaps his toughest moment as he approaches a decade in rule, with North Korea's coronavirus lockdown unleashing further shock on an economy devastated by decades of mismanagement and crippling U.S.-led sanctions over his nuclear weapons programme.The North's official Korean Central News Agency said Kim made the comments during an opening speech at a meeting of the Workers' Party's cell secretaries on Tuesday.“Improving the people's living standards ... even in the worst-ever situation in which we have to overcome unprecedentedly numerous challenges depends on the role played by the cells, the grassroots organizations of the party,” Kim said.He urged members to carry out the decisions made at a party congress in January, when he vowed to bolster his nuclear deterrent in face of US pressure and announced a new five-year national development plan. The congress came months after Kim during another political conference showed unusual candor by acknowledging that his plans to improve the economy weren't succeeding.During Tuesday's speech, Kim also criticised the party's grassroots units for unspecified “shortcomings” that should be immediately corrected to ensure the “healthy and sustainable” development of the party.Party cells, which consist of five to 30 members, are the smallest units of party authority that oversee the works and lives at factories and other places. The network is an important tool for Workers' Party to perpetuate its power. The previous conference of cell secretaries was held in 2017.The economic setbacks have left Kim with nothing to show for his ambitious diplomacy with former President Donald Trump, which collapsed over disagreements in lifting sanctions for the North's denuclearization steps.The North has so far rejected the Biden administration's overture for talks, saying that Washington must discard its “hostile” policies first, and dialed up pressure by resuming tests of ballistic missiles last month after a yearlong pause.

The first confirmed infection was reported on Monday. It was found in a patient tested by Stanford Health Care Clinical Virology Laboratory in California, according to news reports. The case was detected in the San Francisco Bay Area, as reported by The Hill.The new strain of the coronavirus is called “double mutant” because it carries two mutations of the pathogen.It has hit the US amid growing concerns about an impending surge fuelled by new variations and complacency following reports of high vaccination rates.“This Indian variant contains two mutations in the same virus for the first time, previously seen on separate variants,” Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at University of California San Francisco, told San Francisco Chronicle.A response was awaited from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to a request for confirmation of news reports about the new variant.EMA has ‘not yet reached conclusion’ on AZ vaccineThe EU’s drug regulator said on Tuesday it is still deciding whether the AstraZeneca vaccine causes blood clots, after a top official said there was a clear link. The European Medicines Agency’s (EMA) safety committee “has not yet reached a conclusion and the review is currently ongoing”, the Amsterdam-based EMA said in a statement. “We will communicate and hold a press briefing as soon as the review is finalised.”The statement came after the EMA’s head of vaccine strategy, Marco Cavaleri, was quoted in the media as saying there was a “clear” connection and the agency would announce it.US President Joe Biden was set to announce on Tuesday that all adults in America will be eligible for Covid-19 vaccines by April 19, two weeks earlier than his previous goal, a White House official said. He will also announce that 150 million doses of vaccine were administered within his first 75 days in office.Brazil’s brutal surge in deaths will soon surpass the worst of a record January wave in the US, climbing well beyond an average 3,000 Covid-19 fatalities per day, scientists are saying, as contagious new variants overwhelm hospitals. Brazil’s overall death toll trails the US outbreak, with nearly 333,000 killed, compared with more than 555,000 dead in the United States.New Zealanders and Australians rushed to book flights on Tuesday as the tourism industry welcomed the “lifeline” of a travel bubble between the largely Covid-free neighbours.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-double-mutant-covid-strain-found-in-us-101617765300743.html

Malaysia’s court ruled in 2020 that Najib must pay 1.69 billion ringgit in taxes, a bill he has disputed.Being a bankrupt would mean he would lose his parliamentary seat and will be ineligible to contest for party polls and national elections, he said.He said the case relates to 3 billion ringgit put in an account under his name that was used to receive donations for corporate social responsibilities and political purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysias-former-pm-najib-served-with-bankruptcy-notice-over-tax-bill-101617762397569.html
07-04-2021||World||Facebook removes accounts tied to Iranian exile group||Facebook said Tuesday it has removed hundreds of fake accounts linked to an Iranian exile group and a troll farm in Albania.The accounts posted content critical of Iran's government and supportive of Mujahedeen-e-Khalq, a dissident group known as MEK. In many cases, the Facebook and Instagram accounts used fake profile names and photos.Facebook determined the accounts were being run from a single location in Albania by a group of individuals working on behalf of MEK. Facebook found other telltale clues suggesting a so-called troll farm, in which workers are often paid to post content, including misinformation, to social media. Facebook says it removes such accounts based on how they behave, not on the material they post.For one, researchers found that the activity seemed to follow the central European workday, with posts picking up after 9 a.m., slowing down at the end of the day, and with a noticeable pause at lunch time. Facebook, however, said it did not find evidence of people being paid.“Even trolls need to eat,” said Ben Nimmo, who works on Facebook’s global threat intelligence investigations, on a conference call with reporters Tuesday.The National Council for Resistance in Iran, an umbrella group that includes MEK, said in a statement that that no accounts affiliated with it or MEK have been removed. The group also denied the existence of an Albanian troll farm affiliated with MEK.MEK is a leading group opposing the Iranian government. It killed Americans before the 1979 Islamic Revolution and was labeled as a terrorist organization by the State Department until 2012. Nevertheless, U.S. politicians from both parties including Rudy Giuliani and Newt Gingrich have given paid speeches to MEK in the past.The network of fake accounts was most active in 2017 and again in late 2020, Facebook said. In all, more than 300 accounts, pages and groups on Facebook and Instagram were removed as part of the company's action. Around 112,000 people followed one or more of the Instagram accounts.In some cases, the fake accounts used photos of Iranian celebrities or deceased dissidents.

President Joe Biden — who said on the campaign trail he'd raise income taxes on high earners — has proposed tax hikes on wealthy individuals and families and a corporate tax rate increase to pay for his infrastructure plan.Democrats in New York hope the tax increase could bring in at least $2.8 billion this upcoming year and prevent the need for spending cuts in years to come.New York’s top income tax rate is currently 8.82% for income over roughly $1 million, while New York City residents face an additional 3.88% top tax rate.New York is now set to raise the combined top tax rate for New York City millionaires above California’s top income tax rate of 13.3%.New Yorkers who make over $1 million would face a 9.65% income tax rate. That increases to 10.3% for taxpayers who make between $5 million and $25 million, and 10.9% for those who make over $25 million.“Working and middle-class taxpayers will receive the relief they desperately need, while the wealthiest New Yorkers will help their neighbors,” Stewart-Cousins said in a statement announcing that legislative leaders and Cuomo reached a budget deal Tuesday.The exact language of the tax hike wasn't available online until late Tuesday evening. New York was also set to raise the corporate tax rate from 6.5% to 7.25% for taxpayers with net incomes over $5 million. That move — along with a reinstatement of the capital base tax — would raise $750 million this upcoming year.Democrats won control of the state Senate in 2018, but they gained more leverage last year by winning a veto-proof supermajority.Cuomo expressed newfound openness to raising taxes on top-earners this year — his budget proposal included a limited, temporary tax increase on high-earners if New Yorkers didn't receive extra COVID-19 aid.He's also long warned that raising taxes on the wealthy could drive them out of New York at a time when the state's economy is still recovering from COVID-19 economic shutdowns last week. His budget director, Robert Mujica, has said the top 1% of earners pay 40% of New York’s income taxes.And Mujica has said an additional $12 billion in expected federal COVID-19 aid could prevent the need for a tax hike.But Democratic legislative leaders who have pushed forward with a proposed tax hike said there's no conclusive evidence that tax hikes drive out the rich. And they criticize years of “fiscal austerity” under Cuomo, as health care costs rise and educational advocacy groups call for more spending on schools.Medicaid costs have skyrocketed as New York has boosted enrollment, raised the minimum wage for all workers and taken on more Medicaid bills once shouldered by counties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/millionaires-in-new-york-set-to-face-highest-tax-rate-in-us-101617761524551.html

Facebook said "malicious actors" had obtained the data prior to September 2019 by "scraping" profiles using a vulnerability in the social media service's tool to sync contacts.The company said it identified the issue at the time and modified the tool."As a result of the action we took, we are confident that the specific issue that allowed them to scrape this data in 2019 no longer exists," Facebook said in a blog post.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-says-data-on-530-million-users-scraped-before-september-2019-101617761692075.html

07-04-2021||World||Amazon boss Bezos backs Biden's proposal to hike US corporate tax rate||Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos endorsed President Joe Biden’s focus on building up the country’s infrastructure Tuesday and said the company even supports a corporate tax rate hike to help pay for it.Also Read | Biden's economic plan gets boost from Senate procedural rulingBezos’ statement, posted on the company’s website, was notable because it came after Biden singled out the company for criticism about how much it pays in federal taxes when he recently unveiled his $2.3 trillion infrastructure proposal.Biden has proposed hiking the U.S. corporate tax rate to 28% from 21% to help pay for his plan, an idea that Republican leaders are panning as harmful to economic growth. Democrats will surely cite support from individual companies to undercut that argument.“We recognize this investment will require concessions from all sides — both on the specifics of what’s included as well as how it gets paid for (we’re supportive of a rise in the corporate tax rate),” Bezos wrote. “We look forward to Congress and the Administration coming together to find the right, balanced solution that maintains or enhances U.S. competitiveness.”Bezos was careful not to endorse a specific plan. Rather, he said “we support the Biden Administration’s focus on making bold investments in American infrastructure.”Also Read | Joe Biden's infrastructure plan to boost job growth, says economic adviserThe company would benefit from the investments made in roads, bridges, airports and broadband. Business groups have joined in the call for more public works investment by the federal government, but they have generally balked at Biden’s call for raising the corporate income tax, with the U.S. Chamber of Commerce describing Biden’s proposal as “dangerously misguided when it comes to how to pay for infrastructure.”Along with partially undoing the corporate tax cut put in place during President Donald Trump’s administration, Biden also wants to set a minimum U.S. tax on overseas corporate income, and to make it harder for companies to shift earnings offshore.Amazon has long been criticized for paying virtually no federal taxes in the U.S. for years even as it built an e-commerce empire that currently has a market value of $1.6 trillion.That has changed slightly in recent years as the Seattle company has become more profitable. Last year, it reported paying $1.7 billion in federal taxes on its U.S. income of $20.2 billion, working out to an effective tax rate of about 8%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-boss-bezos-backs-biden-s-proposal-to-hike-us-corporate-tax-rate-101617755520273.html

07-04-2021||World||Brazil's Covid-19 deaths on track to pass worst of US wave||Brazil's brutal surge in Covid-19 deaths will soon surpass the worst of a record January wave in the United States, scientists forecast, with fatalities climbing for the first time above 4,000 in a day on Tuesday as the outbreak overwhelms hospitals.Brazil's overall death toll trails only the US outbreak, with nearly 337,000 killed, according to Health Ministry data, compared with more than 555,000 dead in the United States.But with Brazil's healthcare system at the breaking point, the country could exceed total U.S. deaths, despite having a population two-thirds that of the United States, two experts told Reuters."It's a nuclear reactor that has set off a chain reaction and is out of control. It's a biological Fukushima," said Miguel Nicolelis, a Brazilian doctor and professor at Duke University, who is closely tracking the virus.On Tuesday, the Health Ministry reported another 4,195 COVID-19 deaths in the past 24 hours, well above the country's prior single-day record. Brazil has set daily death records every week since late February, as a more contagious local variant and meager social distancing efforts fuel an uncontrolled outbreak.With mass vaccinations curtailing the U.S. outbreak, Brazil has become the epicenter of the pandemic, contributing about one in four deaths per day globally, according to a Reuters analysis.President Jair Bolsonaro has pushed back against mask-wearing and lockdowns that public health experts consider the best way to lessen virus transmission.The country dragged its feet last year as the world raced to secure vaccines, slowing the launch of a national immunization program.Despite the recent surge, Brazilian officials are insistent that the country can soon return to something resembling business as usual."We think that probably two, three months from now Brazil could be back to business," Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said during an online event on Tuesday. "Of course, probably economic activity will take a drop but it will be much, much less than the drop we suffered last year ... and much, much shorter."Bolsonaro has responded to growing political pressure with a dramatic shakeup of a half dozen ministries, putting loyalists in key roles ahead of what may be a tough re-election campaign next year against his political nemesis.While the president has shifted his tone on immunizations, touting vaccines he had recently disdained, the far-right former army captain continues to battle in the courts against state and municipal restrictions on economic activity.With weak measures failing to combat contagion, Brazil's Covid-19 cases and deaths are accumulating faster than ever.Nicolelis and Christovam Barcellos, a researcher at Brazilian medical institute Fiocruz, are separately forecasting that Brazil could surpass the United States in both overall deaths and the record for average deaths per day.As soon as next week, Brazil may break the record U.S. seven-day average for Covid-19 deaths, according to a model by the influential Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington. The U.S. average for daily deaths peaked at 3,285 in January.The IHME forecast does not currently extend beyond July 1, when it projects Brazil could reach 563,000 deaths, compared with 609,000 total U.S. fatalities expected by then.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-covid-19-deaths-on-track-to-pass-worst-of-us-wave-101617752519217.html

He asked roughly how many people a day come through, to which an official said about 300 people a day.He also spoke about encouraging a community spirit to get vaccinatedThe Neighborhood Health sees a count of 300 people on a regular basis, say the health workers. An estimate of about 20,000 doses, 5,000 shots a week is administered by the non profit.At one point Biden leaned over and whispered to the workers: "We passed 150 million yesterday."Approaching three people receiving a shot near where the pool was held, POTUS said: "You're doing the right thing...really important. And when you go back when you go home, get all your friends, tell them, 'Get a shot when they can,'" he said. "We're going to be able - everyone's going to be able to before the month is out. Every age."The US president reassured people and said: "All these strains you're hearing about. You should not worry.""They are more virulent. They are ...more dangerous but the vaccines work on all of them.""Hopefully we're going to get good enough, pretty soon, where we have enough that we can give the rest of the world. Because this is something that's not just... we can solve it here in America. We don't solve it around the world - you can't build a wall or fence high enough to keep out a virus," he said.Asked if the worst of the coronavirus pandemic was behind us, POTUS said: "I think If everyone continues down the road that we're on now, it will be behind us but it's not over yet. We're in a situation where I believe by end of the summer, we'll have a significant portion of the American public vaccinated."Later at the White House Biden announced that every adult in the US will be eligible to be vaccinated for COVId-19 by April 19, which is two weeks earlier than May 1 deadline that Biden had previously targeted."By no later than April 19, every adult aged 18 years and above will be eligible to be vaccinated. No more confusing rules. No more confusing restrictions" said Biden In his remarks at the White House on Tuesday.According to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 167m doses have so far been administered in the US. While 40 per cent of adults have received at least one shot, about a quarter have completed their course of vaccinations, including 55 per cent of people aged over 65.Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced it has awarded Virginia $77.1 million to support local efforts to increase vaccine uptake by expanding COVID-19 vaccine programs and ensuring greater equity and access to vaccine by those disproportionately affected by the virus.The United States is averaging more than 64,000 new cases each day, a 20 percent increase from two weeks earlier, the NYT reported adding the country is averaging over 800 Covid-19 deaths each day, the lowest level since November.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/passed-150-million-joe-biden-on-covid-19-vaccine-doses-administered-in-us-101617754807141.html

We have to do more," she said. "(They) have already attempted to kill him, they are now detaining him, and imposing prison conditions, that amount to torture."Navalny went on a hunger strike last week in an attempt to force the prison holding him outside Moscow to provide him with proper medical care for what he said was acute pain in his back and legs.The Kremlin has declined to comment on his health, saying it is a matter for the federal penitentiary service. The penitentiary service last week said the 44-year-old was receiving all necessary treatment.Navalny was jailed in February for two and a half years for parole violations that he called politically motivated. Moscow, which has cast doubt over his poisoning, paints Navalny as a Western-backed troublemaker bent on destabilising Russia.Callamard said Navalny's ill-treatment came at a time when the COVID-19 pandemic had exacerbated inequalities and increased state-sponsored repression in some countries.Certain governments had instrumentalised the pandemic against minority groups to repress dissent and human rights, while in other countries there had been a near-normalisation of emergency measures that restricted civil liberties, she added."COVID has amplified oppression," Callamard said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-may-be-slowly-killing-alexei-navalny-says-amnesty-international-101617754019210.html

The people said on condition of anonymity that the meeting was sought by the US side and lasted almost 15 minutes.Kerry, in his previous role as secretary of state in the Barack Obama administration, and Lavrov had played key roles in the protracted negotiations that led to the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.The US embassy said that over the next few days, Kerry will meet with a range of representatives of the Indian government, private sector and non-governmental organisations.Lavrov travelled to Pakistan from India hours after his talks with external affairs minister S Jaishankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/lavrov-kerry-run-into-each-other-at-hotel-have-brief-chat-101617745652630.html
07-04-2021||World||Talks to save Iran nuclear deal get off to good start||Iran, Russia and the United States reacted positively Tuesday to the opening exchanges in a first day of talks in Vienna aimed at rescuing an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme.US President Joe Biden has said he is ready to reverse the decision of his predecessor Donald Trump to withdraw from the landmark 2015 agreement, negotiated to ensure that Iran never developed a military nuclear programme.And after Moscow gave a positive assessment of the opening of the talks earlier Tuesday Washington's reaction a little later was also upbeat. Iran too, described the opening talks as constructive."I can say that overall, the meeting was constructive," the head of the Iranian delegation, Abbas Araghchi, said in a video on Iranian broadcaster Irinn.The United States was not present at those discussions because Iran has refused to meet the US delegation so long as its sanctions against Tehran remain in place. The European Union is acting as an intermediary.Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's Vienna-based envoy to international organisations, said Tuesday's meeting between those parties still in the deal -- Iran, China, Britain, France, Germany and Russia -- had been "successful".It would take time to restore the agreement, he said."The most important thing after today's meeting of the Joint Commission is that practical work towards achieving this goal has started," he tweeted."We do see this as a constructive and certainly welcome step," US State Department spokesman Ned Price said of the talks a little later."It is a potentially useful step as we seek to determine what it is that the Iranians are prepared to do to return to compliance with the stringent limitations under the 2015 deal, and as a result what we might need to do to return to compliance ourselves," he added.'Back on track'Since Trump pulled the US out of the deal with Iran in 2018, re-imposing sanctions on Tehran, the remaining parties have been struggling to save the agreement, as Iran has gradually stepped up its nuclear activities.Tehran is demanding an end to the crippling sanctions Trump imposed -- before which Iran will not meet the US delegates.Talks between the delegates from the remaining members of the 2015 agreement will continue Wednesday at the luxury hotel in Vienna, a diplomat familiar with the discussions said.The US delegation is due to meet in a different high-end hotel, also in downtown Vienna, with EU negotiators acting as go-betweens.At the same time, two expert-level groups -- on sanctions lifting and nuclear issues -- are working "to identify concrete measures to be taken by Washington and Tehran" to restore the deal, Ulyanov said."We need to make the best of this diplomatic space to bring the JCPOA back on track," said a tweet from EU diplomat Enrique Mora, the chair of Tuesday's meeting, referring to the pact by its acronym."Our clear goal is to return to full and effective implementation of the agreement by all sides," he added.Ahead of the talks, US special envoy Rob Malley suggested that the United States could be open to lifting sanctions and returning to the deal, comments welcomed by Iran government spokesman Ali Rabiei."We find this position realistic and promising. It could be the start of correcting the bad process that had taken diplomacy to a dead end," he told reporters in Tehran.Iran confirmed in January it was enriching uranium to 20 percent purity, well beyond the threshold set by the deal.Rabiei reiterated Iran was ready to reverse the steps it had taken as soon as all sanctions imposed during the Trump administration are lifted.'Complex process'EU spokeswoman Nabila Massrali warned of a "complex process" ahead, stressing that it was too soon to anticipate the outcome.It would take "joint efforts", she said, to see "what sanctions can be lifted and how to settle the nuclear issue".Kelsey Davenport, director for Non-proliferation Policy at the Arms Control Association think-tank, argued on the eve of the talks for a "bold first step by both sides" to inject "much-needed momentum" into the process.Washington, for example, could unfreeze Iranian funds held in foreign banks and facilitate humanitarian trade, and Tehran could stop enriching uranium beyond the levels agreed in the 2015 accord, said Davenport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/talks-to-save-iran-nuclear-deal-get-off-to-good-start-101617744575670.html
07-04-2021||World||Key witness in George Floyd murder trial seeks to avoid testifying||A key witness in the trial of the Minneapolis police officer accused of murdering George Floyd sought Tuesday to avoid giving evidence as his lawyers said he could incriminate himself on separate charges.Morries Hall, who was with Floyd in his car shortly before his death, is in custody and appeared by video camera at the hearing after he was subpoenaed to testify."There's really a very small narrow topic that might be permissible," Judge Peter Cahill said as Hall's lawyers argued that it was impossible for him to be cross-examined without incriminating himself.Hall is seen as a potentially important witness for the defense of former police officer Derek Chauvin, who was seen in a phone video kneeling on the neck of a handcuffed Floyd for more than nine minutes.The harrowing footage of Floyd's May 25, 2020 arrest touched off protests against racial injustice and police brutality in the United States and around the world.Minneapolis police chief Medaria Arradondo testified on Monday that Chauvin violated training policies by kneeling on Floyd's neck after he had stopped resisting.Further witnesses on Tuesday largely took the same line as they were questioned over Chauvin's actions.Shown a picture of Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, Lieutenant Johnny Mercil, the police's use-of force coordinator, said it was not an authorized restraint."We tell officers to stay away from the neck when possible. And if you're going to use body weight, to pin it on their shoulder," Mercil said during cross-examination.Prosecutors are seeking to prove that Floyd's death was due to asphyxiation, while Chauvin's defense claims it was due to illegal drugs in Floyd's system.Chauvin's lawyer Eric Nelson confirmed he wanted to ask if Hall sold or gave Floyd drugs.Hall's lawyer said "there's an allegation here that Mr Floyd ingested a controlled substance as police were removing him from the car... This leaves Mr Hall potentially incriminating himself."The judge said he would rule later on Hall's request not to testify.Chauvin, who was sacked from the police force after the incident, has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and manslaughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/key-witness-in-george-floyd-murder-trial-seeks-to-avoid-testifying-101617744137236.html
07-04-2021||World||Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's supporters denied prison visit and detained||Supporters of Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny were detained Tuesday outside a penal colony east of Moscow where the Kremlin critic is currently serving time.Navalny has been on hunger strike for nearly a week to protest what he says is the failure of authorities to provide proper medical treatment for his back and leg pains.Doctors from the Navalny-backed Alliance of Doctors union and supporters of the politician gathered in front of the prison. Navalny's physician and the union leader Dr. Anastasia Vasilyeva tried to get inside to meet with prison officials and see Navalny or talk to the prison medics about his condition, but were turned away.Local police said they detained nine people who allegedly “breached public order.” They included Vasilyeva and a CNN crew. Vasilyeva and the journalists were soon released, while other members of the union remained in custody.Navalny, 44, is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s fiercest domestic opponent. He was arrested in January upon returning to Moscow from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.A court ordered Navalny in February to serve 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation, including when he was convalescing in Germany, from a 2014 embezzlement conviction. Navalny has rejected the conviction as fabricated, and the European Сourt of Human Rights found it “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”Authorities transferred Navalny last month from a Moscow jail to the IK-2 penal colony in the Vladimir region, 85 kilometers (53 miles) east of the Russian capital. The facility in the town of Pokrov stands out among Russian penitentiaries for its especially strict inmate routines, which include standing at attention for hours.Within weeks of being imprisoned, Navalny said he developed severe back and leg pains and was effectively deprived of sleep because a guard checks on him hourly at night. He went on a hunger strike last Wednesday, demanding access to proper medication and a visit from his doctor.Russia's state penitentiary service has said Navalny is receiving all the medical help he needs, but Vasilyeva and others from the Alliance of Doctors had vowed to go to the prison on Tuesday if the politician wasn't allowed a visit from a qualified independent physician by Monday night.“We're gathering there not to protest. We're gathering there to save a man who, like any one of us, has the right to life and health,” Vasilyeva said in a YouTube video Monday.In an Instagram post Monday, Navalny said that three of the 15 people he is housed with were diagnosed with tuberculosis. He said he had a strong cough and a fever with a temperature of 38.1 degrees Celsius (100.6 F).The newspaper Izvestia carried a statement from the state penitentiary service late Monday saying Navalny had been the prison's sanitary unit after a checkup found him having “signs of a respiratory illness, including a high fever.”It was unclear Tuesday whether there had been any changes to the politician's condition.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Navalny would receive the necessary medical care but no preferential treatment.“Of course, there can be no talk about special conditions for one of the convicted persons,” Peskov said during a conference call with reporters. “There are certain rules for inmates who get sick. If the illness truly takes place, any relevant treatment will be provided.”Vasilyeva from the Alliance of Doctors said Tuesday she and her colleagues will keep coming to the colony. “I see only one option. If nothing happens, then we will come here tomorrow and the day after tomorrow. We will keep coming with our colleagues, requesting information and (trying to) be involved in (Navalny's) treatment somehow,” Vasilyeva said. “We can't back down. It's a matter of a person's life and death.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kremlin-critic-alexi-navalny-s-supporters-denied-prison-visit-and-detained-101617733500716.html

No safety issues have arisen in the children’s trial, he said.The trial plans to enroll 300 children aged 6 to 17, Oxford has said.

07-04-2021||World||7 deaths in UK among AstraZeneca jab recipients after blood clots||The UK medical regulator said Saturday that out of 30 people who suffered blood clots after receiving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, seven have died.The British acknowledgement of deaths comes as several European countries have paused the use of the AstraZeneca jab over a potential link to blood clots.The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency said in a statement that "Out of the 30 reports up to and including 24 March, sadly 7 have died."The Netherlands on Friday halted vaccinations with the AstraZeneca jab for people under the age of 60 after five new cases among women, one of whom died.Germany took a similar decision earlier this week.The European Medicines Agency (EMA), which like the World Health Organization previously declared the AstraZeneca vaccine safe, is expected to announce updated advice on the issue on April 7.The EMA said again on Wednesday it believes the vaccine is safe and that experts have found no specific risk factors such as age, gender or medical history.The UK regulator said that the 30 reports of thrombosis, submitted by medics or members of the public via a government website, came after 18.1 million doses of the vaccine had been administered in the country.Most of the cases (22) were cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, a rare condition when a blood clot forms in the brain.Eight other cases saw people suffer thrombosis and low levels of blood platelets, which help blood clot.There were no reports of blood clots from the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine it said, adding that "our thorough review into these reports is ongoing."The regulator's website says that on the basis of current data, the benefits of the vaccines against Covid-19 "continue to outweigh any risks".AstraZeneca said last month following US efficiency trials that its vaccine is 79 percent effective at preventing the disease and does not increase the risk of blood clots.The UK has administered more than 31 million first vaccine doses, using both the Oxford-AstraZeneca and the Pfizer-BioNTech jabs. People cannot choose which one they get.The UK in June 2020 ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and supported its development. It also ordered 30 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine the same year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-deaths-in-uk-among-astrazeneca-jab-recipients-after-blood-clots-101617438589413.html
