"It further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations."Bilateral ties were strained in 2018 when Australia became the first country to publicly ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network. Relations worsened last year when Canberra called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.Australia's latest move "is bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself," the Chinese embassy said.Australia's federal parliament granted the veto power over foreign deals by states in December amid the deepening diplomatic spat with China, which has imposed a series of trade sanctions on Australian exports ranging from wine to coal.Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull had declined to agree to a country-level MOU with China on the Belt and Road Initiative.But Victoria's Labor state premier Dan Andrews signed agreements with China's National Development and Reform Commission to promote the initiative in 2018 and 2019.Some countries fear the lending the Belt and Road scheme entails could lead to unsustainable debt levels in developing nations, including the Pacific islands region.Morrison's government has denied that its new veto power is aimed at China, Australia's largest trading partner and biggest source of overseas universities students before the pandemic led the country to close its borders.Payne said states, local governments and publicly funded universities had notified her of more than 1,000 foreign deals overall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-cancels-belt-and-road-deals-china-warns-of-further-damage-to-ties-101619018866588.html
21-04-2021||World||Thailand aims to boost vaccines by 50%; aims to reopen for tourists||Thailand aims to boost its vaccine order by more than 50% to 100 million doses this year in a bid to reach herd immunity, as surging local infections threaten to derail plans to reopen borders to tourism and reboot the economy.The government plans to buy 35 million more doses from two or three manufacturers with a target to administer them all by the end of 2021, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha said a day after chairing a meeting on the country’s new inoculation plan. The National Vaccine Institute is in talks with Pfizer Inc. for as many as 10 million doses, he said Tuesday.Thailand’s scaling up of vaccination efforts comes as Moody’s Investors Service cautioned that a new wave of Covid-19 cases threatens to further derail an economy that relies on tourism for about a fifth of gross domestic product. Infections have surged more than 60% so far this month, prompting at least two GDP downgrades, while fewer than 1% of Thais have received at least one of two vaccine doses.Read: Thailand’s Restrictions to Constrain Economic Recovery: Moody’s“The rollout has been too slow,” Kanit Sangsubhan, secretary general of the Eastern Economic Corridor Office, who attended Tuesday’s meeting with the prime minister, said in an interview.Thailand has so far relied on Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s shots for its priority sector workers and people at least 60 years. It’s also ordered 61 million doses of AstraZeneca Plc jabs to be locally manufactured by Siam Bioscience Ltd. that will be delivered from June.Faster RolloutWith a resurgence, the focus should be to administer vaccines as fast as possible in order to reopen for tourists and foreign investors, said Kanit, who’s also a member of Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee. “If we can’t contain the outbreak situation and can’t reach herd immunity, no one will come here.”Thailand has announced plans to reopen Phuket from July by waiving quarantine for vaccinated foreign tourists heading there. It’s using the resort island as a testing ground before expanding similar easing measures to other destinations such as Koh Samui.Phuket is on track to inoculate 70% of its adult population before July and the current outbreak is unlikely to delay the planned reopening, Bhummikitti Ruktaengam, president of the Phuket Tourist Association, said on Wednesday. The island will vaccinate 47% of its population by the end of May, similar to the current level in the Maldives, he said.Thailand’s central bank has said its 3% growth forecast for this year faces downward risks if its target of 3 million tourists isn’t reached. The nation’s tourism industry generated more than $60 billion in revenue from about 40 million foreign visitors in 2019.“The outbreak situation and vaccine rollout are two separate issues, and as long as we can reach the herd-immunity target, we can reopen,” said Bhummikitti, whose association represents about 300 members including luxury resort and five-star hotel operators in Phuket. “This is an unstoppable plan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-aims-to-boost-vaccines-by-50-aims-to-reopen-for-tourists-101618997389524.html
21-04-2021||World||Japan PM Yoshihide Suga’s visit, 2+2 meet called off due to Covid-19 crisis||Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has cancelled a planned visit to India and the Philippines later this month because of the Covid-19 situation, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. A 2+2 meeting of the defence and foreign ministers of India and Japan, which was to be held in Tokyo later this week, has also been called off, the people said on condition of anonymity. Though both countries were keen on the visit going ahead, a decision was made to call off the trip following consultations on Tuesday because of the Covid-19 situation on both sides, the people said. India recorded more than 295,000 new infections on Wednesday – the biggest daily increase reported in any country – while Japan is grappling with a resurgence of infections. Neither India nor Japan had formally announced the visit, but Suga had been expected to travel to New Delhi in late April or early May to boost bilateral cooperation, especially in the Indo-Pacific, in the face of China’s growing aggression and assertiveness across the region. The visit would have set the stage for the first in-person meeting between Suga and Modi, who had developed a close relationship with former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Suga was expected to discuss cooperation in a wide range of areas, ranging from maritime security to development of resilient supply chains and joint projects in third countries, during the visit. India and Japan have also been working closely within the framework of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, and Suga and his India counterpart Narendra Modi participated in the first leaders’ summit of the grouping last month. Japan is set to provide financing to ramp up the production of Covid-19 vaccines in India for distribution to developing countries in the Indo-Pacific. Japan, along with the US, has taken the lead in enhancing cooperation through the Quad, which also includes Australia, to ensure a rules-based order and freedom of navigation in the South and East China Sea. Japan has also backed India’s call for the restoration of the status quo on the Line of Actual Control amid the dragging military standoff with China. The cancellation of Suga’s visit follows British Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling off a trip to New Delhi on April 25. Modi has also cancelled a planned visit to Portugal next month for the India-European Union Summit. Johnson and Modi will hold a virtual meeting on April 26 and the India-EU Summit too will be held in a virtual format. There are no plans as of now for a virtual meeting between the Indian and Japanese premiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-yoshihide-suga-s-visit-2-2-meet-called-off-due-to-covid-19-crisis-101619026544887.html
21-04-2021||World||White House aims to make it easier for people to get vaccinated against Covid-19||The White House is trying to overcome diminishing demand for Covid-19 shots by making it easier for Americans to get vaccinated even as the United States is set to meet President Joe Biden's goal of administering 200 million coronavirus doses in his first 100 days in office.With more than 50% of adults at least partially vaccinated and roughly 28 million vaccine doses being delivered each week, demand has eclipsed supply as the constraining factor to vaccinations in much of the country.Over the last week, the pace of inoculation in the US has slowed slightly. That is partly a reflection of disruptions from the “pause” in administration of the Johnson & Johnson shot for a safety review, but also of softening interest for vaccines in many places even as eligibility has been opened to all those older than 16.As the vaccination program progresses, the administration believes it will only get more difficult to sustain the current pace of about 3 million shots per day. Roughly 130 million Americans have yet to receive one dose.In a White House speech on Wednesday, Biden will discuss efforts to expand vaccine distribution and access in his first three months in office, and outline his administration's latest plans to motivate more Americans to get shots.Surveys have shown that vaccine hesitancy has declined since the rollout of the shots, but administration officials believe they have to make getting vaccinated easier and more appealing, particularly for younger Americans who are less at risk from the virus and do not feel the same urgency to get a shot. That means providing incentives and encouragement to get vaccinated, as well as reducing the friction surrounding the vaccination process.Biden is announcing the launch of a new tax credit for small businesses to provide paid leave for those getting vaccinated or potentially needing to take time off to recover from side effects. Paid for through the $1.9 trillion virus relief package passed last month, the tax change would provide a credit of up to $511 per day, per employee for businesses with fewer than 500 workers to ensure that those workers or businesses don't suffer a penalty by getting vaccinated.The White House is calling on larger employers, which have more resources, to provide the same benefits to their employees, and to institute vaccine education and encouragement campaigns so that their workers get shots.According to the White House, just 43% of working adults have received at least one shot.Through its partnership with more than 40,000 retail pharmacies, the White House says more than 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site, and the administration is encouraging state and local efforts to bring vaccines directly to people, whether through initiatives reaching the homebound or clinics at large employment sites.Many states have also begun to open up vaccination sites to walk-in appointments, reducing reliance on often-cumbersome reservation systems.Maximizing the number of Americans vaccinated in the coming months is critical for the White House, which is aiming to restore a semblance of normalcy around the July Fourth holiday and even more so by the beginning of the next school year.Biden was not expected to set new public targets for vaccinations, and administration officials have been careful to avoid predicting when the country will have vaccinated enough people to reach herd immunity — when enough people become immune to a disease to make its spread unlikely. The US is on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult by the end of May and for every American by July, but administering the shots will be another matter.In recent weeks the White House has launched a massive outreach campaign to Americans to get vaccinated, relying on funding from the relief bill to launch ads and fund direct community engagement to under-vaccinated constituencies.Biden set his goal of 200 million shots last month after meeting his 100 million-in-100 days goal just over a month ago. At the time the US was well on pace to meet the higher target, and the pace of vaccinations has only accelerated, to about 3 million shots per day.The 100 million-dose goal was first announced on Dec. 8, days before the US had even one authorized vaccine for Covid-19, let alone the three that have now received emergency authorization. Still, it was generally seen within reach, if optimistic.By the time Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the US had already administered 20 million shots at a rate of about 1 million per day, bringing complaints at the time that Biden’s goal was not ambitious enough. Biden quickly revised it upward to 150 million doses in his first 100 days.It was a deliberate effort by Biden to set clear — and achievable — metrics for success as part of a strategy of underpromising, then overdelivering. Aides believe that exceeding his goals breeds trust in government after the Trump administration’s sometimes fanciful rhetoric on the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-aims-to-make-it-easier-for-people-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid19-101619021320982.html
21-04-2021||World||US adds about 100 countries to its 'Do Not Travel' advisory list||The U.S. State Department has added about 100 countries this week to its "Level Four: Do Not Travel" advisory list, putting the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Mexico, Germany and others on the list, citing a "very high level of Covid-19."On Monday, the State Department said it would boost the number of countries receiving its highest advisory rating to about 80% of countries worldwide.Before Tuesday, the State Department listed 34 out of about 200 countries as "Do Not Travel." The State Department now lists about 131 countries at Level Four. The State Department declined to say when it would complete the updates.The State Department said Monday the move does not imply a reassessment of current health situations in some countries, but rather "reflects an adjustment in the State Department's Travel Advisory system to rely more on (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's) existing epidemiological assessments."Other countries in the "Do Not Travel" list include Finland, Egypt, Belgium, Turkey, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain. Some countries like China and Japan remain at Level 3: Reconsider Travel."Most Americans already had been prevented from traveling to much of Europe because of Covid-19 restrictions. Washington has barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in most of Europe, China, Brazil, Iran and South Africa.On Tuesday, the United States extended by another 30 days restrictions barring non-essential travel at its Canadian and Mexican borders.Asked for comment on the travel advisory changes, Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. carriers, said it continues "to urge the federal government to transparently establish the criteria – including clear metrics, benchmarks, and a timeline – for reopening international markets."Earlier this month, CDC said fully vaccinated people can safely travel within the United States at "low risk" but Director Rochelle Walensky discouraged Americans from doing so because of high coronavirus cases nationwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-about-100-countries-to-its-do-not-travel-advisory-list-101619020611187.html
21-04-2021||World||Bangladesh seeks speedy delivery of vaccines from India amid domestic demand||The Bangladesh government has requested its Indian counterpart to expedite the delivery of about 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to ensure that the rollout of the immunisation programme in the neighbouring country isn’t affected, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. The matter was raised by the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and authorities in Dhaka over the past few days against the backdrop of concerns among Bangladeshi authorities about the delay in supply of doses that were contracted from Serum Institute of India (SII), the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. There was no official response from Indian officials on the matter. The Indian side said recently that exports of Covid-19 vaccines will be rolled out in a phased manner and delivery schedules will be calibrated in sync with domestic requirements. However, concerns have grown in several countries that have signed commercial agreements with SII as India’s domestic vaccine needs have increased significantly following a massive spike in infections and the government’s plans to open up the vaccination drive to everyone above the age of 18 from May 1. The people said the Bangladeshi side was solely dependent on vaccine supplies from India after it opted not to procure Chinese-made doses despite offers from Beijing. Any prolonged delay in the delivery of doses by SII could hit the rollout of the vaccination drive in Bangladesh, the people said. Bangladeshi authorities are also looking at the possibility of acquiring the Sputnik V vaccine developed by Russia, the people added. India has so far supplied 3.3 million doses of Covishield as grants to Bangladesh, while the country received another seven million doses as commercial supplies. The supplies began in January and the last delivery – 100,000 doses provided as a grant – was made on April 2. Bangladesh signed a commercial contract with SII last year to buy 30 million doses, and under the terms of the deal, the country should receive five million doses a month between January and June. The Nepal government too is awaiting the delivery of a million doses of Covishield contracted from SII. Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali had raised the delay in delivery of the doses during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on April 9. People familiar with developments in Kathmandu said there had been no word from the Indian side regarding the delivery of the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-seeks-speedy-delivery-of-vaccines-from-india-amid-domestic-demand-101619021924134.html

He is serving a 2-1/2-year sentence on old embezzlement charges that he says were trumped up.Navalny returned to Russia in January after treatment in Germany for what German authorities say was poisoning in Russia with a banned nerve agent. The Kremlin denies any blame.The U.N. experts voiced alarm at his deteriorating health, saying: "We believe Mr. Navalny’s life is in serious danger.""We are deeply troubled that Mr. Navalny is being kept in conditions that could amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in a facility that reportedly does not meet international standards," they added.They said that Navalny's current imprisonment and past attacks on him, including with Novichok, are "all part of a deliberate pattern of retaliation against him for his criticism of the Russian government and a gross violation of his human rights".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/his-life-at-risk-un-experts-urge-russia-to-allow-navalny-to-be-treated-abroad-101619020751845.html
21-04-2021||World||Republicans introduce bill to rename Ohio park after former US President Donald Trump||A GOP-backed bill introduced Monday would change the name of an Ohio state park to honor former President Donald Trump.The bill primarily sponsored by freshman state Rep. Mike Loychik to rename Mosquito Lake State Park to Donald J. Trump State Park is the latest attempt by Ohio Republicans to honor the former president.“This legislation is meant to honor the commitment and dedication that our 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, bestowed upon the great people of Trumbull County,” Loychik wrote in an initial statement.He added, “This enthusiasm for our former president was also historic throughout the state of Ohio last November as he pushed for initiatives and policies that was very well-received with my constituency and the state."While Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, he won Ohio with more votes than any candidate in state history.The state park proposal is just the latest indication of Trump’s influence in politics over the GOP party in Ohio — whether in the measured approaches of it over establishment Republicans like Gov. Mike DeWine, who is expected to run for reelection next year, or in the many right-wing candidates vying for the party’s nomination for Sen. Rob Portman’s seat.In Trumbull County, where the Mosquito Lake State Park is located, Trump won nearly 55% of the vote in November.The state park is located in Cortland, Ohio, with more than 7,000 acres, and one of the largest lakes in the state. Loychik had initially announced his plans for the bill in mid-March, resulting in a wave of criticism from Democratic colleagues.“Ohioans’ are struggling with an addiction crisis, economic disruption, and a pandemic that the other guy said would disappear just like magic,” Democratic Rep. Rich Brown tweeted on March 12. “Instead of addressing these pressing issues, Ohio House Republicans are spending their time flattering the Insurrectionist in Chief.”The state would need $300,000 allocated to change the signs in the park, according to the bill language.A message seeking comment was left Tuesday with Loychik.Also in response to the bill, the state Department of Natural Resources defended the name of the park.“The name has withstood the test of time. Mosquito Creek Lake was formed by damming Mosquito Creek back in 1944,” the statement read. “Since then, Mosquito Lake State Park has become one of Ohio’s best state parks, best fishing lakes, and has one of Ohio’s most important wildlife refuges.”The first proposal introduced by Republican legislators in honor of Trump sought to declare his birthday, June 14, as Donald J. Trump Day in Ohio.While it is not uncommon for states to turn the birthdays of former presidents into paid holidays or days of significance, that designation is usually bestowed after death. More than 40 states, including Ohio, recognize Ronald Reagan Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-introduce-bill-to-rename-ohio-park-after-former-us-president-donald-trump-101619020367896.html
21-04-2021||World||Biden pick Lisa Monaco wins Senate confirmation for no. 2 at DOJ||The Senate confirmed Lisa Monaco as deputy attorney general, the first action toward filling out Merrick Garland’s new leadership team for the Justice Department as it races to confront threats from domestic terrorism to potentially crippling cyber attacks.Monaco, who was confirmed Tuesday with strong bipartisan support on a vote of 98-2 brings a wealth of experience to the position, which oversees all of the department’s operations and its workforce of about 113,000, including 93 U.S. attorneys, as No. 2 to Attorney General Garland.Monaco, 53, spent 15 years in the Justice Department during the Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama administrations. In 2011 she became the first woman to lead the department’s national security division. In 2013, President Barack Obama selected her to serve as White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser.“Simply put, Lisa Monaco may be the most qualified individual ever nominated to serve as deputy attorney general,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said during her confirmation hearing on March 9.Gupta ChallengedAlthough Monaco had a relatively easy confirmation process, other officials nominated by President Joe Biden to top department positions have encountered fierce opposition from Republicans.Most Republicans have said they are opposed to the nominations of Vanita Gupta to be associate attorney general -- the No. 3 leadership position -- and Kristin Clarke to head the civil rights division on grounds that they’re too liberal.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had to take the rare step of filing a discharge petition in order to bring Gupta’s nomination to the floor. A vote hasn’t yet been held on confirming her nomination.Monaco said during her confirmation hearing that her first priority once confirmed will be getting up to speed on the investigation into the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by extremist supporters of former President Donald Trump.“It will be my focus to immediately get briefed on that investigation, but more broadly to understand, what is it that brought us to this point where we could have such an attack that I personally never thought I would see in my lifetime?” Monaco said. “What is it that is mobilizing people to violence and can we deploy all of the tools and resources of the Department of Justice to make sure it never happens again?”The Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation have warned about a heightened threat of attack from domestic violent extremists, and white supremacists in particular.“The Department of Justice is pouring its resources into stopping domestic violent extremists before they can attack, prosecuting those who do, and battling the spread of the kind of hate that leads to tragedies like the one we mark here today,” Garland said Monday at an event marking the 26th anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.Monaco also will help coordinate the department’s investigations and responses to hacking attacks. The nation’s spy chiefs warned last week that the prospect of “destructive and disruptive” hacking attacks is increasing as countries deploy more aggressive cyber operations, including those that could temporarily disable critical computers in the U.S.While the deputy attorney general has traditionally been a relatively obscure position publicly, its importance was demonstrated during the Trump administration. Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from being involved in the FBI’s investigation into whether Trump or any of his associates conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.The recusal catapulted then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to national prominence -- and controversy -- as he took charge of overseeing the investigation. Rosenstein in turn appointed Special Counsel Robert Muellerto run the inquiry, which cast a shadow over Trump’s tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-pick-lisa-monaco-wins-senate-confirmation-for-no-2-at-doj-101619016007482.html
21-04-2021||World||Bad offshore weather delays SpaceX crew launch until Friday||SpaceX on Wednesday bumped its next astronaut launch by a day because of dangerously high waves and wind offshore.Liftoff is now scheduled an hour before sunrise Friday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, when better weather is expected.The SpaceX Dragon capsule has the ability to abort the launch all the way to orbit in case of an emergency. That’s why good weather is needed not only at the Florida launch site, but all the way up the East Coast and across the North Atlantic to Ireland.“Although the weather is probably going to look great here at the launch site, we're worried about those downrange winds and wave heights in case of an abort,” said Kennedy's director, Robert Cabana, a former astronaut.The four astronauts from the U.S., Japan and France will spend six months at the International Space Station.This will be SpaceX's third launch of astronauts for NASA in less than a year. NASA turned to private companies once the shuttle program ended to haul not only supplies to the space station, but also people. SpaceX began delivering cargo in 2012 and flew its first crew up last May.For the first time, astronauts will be flying in a recycled capsule atop a recycled Falcon rocket. The capsule, dubbed Endeavour after the retired space shuttle, was used for SpaceX's first crew flight. The rocket was used for the company's second crew flight last November.The four astronauts on that second Spacex flight will return to Earth next Wednesday, assuming Friday's launch occurs. Splashdown will occur in the Gulf of Mexico off the Tallahassee, Florida, coast.During an outdoor news conference near Kennedy's countdown clock, NASA's acting administrator, Steve Jurczyk, stressed the space station's importance in the agency's effort to return astronauts to the moon. The 260-mile-high (420-kilometer-high) station is also key for Earth observations, he noted.In Washington, the Senate held a confirmation hearing Wednesday for former U.S. senator Bill Nelson, nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as NASA's next administrator. While a Florida congressman, Nelson flew on space shuttle Columbia in January 1986, just a couple weeks before the Challenger launch disaster."There's a lot of excitement going on at NASA right now and you all have seen it,” Nelson told the Senate panel, citing Monday's debut flight of a small helicopter on Mars and the return of astronaut launches to Florida.Former space shuttle commander Pamela Melroy would serve as Nelson’s deputy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bad-offshore-weather-delays-spacex-crew-launch-until-friday-101619017960356.html
21-04-2021||World||US Covid-19 vaccine plant for J&J to stay on hold after FDA Inspection||Production at an Emergent BioSolutions Inc. facility in Baltimore that’s expected to help make Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine will remain on hold, U.S. regulators said, after an inspection turned up multiple problems.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a report posted on its website Wednesday that Emergent failed to thoroughly investigate unexplained discrepancies, including the cross-contamination of a vaccine substance batch with ingredients from another shot.Emergent’s facility lacked sufficient oversight and failed to document and thoroughly investigate discrepancies, the FDA report said. Additionally, conditions at the plant were unsanitary, the agency said.Output at the facility has been on hold amid the inspection, which began last week and concluded on Tuesday.Use of the J&J vaccine has been paused in the U.S. since last week as regulators probe reports that a small number of people suffered serious blood-clotting side effects after receiving the shot. The FDA said the Emergent report was unrelated to a safety review that the agency and the Centers and Disease Control and Prevention are conducting. An advisory panel is meeting Friday to weigh whether use of the vaccine should resume.The FDA said in a statement that already-manufactured vaccines will undergo additional testing and evaluation to ensure their quality before they are distributed. The agency said that no vaccine manufactured at the plant has been distributed for use in the U.S.In response to the findings, J&J said in a statement that it planned to set up a global supply network to produce its shots, and that it would ensure that the concerns raised by the FDA about the Emergent plant are addressed.Emergent spokesman Matt Hartwig said the FDA findings will give the manufacturer direction on steps needed to improve operations and strengthen the J&J vaccine supply chain.“While we are never satisfied to see shortcomings in our manufacturing facilities or process, they are correctable and we will take swift action to remedy them,” he said.Last month, Emergent staff conflated materials for the J&J vaccine with another from U.K. drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc that was also being made on the premises. The error led the site to discard 15 million doses worth of an ingredient used in the J&J vaccine. J&J said on April 3 it would boost oversight of the facility and bring in new leadership.“There is no assurance that other batches have not been subject to cross contamination,” the FDA inspectors wrote in their report.Shares of Emergent were down 0.4% at 11 a.m. in New York, while J&J shares declined 0.2%.Improper HandlingFDA inspectors found that containers where drug substance was stored weren’t handled properly to prevent cross contamination, including instances caught on security cameras where employees dragged unsealed bags of special medical waste from manufacturing areas to the warehouse.Cameras caught employees who removed outer protective garments and put them in open garbage containers in the warehouse where raw materials sat awaiting manufacturing, according to the FDA report.Inspectors also flagged improper gowning procedures when employees who had been in a processing area for one bulk drug substance entered rooms where other substances were being made.The FDA began an inspection at the Baltimore facility on April 12. Four days later, regulators requested that Emergent stop making new materials and quarantine existing materials until the inspection and any remediation are concluded.Inspectors observed peeling paint, paint flecks on the floor and walls, and brown residue on the wall.FDA inspectors determined the facility is too small to handle the waste being generated by its vaccine output.

Opposition parties have accused the government of cronyism.The government denies the charge and a spokesman for Johnson said the prime minister had not broken any rules as he had informed officials about the exchange promptly."I make absolutely no apology at all ... for shifting heaven and earth and doing everything I possibly could ... to secure ventilators for the people of this country and to save lives," Johnson told parliament after being asked by the opposition Labour Party about the texts.The exchange of texts between Dyson and Johnson happened when the inventor tasked his engineers with making a ventilator to ease predicted shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.Dyson had asked the finance ministry for no change in tax status for his staff coming to Britain to work on the emergency project.He also contacted Johnson directly, who replied: "I will fix it", the BBC reported on Wednesday.Dyson's company, which in 2019 announced it was moving its headquarters from Britain to Singapore, developed a ventilator in 30 days.However, in the end the machines were not needed in Britain, which had sufficient supplies.Dyson said in May his company, known for its vacuum cleaners and fans, spent around 20 million pounds ($28 million) on the project and it would not be accepting any public money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-apology-boris-johnson-on-tax-assurance-to-secure-ventilators-for-covid-19-patients-101619013933691.html
21-04-2021||World||Search for missing Indonesian submarine finds oil spill||Indonesian rescuers searching for a submarine that went missing with 53 people on board found an oil spill on Wednesday near its dive location, authorities said.The 44-year-old submarine, KRI Nanggala-402, was conducting a torpedo drill in waters north of the island of Bali but failed to relay the results as expected, a navy spokesman said.An aerial search found an oil spill near the submarine's dive location and two navy vessels with sonar capability have been deployed to assist the hunt, Indonesia's Defense Ministry said.A ministry statement said requests for assistance had been sent and Australia, Singapore and India had responded.CNN Indonesia reported that Indonesian navy official Julius Widjojono said he suspected the submarine had descended to a depth of 600-700 metres."We are still searching in the waters of Bali, 60 miles (96 km) from Bali, (for) 53 people," military chief Hadi Tjahjanto told Reuters in a text message. He said contact with the vessel was lost at 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday.Representatives of the defence departments of Australia and Singapore did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The military chief will hold a media briefing to share further information about the search on Thursday from Bali, a spokesman said.Military analyst Soleman Ponto said it is too early to determine the fate of the submarine conclusively."We don't know yet whether the communication equipments were broken or the submarine has sunken. We have to wait for at least three days," he said.The 1,395-tonne KRI Nanggala-402 was built in Germany in 1977, according to the defense ministry, and joined Indonesian fleet in 1981. It underwent a two-year refit in South Korea that was completed in 2012.Indonesia in the past operated a fleet of 12 submarines purchased from the Soviet Union to patrol the waters of its sprawling archipelago.But now it has a fleet of only five including two German-built Type 209 submarines and three newer South Korean vessels.Indonesia has been seeking to modernise its defence capabilities but some of its equipment still in service is old and there have been deadly accidents in recent years.In 2016, an Indonesian air force transport plane crashed into a mountain, killing all 13 people board, during a training exercise in the remote region of Papua.In 2015, an Indonesian military transport plane crashed into a northern residential area two minutes after takeoff, killing more than 100 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-for-missing-indonesian-submarine-finds-oil-spill-101619014043788.html
21-04-2021||World||Police fire tear gas in protest against German Covid-19 measures||Police fired tear gas as thousands of people demonstrated in Berlin on Wednesday against a proposed amendment to give Angela Merkel's government power to impose tougher anti-coronavirus measures.With Germany buckling under a third wave of the virus, the amendment allowing for nationwide curbs like school closures and night-time curfews aims to end a political tug-of-war between the federal government and the 16 regional states over virus restrictions.Around 8,000 protesters gathered ahead of a vote on the law in the Bundestag lower house of parliament on Wednesday, with more than 2,000 police officers deployed to the scene.Protesters were carrying placards with slogans such as "Merkel & Co = high treason" and chanting "Wir sind das Volk" ("We are the people") -- a common refrain in the run-up to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.Police started breaking up the demonstrations in the afternoon as protesters were not wearing masks or observing social distancing, a police spokeswoman said.Seven people were arrested, added police.Dubbed the "emergency brake", the law prescribes tough measures including sweeping shutdowns and overnight curfews in regions with incidence rates of more than 100 new infections per 100,000 people over the last seven days.It would also force schools to revert to virtual teaching in states where the incidence rate exceeds 165.Only one state had an incidence rate below 100 on Wednesday, while seven topped 165 -- including the two most populous of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia.Fierce oppositionThe curfews would apply from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am in areas with high infection rates, with exceptions for lone walkers and joggers before midnight.The proposals have come under fierce opposition, particularly the plans for curfews in a country still scarred by memories of Nazi and communist dictatorships that spied on citizens and stole their freedoms.In a heated debate over the amendment, Christine Aschenberg-Dugnus of the pro-business FDP said the curfews were "not an appropriate measure" and the party would take legal action against them.If passed by the parliament, the law will go to a second vote in the upper house, or Bundesrat, on Thursday before being signed off by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.Virus restrictions in Germany have so far been decided in consultations between Merkel and the leaders of the 16 states, with the regions ultimately responsible for implementing them.But in many cases, regional leaders have failed to put in place shutdown measures which they agreed with Merkel, with many choosing broad interpretations of the rules.Merkel warned in a rare TV interview in March that she would not stand by and watch infection rates continue to rise, threatening the regional leaders with a change in the law if they did not play ball.'Cry for help'Defending the plan for tougher rules in parliament on Friday, Merkel pointed out that other countries have imposed far more restrictive measures."The third wave of the pandemic has our country firmly in its grip," she said. "The intensive care doctors are sending out one cry for help after another. Who are we if we ignore these emergency calls?"Some German states, including Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Baden-Wuerttemberg, have already sharpened their rules in anticipation of the new law.But critics say it does not go far enough, with doctors and scientists calling for a quick, hard lockdown to bring infections under control while the country's vaccination effort picks up pace."A standardisation of the rules is welcome, but they are not far-reaching enough," Thorsten Lehr, a professor of clinical pharmacy at Saarland University, told Der Spiegel.Social Democrat MP and epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach told Die Welt newspaper the watered down curfews would "extend the duration of the lockdown and, unfortunately, lead to unnecessary deaths".The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) health agency reported 24,884 new cases in the past 24 hours on Wednesday and 331 deaths, with a national incidence rate of 160.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-fire-tear-gas-in-protest-against-german-covid-19-measures-101619011279684.html
21-04-2021||World||Pakistan probes shooting of former prominent journalist critical of military||Pakistani police on Wednesday opened an investigation into the shooting and wounding of a former prominent journalist and head of the state media regulator, who has been a vocal critic of the military and its alleged meddling in politics.Absar Alam, who is in his 50s, was shot at by an unknown person in a park close to his home in Islamabad on Tuesday, police said in a statement.He headed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) for two years under former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who had fallen out with the military before he was sacked by a court on corruption charges, which he denies.Alam was shot in the ribs and was in hospital but out of danger, police said."I have not lost my spirit, and I will not lose my spirit," Alam said in a video message he recorded in a car on his way to hospital after the attack.Prime Minister Imran Khan's relations with the press and broadcasters have become increasingly strained since he took office after an election in 2018.Opponents say Khan secured office with the help of a crackdown on the media by the military, which has a history of involvement in Pakistani politics, including staging coups to oust civilian governments.The military denies meddling in politics or involvement in the shooting."We vehemently deny this. The military has nothing to do with this," the military's Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) wing told Reuters.Activists say the crackdown on the media since 2018 has left 3,000 journalists and other media workers jobless.Alam alleged in a tweet over the weekend that the current chief of the military's ISI spy wing called him when he was PEMRA chief to reinstate live coverage by a local TV channel of an Islamist group. The Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) had choked Islamabad in 2017 protests against cartoons published in France depicting the Prophet Mohammad.The TLP called an end to violent nationwide anti-France protests on Tuesday after the government called a parliamentary vote on whether to expel the French ambassador over the same issue.Amnesty International and the Community to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called on authorities to investigate the shooting and find those responsible.The shooting "highlights the dangerous climate that all members of the press face in Pakistan if they dare to criticize the country's powerful military", said Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia programme coordinator.Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan among the five deadliest countries for journalists in 2020, when four journalists were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-probes-shooting-of-former-prominent-journalist-critical-of-military-101619010931220.html
21-04-2021||World||Bank of England sees potential risks from cloud data providers||The Bank of England might strengthen its controls on cloud data providers and other technology firms to counter possible risks to the stability of the financial system from the rise of fintech, Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said.The Bank of England (BoE) has expressed concerns before about the reliance by financial firms, especially fintech startups, on third-party technology companies for key parts of their operations, and Ramsden said this scrutiny would intensify."We plan to analyse further whether we need even stronger tools to manage the risk that critical third parties, including potentially cloud and other major tech providers, may pose to the Bank's ... objectives," Ramsden told the Innovate Finance conference on Wednesday.Regulators globally have been tightening scrutiny of outsourced functions as they worry that core services financial firms provide to customers are vulnerable to outages at third parties.Britain's government is keen to promote fintech as an area of growth and hopes that nimbler regulation will enable it to steal a march over the European Union, where British financial firms now have reduced access due to Brexit.The BoE has said it will not water down regulatory standards, but does see scope for more streamlined regulation of smaller banks and in some areas of insurance.On Monday, finance minister Rishi Sunak asked the BoE to work with the finance ministry on whether the central bank should set up a digital version of sterling to compete with cryptocurrencies, which he dubbed 'Britcoin'.The government is also consulting over proposals to relax stock market listing rules due to a concern that Britain is less attractive than the United States as a listing venue, especially for tech companies whose founders want to keep an sizeable role.Ramsden said the BoE had taken a step to make life easier for smaller financial companies on Monday by giving firms more direct ways to access its high-value payments system, which is dominated by major banks and processing companies.Other steps included work standardising the identification of businesses involved in financial transactions, and looking at whether artificial intelligence could ease the burden of regulatory compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bank-of-england-sees-potential-risks-from-cloud-data-providers-101618997347736.html

Some members of the royal family are expected to be with her on Wednesday. Her birthday falls within the two-week royal mourning period for Philip that is being observed until Friday.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was one of many people who sent best wishes to the monarch.“I have always had the highest admiration for Her Majesty and her service to this country and the Commonwealth," Johnson said on Twitter. “I am proud to serve as her prime minister.”Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, died on April 9 at age 99. Family and friends gathered for his funeral at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday to say their final farewells.His death came a few months before his 100th birthday, which was due to be the focus of royal celebrations this year, while the queen’s 95th was always set to be a more low-key event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-death-queen-elizabeth-expresses-thanks-for-support-and-kindness-101619005028618.html
21-04-2021||World||Syria loses voting rights at global chemical watchdog for poison gas use in civil war||Syria on Wednesday was stripped of its voting rights by member states at the global chemical weapons watchdog after its forces were found to have repeatedly used poison gas during the civil war.A majority of nations voting at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) supported a decision to immediately revoke Syria's privileges at the agency.The proposal was initiated by 46 out of 193 member countries on the OPCW's governing Conference of States Parties, including Britain, France and the United States. It passed by 87 votes in favour to 15 against, meeting the required two-thirds majority of votes. There were 34 abstentions out of 136 countries taking part.Iran, Russia and Syria were among those to vote against.Although largely symbolic, the move sends a political signal to Syria that breaches of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits all use of chemicals on the battlefield, will not be accepted.It gave "a clear no against continued use and possession of chemical weapons," the representative of the Netherlands at the OPCW Tweeted.Repeated investigations by the United Nations and the OPCW's special Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) concluded that Syrian government forces used the nerve agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs in attacks between 2015 and 2018 that investigators said killed or injured thousands.Syria and its military ally Russia have repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the war, which has turned the once-technical agency into a flashpoint between rival political forces and deadlocked the U.N.

21-04-2021||World||Putin warns West of harsh response if it crosses Russia's 'red lines'||President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday not to cross Russia's "red lines", saying Moscow would respond swiftly and harshly to any provocations in a way that would force those behind them to regret their actions.Putin made his comments at a time when relations with the United States and Europe are under acute strain over Ukraine and the health of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny."We want good relations...and really don't want to burn bridges," Putin said in his annual state of the nation address to both houses of parliament."But if someone mistakes our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intends to burn down or even blow up these bridges, they should know that Russia's response will be asymmetrical, swift and harsh."Russia would determine where its red line lay in each specific case, he said.His comments came at the climax of a 78-minute speech dominated by Russia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic hardship.Recent weeks have seen an intensification of confrontation between Russia and Western countries which say Moscow is massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine.ROLLING PROTESTSLast week, Washington tightened sanctions on Russia over accusations of computer hacking and election interference, and the Czech Republic accused Moscow of a role in explosions at an arms depot in 2014. Both expelled Russian diplomats. Russia denied wrongdoing and responded with tit-for-tat expulsions.Putin made no mention of Navalny, the jailed opposition politician three weeks into a hunger strike, whose supporters, even as Putin spoke, were beginning a series of rolling protests across the country.Two of Navalny's closest allies were arrested on Wednesday, their lawyers said. Lyubov Sobol, one of the faces of Navalny's popular YouTube channel, and Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, were both detained in Moscow."As usual, they think that if they isolate the 'leaders', there won't be any protest," said Leonid Volkov, a close Navalny associate. "Of course that's wrong."Another Navalny aide, Ruslan Shaveddinov, tweeted: "Right now across the whole of Russia they are detaining potential protesters. This is repression. This cannot be accepted. We need to fight this darkness."Navalny, Russia's leading opposition politician, is gravely ill in prison following his decision to launch a hunger strike in protest against what he calls inadequate medical treatment for leg and back pain. His team have urged people across the vast country to take to the streets on Wednesday.The government has said the planned gatherings are illegal. Previous pro-Navalny rallies have been dispersed by force, with thousands of arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-respond-harshly-quickly-to-foreign-provocations-says-putin-101619003209223.html

He said that contact with the vessel was lost at 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday.Representatives of the defence departments of Australia and Singapore did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The 1,395-tonne KRI Nanggala-402 was built in Germany in 1978, according to the Indonesian cabinet secretariat's website, and underwent a two-year refit in South Korea that was completed in 2012.Indonesia in the past operated a fleet of 12 submarines purchased from the Soviet Union to patrol the waters of its sprawling archipelago.But now it has a fleet of only five including two German-built Type 209 submarines and three newer South Korean vessels.Indonesia has been seeking to upgrade its defence capabilities but some of its equipment still in service is old and there have been deadly accidents involving in particular ageing military transport planes in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-submarine-with-53-crew-aboard-missing-seeks-australia-singapore-help-101619002012009.html
21-04-2021||World||Xi, Modi among 40 leaders at Biden-led climate summit starting on Thursday||China’s President Xi Jinping will attend a US-led climate summit on Thursday, boosting hopes of cooperation between the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters even as they bicker over a host of diplomatic, trade and human rights issues.Xi is among 40 world leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, invited by US President Joe Biden to attend the two-day virtual event.Xi’s confirmation comes days after John Kerry, US special envoy on climate change, held talks with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, in Shanghai. Xi, at the invitation of the US, will attend the summit via video and will deliver an “important” speech, said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, on Wednesday.It will be the first appearance of Xi and Biden in the same event after the latter became US president in January. The announcement of Xi’s attendance was made a day after he made veiled references to the US-led West in a speech delivered virtually at an economic forum, rejecting what he called hegemonic powers in global governance and saying there should be no “bossing” and “meddling” in other countries.Xi’s critical tone was a continuation from Alaska last month where a high-level meeting of diplomats from the two countries – the first such meeting since Biden took over -- was marked with rancour and retorts.But the two countries have discovered a patch of common ground on tackling the climate crisis.Last week in Shanghai, Kerry and Xie agreed on concrete actions “in the 2020s” to reduce emissions.The talks also marked a resumption of dialogue on climate halted during the Donald Trump administration, who had withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement. Later, Biden put America back into the accord.“Moving forward, China and the US are firmly committed to working together and with other parties to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement,” a joint statement issued after the Xie-Kerry talks had said.“The Leaders’ Summit on Climate will underscore the urgency – and the economic benefits – of stronger climate action. It will be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow,” a statement from the White House had said earlier.On Wednesday, Wang said, “China expects that this summit will provide a platform for global cooperation to address climate change challenges, promote the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, and provide a useful platform for exchanges and cooperation to jointly promote global climate and environmental governance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-modi-among-40-leaders-at-biden-led-climate-summit-starting-on-thursday-101619002003141.html

It reported 1,458 new infections and two deaths on Wednesday.Its mass vaccination plan has been centred on 61 million doses of locally-made AstraZeneca vaccine, the first batches scheduled for June.For initial inoculations, Thailand has received 2 million doses of Sinovac Biotech's vaccine and has ordered a further 1.5 million doses, with 500,000 to arrive on Saturday and the rest next month. It has also imported 117,000 doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine.The private sector, which had been for months seeking permission to import vaccines, welcomed its inclusion."This is the race. We have to be fast and have volume, but we haven't had any other vaccines," Chalerm Harnphanich, president of the Private Hospital Association, told Reuters.Health experts also questioned the government's decision not to use the COVAX international vaccine-sharing facility, which has provided vaccines to 100 countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and South Korea."We missed an opportunity by not joining COVAX," said Thiravat Hemachudha, head of the Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Centre.The government has argued joining COVAX risked higher costs and uncertain delivery times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-will-get-35-mn-more-vaccine-doses-pm-amid-criticism-of-slow-rollout-101619000955425.html

Prosecutors sought permission to introduce eight prior use-of-force incidents, but the judge would only allow two. In the end the jury heard none.Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lawyer, has defended his client's use of force as appropriate in potentially dangerous situations."I don't have no sympathy for him. I think he got what he deserved," Julian Hernandez, 38, a carpenter now working in Pennsylvania, told Reuters.Hernandez said he never heard anything from the Minneapolis police after submitting a complaint about Chauvin, who he said "choked him out" during an encounter in a Minneapolis night club in 2015. A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department declined to comment.According to Chauvin's police report, Hernandez failed to follow orders and resisted arrest when Chauvin, who was working as an off-duty security guard, tried to escort him out of a night club. Chauvin's report said this prompted him to apply "pressure toward his Lingual Artery" to subdue Hernandez.Hernandez said Chauvin picked him out of the crowd for no reason and quickly escalated to violence. He said Chauvin should have been removed from the police force.As Monroe Skinaway, 75, took in news of Chauvin's conviction, he flashed back to the night he witnessed Chauvin pin another man to the pavement with the same detached look as when he knelt on Floyd's neck.It was March 2019, 15 months before Floyd's death would spark global protests against racism and police brutality.But Skinaway still remembers what he deemed the indifference on Chauvin's face that night as he pressed Sir Rilee Peet's head into a puddle deep enough that he, like Floyd, struggled to breathe.A jury on Tuesday found Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force, guilty of all three charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, an outcome welcomed by activists as progress in holding law enforcement accountable for its treatment of Black Americans. Chauvin is white and Floyd was Black."We people of color very seldom get a good verdict," said Skinaway, who is Native American. "I'm kind of amazed."'I CAN'T BREATHE, MAN'Skinaway says he did not know Chauvin at the time he and another officer arrested Sir Rilee Peet, a young Native American man with a history of mental illness. But Skinaway later recognized him as the officer charged in Floyd's death.Skinaway says he was speaking with the officers about the recovery of a stolen car when Peet approached and did not comply with requests to back away. A police report about the incident states that a struggle ensued and Chauvin maced Peet, applied a neck restraint and pinned him to the ground so he could be handcuffed.The incident was one of the six prior use-of-force incidents that Judge Peter Cahill blocked prosecutors from presenting at trial, ruling they would be prejudicial.In court filings, prosecutors said Chauvin restrained Peet in a manner that was beyond what was necessary or reasonable - an assertion also made by Skinaway in interviews with Reuters.Skinaway says Chauvin grabbed Peet by the back of his hair and pressed his face into a rain puddle. That began a cycle where Peet would gasp for air and say "I can't breathe, man" before Chauvin would force his head down again.Skinaway said he saw similarities between Chauvin's treatment of Peet and Floyd."He basically did the same thing to that Native kid," Skinaway said. "I think the incident would have gone longer possibly if the ambulance didn't show up."Peet, who was arrested for disorderly conduct and obstruction of the legal process, could not be reached for comment. Earlier this year Peet told the Marshall Project he did not recall the incident. It was not clear what happened to the charges against him.Jimmy Bostic, who ended up in the hospital after a scuffle with Chauvin and other officers in April 2016, said he was "ecstatic" when he heard the verdict, seeing it as a sign that police officers, too, could be held accountable.According to a police report, Bostic was refusing to leave a store and threatening to spit on its owner. As the situation escalated, Chauvin wrote in the report that he "closed distance with" Bostic and "secured his neck/head area with my hands."Bostic, who is currently in prison on an unrelated burglary conviction, said he struggled to breathe after the encounter and was taken to the hospital due to an asthma attack."George Floyd could have very well been Jimmy Bostic Jr," the 23-year-old said in an interview after the verdict. "I'm just happy that there was an example set today."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-sympathy-for-chauvin-say-those-who-had-run-ins-before-floyd-101619000573990.html
21-04-2021||World||With enough supplies, Israel looks to re-route AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine delivery||Israel no longer wants AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine and is exploring with the company whether a big shipment in the pipeline could be sent elsewhere, Israel's pandemic coordinator said on Wednesday."We are trying to find the best solution. After all, we don't want (the vaccines) to get here and have to throw them into the trash," the official, Nachman Ash, told Army Radio, saying Israel's needs were being met by other suppliers.In his remarks, Ash made no reference to AstraZeneca’s vaccine having been associated with very rare blood clots in Europe. Many countries there resumed administering it after the European Union's drug watchdog said benefits outweighed risks.Israel cast a wide net last year when trying to secure vaccine doses at the height of the pandemic and pre-ordered from a number of companies.It largely settled on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, launching one of the world's swiftest rollouts. Covid-19 infections in Israel have dropped dramatically and the economy has reopened.Israel is also buying the Covid-19 vaccines from Moderna, which uses a similar messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.Ash said that with supplies secure through 2022, Israel no longer required the 10 million doses it agreed to purchase from AstraZeneca."They can certainly be used in other places in the world. At the moment, we are trying to find, along with the company, the best way to do this," he said."We believe it would be best if they (the vaccines) did not come to Israel and we agree with the company on some sort of way to divert them elsewhere."Officials at AstraZeneca had no immediate comment.Around 81% of Israeli citizens or residents over 16 - the age group eligible for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel - have received both doses.Some 167,000 of the 5.2 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Islamist Hamas-run Gaza have had at least one dose of vaccine, with supplies coming in from Israel, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the global COVAX vaccine-sharing programme and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-enough-supplies-israel-looks-to-re-route-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-101619000316613.html
21-04-2021||World||Russia detains top aides of jailed Kremlin critic Nalanvy ahead of protests||Two close associates of Alexei Navalny were detained Wednesday ahead of protests planned to support the imprisoned Russian opposition leader, who has been on a hunger strike since March 31.Navalny's team called Sunday for nationwide protests after reports about the politician's health deteriorating in prison. Russian authorities have stressed that the demonstrations were not authorized and warned against participating in them.Vladimir Voronin, a lawyer for top Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol , said on Twitter that people “in uniform” removed Sobol from a taxi near a Moscow metro station on Wednesday morning and took her to a police precinct.Police also detained Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh, who is currently under house arrest on charges related to January protests in support of the politician. Yarmysh was detained near the entrance of her apartment building when she went out during the one hour she is allowed to leave, her lawyer, Veronika Polyakova, said on Twitter.Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin. Russian officials have rejected the accusation. His arrest for an alleged violation of a suspended sentence from a 2014 embezzlement conviction triggered protests that represented the biggest show of defiance in Russia in recent years.Soon after, a court ordered Navalny to serve 2 1/2 years in prison for the embezzlement conviction, which the European Court of Human Rights deemed to be “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”Navalny began the hunger strike to protest prison officials' refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. The penitentiary service has said Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.Navalny’s physician, Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said Saturday that test results he received from Navalny’s family showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys.“Our patient could die at any moment,” he said in a Facebook post.On Sunday, the politician was transferred to a hospital in another prison and given a glucose drip. Prison officials rebuffed attempts by his doctors to visit him there.In response to the news about Navalny’s health, his team called for more nationwide protests on Wednesday, the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to deliver his annual state of the nation address.According to a website dedicated to the protests, demonstrations were being planned in 165 Russian cities as of Wednesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-detains-top-aides-of-jailed-kremlin-critic-nalanvy-ahead-of-protests-101618995083029.html
21-04-2021||World||Europe clinches deal on wide-ranging climate law to speed emissions cuts||The European Union clinched a deal in the early hours of Wednesday on a landmark climate change law that puts new, tougher greenhouse gas emissions targets at the heart of all EU policymaking.The deal arrives just in time for a summit of world leaders hosted by the US government on Thursday and Friday, where the EU and other global powers will promote their pledges to protect the planet.The European climate law will guide the bloc's regulations in the coming decades. It includes a target to reduce net emissions at least 55% by the end of the decade from 1990 levels - lower than the 60% goal sought by the European Parliament - to steer it towards reaching zero net emissions by 2050.If adopted globally, the net zero by 2050 pathway would limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.After months of wrangling and a full night of negotiations from Tuesday, negotiators representing the European Parliament and the 27 EU governments finished the law. The deal still needs formal approval from parliament and national governments."This is a landmark moment for the EU," the bloc's climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said in a statement. "Today's agreement also reinforces our global position as a leader in tackling the climate crisis."A handful of countries, including Britain and New Zealand, have enshrined net zero emissions goals into law, but the 27-country EU is the biggest emitter to do so.The target to cut EU-wide net emissions at least 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels, replaces a previous goal of a cut of at least 40%. By 2019, EU emissions were already 24% lower than in 1990.EU lawmakers had wanted to go further to 60% by 2030. Green campaigners said the cut should be 65%."I'm satisfied today," said Swedish Social Democrat Jytte Guteland, the European Parliament's lead negotiator. "The most important thing was to make sure that science would be more integrated in the EU law."Green EU lawmaker Michael Bloss said Brussels had sacrificed ambition to rush through a deal in time for the US summit.The 2030 target sets the stage for a major package of EU regulations due in June to cut emissions, including proposals to revamp the EU carbon market, tougher CO2 standards for cars, and a border tariff to impose CO2 costs on imports of polluting goods.Negotiators agreed to limit the amount of emissions removals that can be counted towards the 2030 target, to 225 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.That aims to ensure the goal is met by cutting emissions from polluting sectors, rather than relying on removing CO2 from the atmosphere through carbon-absorbing forests.The law requires Brussels to create an independent body of scientific experts to advise on climate policies, plus a greenhouse gas budget laying out the total emissions the EU can produce from 2030-2050, without thwarting its climate goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-clinches-deal-on-wide-ranging-climate-law-to-speed-emissions-cuts-101618998128787.html
21-04-2021||World||Covid-19: China says it has vaccinated 200 million citizens||Around 200 million Chinese, or 14.29% of the population, have been vaccinated for COVID-19 so far, with an emphasis on front-line workers, university students and people living in border areas, a health official said Wednesday.China is ramping up vaccination efforts after a slow start, prompted in part by the virtual elimination of domestic transmission. Just two local cases were reported on Wednesday, both in the city of Ruili, which borders on Myanmar.Center of Disease Control official Cui Gang told a news conference that key areas and members of the population were being prioritized for vaccines. China has approved five domestically produced vaccines and exported millions of doses, although some scientists believe they provide less protection that those by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.The Chinese vaccines have an efficacy range of 50.7% to 79.3%, based on company data, lower than their foreign peers but still effective.China is now giving millions of shots a day and a top government doctor, Zhong Nanshan, has announced a goal of vaccinating 560 million of the country’s 1.4 billion people by mid-June.China locked down the city of Wuhan for more than two months starting in January 2020 after the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019. Wuhan became known as the epicenter of the pandemic, although Beijing has suggested the virus might have been circulating earlier and possibly brought to China from abroad.Since then, China has controlled the virus through stringent border controls and quick lockdowns whenever new outbreaks crop up. Mask wearing indoors remains almost universal and health tracing applications must be shown at most shops, offices and public buildings.While China was the first major economy to throw off the effects of the virus, the restrictions are seen as limiting its further growth, particularly as Beijing readies to welcome tens of thousands of visitors as host of the Winter Olympics in February 2022.Along with the sheer scale of the vaccination effort, authorities need to convince a population that largely no longer feels threatened by infection.“At present, vaccination efforts in key areas and key population groups are progressing smoothly overall," Cui told reporters at Wednesday's briefing. Already, 80% of workers in the health sector have received the jab, Cui said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-says-it-has-vaccinated-200-million-citizens-101618998428690.html

He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia's technological and industrial potential.The Russian leader has urged authorities to quicken the pace of the country's vaccination program, which has been slow compared to the West.He promised new measures to encourage births and to increase average life expectancy, acknowledged that the pandemic has exacerbated demographic trends in Russia.Putin proposed new incentives to help the economy overcome the blow from the pandemic and new social payments to the population.Allies of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny called for nationwide protests across Russia on Wednesday to support him. Navalny started a prison hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he says is inadequate medical treatment for his back pains and officials' refusal to allow a visit by his doctor. His deteriorating condition has caused international outrage.Navalny's imprisonment and his health condition have fueled tensions with the West, already strained over Moscow's interference with elections, hacking attacks and, most recently, a massive Russian military buildup near the border with Ukraine.The Kremlin has rejected Western concerns about the troop concentration, saying it's free to deploy the military wherever it's deemed necessary on the Russian territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-lauds-russia-s-vaccine-work-predict-herd-immunity-by-autumn-101618997821964.html
21-04-2021||World||Mourning Queen Elizabeth marks low-key 95th birthday||Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II is marking a low-key 95th birthday on Wednesday, days after husband Prince Philip’s funeral on Saturday.While the national mourning period in memory of the Duke of Edinburgh officially concluded on Sunday, the monarch remains in mourning until Friday and there is unlikely to be any of the usual birthday markers such as the release of an official photograph by Buckingham Palace.The Queen is expected to spend the day privately at Windsor Castle, where she will be joined by some close members of the royal family.“I would like to send my warm wishes to Her Majesty The Queen on her 95th birthday,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a Twitter statement.“I have always had the highest admiration for Her Majesty and her service to this country and the Commonwealth. I am proud to serve as her Prime Minister,” he said.Prince Philip, the longest-serving consort to a British monarch, died on April 9, just under two months away from his 100th birthday, which was due to be the focus of royal celebrations this year – with the Queen's 95th already set to be a lower key affair.The coronavirus pandemic situation meant that the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony to celebrate the Queen’s official birthday in early June had also been called off by Buckingham Palace back in March.Thousands of well-wishers usually fill central London to watch the Queen and members of the royal family for the event, which stems from the traditional preparations for battle, when colours (or flags) were carried ("trooped") down the rank to be seen and recognised by the soldiers.The full ceremony traditionally takes place at Horse Guards Parade in London and involves more than 1,400 soldiers and 200 horses. The event attracts thousands of spectators – largely friends and family of the soldiers taking part in the military spectacle.The royal family gathers on the Buckingham Palace balcony to acknowledge the crowds in The Mall leading up to the palace. However, the event has now been cancelled for the second year running and the palace said that options for a smaller parade in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle are being considered instead, like last year.The Queen's close family are thought to be with her at Windsor along with around 20 staff, dubbed “HMS Bubble” alluding to the lockdown. The monarch has spent the bulk of the lockdown since last year at her Berkshire castle, along with Prince Philip – who passed away peacefully in his apartment.The Queen became the world's oldest monarch in 2015 and will be marking the platinum jubilee of her 70-year reign in June 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mourning-queen-elizabeth-marks-low-key-95th-birthday-101618997887593.html
21-04-2021||World||US-backed Afghan peace talks in Turkey postponed after Taliban no-show||An upcoming international peace conference that was meant to move Afghanistan's warring sides to a power-sharing deal and ensure an orderly U.S. exit from the country has been postponed, its sponsors announced Wednesday, citing a lack of prospects for meaningful progress. The decision came several days after Taliban insurgents, who are key to peace efforts, dismissed the U.S.-promoted conference in Istanbul as a political spectacle serving American interests.No new date was given for the conference, which was to have started Saturday under the sponsorship of the United Nations, Turkey and Qatar. Turkey's foreign minister said the conference was delayed until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan which ends in mid-May.The delay underscored the difficulties the Biden administration and NATO are facing in orchestrating an orderly exit from conflict-scarred Afghanistan. Both have said they would begin withdrawing their remaining troops — a total of close to 13,000 — from the country on May 1 and complete the pullout by Sept. 11, no matter what.Just hours before the announcement of the postponement, a suicide bomber attacked a convoy of Afghan security personnel, wounding seven people in the capital of Kabul. The interior ministry said civilians and security personnel were among the wounded.The attack was the first in weeks in the capital, even as targeted killings have escalated and Afghanistan’s security personnel have come under relentless attacks by Taliban insurgents. Recent months have also seen an increase in government bombing raids on suspected Taliban positions and increased raids by Afghan special forces.Residents fear the attack could be a harbinger of what’s to come as foreign troops prepare to begin their final withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one took immediate responsibility for the attack.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the conference was postponed because of “lack of clarity” by the participants, without elaborating.The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said in a statement Wednesday that the conference will be held at “a later date when conditions for making meaningful progress would be more favourable.”Until now, the Taliban have refused to sign on to the conference even as Pakistan, where their leadership council resides, has been pressing the hardline Islamic militia to attend.The Taliban have accused Washington of breaching an agreement signed last year under which the U.S. was to have withdrawn the last of its troops by May 1.But President Joe Biden, who inherited that deal with the Taliban from his predecessor, last week said the remaining estimated 2,500 troops would begin leaving on May 1. All American and NATO soldiers would be gone by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist assault on the U.S. that launched the U.S.-led invasion to hunt down al Qaida's leader Osama bin Laden.On Sunday, the Taliban issued an English-language statement on their Al Emara site, indicating they were not ready to attend the conference. They claimed that a powerful propaganda campaign had been launched, hyping expectations that a peace deal would be reached at the end of the planned 10-day meeting.The statement said this was an attempt “to push the Taliban, willingly or unwillingly, to a rushed decision which was needed by America.” It alleged that the aim of the conference was to “complete a for-show road map before the withdrawal of foreign forces.”In Kabul, Afghan government-allied negotiators had anticipated a delay as none had received an invitation to the conference and several were without visas to Turkey.In Washington, the U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price would not confirm the postponement but said the U.S. would continue diplomatic efforts to reach a peace deal.“When it comes to the talks in Istanbul, this gets to the point that, from the very earliest days of the Biden administration, we have recognized ... that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan, and only through a political settlement and a comprehensive ceasefire will we be able to support a resolution that brings a security, stability, and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan," Price said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usbacked-afghan-peace-talks-in-turkey-postponed-after-taliban-noshow-101618997684946.html
21-04-2021||World||12 US states urge Biden to back phasing out gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035||The governors of a dozen U.S. states including California, New York, Massachusetts and North Carolina called on President Joe Biden on Wednesday to back ending sales of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels.Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan calls for $174 billion in spending and tax credits to boost electric vehicles (EVs) and charging networks but does not call for phasing out gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.In a letter that was seen by Reuters, the governors, which also include those of Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington State and Rhode Island, urged Biden to set standards "to ensure that all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold are zero-emission no later than 2035 with significant milestones along the way to monitor progress."They argued that "by establishing a clear regulatory path to ensuring that all vehicles sold in the United States are zero-emission, we can finally clear the air and create high-road jobs."The governors also want Biden to set standards and adopt incentives aimed at ensuring 100% zero-emission sales of medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles by 2045.The White House did not immediately comment on the governors' letter.States and some lawmakers hope that Biden's endorsement of a phase-out date will speed the transition to EVs by users and automakers. EVs currently make up just 2% of U.S. vehicle sales.A number of U.S. lawmakers have urged Biden follow California's lead, which in September said it planned to end sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles by 2035. Biden's campaign said last fall he did not support California's phase-out plan.In March, a group of 71 House Democrats urged Biden to set tough emissions rules to ensure 60% of new passenger cars and trucks sold are zero-emission by 2030, while 10 U.S. senators urged Biden "to set a date by which new sales of fossil fuel vehicles will end entirely."General Motors said in January it was setting a goal to end all gasoline passenger car and truck sales by 2035. Volvo, a unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding, said its entire car line-up will be fully electric by 2030 and Ford’s European lineup will also be fully electric by 2030.In their letter, the governors said they want Biden to boost fuel economy standards rolled back under President Donald Trump and provide states "substantial funding for investment in charging and fueling infrastructure." They also urged removal of or raising the EV tax credit limits per manufacturer.But not everyone has backed a phase-out plan.Rory Gamble, the president of the United Auto Workers union, has expressed caution about the shift to EVs, noting it takes fewer workers to build EVs than gas-powered vehicles and said "workers will disproportionately suffer if we do not get it right."He said last month the government must ensure the transition to EVs "is stable, reliable and creates quality union wage jobs and flexible to market demand not relying on a one-size fits all solution."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-us-states-urge-biden-to-back-phasing-out-gas-powered-vehicle-sales-by-2035-101618996186975.html

21-04-2021||World||Some parts of China battle tight supply of Covid-19 vaccines: State media||Residents of some parts of China that are grappling with tight supplies of coronavirus vaccines have not received their second doses in time, but the crunch will ease by June as production is being stepped up, a health official told state media.The pace of China's massive inoculation campaign has slowed, to a daily average of about 3.3 million doses in the seven days until Monday, down from the corresponding figure of 4.2 million in the week until April 12, Reuters calculations showed."At present, domestic vaccine supply is relatively tight, but from May, especially after June, the situation will ease significantly," Zheng Zhongwei, the director of a team coordinating vaccine development projects, told the Global Times in an interview.Zheng did not say how severe the crunch was or which areas experienced tightness. The Global Times, published by the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, did not say how long people in those areas had to wait for the second shot.By Wednesday, China had given more than 200 million doses of vaccines, ranking only behind the United States, and it aims to inoculate 40% of its population by summer.Big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have widened vaccination efforts to include foreigners, with the pace in some cities outstripping the national average, as China prioritises supplies to key provinces.The capital city of Beijing, for example, has inoculated more than half of its population of 21.5 million.This month Zheng said China was likely to have produced 3 billion doses of the vaccines by year-end, allowing it to meet the demand in the second half of 2021.China's national guidelines allow intervals of up to eight weeks between the two doses of vaccines developed by domestic firms Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech.Local authorities should make sure the second dose can be administered within eight weeks, said Mi Feng, a spokesman of the National Health Commission."Avoid the situation where there's no dose following the first one," he told a news conference on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-parts-of-china-battle-tight-supply-of-covid-19-vaccines-state-media-101618994687379.html

But family members have identified her as Makiyah Bryant, aged 16.The police chief said the video, which he said shows the slain teenager trying to stab both females, was released to the public within hours of the incident in the interest of "transparency."The officer who opened fire was not identified but appears from the video to be white. The chief said he "would be taken off the street" pending an investigation.Around the time the video was made public, live television news coverage showed a growing crowd of protesters on city streets after dark, confronting a small line of police officers on bicycles.The demonstration appeared from media coverage to be peaceful, with protesters repeatedly chanting the girl's name.The Columbus Dispatch reported that demonstrators had gathered near the scene of the shooting earlier in the day.Woods said the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) had opened an inquiry into the case. The city's public safety director, Ned Pettus, Jr., appealed for calm while the investigation proceeds and facts are uncovered in what he called "a devastating" loss of life."Fast, quick answers cannot come at the cost of accurate answers," Pettus told a late news conference with the police chief and mayor. "BCI will conduct a fully independent investigation, which will be made public. If an officer has violated policy or the law, if they have, they will be held accountable."Mayor Andrew Ginther said it appeared from an initial review of the footage that the officer who opened fire "took action to protect another young girl in our community.""But another young girl will still not be coming home tonight," he said. "I ask everyone to pray for peace. Tonight, we pray for this family, we pray for this city, and we pray for our neighbors."A woman identified in the Columbia Dispatch account as the slain girl's aunt, Hazel Bryant, told the newspaper the teenager lived in a foster home and became involved in an altercation with someone at the residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-teenage-girl-seen-brandishing-knife-in-ohio-shot-dead-by-us-police-101618994484933.html
21-04-2021||World||Canadian PM Justin Trudeau keen to take AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine||Justin Trudeau said he would prefer taking AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine after Ontario province, where the capital city of Ottawa is located, threw open its vaccination drive against the disease, making the Canadian prime minister eligible for the jab.Ontario’s administration announced on Tuesday that those aged 40 to 54 can register for vaccination. The 49-year-old Trudeau falls in that category.Trudeau insisted on getting the AZ vaccine “to convey the message to all Canadians that they should be vaccinated with the first one that is offered to them as quickly as possible”, according to a translation of a comment in French cited by CBC News.Trudeau’s remarks came even as a third case of rare blood clots following an AZ shot was reported in Canada.It occurred in the province of New Brunswick, where a person received the SII-manufactured Covishield vaccine in mid-March. The unnamed individual, in the 30s, has now recovered, according to authorities. During the course of a briefing on Tuesday, Jennifer Russel, the province’s chief medical health officer, said such cases “are extremely rare”, adding that they “do happen” and they are “treatable”.Canada has lately been seeing a degree of vaccine hesitancy over reports of rare blood clots following the use of the AZ jab. Two cases were reported earlier, in Quebec and Alberta - both linked to the version manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) under the Covishield brand name. However, Canadian health officials have consistently stressed on the safety of the vaccination drive. Health Canada tweeted recently, “Based on all the evidence available internationally to-date, Health Canada continues to consider that the benefits of the #AstraZeneca and Covishield vaccines to protect against Covid-19 outweigh the potential risks.”Vaccine supplies continue to be haphazard in Canada, which received 13,371,462 doses in total till April 19, including 2,316,020 AZ shots of which 500,000 were Covishield.Canada reported 7,270 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking its total number of infections to 1,139,049, which includes 23,714 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-keen-to-take-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-101618991682789.html
21-04-2021||World||China’s tech firms not adopting renewable energy goals fast enough: Greenpeace||China’s tech firms are not adopting clean energy “fast enough” to mark their commitment towards carbon neutrality, though more Chinese internet companies have begun to procure renewable energy and are disclosing greenhouse gas emissions data, environmental group Greenpeace said in a report on Wednesday.The report says China’s data centre industry is a significant and growing source of CO2 emissions – energy consumption from the sector is on track to increase 66% between 2019 and 2023; while in 2018, data centres in China were powered 73% by coal.By 2023, electricity consumption from the industry is projected to rival that of Australia.But the situation is changing, the Greenpeace report says.In a new ranking published on Wednesday, internet giant Tencent took the top spot among cloud providers in Greenpeace East Asia’s latest clean energy scorecard for China’s tech sector, leapfrogging e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, which fell to fourth place.Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to bring the country’s climate-warming emissions to a peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, committing the country to an accelerated transition to renewable energy.As of April 2021, 13 of China’s 22 biggest tech companies have begun to actively procure renewable energy, compared to just eight companies in 2019. However, only two major Chinese tech companies have recorded renewable energy usage rates that are higher than 3% - Chindata (51%) and Baidu (9%).“To date, only one major Chinese tech company, data centre operator Chindata Group, has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. Last year, Chindata signed contracts to develop 1.3GW of wind and solar projects in Shanxi and Hebei provinces, making the company one of the top three renewable energy buyers worldwide in 2020,” the report says.“At the same time, GDS fell from being the second-ranked data centre operator to sixth due to a lack of carbon neutrality commitments and poor transparency,” the report said.Ye Ruiqi, Greenpeace East Asia’s climate and energy campaigner, said, “China’s internet sector is powered primarily by coal, and the industry’s energy consumption continues to rise. Over the past year, more Chinese companies have begun to procure renewable energy and to disclose greenhouse gas emissions data.”“However, the pace of clean energy adoption is not nearly fast enough, especially when we consider that China’s biggest tech company, Alibaba, and its biggest independent data centre operator, GDS, have yet to issue renewable energy or carbon neutrality commitments,” Ye added.The report spells out what needs to be done.China’s internet companies should set targets for 100% renewable energy use and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, it says.“Carbon offsets are not a substitute for the reduction of fossil fuel emissions. Companies must scale up procurement of wind and solar energy, and actively disclose energy use data and greenhouse gas emissions data,” the report says.Ye said, “Tech giants such as Alibaba and GDS have an opportunity to drive China’s shift to a low-carbon economy, but currently they are falling behind their competitors. Ultimately, we need all of China’s major tech firms to achieve 100% renewable energy use and carbon neutrality across the value chain by 2030 - this would lend strong momentum to China’s national climate commitments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-tech-firms-not-adopting-renewable-energy-goals-fast-enough-greenpeace-101618990122507.html

The UK has not prohibited direct flights from India.Canada has taken no decision yet, but the matter is being look at, as Trudeau said on Tuesday. “I’ve asked our officials to look very carefully at what for example the UK has done in suspending flights from India, what more can and should be done to ensure we are not getting cases in from overseas,” he told reporters. Flights are currently operating between India and Canada almost on a daily basis under an air bubble arrangement between the two countries. They are operated by Air Canada and Air India and connect New Delhi to the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver.Canada has already instituted additional measures since January, including the requirement of a negative RT-PCR test before boarding a flight and a test on arrival in Canada, with passengers having to remain at a designated hotel at their cost, till the results arrive. According to data from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Covid-19 cases have been reported on 28 flights from India this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-closely-looking-at-uk-move-to-place-india-on-red-list-101618988682769.html
21-04-2021||World||Floyd’s killing: Jury holds Chauvin guilty, Biden calls it ‘giant step forward’||After a high-profile trial followed closely in America and around the world, a jury has held former US police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of all three charges over the controversial death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year - including unintentionally killing the Black man - which had sparked a global wave of anti-racism protests. Soon after the verdict was delivered in Minneapolis, US President Joe Biden called it a “giant step forward” in the fight against systemic racism, and said Floyd’s killing was a “a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the (racism)”, which he said was “a stain on our nation’s soul”. Vice-President Kamala Harris said, “Today, we feel a sigh of relief. Still, it cannot take away the pain. A measure of justice isn’t the same as equal justice. This verdict brings us a step closer. And, the fact is, we still have work to do.”Floyd’s death under Chauvin’s knee outside a Minneapolis grocery store on May 25, 2020 had triggered countrywide protests and outrage that had turned violent in the initial days with the National Guard being deployed to various parts of the US. The unrest — which swelled under the anti-racism slogan “Black Lives Matter” — quickly spread beyond the shores of the US and led to the toppling of a statue of a slave-trader in Bristol, UK; sparked the targeting of a 150-year-old statute of King Leopold II in Brussels, Belgium for brutalities in Congo; and triggered demonstrations in Australia against the subjugation of its indigenous people.The wave of anti-racism protests touched India as well. Mahatma Gandhi’s statute was vandalised by protesters outside the Indian embassy in Washington, DC, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to bring it up in a phone call with then US president Donald Trump.In Minneapolis, a 12-member jury of six white people and six people of colour held Chauvin guilty of unintentional second-degree murder, which is punishable with up to 40 years in prison; third-degree murder, which is unintentional murder caused by the use of an eminently dangerous act, punishable with up to 25 years in jail; and secondary manslaughter, which is culpable negligence creating an unreasonable risk. Sentencing is expected in about two months’ time, with Chauvin possibly staring at a lengthy jail term, according to legal experts.The former police officer looked on with a frown, the lower half of his face covered by a mask, as judge Peter Cahill read out the verdict in a Minneapolis courtroom. After that, Chauvin was taken away in handcuffs in a rare case of a US police officer held guilty for a killing. There have been only seven cases since 2005 in which police officers were found guilty of murder for on-duty shooting. Around 1,000 fatal shootings by cops are reported every year, according to a widely cited study by Bowling Green State University.Floyd’s family was relieved at the verdict. “They’re all saying the same thing: ‘We won’t be able to breathe until you’re able to breathe.’ Today, we are able to breathe again,” Philonise Floyd, one of his brothers, said in Minneapolis after the verdict. “Justice for George means freedom for all.” Terrence Floyd, another brother, said, “I’m going to miss him, but now I know he’s in history. What a day to be a Floyd, man.”The verdict came after three weeks of a trial aired live into Americans homes. The prosecution built its case around a video shot by a bystander — 17-year-old Darnella Frazier — that shows Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds. “Use your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw,” prosecutor Steve Schleicher said in his closing arguments.Defence attorney Eric Nelson tried to divert the jury’s attention from the video towards Floyd’s underlying health conditions and drug use. “The state has really focused on the 9 minutes and 29 seconds, 9 minutes and 29 seconds, 9 minutes and 29 seconds. It’s not the proper analysis because the 9 minutes and 29 seconds ignores the previous 15 minutes and 59 seconds, completely disregards,” he said in his concluding arguments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floyds-killing-jury-holds-chauvin-guilty-biden-calls-it-giant-step-forward-101618986882437.html
21-04-2021||World||Joe Biden’s wartime law use blocks India’s vaccine ramp-up||Indian officials are in touch with their counterparts in the US to resolve a hold-up in supplies of raw materials needed by Covid-19 vaccine makers that has been caused by Washington’s decision to prioritise local buyers under a war-time law invoked earlier this year by President Joe Biden to boost vaccine production.Supplies of nearly 30 such items have been affected by this wartime law, known as the Defense Priorities and Allocations System Programme (DPAS) under the Defense Production Act (DPA).Vaccine maker Serum Institute of India (SII) is understood to be in dire need of raw materials as it ramps up its production of Covid-19 vaccines amid an alarming surge in infections across the country.These raw materials include reagents, tubing materials, nano-filters, plastic bagging material and equipment that are understood to be needed for ramping up vaccine production.The Indian side has raised the issue with the US as part of the growing bilateral cooperation on healthcare. External affairs minister S Jaishankar discussed it with US secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday, and the Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, has brought it up in his conversations with US officials. The Americans have promised to “give the matter due consideration” and work with India to “find appropriate solutions”, according to people familiar with the developments.The raw materials are not subject to any explicit export ban, it has been argued. But American sellers of these items are obligated to meet contractual requirement from US buyers before anyone else, which include Indian buyers, who have been being told to expect delayed delivery, according to the people familiar with these discussions.Biden invoked the DPA in February to boost vaccine production, especially to aid Pfizer-BioNTech’s effort. The supply crunch for Indian vaccine makers was first noticed in March, according to the people cited above. SII’s CEO and owner Adar Poonawalla went public with his plight in an appeal to Biden last week. Now that the US has administered at least one dose of vaccine to half of its population and built up a sizable stockpile of millions of doses, its need for these raw materials may be tapering off, which would allow American suppliers to resume full and timely delivery of shipment ordered by outside buyers, such as vaccine makers from India, it was said.The issue of raw material supply crunch has, however, been confused in some quarters for India and South Africa’s appeal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) last October for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights (IPR) related to Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, “until widespread vaccination is in place globally, and the majority of the world’s population has developed immunity”. The US and Europe, home to leading Covid-19 vaccines makers, have blocked that move, which has been backed by 80 WTO members.Asked about the bottleneck in raw material supplies, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, spoke on Monday about the WTO discussions. “We are, of course, working with WTO members on a global response to Covid. That includes a number of components, whether it’s $4billion committed to COVAX, or discussions about how we can aid and assist countries that need help the most,” she said.Psaki also referred to US trade representatives Katherine Tai’s speech at a WTO-hosted discussion on Covid-19 vaccine and the need for their equitable distribution around the world. While sympathetic to the cause, Tai did not concede any ground on the question of the waiver of Covid-19 vaccine-related IPR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-wartime-law-use-blocks-india-s-vaccine-rampup-101618984303659.html
21-04-2021||World||Xi Jinping to participate in Biden's climate summit||Chinese leader Xi Jinping will participate in a climate summit organized by US President Joe Biden, a sign that climate issues are one area the two countries can cooperate on amid frosty ties.Xi accepted Biden’s invitation and will attend via video link on Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday.Washington and Beijing are at odds over a range of issues, from allegations of forced labor in Xinjiang and China’s tightening political grip over Hong Kong to US efforts to curb China’s role in supply chains. Xi used a speech Tuesday to the Boao Forum on Asia to challenge Washington’s global leadership, saying the world needed “justice, not hegemony.”Still, the two nations have shown they’re eager to work together to tackle climate change. A joint statement released after US climate envoy John Kerry visited Shanghai last week said Washington and Beijing would support implementation of the Paris Agreement and promote a successful United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow this year.“China maintains an open attitude when it comes to climate cooperation and welcomes dialogue,” said Zhang Monan, senior fellow at the US-Europe Institute at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a think tank in Beijing.“However, if countries continue to pressure China or adopt confrontational and non-cooperative tactics, then China will address this with corresponding actions,” she said.Xi met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron last week for a virtual climate conference. The European leaders welcomed his renewed commitment for China to achieve CO2 neutrality by 2060, a spokeswoman for Merkel said, and the three also discussed the coronavirus pandemic and global vaccine supplies.Washington dropped out of the Paris climate accord under the Trump administration, and China has been critical of the move. During Kerry’s visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the US is to blame for delaying the agreement’s progress.The US is preparing to host 40 world leaders at the summit on Thursday and Friday. The virtual conference will bring together 17 countries responsible for 80% of global emissions and gross domestic product, the White House said.Biden will pledge to cut US greenhouse-gas emissions by at least half by the end of the decade, the Washington Post reported, citing two people briefed on the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-to-participate-in-biden-s-climate-summit-101618981683032.html
21-04-2021||World||Singapore to reduce entry of Indians as new virus variants emerge||Singapore is reviewing its border measures for recovered travelers following the emergence of new variants of concern as coronavirus cases tick up around the world.The city-state will also closely monitor for re-infection of people who have previously recovered from Covid-19, the Health Ministry said in a statement published Tuesday. The announcement came after a recent case, where an individual likely contracted the virus again during a visit to India and was infectious when he returned to Singapore, the ministry said.The Southeast Asian country, which has largely managed to contain the pandemic, is stepping up its safeguards amid new waves of virus infections in Europe and Asia. New measures include reducing border entry approvals and extending isolation measures for travelers from India amid an escalation of Covid-19 cases in that country.Fewer entry approvals from India will be granted for non-Singapore citizens or permanent residents with immediate effect, the ministry said in another press release also published Tuesday. Starting at the end of April 22, all travelers who have recently been to India will be subjected to an extra seven days of home isolation following their 14-day quarantine at a government-designated facility.India now has the world’s fastest-growing Covid-19 caseload, adding 259,170 new infections and 1,761 deaths on Tuesday, leaving it behind only the U.S. in terms of total numbers.Hong KongAt the same time, the city-state eased measures for travelers from Hong Kong, and lifted entry restrictions for travelers from the U.K. and South Africa. The government is also making it easier for people who have been fully vaccinated to travel to high-risk regions.Travelers from Hong Kong, where vaccinations are rising and cases are dropping, will have to stay in home isolation for seven days upon arriving in Singapore starting at the end of Thursday. Previously they had to spend 14 days in a government-chosen hotel.Singaporean long-term pass holders and short-term visitors will now be able to enter from the U.K. and South Africa. Previously only citizens or permanent residents were allowed in. All will have to spend 14 days in a government-selected hotel and an additional seven days in home isolation.Fully vaccinated people will be able to make “essential official” trips to higher-risk regions subject to multiple tests at their destination and seven days of self-isolation when they return to Singapore, while non-vaccinated people will have to abide by prevailing border measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-reduce-entry-of-indians-as-new-virus-variants-emerge-101618975589594.html
21-04-2021||World||US says ‘deeply focused’ on expanding global Covid-19 vaccination, manufacturing||The United States is deeply focused on expanding global vaccination, manufacturing, and delivery -- all of which will be critical to ending the Covid-19 pandemic, the State Department has said.“President (Joe) Biden, Secretary (of State Tony) Blinken, they are deeply focused on the issue of expanding global vaccination, manufacturing, and delivery – all of which will be critical to ending the pandemic,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters during his daily news conference.Responding to a question, he said, Blinken has consistently made the point that as long as the virus is out of control and uncontained anywhere around the world -- whether in the US or elsewhere -- it continues to pose a threat to American people.“First and foremost, our priority is ensuring the distribution of a safe and effective vaccine to millions of Americans, to all Americans who are able to take advantage of it. But we also know that we need to continue to demonstrate that leadership when it comes to countries beyond our borders, and that’s precisely what we’ve done,” he said.The United States, he said, has re-engaged the WHO; it has committed USD 2 billion to COVAX, and another USD 2 billion over time; it has spoken to its partners Canada and Mexico.“We have spoken to the arrangement we have with the Quad and the increased production capacity that that will bring about,” Price said.“It is not only in our interest to ensure that the American people are vaccinated, the other point I would make is that the rest of the world also has an interest in seeing to it that the American people are vaccinated and that the virus is brought under control here,” he said.The US, he said, has suffered tremendously.“We have more deaths than any other country around the world, more than 5,50,000 at this point, tens of millions of cases. So again, as long as the virus is uncontrolled anywhere, it is a threat to people everywhere. That is true in the United States; that is true in countries around the world, and it’s precisely why we’re taking this approach,” Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-deeply-focused-on-expanding-global-covid-19-vaccination-manufacturing-101618973851485.html

Reacting to the development, George Floyd's brother Philonise, speaking at a news conference with several family members after the verdict, said, "We are able to breathe again" but added that the fight for justice was not over. "We have to protest because it seems like this is a never-ending cycle," he was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.A 12-member jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty of all three charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter after considering three weeks of testimony from 45 witnesses, including bystanders, police officials and medical experts. Deliberations began on Monday and lasted just over 10 hours.BackgroundIn a confrontation captured on video last year, Derek Chauvin, a white veteran of the police force, was seen pushing his knee into the neck of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020. Chauvin and three fellow officers were attempting to arrest Floyd, accused of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a grocery store.Floyd's death prompted protests against racism and police brutality in many US cities, including Minneapolis, and other countries last summer, even as the world grappled with the coronavirus pandemic. The intersection of race and law enforcement has long been contentious in the United States, underscored by a series of deadly incidents involving white police officers and Black people in recent years.SentencingChauvin could now face up to 40 years in prison. Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, Chauvin faces 12-1/2 years in prison for his murder conviction as a first-time criminal offender. Prosecutors could seek a longer sentence of up to 40 years if Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill determines that there were "aggravating factors." Cahill said Chauvin's sentencing was likely eight weeks away.While the US criminal justice system and juries have long given leeway and some legal protection to police officers who use violence to subdue civilians, the Minneapolis jurors found that Chauvin had crossed the line and used excessive force.The Minneapolis police department fired Chauvin and the three other officers the day after Floyd's murder. The three others are due to face trial later this year on aiding-and-abetting charges.The jurors remained still and quiet as the verdict was read. Chauvin, wearing a grey suit with a blue tie as well as a light-blue face mask, nodded and stood quickly when the judge ruled that his bail was revoked. He was taken out of the courtroom in handcuffs and placed in the custody of the Hennepin County sheriff.ReactionsThe conviction triggered a wave of relief and reflection not only across the United States but in countries around the world."It was a murder in the full light of day and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism," US president Joe Biden said in televised remarks. "This can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America." Biden and vice president Kamala Harris watched the verdict being read out along with staff in the White House's private dining room, the White House said. Biden, Harris and first lady Jill Biden all spoke with Philonise Floyd.The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement published in the Minneapolis Star Tribune that "there are no winners in this case, and we respect the jury's decision," adding: "We need to stop the divisive comments, and we all need to do better to create a Minneapolis we all love."Outside the courthouse, a crowd of several hundred people erupted in cheers when the verdict was announced - a scene that unfolded in cities across the country. Car horns honked, demonstrators blocked traffic and chanted: "George Floyd" and "All three counts." At George Floyd Square in Minneapolis, the intersection where Floyd was killed and which was later named in his honour, people screamed, applauded and some threw dollar bills in the air in celebration.While celebrating the verdict, protesters called for justice in the case of Daunte Wright, a Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer after a routine traffic stop on April 11, just a few miles from where Derek Chauvin stood trial. Kimberly Potter, who has turned in her badge, has been charged with manslaughter in that case.(Inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-able-to-breathe-again-george-floyd-s-family-hails-chauvin-verdict-101618972296098.html
21-04-2021||World||South Korean and Australian economy exhibit resilience to Covid-19 global crises||South Korea and Australia are proving the odd couple of the global economy, managing to mitigate the impact of the Covid crisis due to deep links with China’s growth and key advantages unique to themselves.The duo’s connections aren’t obvious given Korea is a manufacturing powerhouse with skilled labor as key strength and Australia extracts vast resource wealth from a continent it has to itself.The common denominator is their exposure to China, which is the endpoint for more than 25% of Korea’s exports and an extraordinary 43% of Australia’s shipments.Yet the reliance doesn’t explain all, as China is the biggest market to most in Asia, including Japan, and many have performed poorly during the pandemic.Another common feature is the duo’s relative success in controlling the pandemic. The coronavirus has all but been eliminated Down Under, while Korea has managed to keep total infections so far to around 115,000 -- a fraction of what’s seen in similar-sized countries elsewhere.“They’re an odd couple,” said Saul Eslake, an independent economist. “They’re in the same timezone, but that’s about it. Korea is an importer of commodities and an exporter of increasingly sophisticated manufactured goods. ”Eslake noted the countries have one of the three Ps that typically drive growth -- population, participation and productivity -- Australia the first and Korea the third.Their currency values tend to rise in a risk-on atmosphere, though it’s the Korean won that’s more aligned with the Chinese yuan, said Park Chong-hoon, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Seoul.The two nations, the only developed economies to dodge the 2009 global recession and whose contractions last year were shallower than most, do have a close economic relationship. Korea is Australia’s fourth-largest trading partner and they’ve had a free-trade agreement operating since 2014.An Ernst & Young report released last month found few countries managed to achieve positive economic and health outcomes during the Covid-19 pandemic. It placed Australia and Korea in an elite quad that also included Denmark and New Zealand.Their huge exposure to China also comes with risks, with both having run afoul of Beijing. Korea faced a tourism boycott after it deployed the U.S. anti-missile system in 2017. Australia faced a range of trade actions against goods including coal, wine and barley after calling a year ago for independent investigators to be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.Peter Drysdale, head of the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Australian National University, notes both Australia and Korea opted for major fiscal responses to the global financial crisis and Covid. He says how they manage China going forward is key.The most important point is “what strategies each country has for linking to the growth momentum in China that appears clearly set to continue,” said Drysdale, one of the architects of APEC. “What will things look like down that track and will the position of each country be as they try to capture long term growth potential.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-and-australian-economy-exhibit-resilience-to-covid-19-global-crises-101618971902640.html

The 12 jurors on Tuesday found Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death in May 2020, CNN reported.Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said, "eight weeks from now we will have sentencing." The former police officer was charged with killing Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes, which was captured on video footage in May 2020 and triggered nationwide demonstrations for racial justice.Issuing a statement on Twitter, Obama said, "For almost a year, George Floyd's death under the knee of a police officer has reverberated around the world inspiring murals and marches, sparking conversations in living rooms and new legislation. But a more basic question has always remained: would justice be done?Here's the entire statement from former US president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle:"In this case, at least, we have our answer. But if we're being honest with ourselves, we know that true justice is about much more than a single verdict in a single trial.""True justice requires that we come to terms with the fact that Black Americans are treated differently, every day. While today's verdict may have been a necessary step on the road to progress, it was far from a sufficient one. We cannot rest," he added.Today, a jury did the right thing. But true justice requires much more. Michelle and I send our prayers to the Floyd family, and we stand with all those who are committed to guaranteeing every American the full measure of justice that George and so many others have been denied. pic.twitter.com/mihZQHqACVObama further said: "We will need to follow through with the concrete reforms that will reduce and ultimately eliminate racial bias in our criminal justice system. We will need to redouble efforts to expand economic opportunity for those communities that have been too long marginalised.""And as we continue the fight, we can draw strength from the millions of people especially young people who have marched and protested and spoken up over the last year, shining a light on inequity and calling for change. Justice is closer today not simply because of this verdict, but because of their work," his statement added.Offering prayers to the Floyd family, the former US President said, "Michelle and I send our prayers to the Floyd family, and we stand with all those who are committed to guaranteeing every American the full measure of justice that George and so many others have been denied."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-cannot-rest-barack-obama-says-verdict-in-derek-chauvin-trial-is-necessary-but-not-sufficient-101618970900715.html
21-04-2021||World||All countries should phase out coal by 2040, says United Nations chief||The United Nations is pushing for a global coalition committed to net zero emissions by 2050 which will cover all countries, cities, regions and businesses, Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary General said on Monday. He also called on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to phase out coal by 2030, and 2040 elsewhere.Ahead of the April 22-23 Virtual Leaders’ Summit on Climate convened by the United States of America where 40 world leaders are likely to speak, including PM Narendra Modi, Guterres said he expects the most important countries, in relation to climate change, will be able to commit to net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by the middle of the century and to commit to a drastic reduction of emissions for the next decade by reviewing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).During a press interaction on Monday evening to launch the World Meteorological Organisation’s State of Global Climate 2020 report, Guterres said it’s a risk to have developing countries like India and China still investing in coal power plants that will be soon stranded assets.When asked how a target of net zero emissions by 2050 for all countries reconciles with the principle of CBDR (common but differentiated responsibilities), Guterres said it’s possible through a large effort of solidarity of developed countries with developing countries in finance and technology. CBDR, is a principle under the Paris Agreement requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them.Also read | In a swipe at West, Xi warns against ‘bossing, meddling’Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said last week that India will not raise its climate ambition at the behest of or under pressure from developed countries. India is already acting responsibly by implementing its ambitious NDC while under CBDR developed countries have a greater responsibility to cut emissions, he said.“In climate debate historic responsibility is a very important aspect. We cannot just forget, and we will not allow anybody to forget it. The historical emissions responsibility today is China 28%, USA 40%; Europe 10% and India is only 3%. We are not responsible for the climate change that is happening, but India is a responsible nation. It will do the right thing to deal with climate change. Principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR, a principle under the Paris Agreement requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them.) is important. Yes, as we are facing a grave common threat, we all will have to act but those who have polluted will have to act more,” Javadekar said.“We need to have an agreement based on three different dimensions: First, very ambitious targets on mitigation, namely, to get to net zero in the middle of the century. Second, a very strong support for adaptation, namely, in the developing countries. And third, a large effort of solidarity of developed countries with developing countries in finance and technology to allow developing countries to take profit of what is today the reality of technology in the economy,” Guterres said, adding that “Today, it is cheaper to produce electricity with renewables than in fossil fuels, and it’s a risk to have developing countries still investing in coal power plants that will be soon stranded assets. We have more and more situations in the world -- I believe it’s already the case in countries like India and China -- in which it is cheaper to create a new solar power plant than just to keep running several of the coal power plants that exist.”“So, the economy is on our side; the technology is on our side, but we need the solidarity of developed countries with the developing world to allow, through the principle of CBDR and taking profit of the national capabilities, to allow exactly for this compromise to be possible. I believe it is possible. It requires commitment,” Guterres said.According to a statement by the White House, a key goal of both the Leaders’ Summit and COP26 at Glasgow this November will be to catalyse efforts that keep that 1.5-degree goal within reach. The Summit will also highlight examples of how enhanced climate ambition will create good paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts. By the time of the Summit, the United States will announce an ambitious 2030 emissions target as its new NDC under the Paris Agreement, the statement had said.The global average temperature was about 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels despite the cooling effect of La Nina in 2020, the WMO confirmed on Monday in its State of the Global Climate 2020 report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had warned that a 1.5°C warming will mark a menacing milestone in the warming of the planet. Last year was one of the three warmest years on record; the six years since 2015 have been the warmest on record and 2011-2020 was the warmest decade on record. The decrease in the annual growth rate of CO2 concentration due to the Covid-19 lockdown will be practically indistinguishable.Globally averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have already exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm), 148% of pre-industrial levels, and if the CO2 concentration follows the same pattern as in previous years, it could reach or exceed 414 ppm in 2021, according to the report.“International agreements on climate change aim to keep global warming within the safe range of 1.5°C to 2°C, but few people realise that the world’s average temperature is already more than a degree warmer than it was 200 years ago. Parts of the world like the Himalayas are warming even faster. This is a serious concern for India, because climate change could have a compounding effect on existing scarcities, stresses and extreme events. For example, in 2020, even as we were fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, we also had to face Cyclone Amphan, which intensified rapidly in a warmer ocean. It is crucial that all countries invest in adaptation to climate impacts, especially to protect those who are most vulnerable to extreme events. At the same time, we need to accelerate policies and technologies to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate programme, World Resources Institute responding to the WMO report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-countries-should-phase-out-coal-by-2040-says-united-nations-chief-101618971295303.html

His statement came amid rising China-US tensions over wide-ranging issues, including Beijing’s role in Xinjiang, Taiwan and Hong Kong.“Bossing others around or meddling in others’ internal affairs would not get one any support,” Xi said, addressing the annual Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) over video link. In state-to-state relations, the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutual trust must be put front and centre, Xi said.Xi criticised efforts by some countries - without naming any - to “build barriers” and “decouple”, which he said would harm others and benefit no one. “Big countries should behave in a manner befitting to their status and with a greater sense of responsibility,” Xi added.“The Covid-19 pandemic has made it all the more clear to people around the world that we must reject the Cold War and zero-sum mentality and oppose a new Cold War and ideological confrontation in whatever forms,” he said.Also read: ‘J&J jab, clots linked’Notwithstanding a patch of common ground on the fight against the climate crisis, US President Joe Biden has been working on uniting allies such as the UK, the EU and Japan on countering China.Last month, Biden held the first summit of the Quad, comprising the US, India, Australia and Japan.Marking the 20th anniversary of the BFA, referred to as Asia’s answer to the World Economic Forum in Davos, this year’s annual conference is themed “A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation”.The Chinese president also said that his country has no plans to enter an arms race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-swipe-at-west-xi-warns-against-bossing-meddling-101618971029755.html

21-04-2021||World||Russia positions more troops at Ukraine’s border||Russia will soon have more than 120,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday, calling for new Western economic sanctions on Moscow.Kyiv, Washington and Nato have been alarmed by the large build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Western officials say the concentration of forces is now larger than during that annexation.“Russian troops continue to arrive in close proximity to our borders in the northeast, in the east and in the south. In about a week, they are expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops,” Kuleba told an online news conference.“This does not mean they will stop building up their forces at that number,” Kuleba said, warning of what he said was Moscow’s unpredictability although he said Ukraine did not want conflict with Russia.The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Monday that Russia had concentrated more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s border and in Crimea.Kuleba also called for Moscow to re-commit to a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has supported separatist forces in a conflict that began in 2014.Russia has said the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from Nato. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.Kuleba attended a video conference with EU foreign ministers and said he openly “called on colleagues to start considering a new round of sectoral sanctions against Russia”.He said he did not feel EU ministers were ready for such a move but he told them that individual sanctions on Russian officials were insufficient.Britain foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Tuesday the country has significant concerns over the buildup of Russian forces and wants to de-escalate the situation,German Chancellor Angela Merkel too expressed concern. The situation is “extremely tense and very worrying as a result of the concentration of forces on the Russian side of the Ukrainian border,” Merkel said at an event on Tuesday. The US Pentagon said on Monday that the buildup exceeds the one that preceded Russia’s 2014 military intervention.Tensions between Kyiv and Moscow have spiraled in recent weeks after Russia began military drills and ceasefire violations jumped in the conflict that began when Vladimir Putin seized Crimea from Ukraine seven years ago. Russia wants more autonomy for the breakaway Donbas region, where Russian-speakers dominate. That could derail Ukrainian plans to join the EU and Nato-- goals that are backed by the majority of its 42 million population.The Kremlin accuses its neighbour of planning an offensive to regain control of Donbas -- a claim Ukraine denies. The fear is a resumption of large-scale fighting that mostly ended after a 2015 peace accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-positions-more-troops-at-ukraine-s-border-101618970021530.html
21-04-2021||World||Joe Biden calls ex-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin verdict 'giant step' toward justice in US||President Joe Biden on Tuesday called the guilty verdict in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged with the murder of George Floyd "a giant step" toward justice in the United States.Derek Chauvin, a white officer, was convicted after kneeling for more than nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, during an arrest last May. Video of the incident set off worldwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.The 12-member jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty of all three charges - second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter - after considering three weeks of testimony from 45 witnesses."It was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see," Biden said in nationally televised remarks. "Systemic racism is a stain on the nation's soul."The Democratic president said the protests seen in the United States after Floyd's killing were something the nation had not witnessed since the civil rights movement and had unified people of different races."Nothing can ever bring their brother and father back," he said of the Floyd family, "but this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America."Biden also praised the "brave young woman" who recorded Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, and cited the police officers who testified for the prosecution in the case "instead of closing ranks.""For so many," Biden said, "it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver basic accountability."Vice President Kamala Harris also delivered remarks, urging the U.S. Senate to pass the "George Floyd Justice in Policing Act," which was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives and aims to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics that have targeted African Americans and other minorities."A measure of justice isn't the same as equal justice. This verdict brings us a step closer," said Harris, the first Black person, first Asian American and first woman to be vice president.Earlier in the day, Biden said he was praying for the "right verdict," a comment that sparked criticism. He said he would not have made such a comment if the jury was not sequestered.Biden and Harris watched the verdict with staff in the president's dining room. Afterward, Biden spoke with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and then Biden, Harris and first lady Jill Biden spoke with Floyd's younger brother Philonise Floyd from the Oval Office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-ex-minneapolis-cop-derek-chauvin-verdict-giant-step-toward-justice-in-us-101618966946467.html
21-04-2021||World||Ex-cop Derek Chauvin guilty of murder and manslaughter in George Floyd case||Former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted Tuesday of murder and manslaughter for pinning George Floyd to the pavement with his knee on the Black man’s neck in a case that touched off worldwide protests, violence and a furious reexamination of racism and policing in the U.S.Chauvin, 45, could be sent to prison for decades.People elated by the verdict flooded the surrounding streets downtown upon hearing the news. Cars blared their horns, and people ran through traffic, waving banners.Floyd family members gathered at a Minneapolis conference room could be heard cheering from the next room as each verdict was read.The jury of six white people and six Black or multiracial ones came back with its verdict after about 10 hours of deliberations over two days. Chauvin was found guilty on all charges: second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.His face was obscured by a Covid-19 mask, and little reaction could be seen beyond his eyes darting around the courtroom.His bail was immediately revoked and he was led away with his hands cuffed behind his back. Sentencing will be in two months.As the judge asked jurors if they reached a verdict, a hush fell on the crowd 300 strong in a park adjacent to the courthouse, with people listening to the proceedings on their cellphones. When the final guilty verdict was announced, the crowd roared, many people hugging, some shedding tears.At the intersection where Floyd was pinned down, a crowd chanted, “One down, three to go!” — a reference to the three other fired Minneapolis police officers facing trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder in Floyd's death.Janay Henry, who lives nearby, said she felt grateful and relieved.“I feel grounded. I can feel my feet on the concrete," she said, adding that she was looking forward to the “next case with joy and optimism and strength.”An ecstatic Whitney Lewis leaned halfway out a car window in a growing traffic jam of revelers waving a Black Lives Matter flag. “Justice was served,” the 32-year-old from Minneapolis said. “It means George Floyd can now rest.”The verdict was read in a courthouse ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire and patrolled by National Guard troops, in a city on edge against another round of unrest — not just because of the Chauvin case but because of the deadly police shooting of a young Black man, Daunte Wright, in a Minneapolis suburb April 11.The jurors identities were kept secret and will not be released until the judge decides it is safe to do so.Floyd, 46, died May 25 after being arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill for a pack of cigarettes at a corner market. He panicked, pleaded that he was claustrophobic and struggled with police when they tried to put him in a squad car. They put him on the ground instead.The centerpiece of the case was the excruciating bystander video of Floyd gasping repeatedly, “I can’t breathe” and onlookers yelling at Chauvin to stop as the officer pressed his knee on or close to Floyd’s neck for what authorities say was 9 1/2 minutes. Floyd slowly went silent and limp.Prosecutors played the footage at the earliest opportunity, during opening statements, with Jerry Blackwell telling the jury: “Believe your eyes.” And it was shown over and over, analyzed one frame at a time by witnesses on both sides.In the wake of Floyd’s death, demonstrations and scattered violence broke out in Minneapolis, around the country and beyond. The furor also led to the removal of Confederate statues and other offensive symbols such as Aunt Jemima.In the months that followed, numerous states and cities restricted the use of force by police, revamped disciplinary systems or subjected police departments to closer oversight.The “Blue Wall of Silence” that often protects police accused of wrongdoing crumbled after Floyd’s death: The Minneapolis police chief quickly called it “murder” and fired all four officers, and the city reached a staggering $27 million settlement with Floyd’s family as jury selection was underway.Police-procedure experts and law enforcement veterans inside and outside the Minneapolis department, including the chief, testified for the prosecution that Chauvin used excessive force and went against his training.Medical experts for the prosecution said Floyd died of asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, because his breathing was constricted by the way he was held down on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind him, a knee on his neck and his face jammed against the ground.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson called a police use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist to help make the case that Chauvin acted reasonably against a struggling suspect and that Floyd died because of an underlying heart condition and his illegal drug use.Floyd had high blood pressure, an enlarged heart and narrowed arteries, and fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in his system.Under the law, police have certain leeway to use force and are judged according to whether their actions were “reasonable” under the circumstances.The defense also tried to make the case that Chauvin and the other officers were hindered in their duties by what they perceived as a growing, hostile crowd.Chauvin did not testify, and all that the jury or the public ever heard by way of an explanation from him came from a police body-camera video after an ambulance had taken the 6-foot-4, 223-pound Floyd away. Chauvin told a bystander: “We gotta control this guy ’cause he’s a sizable guy ... and it looks like he’s probably on something.”The prosecution’s case also included tearful testimony from onlookers who said the police kept them back when they protested what was happening. Eighteen-year-old Darnella Frazier, who shot the crucial video, said Chauvin just gave the bystanders a “cold” and “heartless” stare.She and others said they felt a sense of helplessness and lingering guilt from witnessing Floyd’s slow-motion death.“It’s been nights I stayed up, apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more, and not physically interacting and not saving his life,” Frazier testified, while the 19-year-old cashier at the neighborhood market, Christopher Martin, lamented that “this could have been avoided” if only he had rejected the suspect $20 bill.To make Floyd more than a crime statistic in the eyes of the jury, the prosecution called to the stand his girlfriend, who told the story of how they met and how they struggled with addiction to opioids, and his younger brother Philonise.

The accord includes the option of a snapback of U.N. sanctions if Iran breaches the deal, requiring Tehran to suspend all nuclear enrichment-related activities, including research development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-sees-vienna-talks-moving-forward-warns-against-excessive-demands-101618940148109.html
21-04-2021||World||Nepal’s former royals test Covid-19 positive after participating in Kumbh Mela||Nepal’s former royals, King Gyanendra Shah and Queen Komal Shah, have tested positive for Covid-19 days after their return home from India following their participation in the Haridwar Mahakumbh Mela in Uttarakhand.Samples provided by the couple for RT-PCR tests were confirmed positive, The Himalayan Times reported, citing Nepal’s health ministry. Authorities have begun tracing others who have been in contact with the couple.The former king, 73, and the former queen, 70, had taken a holy bath at Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar during Mahakumbh. Hundreds of people had gathered at the airport in Kathmandu to welcome the couple on their return.Gyanendra, who stepped down in 2008 after a popular revolt against him, travelled to Haridwar on April 11 and interacted with Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Kailashananda Giri Maharaj of the Niranjani Akhara and many other sadhus. Nepal’s former royal family is held in high esteem by religious leaders in many parts of north India. Gyanendra was also felicitated at a public event.The former king was criticised for not adhering to Covid-19 protocols such as social distancing and wearing a mask during the event. He also led the procession of the Niranjani Akhara on April 12.Thousands of people who attended the Kumbh Mela have tested positive for coronavirus disease. Gyanendra was crowned the king of Nepal in 2001 after his elder brother Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev and his family were killed in a massacre at the royal palace. However, he became unpopular when he seized direct control of the country in 2005 on the grounds that political parties failed to tackle the Maoist insurgency.After the centuries-old monarchy was abolished, Gyanendra has largely maintained a low-profile.As Covid-19 infections spiked across the country, the Indian government last week appealed to religious leaders to observe the remainder of the Kumbh Mela only in a symbolic fashion.On Monday, India recorded nearly 274,000 new coronavirus infections and the total number of confirmed cases was more than 15 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-former-royals-test-covid-19-positive-after-participating-in-kumbh-mela-101618943679054.html
