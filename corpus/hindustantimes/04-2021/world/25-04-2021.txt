Biden has said the US won't begin doing so until it has enough supplies at home.Fauci said Sunday that the US would review how to help increase India's vaccine supply, such as by sending them doses or helping them “to essentially make vaccines themselves.”He said, quote: “Bottom line, it's a terrible situation that's going on in India and other lower middle-income countries, and there is more we can do.” (AP) RUP||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-actively-looking-at-ways-to-boost-aid-to-india-anthony-fauci-101619371774093.html
25-04-2021||World||Joe Biden polls positive for first 100 days in office||A majority of Americans approve of President Joe Biden's performance during his first 100 days in office, three new polls found Sunday.Overall, the polls showed a range of 52-58 percent of US adults who say they approve of the job Biden is doing, compared with 39-42 percent who say they disapprove.But the positive ratings are divided along party lines: about 90 percent of Democrats say they approve of Biden's performance, while only nine to 13 percent of Republicans do.Biden's performance is far higher than predecessor Donald Trump achieved in his entire presidency.Trump spent most of his presidency with ratings in the low 40s, and left office on January 20 with a Gallup poll approval of just 34 percent, a record low.A poll by CBS gives Biden the highest ranking, with 58 percent approval and 42 percent disapproval.NBC found that 53 percent of adults approve, while 39 percent disapprove.And a poll by ABC and The Washington Post showed a 52 percent overall approval rating and a 42 percent disapproval rating.Biden's strongest performance across the board was for his handling of the coronavirus pandemic, with 64-69 percent approval.However, the polls found that vaccine hesitancy has increased, with CBS showing that 19 percent of Republicans say they might get the vaccine, and 30 percent saying they won't get it at all.Additionally, Biden received the weakest marks for how he has dealt with the migration situation at the US-Mexico border.The ABC poll found that only 37 percent of adults approved of his approach to the border, while NBC found that only 33 percent of adults approved.While Biden's overall performance so far is generally higher than Trump's, it is lower than that of Barack Obama, under whom Biden served as vice president.Obama had an average of 60 percent approval in his first half year and his predecessor George W. Bush had 53.9 percent.Trump, by contrast, had an average approval rating of 41.4 percent in his first six months.According to data from the fivethirtyeight.com site, Trump was the first president in half a century not to enjoy a honeymoon period with substantially better polling in the first six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-polls-positive-for-first-100-days-in-office-101619370976019.html

That hesistancy has been seen as a roadblock to the US achieving herd immunity against Covid 19.Collins said some parts of the country are getting close to the 75% or 80% level of those with immunity, when vaccinations are combined with people who have had Covid-19, which also provides immunity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stop-covid-19-vaccine-finger-wagging-says-top-us-health-official-101619369369278.html
25-04-2021||World||Covid-19 crisis: US to rapidly provide support to India; EU, Germany mobilising aid||The US will rapidly provide support to help India’s Covid-19 response amid mounting calls from lawmakers and businesses for the Biden administration to do more and criticism from some quarters for what is being seen as Washington’s lethargic reaction. The European Union (EU) and Germany said on Sunday they were mobilising aid to support India following a huge surge in Coronavirus infections that has stretched medical facilities across the country and resulted in shortages of oxygen. Canada, Pakistan and Iran too said they were ready to supply equipment and medical supplies to help India tackle the crisis caused by a second wave of infections. India recorded more than 300,000 Covid-19 cases for the fourth straight day on Sunday. Official data showed 349,691 infections were detected across the country since Saturday, while the death toll crossed 192,000. The first expressions of support by senior members of the Biden administration came in the form of tweets by secretary of state Antony Blinken and National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan late on Saturday night. “Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific COVID-19 outbreak. We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India’s health care heroes,” Blinken tweeted. Shortly after, Sullivan tweeted: “The US is deeply concerned by the severe COVID outbreak in India. We are working around the clock to deploy more supplies and support to our friends and partners in India as they bravely battle this pandemic. More very soon.” Blinken and Sullivan didn’t give specifics of the support. The Biden administration has faced mounting calls to do more on several fronts related to the crisis in India, and criticism for not acting more speedily in the case of a strategic partner. Lawmakers from the House of Representatives and Senate – all Democrats – called on the administration to back a proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization to grant a temporary waiver from intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines to make them easily accessible. There is also the issue of raw materials for making Covid-19 vaccines, raised mostly by Indian companies with growing popular support. US suppliers of these items are required to prioritise orders from American buyers after President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act. The Serum Institute of India has called for the US to “lift the embargo” on raw materials and the matter has been discussed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar with Blinken, while foreign secretary Harsh Shringla raised it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman. The US side has promised to “give the matter due consideration”. US experts, however, believe the Biden administration should do more. “Tweetments are good, action is better. Time is crucial here,” said Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to the tweets by Blinken and Sullivan. Christopher Clary, assistant professor of political science at the University at Albany, described the US response to India’s coronavirus outbreak as “lethargic and inadequate”. “It has been insufficient given the scale of the suffering and inconsistent with our aspirations for the US-India relationship. I hope and expect Washington to do more in the coming days because it is our moral obligation to help a friend in need and it is in our strategic interests not to be seen as unreliable during India’s time of crisis,” Clary said. “As a former US government official, I am embarrassed and puzzled by the slow response,” he added. The US Chamber of Commerce called on the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots will more than meet its needs. The US has also not authorised the AstraZeneca shot. Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley tech billionaire and investor, and Raja Krishnamurthi, an Indian American Democratic lawmaker, echoed that call. Khosla offered to fund oxygen supplies for India. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply,” he tweeted. Janez Lenarčič, the EU commissioner for crisis management, said on Sunday the bloc’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) was coordinating with member states to rapidly provide urgently needed oxygen and medicines to India. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who caused a stir in New Delhi last week with her criticism of the slowdown of vaccine exports from India, expressed solidarity in the “common fight” against Covid-19 and said Germany was preparing a “mission of support”. Lenarčič, responsible for EU’s humanitarian aid and the European emergency response coordinator, said the support was being provided in response to a request from India. “Upon request for assistance by #India, we have activated the #EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The [EU] will do its utmost to mobilise assistance to support people of [India],” he tweeted. German ambassador Walter Lindner posted a message from Merkel on Twitter outlining the plans to support India. “To the people of India I want to express my sympathy on the terrible suffering that Covid-19 has again brought over your communities. The fight against the pandemic is our common fight. Germany stands in solidarity with India and is urgently preparing a mission of support,” Merkel said in her message. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that details of aid to be provided by EU and Germany were in the final stages of being worked out and a clearer picture would be available by Monday. The EU, through its Civil Protection Mechanism, helps coordinate the response to emergencies in Europe and beyond. Canada’s public services minister Anita Anand told a news conference on Saturday that Ottawa has communicated its willingness to assist New Delhi. “We will stand ready with PPE (personal protective equipment) and ventilators and any items that might be useful for the government of India,” she said. Anand was quoted by the outlet Global News as saying that the Canadian government was in touch with India and through its envoy in New Delhi, Nadir Patel, “about a number of options that may be on the table for us to assist”. In a statement issued late on Saturday, Pakistan’s foreign ministry offered to provide relief support to India, including ventilators, bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi PAP), digital X-ray machines, PPEs and related items, as a gesture of solidarity. “The concerned authorities of Pakistan and India can work out modalities for quick delivery of the relief items. They can also explore possible ways of further cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic,” the statement said. Iran’s health minister Saeed Namaki offered help in a letter sent to his Indian counterpart Harsh Vardhan. “The government and people of Iran are ready to spare no technical assistance, expertise and equipment in these difficult days and at the height of the plight of the dear citizens of India with the Covid-19 epidemic,” he said. “We hope that the exchange of experiences with scientific, research and production centres of the two countries can create a brighter future for the two countries with a long history of scientific, cultural and production exchanges,” he added. Since Saturday, Indian military aircraft and ships have been used to transport special oxygen tanks, cylinders and liquid oxygen from countries such as Singapore and Saudi Arabia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-crisis-us-to-rapidly-provide-support-to-india-eu-germany-mobilising-aid-101619367067204.html

25-04-2021||World||India’s Covid fight: US ready to deploy support, supplies||The United States will rapidly deploy “support” to help India deal with the second wave of Covid-19 cases amidst mounting calls for the Biden administration to do more from lawmakers, businesses and an offer from an Indian American tech billionaire to fund “planeloads of oxygen”.“Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific Covid-19 outbreak,” said secretary of state Antony Blinken in a tweet on Saturday night. “We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India’s health care heroes.”Shortly after, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan echoed similar assurances in a separate tweet. “The US is deeply concerned by the severe Covid outbreak in India,” he said in a tweet late on Saturday, adding, “We are working around the clock to deploy more supplies and support to our friends and partners in India as they bravely battle this pandemic. More very soon.”Neither Blinken nor Sullivan gave specifics of what these “supplies and support” would be. Some details are expected later today.The Biden administration has faced mounting calls in recent days to do more on several fronts related to Covid-19 and India. Lawmakers from the House of Representatives and the Senate - all Democrats - called upon it to back a proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization to grant temporary waiver from intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies to make them easily accessible to all countries.The second was the issue of raw materials needed for manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines, raised mostly by Indian pharmaceutical companies with growing popular support. US suppliers of these materials - 35 categories - are required to prioritise orders from American buyers over those coming from other countries. The Serum Institute of India called for the US to “lift the embargo” saying supplies of these raw materials are being held up. India and US officials have been in talks at a very high level - external affairs minister S Jaishankar raised it with his US counterpart Antony Blinken recently and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla discussed it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman. The American side promised to “give the matter due consideration”, according to people familiar with these discussions.And the third was a call from the US Chamber of Commerce, one of the most powerful lobbying groups, for the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because, one, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will more than meet its current and future needs. Two, the US has not even authorised the AstraZeneca vaccine yet.Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley tech billionaire and investor, and Raja Krishnamurthi, an Indian American lawmaker who was born in New Delhi, echoed that call on Saturday. “I respectfully but strongly call on the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to countries hardest-hit by the spread of Covid-19, including India, Argentina, and potentially others,” said Krishnamurthi, a Democrat.But Khosla’s primary offer was to fund oxygen supplies, addressing a critical shortage reported from hospitals around India. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply. Public hospitals/NGO’s also pls reach out,” he wrote in a tweet, copying @PMOIndia and several news publications.Khosla, who made his wealth as a co-founder of Sun Microsystem, is worth $2.9 billion, according to Forbes, which also put him at 174 on its list of billionaires and at 40 on the Midas list of investors. He had co-founded Sun Microsystems, with fellow Stanford graduates. It was acquired by Oracle in 2010. And, he now heads Khosla Ventures, an investment firm.“The AZ vaccine is unlikely to be ever approved in the US given current alternatives here,” Khosla wrote on Twitter about the AstraZeneca vaccine, adding, President Joe Biden, addressing him by his official twitter handle @Potus, “should absolutely release all doses and future commitments for US supply” as the Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines will be enough for the US.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-covid-fight-us-ready-to-deploy-support-supplies-101619358306732.html

25-04-2021||World||Canada extends helping hand to India in tackling raging Covid-19 crisis||As the Covid-19 pandemic ravages India, Canada has reached out to New Delhi with an offer to help in any way possible to alleviate the crisis.During the course of a press briefing on Saturday, Canada’s Minister of Public Services and Procurement Anita Anand said Ottawa has communicated its willingness to assist India during these difficult times. She said, “We will stand ready with PPE (personal protective equipment) and ventilators and any items that might be useful for the Government of India.”Anand, who is of Indian origin, was also quoted by the outlet Global News as saying that the Canadian government was in touch with India and through its high commissioner in New Delhi Nadir Patel is discussing “about a number of options that may be on the table for us to assist”. “We will continue to be engaged to assist wherever possible.”Global Affairs Canada, the country’s foreign ministry, also underscored this point, tweeting, “We remain united with our friend and partner and stand ready to assist.” Its Twitter handle Foreign Policy CAN added, “Our thoughts are with the people of #India in the face of the #Covid19 pandemic.”Other senior Canadian leaders have voiced their support for India in this crisis. The country’s ambassador to the United Nations Bob Rae tweeted, “India’s tragedy is our tragedy.” He said this was true not just morally but also empirically. “The virus in all its variants, is not national, or ethnic, or racial, it is global. It will continue to mutate, and destroy lives, until it is defeated everywhere. It will require a global effort,” he said.Former Canadian cabinet minister Amarjeet Sohi welcomed the offer of cooperation from Anand, as he tweeted, “It’s nice to see Canada stepping up to help Indian people in this time of need.” Sohi, who also has roots in India, added that “a lot of us are worried about our loved ones”.In February this year, as the crisis became pronounced in Canada, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau had reached out to his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi with a request for vaccines. As a result, a deal to provide two million doses of Covishield, the version of the AstraZeneca vaccine manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, was arrived at and the first consignment of 500,000 doses was sent to Canada in early March.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-extends-helping-hand-to-india-in-tackling-raging-covid-19-crisis-101619349186345.html
25-04-2021||World||Armenian PM triggers early election a day after Biden's genocide announcement||Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, who was swept to power in pro-democracy protests in 2018, triggered an early election on Sunday to try overcome criticism over his handling of last year's conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh.His resignation, which was expected, came a day after U.S. President Joe Biden said that massacres of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire in 1915 constituted genocide, a move welcomed by Armenians worldwide and condemned by Turkey.Pashinyan told Biden the symbolic decision was a matter of security to Armenia after the six week conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh, in which Turkey backed Armenia's neighbour Azerbaijan, where the ethnic Armenian-populated enclave is located.Pashinyan had been under pressure to resign since he agreed to a ceasefire after ethnic Armenians lost territory in the fighting with Azeri forces in and around Nagorno-Karabakh.He had already named a June 20 date for an early election.Announcing his resignation, he said on his Facebook page on Sunday that he was returning power received from citizens to them so they could decide the future of the government through free and fair elections.He said he had been compelled to agree to the peace deal, which was brokered by Russia, to prevent greater human and territorial losses. The Armenian army called for his resignation and he then tried to sack the chief of staff, a decision blocked by the former Soviet republic's president.Pashinyan updated Russian President Vladimir Putin about the elections and the situation over the Nagorno-Karabakh region, where around 2,000 Russian peacekeepers have been deployed, in a phone call on Saturday, the Kremlin said.The Armenian Prime Minister has complained before that some issues over the region, including the return of prisoners of war, have not been resolved yet.According to the Sputnik media outlet, Pashinyan's My Step ruling alliance led an opinion poll conducted by Gallup International Аssociation at the end of last month.Its main rival is likely to be a grouping led by Robert Kocharyan, Armenia's president from 1998-2008.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenian-pm-triggers-early-election-a-day-after-biden-s-genocide-announcement-101619347888319.html
25-04-2021||World||Germany plans to ease Covid-19 restrictions for vaccinated people||Germany plans to ease some of the current coronavirus restrictions for people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19, according to a draft text drawn up by the government and seen by AFP at the weekend.The proposal is to be discussed at a meeting on Monday by Chancellor Angela Merkel's government and the powerful regional state premiers.According to the draft text, it was a question not of awarding people with proven immunity any special privileges, but of "lifting curbs on their basic rights that are no longer justified".The debate comes as Germany is struggling to tame a third wave of coronavirus infections, and just 22 percent of Germans have had their first of two Covid-19 jabs.Under the proposed relaxations, people who are fully vaccinated would no longer have to show a recent negative coronavirus test to enter certain shops, get a haircut or attend certain events.They would also be exempt from quarantining after returning from abroad, unless they were coming from a country classed as a high-risk virus variant area such as India.Rules on social distancing and mask wearing would still apply to everyone.German leaders from across the political spectrum have come out in favour of giving vaccinated people more freedoms.The German Ethics Council, which helped shape the country's vaccine priority groups, said it was becoming harder to justify the restrictions in the face of growing evidence that those vaccinated no longer play a significant role in spreading the virus.Giving the same treatment to people who test negative, are vaccinated or even those who can show they have recovered from Covid and allow them "to access restaurants or shops is ethically unproblematic", council chair Alena Buyx told the Tagesspiegel daily on Sunday.'Emergency brake'New nationwide legislation went into force on Saturday that imposes tougher restrictions in regions with more than 100 new infections per 100,000 residents over a seven-day period for three consecutive days, which currently includes huge swathes of Germany.Merkel had pushed hard for the "emergency brake" rules to become legally binding after many regional leaders refused to take unpopular measures despite rapidly rising case numbers.The new law includes a controversial 10pm-5am curfew and stricter rules for social gatherings and store openings.If the incidence rate climbs above 165, schools must revert to online lessons.The legislation also explicitly allows for "exceptions to be granted to those considered immune", Justice Minister Christine Lambrecht told the Handelsblatt business daily on Saturday.Finance Minister Olaf Scholz, who is running to succeed Merkel in September's general elections, said Germany should go even further and draw up plans for a phased reopening of the country as the vaccination pace picks up speed."By the end of May we should be able to make reliable predictions. I want us, as a government, to commit to clear and brave steps towards reopening," he told the Bild am Sonntag newspaper.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-plans-to-ease-covid-19-restrictions-for-vaccinated-people-101619346929632.html

I took my brother out to the street, next to the checkpoint. Then I came (back) and went up from there. To the last floor, that did not burn. I found a girl suffocating, about 19 years old, she was suffocating, she was about to die," said Ahmed Zaki."I took her on my shoulders and I ran down. People were jumping... Doctors fell on the cars. Everyone was jumping. And I kept going up from there, got people and come down again,” Zaki said.Patients were moved to other hospitals, medical sources said. But several families were still at the hospital hours after the fire had been extinguished, after failing to find them elsewhere.Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi ordered an investigation."Such an incident is evidence of negligence and therefore I directed that an investigation be launched immediately and for the hospital's manager and the heads of security and maintenance to be detained along with all those concerned until we identify those negligent and hold them accountable," he said in a statement.Iraq's healthcare system, ruined by decades of sanctions, war and neglect, has been stretched during the coronavirus crisis. The country has recorded a total of 102,5288 infections, including 15,217 deaths, the health ministry said on Saturday.Security has improved in recent years but Iraq still suffers from political violence, including militia rocket attacks on foreign forces and a low-level Islamic State insurgency.Accidents due to neglect and wrecked infrastructure have compounded the woes of ordinary Iraqis.In 2019, at least 90 people died when an overloaded ferry carrying families on an outing sank in the Tigris river in the northern city of Mosul.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/everyone-was-jumping-doctors-fell-on-cars-baghdad-hospital-fire-kills-82-101619343920384.html

Other European funds and national resources will also contribute to the program.The package will have a “significant impact” on Italy’s economy, which has been deeply scarred by the Covid-19 pandemic and had been undeperforming for the decades before the crisis, the government said. Gross domestic product shrank by 8.9% in 2020.A large share of the resources will be used for infrastructure projects. They will also be used to reduce inequality, with about 40% of the funds destined for Italy’s underdeveloped southern regions. Overall, the allocation of funds is in line with EU requirements, according to the statement.The plan also envisages the modernization of Italy’s inefficient bureaucracy and courts, as well as enhancing competition and cutting red tape.Italy’s plan was signed off at a late night cabinet meeting chaired by Prime Minister Mario Draghi after hours of political wrangling. Draghi will present the plan in parliament on Monday ahead of a deadline to submit it to the EU Commission by April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-signs-off-on-investment-reform-package-to-deploy-eu-funds-101619331886924.html

The overall COVID-19 caseload has reached 7,95,627 while the death toll has risen to 17,117.Amid growing cases of COVID-19 across the country, the federal government on Saturday warned that it would only wait for a week and if the situation did not improve, then imposing a complete lockdown would be its key option to save the people's lives, Dawn reported."We make it possible to keep things going amid the pandemic because when it comes to strict measures, the daily wage earners and poor segments of society are hit hard. Secondly, traders who make money most in this month [Ramazan]. So we appeal to the traders and the people to please take care and follow the guidelines. Ultimately if the people's lives come under threat, we would have to go for drastic measures, including complete lockdown," said Federal Minister for Information and Broadcasting Chaudhry Fawad Hussain at a press conference at the Governor House.Smart lockdowns have been imposed in several areas of the country in an effort to curb the spread of the virus.

25-04-2021||World||Asean leaders tell Myanmar coup maker to end killings||Southeast Asian leaders demanded an immediate end to killings and the release of political detainees in Myanmar in an emergency summit Saturday with its top general and coup leader, Indonesia's president said.The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also told Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing during the two-hour talks in Jakarta that a dialogue between contending parties in Myanmar should immediately start, with the help of ASEAN envoys, President Joko Widodo said.“The situation in Myanmar is unacceptable and should not continue. Violence must be stopped, democracy, stability and peace in Myanmar must be returned immediately,” Widodo said during the meeting. “The interests of the people of Myanmar must always be the priority.”Daily shootings by police and soldiers since the Feb. 1 coup have killed more than 700 mostly peaceful protesters and bystanders, according to several independent tallies.The messages conveyed to Min Aung Hlaing were unusually blunt and could be seen as a breach of the conservative 10-nation bloc’s bedrock principle forbidding member states from interfering in each other’s domestic affairs. But Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin said that policy should not lead to inaction if a domestic situation “jeopardizes the peace, security, and stability of ASEAN and the wider region” and there is international clamor for resolute action.“There is a tremendous expectation on the part of the international community on how ASEAN is addressing the Myanmar issue. The pressure is increasing,” Muhyiddin said, The current ASEAN chair, Brunei Prime Minister Hassanal Bolkiah, and the regional bloc’s secretary general should be allowed access to Myanmar to meet contending parties, encourage dialogue and come up with “an honest and unbiased observation,” he said.Such a political dialogue “can only take place with the prompt and unconditional release of political detainees," the Malaysian premier said.A formal statement issued by ASEAN through Brunei after the summit outlined the demands made by the six heads of state and three foreign ministers in more subtle terms. It asked for the “immediate cessation of violence in Myanmar” and urged all parties to “exercise utmost restraint,” but omitted the demand voiced by Widodo and other leaders for the immediate release of political detainees. It said ASEAN would provide humanitarian aid to Myanmar.It was not immediately clear if and how Min Aung Hlaing responded to the blunt messages.It was the first time he traveled out of Myanmar since the coup, which was followed by the arrests of Aung San Suu Kyi and many other political leaders.Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi expressed hopes on the eve of the summit that “we can reach an agreement on the next steps that can help the people of Myanmar get out of this delicate situation.”ASEAN’s diversity, including the divergent ties of many of its members to either China or the United States, along with a bedrock policy of non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs and deciding by consensus, has hobbled the bloc’s ability to rapidly deal with crises.Amid Western pressure, however, the regional group has struggled to take a more forceful position on issues but has kept to its non-confrontational approach.Critics have said ASEAN’s decision to meet the coup leader was unacceptable and amounted to legitimizing the overthrow and the deadly crackdown that followed. ASEAN states agreed to meet Min Aung Hlaing but did not treat or address him as Myanmar’s head of state in the summit, a Southeast Asian diplomat told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity for lack of authority to discuss the issue publicly.The London-based rights watchdog Amnesty International urged Indonesia and other ASEAN states ahead of the summit to investigate Min Aung Hlaing over “credible allegations of responsibility for crimes against humanity in Myanmar.” As a state party to a U.N. convention against torture, Indonesia has a legal obligation to prosecute or extradite a suspected perpetrator on its territory, it said.Indonesian police dispersed dozens of protesters opposing the coup and the junta leader’s visit. More than 4,300 police fanned out across the Indonesian capital to secure the meetings, held under strict safeguards amid the pandemic.The leaders of Thailand and the Philippines skipped the summit to deal with coronavirus outbreaks back home. Laos also canceled at the last minute. The face-to-face summit is the first by ASEAN leaders in more than a year.Aside from Myanmar, the regional bloc is made up of Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-leaders-tell-myanmar-coup-maker-to-end-killings-101619315783386.html

But now we would wait for another week and if the situation doesn’t improve, definitely we would have to think about complete lockdown,” he said.Prime Minister Khan on Friday urged the people of Pakistan to strictly follow the Covid-19 guidelines, warning that another nationwide lockdown will be imposed if the spiralling coronavirus crisis continues to worsen.Khan, who was himself affected by the disease last month, warned that major cities would be closed down if the situation continued to deteriorate."If we (as a nation) don't take precautionary measures, we will have to impose a lockdown which will also affect our economy at a time when it is on the rise,” he said and urged the people to follow the SoPs as they did during Ramzan last year.Khan said he had asked the Pakistan Army to assist police and law enforcement agencies in enforcing SOPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-covid-19-caseload-nearing-796-000-5-611-new-cases-reported-101619337779837.html

Everest, whose revised height is 8848.86 meters.Nepal relies heavily on income generated from Everest expeditions."I have no information about the traffic jam on the Everest," Acharya said in response to a question.A foreign climber needs to pay USD 11,000 per person for getting permission to climb Mount Everest."The enthusiasm shown by the international climbers to Mt. Everest shows, their growing passion and love for Everest," says Mingma Sherpa, chairman of Seven Summit Treks of Kathmandu.This will certainly help in boosting Nepal's tourism despite the pandemic, he added.The first cases of Covid-19 have been identified at Everest base camp this week.Nepal insists that visiting climbers quarantine before proceeding to Everest base camp.Nepal has reported 297,087 Covid-19 cases so far with 3,136 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-issues-record-number-of-permits-for-everest-expeditions-despite-covid19-101619335966208.html

The Iran-backed Huthis rarely disclose their own losses.With the Huthis taking control of the Kassara front, the battles have moved to the Al-Mil area, which is a mere six kilometres (four miles) from the centre of Marib and its population centres, they said.However, mountains around Al-Mil remain a formidable barrier to the rebels who launched a fierce campaign for Marib city in February.The government sources said the Huthis had poured in hundreds of reinforcements in recent days to achieve the gains, resorting to motorbikes after the coalition targeted their military vehicles.The loss of Marib would be a disaster for the Yemeni government and for Saudi Arabia which has supported it militarily since March 2015, after the rebels captured Sanaa.The city's fall could also lead to a humanitarian disaster, as vast numbers of civilians displaced from fighting elsewhere have sought refuge in the area.Around 140 camps have sprung up in the surrounding desert to provide basic shelter for up to two million displaced, according to the Yemeni government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/yemen-rebels-advance-on-marib-65-dead-military-sources-101619334810442.html
25-04-2021||World||European Union blames China for endangering peace in South China Sea||The European Union called out China on Saturday for endangering peace in the South China Sea and urged all parties to abide by a 2016 tribunal ruling which rejected most of China's claim to sovereignty in the sea, but which Beijing has rejected.The EU last week released a new policy aimed at stepping up its influence in the Indo-Pacific region to counter China's rising power.The Philippines on Friday protested to China over its failure to withdraw what it called as "threatening" boats believed to be manned by maritime militia around the disputed Whitsun Reef, which Manila calls the Julian Felipe Reef."Tensions in the South China Sea, including the recent presence of large Chinese vessels at Whitsun Reef, endanger peace and stability in the region," a EU spokesperson said in a statement on Saturday.EU reiterated its strong opposition to "unilateral actions that could undermine regional stability and international rules-based order".It urged all parties to resolve disputes peacefully in accordance with international law, and highlighted a 2016 international arbitration that had ruled in favor of the Philippines while invalidating most of China's claims in the South China Sea.China rejected EU's accusation that its ships at Whitsun Reef, which China calls Niu'E Jiao, had endangered peace and security.The Chinese Mission to the EU in a statement on Saturday reiterated that the reef is part of China's Nansha Islands, or Spratly Islands, and that it was "reasonable and lawful" for Chinese fishing boats to operate there and shelter from the wind.The Chinese statement also insisted that China's sovereignty, rights and interests in the South China Sea were formed in the "long course of history and consistent with international law" and rejected the 2016 tribunal ruling as "null and void"."The South China Sea should not become a tool for certain countries to contain and suppress China, much less a wrestling ground for major-power rivalry," the Chinese statement said.China is increasingly worried that Europe and other countries are heeding US President Joe Biden's call for a "coordinated approach" towards China, which had so far materialised in the form of sanctions over its security crackdown in Hong Kong and treatment of Uyghur Muslims.US Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month said Washington "stands by its ally, the Philippines," in the face of China’s massing maritime militia at Whitsun Reef.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-blames-china-for-endangering-peace-in-south-china-sea-101619330953626.html
25-04-2021||World||US vows ‘more support’ to India; billionaire offers to fund ‘planeloads’ of O2||The US has decided to deploy “more supplies and support” to help India deal with the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 cases. It comes amid mounting calls for the Biden administration to do more - from lawmakers and businesses - with an Indian-American tech billionaire even offering to fund “planeloads of oxygen”.“The US is deeply concerned by the severe Covid outbreak in India,” tweeted US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan on Saturday. “We are working around the clock to deploy more supplies and support to our friends and partners in India as they bravely battle this pandemic. More very soon.”Sullivan gave no details of what these “supplies and support” were and they could not be independently ascertained.The Biden administration has faced mounting calls in recent days to do more on several fronts related to the pandemic’s resurgence in India. Representatives and Senators, all Democrats, have called upon the government to back a proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to grant temporary waiver from intellectual property rights protections to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies to make them easily accessible to all countries.Another issue is related to raw materials needed for manufacturing Covid-19 vaccines in India, raised mostly by Indian pharma companies, with growing popular support. US suppliers of these raw materials, which have 35 categories, are required to prioritise orders from American buyers over those coming from abroad. The Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) has called upon the US to “lift the embargo”, saying supplies of these raw materials are being held up. Indian and US officials have been in talks on this matter at a high level. India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar raised it with US secretary of state Antony Blinken recently and foreign secretary Harsh Shringla has discussed it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman. The American side promised to “give the matter due consideration”, according to people familiar with these discussions.There has also been a call from the US Chamber of Commerce, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America, for the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because firstly, the jabs from Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson will meet the country’s current and future needs; and secondly, the US is yet to authorise the use of the AZ vaccine.Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley tech billionaire and investor, and Raja Krishnamurthi, an Indian-American lawmaker born in New Delhi, echoed that call on Saturday. “I respectfully but strongly call on the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to countries hardest-hit by the spread of Cobid-19, including India, Argentina, and potentially others,” said Krishnamurthi, a Democrat.Khosla’s offer, meanwhile, was to fund oxygen supplies for Indian hospitals facing a critical shortage as they struggle to tackle a fast-escalating number of Covid-19 patients. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply. Public hospitals/NGO’s also pls reach out,” he tweeted, tagging the Indian PMO’s official handle and several news publications.Khosla, who now heads Khosla Ventures, an investment firm, is worth $2.9 billion, according to Forbes, which has put him at No. 174 on its list of billionaires. He is at No. 40 on the Midas list of investors. “The AZ vaccine is unlikely to be ever approved in the US given current alternatives here,” Khosla tweeted about the AstraZeneca vaccine, adding that US President Joe Biden “should absolutely release all doses and future commitments for US supply since Moderna and Pfizer [vaccines] can supply US needs”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vows-more-support-to-india-billionaire-offers-to-fund-planeloads-of-o2-101619330465655.html

So far, just over 20 per cent of the population has received the first dose of a coronavirus vaccine.Moreover, Merkel added that doctors and nurses have been calling for help due to high infection numbers and intensive care admissions."These people push their limits every day to save the lives of corona patients," Merkel said, adding that they "cannot do it alone".Germany's parliament, the Bundestag, passed the new "emergency brake" measures earlier this week which now take effect in areas where the incidence rate is higher than 100 new infections per 100,000 people.Those regions will be subject to tougher restrictions including a 10 pm curfew and restrictions on shops and households meeting, reported euronews.Germany recorded 23,000 new Covid-19 cases in 24 hours, according to the most recent figures from the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) and according to the April 22 situation report, more than 5,000 Covid-19 patients are hospitalised in intensive care.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-in-germany-angela-merkel-defends-tough-emergency-measures-amid-3rd-wave-101619329638535.html

The site will be open to anyone living and working in Tokyo, the paper said.Medically trained staff from Japan's Self-Defense Forces will also assist with vaccinations in such centers, the Nikkei said.The Japanese government has come under sharp criticism for its sluggish vaccination roll-out, which has been handled mostly by municipal authorities. Japan has vaccinated about 1% of its population, according to a Reuters tracker.Japan has avoided an explosive spread of the pandemic experienced by many countries. There have been about 550,000 cases and 9,761 deaths, significantly lower numbers than in other large economies.But the latest rise in infections has stoked alarm, with a surge in a mutant variant and a critical shortage of medical staff and hospital beds in some areas.Japan's third state of emergency in Tokyo, Osaka and two other prefectures began on Sunday, which will cover nearly a quarter of the population and attempt to combat a surge in coronavirus cases three months before the Tokyo Olympics is set to open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-to-open-large-covid-19-vaccination-centres-in-tokyo-osaka-report-101619328976066.html
25-04-2021||World||EU agency says clot 'very rare' J&J vaccine side effect||Europe's medicines regulator said Tuesday that blood clots should be listed as a "very rare" side effect of Johnson & Johnson's coronavirus vaccine, but that the benefits of the shot still outweighed the risks.The United States is expected to announce its decision on the single-shot J&J vaccine by Friday, as nations around the world urgently try to accelerate inoculation campaigns and revive their pandemic-ravaged economies.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) assessment came as an EU official promised to have enough doses available to vaccinate 70 percent of European adults by the summer -- a boon for the continent's sluggish rollout.Europe's Johnson & Johnson campaign was delayed after US health regulators said the shot should be paused over blood clot fears.After reviewing isolated cases of clotting among people who received the vaccine, EMA's safety committee said it found a "possible link" to the jab.The regulator said its safety committee "concluded that a warning about unusual blood clots with low blood platelets should be added to the product information" for the J&J shot."This is a very rare effect," EMA chief Emer Cooke told reporters. "But it also makes it very important for doctors and patients to be aware of the signs so that they can spot any concerns."Italy's health authorities said that in light of the EMA ruling, the vaccine should be considered "definitively safe" but the country would prioritise its use for people aged over 60.- 'We remain confident' - Only two countries had started administering the J&J shot before it was paused -- the United States and South Africa -- with more than seven million doses given out so far, according to an AFP tally.The vaccine was praised as easier to administer and transport than some of its rivals, because it requires just one dose and can be stored at warmer temperatures.The EU approved the J&J shot on March 3 and started taking deliveries on April 19, but has not yet started administering it to people.A top Johnson & Johnson executive said Tuesday he hoped for a speedy resolution to the current pause."We remain very confident and very hopeful that the benefit-risk profile will play out," Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told CNBC.The J&J concerns follow similar reports of blood clots in a very small number of people who received the AstraZeneca shot.The EMA also described those clots as a "very rare" side effect, stressing that the AstraZeneca jab's benefits outweigh the risks.Europe's leaders are keen to accelerate vaccinations and expand availability after facing intense criticism over a slow rollout and with the public desperate for a return to some degree of normality.Thierry Breton, the EU's internal markets commissioner, told French newspaper Le Figaro the bloc was now set to have enough doses to cover 70 percent of its adult population by mid-July.The Dutch government said Tuesday it would end its coronavirus curfew and allow cafes to serve outdoors during limited hours from April 28.Elsewhere there was less reason for hope.Moscow's mayor Sergei Sobyanin announced a drive to get elderly residents vaccinated to avoid a lockdown, acknowledging the deteriorating situation there.- 'Like a storm' -And India, home to 1.3 billion people, is battling a worrying surge, with record daily case numbers overwhelming already stretched hospitals.The capital New Delhi was locked down Monday for a week, and the government said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine from May as it tries to get a grip on the crisis.In a televised address Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi acknowledged that this second wave had hit India "like a storm"."It is a big challenge, but we have to -- together, with our courage and determination -- overcome it," he added.The Delhi lockdown follows strict measures already imposed in other Indian states.The US Centers for Disease Control on Monday advised against all travel to India, and the UK imposed restrictions on arrivals from the country.India's crematoriums and gravediggers have been overwhelmed.Social media and newspapers have been flooded with horrifying images of row upon row of burning pyres. At a cemetery in New Delhi, gravedigger Shamim told AFP: "At this rate, I will run out of space in three or four days."Hard-hit Brazil meanwhile now has the leading overall death rate in the Americas and the entire southern hemisphere, according to AFP data.With 176 deaths per 100,000 people since the beginning of the outbreak, Brazil has recently overtaken Peru with 174 per 100,000 and the US with 172 per 100,000.There was growing concern about a spike in Japan, where the third most populated region, Osaka, on Tuesday asked the central government to impose a state of emergency with infections rising just three months before the country hosts the Olympics.Tokyo and several other areas are expected to follow suit, hoping to avoid Osaka's plight, where hospital beds for seriously ill coronavirus patients have run out.burs-dl/jhJOHNSON & JOHNSONASTRAZENECA||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-agency-says-clot-very-rare-j-j-vaccine-side-effect-101619317465411.html

The Indian government has deployed military planes and trains to get oxygen to Delhi from other parts of the country and foreign countries, including Singapore.The number of cases across the country of around 1.3 billion rose overnight by 346,786, India's Health Ministry said on Saturday, for a total of 16.6 million cases, including 189,544 deaths.But experts say the number of cases is likely many times higher and could rise further.Officials from both countries are engaged at various levels to ensure "a small supply of inputs and components from U.S. companies for production of Covid-19 vaccines in India," a spokesman at the Indian Embassy in Washington told Reuters."We believe it is important to work together to identify both bottlenecks in medical supply chains and potential solutions for overcoming these (bottlenecks), and to combat the global pandemic together and expedite ongoing vaccination efforts," the spokesman said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deeply-concerned-by-india-s-covid-19-situation-us-state-of-secretary-blinken-101619322543381.html
25-04-2021||World||6 things to know about Joe Biden's first 100 days||President Joe Biden has hit some big targets in 100 days, starting with an epic effort to pull the United States from its Covid-19 nightmare, but headaches lie ahead.Here are three big achievements and three areas where much remains to be done.Done or getting it done1. Covid vaccinations: the raging pandemic was the gravest single threat facing Biden's administration when he took over on January 20. The solution was mass vaccinations.On this, Biden is delivering. Last week he celebrated the 200th million vaccine shot administered and Covid deaths have fallen dramatically.2. Economic stimulus: Biden pushed through a nearly $2 trillion rescue plan for an economy that has been hobbled and hollowed by the more than year-long coronavirus shutdown.Although Democrats control Congress, their margin is razor thin and he had to work hard to get the American Rescue Plan passed. Polls show it is popular both among Democratic and Republican voters.3. Foreign policy rethink: Biden's priority was to undo what he saw as the reckless damage caused by Donald Trump to traditional US alliances.Inviting Japan's Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga as the first foreign leader to the White House showed that Washington is serious about its ties to Asia.The White House says Biden's own first foreign trip will be to Europe, where he will attend G7, NATO and EU summits in June. The transatlantic alliance, which Trump questioned, is back.As well as returning the United States to the Paris climate accord and seeking to revive the Iranian nuclear negotiations, Biden has also set a clear date for pulling the final US soldier out of Afghanistan: September 11.Still to do1. Working with Congress: Biden promised bipartisanship but so far he has worked on the back of a razor thin Democratic majority.That raises growing doubts over his upcoming big projects -- an infrastructure bill, greening of the economy, police brutality reforms and immigration.Midterm congressional elections next year could erase the Democrats' advantage in Congress.2. Immigration: nowhere has the smooth running Biden administration stumbled more than on handling illegal immigration at the southern border.Biden promised a more humane approach after Trump's hardline crackdown, which relied largely on physical barriers.But the new administration was unprepared for a surge in people, many from Central America. Facilities overwhelmed with unaccompanied migrant children provided Republican critics with political ammunition while angering Biden's own supporters.The administration's confusing back-and-forth on promises to greatly increase the cap on refugees allowed into the United States has fueled the sense of disarray.3. Foreign policy trouble: Although Biden moved quickly to repair ties with allies, his plans for dealing with adversaries remain very much a work in progress.He has also yet to be tested by a genuine crisis. China, Iran, North Korea and Russia could provide one at any time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/6-things-to-know-about-joe-biden-s-first-100-days-101619316849418.html
25-04-2021||World||US Congressman Krishnamoorthi calls on Biden to release AZ vaccine to India||Indian-American Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi on Saturday (local time) called on US President Joe Biden's administration to release doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to countries currently experiencing massive and deadly surges in the spread of Covid-19, including India."We are currently sitting on close to 40 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the US stockpile, a stockpile which we're not using and which we've already opened to combat Covid19 in Mexico and Canada," Krishnamoorthi said in a statement."In order to curb the spread of this virus internationally and to protect public health and our international economy, we need to get these vaccines out the door now. I respectfully but strongly call on the Biden Administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses to countries hardest-hit by the spread of Covid-19, including India, Argentina, and potentially others," he added.India on Saturday recorded 3,46,786 new Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike since the pandemic broke out last year. According to the official data issued by the government, the country recorded 2,624 new deaths due to Covid-19 in the last 24 hours.So far, 1,66,10,481 Covid-19 cases have been reported in India while 1,89,544 people have succumbed to the viral infection.Currently, there are 25,52,940 active cases of Covid-19 in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-krishnamoorthi-calls-on-biden-to-release-az-vaccine-to-india-101619311470224.html

I never understood why the U.S. waited this long when they knew the truth about what happened. It's amazing and I'm very happy he did what he did,” said Varoujan Kioudjian, 74.He was among hundreds of people who streamed to a hilltop monument in Montebello, about 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of downtown Los Angeles, to mark Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day.Dressed in black for the solemn ceremony, they laid flowers around a tomb and said prayers for the estimated 1.5 million Armenians who were killed in the events beginning in 1915 known as Metz Yeghern.Kioudjian said for as long as he can remember his late father, whose parents were killed in the genocide and grew up in an orphanage, took him to memorials and demonstrations every April 24. That was the day in 1915 when Ottoman authorities began arresting Armenian intellectuals and community leaders in Constantinople, now known as Istanbul.“The day April 24 comes around, tears flowed from his eyes, from his heart. It was that sad,” he said.Outside the Turkish consulate in Beverly Hills, several thousand people blocked off Wilshire Boulevard, the main artery through the city, to demand that Turkey recognize as genocide the events that began 106 years ago. The demonstrators waved the national flag of Armenia and called for reparations.Taleen Nazarian, 22, said at the rally that activists like herself have built their identities around fighting for recognition.“We feel this passion to continue the fight for justice ... and do everything we can to pass it down to the next generation," she said.She said she was gratified by Biden's proclamation.“It's still surreal that the day we've been fighting for finally came,” she said.Can Oguz, consul general of Turkey in Los Angeles, said his country vehemently rejects Biden's statement.“None of the conditions defined by the international law have been met that would warrant the use of ‘genocide’ concerning the events of 1915,” Oguz said in a email. "Today’s statement will hurt our bilateral relations and undermine dialogue efforts for peace and stability in the region.”The White House had avoided using using the term genocide for decades for fear of alienating Turkey, a NATO ally and important power in the Middle East. Biden followed through on a campaign promise to make human rights a central guidepost of his foreign policy. He argued last year that failing to call the atrocities against the Armenian people a genocide would pave the way for future mass atrocities.“Today is an historic and emotional day for the Armenian people, including members of my own family who are descendants of genocide survivors,” state Sen. Andreas Borgeas, a Republican from Fresno, said in a statement. "After more than a century, the United States has mustered the courage to acknowledge the truth despite the potential political consequences with the Republic of Turkey.”Rep. Adam Schiff, a Democrat from Los Angeles, praised Biden for following through on his pledge.“This is a momentous day for thousands upon thousands of my Armenian American constituents who have been working, advocating, and praying for recognition for their entire lives – and I am heartened that this announcement comes at a time when there are still some genocide survivors alive to witness it, though their numbers are very small," he said in a statement.The survivors, many of them orphans who were brought to the United States, were recognized by California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who proclaimed Saturday a “day of remembrance of the Armenian genocide."“Forced to build new lives in all corners of the globe, Armenians bravely forged ahead in the face of unimaginable tragedy. Thousands made their homes in California, and we are greater for their contributions,” the proclamation states. “Today and every day, let us recommit ourselves to making certain that we never forget the Armenian Genocide, and that we always speak out against hatred and atrocities anywhere they occur.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armenian-americans-celebrate-us-president-biden-s-recognition-of-genocide-101619309685065.html

25-04-2021||World||In Mexico, Remembrance Bears help Covid-19 victims' families||The human and psychological toll of the coronavirus pandemic hit home for Mexico City clothing designer Irma de la Parra in January, with the death of a longtime friend from Covid-19.Mexican hospitals usually don’t let family members visit their dying relatives, because of tightly packed hospital wards, a shortage of personal protective equipment and fear of spreading the infection.After her experience, she learned of many families who had never been able to say one last word, or give one last hug, to friends and relatives. So she decided to make a way for them to give endless hugs.“We were overwhelmed with sadness because we knew him (her and her husband's friend) since we were very young, and he was a very good person,” De la Parra said of Martín Elizalde, 53, who died Jan. 10. “I said, how is it possible that none of us, not even his family, could see him again?”That's when the idea of Remembrance Bears was born. De la Parra had long worked making uniforms for daycare centers, so she had the necessary skills and equipment. She decided to make teddy bears out of the clothes of Covid-19 victims so the families could have something tactile to remember people who never got a last hug.The bears are “so that relatives could have something to remember these people who have gone.”Relatives send clothing items the victims often wore before they got ill, and De la Parra carefully cuts out the pattern for the teddy bear’s outer ‘skin’, and then stuffs them.She estimates she has now made about 300 Remembrance Bears.It’s hard, because each bear must be hand sewn and filled with stuffing, and takes about three days to complete. Some of the clothing sent in by relatives is so worn that De la Parra has to sew linings into the bears so they don’t burst. She said she doesn’t look to really make a profit on the bears, charging about $10 apiece.“When we deliver the bears, oh, people are so happy,” De la Parra said. “I feel it is a way to heal their pain a little, because they take them with so much affection.”It has changed De la Parra, who lost most of her income early in the pandemic because the daycare workers and other customers who used to buy clothes and uniforms from her stopped coming in.“My first experience with the pandemic was the economic impact, because we didn’t know many people yet who had gotten sick,” she said. “But as time went on we realized how many people around us were getting sick.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-mexico-remembrance-bears-help-covid-19-victims-families-101619307436019.html
25-04-2021||World||Fire tears through Baghdad hospital for Covid-19 patients, 23 deaths reported||At least 23 people died when a fire broke out Sunday in a coronavirus intensive care unit in the capital of Iraq, a country with long-dilapidated health infrastructure now facing mounting Covid-19 cases.The explosion was caused by "a fault in the storage of oxygen cylinders", medical sources told AFP.Iraq's hospitals have been worn down by decades of conflict and poor investment, with shortages in medicines and hospital beds.On Wednesday, the number of Covid-19 cases in the country surpassed one million, the highest of any Arab state.In the middle of the night, as dozens of relatives were at the bedsides of the 30 patients in the intensive care unit at Ibn al-Khatib hospital -- reserved for the most severe Covid-19 cases in Baghdad -- flames spread across multiple floors, another medical source said.Videos on social media showed firefighters trying to extinguish flames at the hospital on the southeastern outskirts of the Iraqi capital, as patients and their relatives tried to flee the building.Medical and security sources told AFP that 23 people had been killed and some fifty others injured in the blaze.The civil defence told Iraqi state news they "rescued 90 people out of 120 patients and their relatives" at the scene, but could not give an exact number of the dead and wounded.- Negligence -The fire -- which according to several sources was caused by negligence, often linked to endemic corruption in Iraq -- immediately sparked anger on social media in the country.Baghdad Governor Mohammed Jaber called on the health ministry "to establish a commission of enquiry so that those who did not do their jobs may be brought to justice".In a statement, the government's human rights commission said the incident was "a crime against patients exhausted by Covid-19 who put their lives in the hands of the health ministry and its institutions and instead of being treated, perished in flames."The commission called on Iraqi Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhemi to sack Health Minister Hassan al-Tamimi and "bring him to justice".Kadhemi responded by calling for "an immediate investigation with those in charge at the ministry" and demanded that the "hospital director, head of security and the technical maintenance team be sent to the investigators and not be released until those at fault have been brought to justice".By the early hours of Sunday, while the civil defence said the fire was under control, the health ministry had not issued any statement or announced how many people had been killed or wounded.The first cases of Covid-19 appeared in Iraq in February 2020.The health ministry has since recorded a total of 1,025,288 cases of the disease and 15,217 deaths.It has said it carries out around 40,000 tests daily from a population of 40 million.Those patients who can often prefer to source oxygen tanks for treatment at home, rather than go to overcrowded and run-down hospitals.The country launched its vaccination campaign last month, and has received nearly 650,000 doses of different vaccines -- the majority by donation or through the Covax programme, which is helping lower and middle income nations to procure vaccines.As of Wednesday, 274,343 people had received at least one dose, the ministry said.Health authorities have faced an uphill battle to convince Iraqis to get vaccinated, in the face of widespread scepticism over the jab and public reluctance to wear masks since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-tears-through-baghdad-hospital-for-covid-19-patients-15-deaths-reported-101619307471016.html
