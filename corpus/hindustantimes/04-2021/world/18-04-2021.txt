The attack comes few days after an explosives-laden drone targeted U.S.-led coalition forces near a northern Iraq airport, causing a large fire and damage to a building.The incident was the latest in a string of attacks that have targeted mostly American installations in Iraq in recent weeks.American forces withdrew from Iraq in 2011 but returned in 2014 at the invitation of Iraq to help battle the Islamic State group after it seized vast areas in the north and west of the country. In late 2020, U.S. troop levels in Iraq were reduced to 2,500 after withdrawals based on orders from the Trump administration.Calls grew for further U.S. troop withdrawals after a U.S.-directed drone strike killed Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani and an Iraqi militia leader in Baghdad in January 2020.Last month, a base in western Iraq housing U.S.-led coalition troops and contractors was hit by 10 rockets. One contractor was killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rockets-hit-iraqi-air-base-2-security-forces-wounded-101618768860354.html

Vistara's flights on Delhi-Hong Kong route had earlier been banned from April 6 to April 19.Vistara did not respond to PTI's request for a statement on the matter. A record single-day rise of 2,61,500 coronavirus infections has taken India's case tally to 1,47,88,109, while active cases have surpassed the 18-lakh mark, according to Union Health Ministry data updated on Sunday.The death toll increased to 1,77,150 with a record 1,501 new fatalities, the data updated at 8 am showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-hong-kong-suspends-flights-connecting-india-from-april-20-to-may-3-101618767141653.html

The French government will discuss these new measures with its European partners early next week, Prime Minister Jean Castex said in an emailed statement.Beforehand, travelers entering France from outside the EU were requested to commit to isolate for seven days with no proper checks, even though Europe’s outside borders have been closed since March 2020.Last week, France announced a temporary suspension of all flights from Brazil due to the deteriorating health situation there, yet maintained flights between its overseas territory of Guyana, which shares 700 kilometers (435 miles) of borders with Brazil.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-sees-eu-coordinating-on-trips-from-covid-variant-hit-countries-101618745509772.html
18-04-2021||World||US focus shifting to China from Afghanistan, says Blinken||Withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan meshes with the Biden administration’s goal of focusing resources on China and the Covid-19 pandemic, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said, as another top U.S. official said it was time for the Afghan people to “step up.”“The terrorism threat has moved to other places,” Blinken said on ABC’s “This Week” on Sunday. “And we have other very important items on our agenda, including the relationship with China, including dealing with everything from climate change to Covid. And that’s where we have to focus our energy and resources.”President Joe Biden said Wednesday that U.S. forces would fully withdraw from Afghanistan by the 20th anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, saying it’s time to end America’s “forever war.”Blinken, who met with Afghan leaders in Kabul and NATO allies in Brussels last week, said al-Qaeda, which carried out the attacks two decades ago, “has been significantly degraded.”He played down concern that U.S. intelligence might be blindsided to terrorist threats emerging in Afghanistan, saying the U.S. will be repositioning forces and assets to “guard against the potential reemergence.”“We’ll be able to see that in real time with time to take action,” Blinken said. “We have different capabilities, different assets, and I think a greater ability to see something coming with time to do something about it.”Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said in a CNN interview that the U.S. withdrawal would eliminate an “excuse” for the Taliban to keep fighting and “the ball clearly is in the court of Taliban and their supporters.”Yet he expressed caution about the Taliban’s readiness to agree to a political settlement, saying “what I hope they will go for and what they’re likely to go for are likely to be different things.”The U.S. is committed to helping find a peace deal for Afghanistan that includes the Taliban, Blinken said.“Ultimately, it is in no one’s interest in Afghanistan, whether it’s the Taliban or anyone else, it’s certainly not the people of Afghanistan, for the country to descend once again into civil war, into a long war.”Separately, U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said there are no guarantees about what will happen in Afghanistan.“All the United States could do is provide the Afghan security forces, the Afghan government and the Afghan people resources and capabilities, training and equipping their forces, providing assistance to their government,” Sullivan said on “Fox News Sunday.” “We have done that, and now it is time for American troops to come home and the Afghan people to step up to defend their own country.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-focus-shifting-to-china-from-afghanistan-says-blinken-101618765668631.html
18-04-2021||World||China to expand digital yuan experiments: Official||China will expand digital yuan experiments to more cities, but there is no specific timetable for its official rollout, central bank vice governor Li Bo told an annual gathering on Sunday of top Chinese and foreign policymakers, executives and academics.China is one of the frontrunners in the global race to launch central bank digital currencies to modernise financial systems, ward off the threat from cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and speed up domestic and international payments.Last year it launched testing in several cities including Suzhou, Shenzhen, Chengdu and Xiong'an.Li said testing had shown that the issuance and distribution mechanism of the digital yuan, or e-CNY, are compatible with the existing financial system, and help minimize the impact on the banking sector.China will continue to improve e-CNY's ecosystem, enhance its security and reliability, and set up a set of legal and regulatory framework, Li said at the Boao Forum in the country's southern island province of Hainan. The forum was cancelled last year due to COVID-19.The digital currency will be used by Chinese citizens as well as foreign visitors to the Beijing Winter Olympics to be held next year, he said.Li also said the focus of developing the e-CNY will be mainly for domestic use, while cooperating with other countries to find a solution for cross-border payments in the long run.The yuan internationalisation will be a natural process, and China's goal is not to replace the U.S. dollar or other global currencies, but let the market make choices, Li added.Zhou Xiaochuan, China's former central bank governor, told the same forum that China's initial motivation for developing the digital yuan was for domestic retail payments, not for cross-border payments, which still face many complex issues.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-to-expand-digital-yuan-experiments-official-101618763573338.html
18-04-2021||World||3 killed in police crackdown on banned radical Islamist party TLP in Pakistan||Three workers of banned radical Islamist party Tehreek-i-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) were killed and scores injured in a fresh operation launched by Pakistani security forces here on Sunday against the outfit that carried out violent protests to force the government to expel the French ambassador over a blasphemous caricature published in France last year.Rangers and police on Sunday morning launched the operation at the TLP headquarters (Chowk Yateem Khana) Lahore to remove thousands of workers camped there, blocking the main Multan Road.During the operation, three TLP activists were killed and dozens injured. A senior police officer is among several law enforcers suffered injuries, a senior police officer told PTI.“As the number of TLP supporters was in thousands the Rangers and police could not manage to disperse them in a three-hour operation,” he said, adding that the law enforcers ended the operation fearing loss of more lives.During the operation, the protesters also held a senior police officer, Omar Farooq Baloch, hostage and tortured him, he said.In a video message released by the TLP, Baloch, who had head injury, urged the Imran Khan government not to kill fellow Muslims and abide by the agreement his government signed with the TLP over expulsion of the French ambassador.Police have failed to recover Baloch from the TLP’s custody so far despite having negotiations with it.Punjab police spokesperson Rana Arif also confirmed death of three persons during the law enforcement agencies's operation. He said a dozen or so police officials were “brutally tortured” by the TLP workers.“Today in the early morning, miscreants (TLP workers) attacked Nawankot Police Station (which is close to TLP headquarters) where Rangers and police officers were trapped inside the police station and Deputy Superintendent Police (Omar Farooq Baloch) was kidnapped and taken to the TLP Markaz (headquarters)," the Punjab police said in a statement issued here on Sunday afternoon.“One oil tanker with 50,000 litres of petrol has been taken by the miscreants to the Markaz. The miscreants were armed and attacked Rangers and police with petrol bombs. Police and Rangers pushed them back and took back the possession of the police station. Police did not plan or conduct any operation against the mosque or seminary,” the statement said.In a video message, a TLP spokesperson Shafiq Ameeni said: “Police attacked us at Lahore Markaz on Sunday morning in which a large number of our workers have been martyred while many are injured. We will bury our dead till the French ambassador is expelled and our agreement with the government is implemented."The government on Friday had announced completion of the operation against TLP in the country which had begun Monday last. After completion of the operation, Prime Minister Imran Khan had said four policemen were killed and over 600 injured in the four-day violent clashes between the law enforcers and TLP workers across the country."I want to pay special tribute to our police force for their heroic stand against organised violence intended to create chaos to blackmail government. Four policemen were martyred and over 600 injured. Our nation is indebted to these heroes and we will look after the families of the martyrs," Khan had said in a tweet on Friday.The Pakistan government had blocked the access to social media platforms — Twitter, Facebook, WhatsApp, YouTube and Instagram — from 11am to 3pm on Friday in connection with the law enforcement agencies' operation against the TLP protesters who refused to vacate some main roads and highways in Lahore and other parts of the Punjab province.The cellular and internet service has been suspended in some parts of Lahore including the area housing the TLP headquarters till Sunday.The government this week banned the TLP. A notification declaring TLP as a proscribed organisation was issued by the Ministry of Interior shortly after the federal Cabinet approved a summary to ban the party.The government has also imposed a ban on the media coverage of TLP and any police action against it. In compliance with this, none of the broadcast media in the country reported police action against the TLP in Lahore on Sunday.The TLP workers had blocked all major roads and highways in the country mostly in Punjab on Monday last after the Imran Khan government arrested it's chief Allama Saad Rizvi.The TLP had given the government April 20 deadline to expel the French ambassador over a blasphemous caricature published in France last year.Punjab police spokesperson Rana Arif said more than 3,200 workers and leaders or TLP have been arrested in Punjab since clashes broke between Islamists and law enforcers.He said all four policemen killed during clashes belong to Punjab police. TLP claims that over a dozen of its activists have been killed in clashes and hundreds of them injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-killed-in-police-crackdown-on-banned-radical-islamist-party-tlp-in-pakistan-101618764592580.html
18-04-2021||World||China's population to enter negative growth after 2025: Official||The demographics of the world's most populous country is set to change as China will experience a negative growth after 2025, which will result in shortage of consumer demand, a well-known Chinese economist has cautioned.China’s population is set to peak in just four years’ time and the milestone will be marked by a significant downturn in consumer demand, said Cai Fang, a member of the monetary policy committee of the People’s Bank of China, the central bank.“When the total population enters negative growth (after 2025), there will be a shortage of demand,” Cai was quoted as saying by Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post on Sunday.“We need to pay attention to the impact of demographics on future consumption,” he said.Cai’s comments came as China is due to release its latest census later this month.According to a PBOC study released a few days ago, China should immediately liberalise its birth policies or face a scenario in which it has a lower share of workers and higher burden of elderly care than the United States by 2050.In a rare frank appraisal, four researchers from the PBOC said the country should not interfere with people’s ability to have children or it will be too late to reverse the economic impact of a declining population.Since 2016, Chinese couples have been allowed to have two children.“We should not hesitate and wait for the effects of existing birth policies,” the researchers said in a working paper published early this week.“The birth liberalisation should happen now when there are some residents who still want to have children but can’t. It’s useless to liberalise it when no one wants to have children,” it said.After implementing the controversial one-child policy for over three decades, China is facing a demographic crisis with a rapidly ageing population over 60 years, which according to official figures, has increased to 420 million in 2019.The two-child policy, which was implemented from 2016 failed to make an impact on the low birth rates as the number of newborns dropped by two million in 2018.China as a whole saw 580,000 fewer new-borns in 2019 compared to 2018, marking the third consecutive year of decline since the implementation of the universal two-child policy in the mainland, according to official data.According to China’s statistics bureau, the country had a population of 1.34 billion in 2010 with an annual growth rate of 0.57 per cent, down from 1.07 per cent a decade earlier.Cai said the number of Chinese of working age had been in decline since 2010, which had mainly affected the supply side of the economy.He said if people of working age were faced with the additional financial burden of looking after an elderly relative while trying to raise a family it would make them more likely to save than consume.That would be bad news for the economy as the government has sought in recent years to drive growth through domestic consumption.“The cost of childbearing, parenting and education are the biggest constraints on young couples,” Cai said.“For the elderly, we need to increase their labour participation and social security benefits so that they can contribute to and share in the economic growth, while also maintaining consumer demand,” he said.The government should also do more to stimulate consumption among low-income groups that had a higher propensity for spending than the wealthy, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-population-to-enter-negative-growth-after-2025-official-101618763610298.html

It was the latest of several rail accidents to hit the country in recent years.At least eight train wagons ran off the railway at the city of Banha in Qalyubia province, just north of Cairo, the provincial governor's office said in a statement. Videos on social media purportedly showed wagons overturned and passengers escaping to safety along the railway.The train was travelling to Nile Delta city of Mansoura from the Egyptian capital, the statement said. The health ministry said that least 97 people were injured. It was not immediately clear what caused the train to derail.Last week, at least 15 people were injured when train carriages derailed in the Nile Delta province of Sharqia.Sunday’s train accident came three weeks after two passenger trains collided in the province of Sohag, killing at least 18 people and injuring 200 others, including children.Prosecutors said they found that gross negligence by railway employees was behind the deadly March 25 crash, which caused public outcry across the country.Train wrecks and mishaps are common in Egypt, where the railway system has a history of badly maintained equipment and mismanagement.Hundreds of train accidents are reported every year. In February 2019 an unmanned locomotive slammed into a barrier inside Cairo’s main Ramses railway station, causing a huge explosion and a fire that killed at least 25 people. That crash prompted the then-transportation minister to resign.Egypt’s deadliest train crash was in 2002, when over 300 people were killed after a fire broke out in an overnight train traveling from Cairo to southern Egypt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/passenger-train-derails-in-egypt-100-injured-101618757623066.html

He was a former FedEx employee.Hole's family released a statement to the families of the victims and the Indianapolis community on Saturday."We are devastated at the loss of life caused as a result of Brandon’s actions; through the love of his family, we tried to get him the help he needed."Our sincerest and most heartfelt apologies go out to the victims of this senseless tragedy. We are so sorry for the pain and hurt being felt by their families and the entire Indianapolis community."Hole is accused of killing Amarjeet Johal, 66; Jaswinder Kaur, 64; Jaswinder Singh, 68; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; Matthew R. Alexander, 32; Samaria Blackwell, 19; Karli Smith, 19; and John Weisert, 74.Police say they are trying to understand the motive behind the mass shooting incident.In March 2020, Hole's mother told law enforcement authorities that he might attempt "suicide by cop," the FBI's Indianapolis office said.Special Agent in Charge Paul Keenan said Hole was placed on an immediate mental health temporary hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. He also said a shotgun was seized at Hole's residence."Based on items observed in the suspect's bedroom at that time, he was interviewed by the FBI in April 2020," CNN quoted the statement as saying."No Racially Motivated Violent Extremism ideology was identified during the course of the assessment and no criminal violation was found. The shotgun was not returned to the suspect."McCartt said that Indianapolis police found Hole's name in two past incident reports.Meanwhile, the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department (IMPD)announced on Saturday that Hole purchased two guns used in the attack legally."During Thursday's incident, the suspect, Brandon Hole, was witnessed using assault rifles in the assault," it said."ATF conducted a trace on the two weapons. IMPD learned that Brandon Hole purchased the rifles legally in July and September of 2020."While Hole's motive is not yet known, "he targeted a facility known to be heavily populated by Sikh employees, and the attack is traumatic for our community as we continue to face senseless violence," said Satjeet Kaur, executive director of the Sikh Coalition.That sentiment was echoed in a letter to the Biden administration on Saturday, in which the Sikh Coalition wrote, "It was no accident that the shooter targeted this particular FedEx facility where he had worked and knew was overwhelmingly staffed by Sikhs.""The people that were shot and killed were not random targets," the coalition said."As such, we implore the Administration to ensure that this shooting is not simply dismissed by the media or law enforcement and acknowledge what it is -- a deliberate act intended to inflict the most harm against diverse Americans."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tried-to-get-him-help-fedex-mass-shooter-s-family-apologises-to-victims-kin-101618761414256.html

No one can.""All the United States could do is provide the Afghan security forces, the Afghan government and the Afghan people resources and capabilities, training and equipping their forces, providing assistance to their government. We have done that and now it is time for American troops to come home and the Afghan people to step up to defend their own country."CIA Director William Burns told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Wednesday that America's ability to collect intelligence and act against extremist threats in Afghanistan will diminish after the departure of U.S. troops.A United Nations report in January said there were as many as 500 al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and that the Taliban maintained a close relationship with the Islamist extremist group. The Taliban denies al Qaeda has a presence in Afghanistan.Announcing his decision to withdraw troops, Biden said the United States would monitor the threat, reorganize counterterrorism capabilities and keep substantial assets in the region to respond to threats to the United States emerging from Afghanistan."He has no intention of taking our eye off the ball," Sullivan said of the president."We have the capacity, from repositioning our capabilities over the horizon, to continue to suppress the terrorist threat in Afghanistan."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-guarantees-about-afghanistan-s-future-after-us-troops-leave-white-house-101618760864377.html

18-04-2021||World||Anthony Fauci expects Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine to resume this week||The United States will likely move to resume Johnson & Johnson's Covid-19 vaccine this coming week, possibly with restrictions or broader warnings after reports of some very rare blood clot cases, the government's top infectious diseases expert said on Sunday.Dr. Anthony Fauci, in a series of news show interviews, said he expects a decision when advisers to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meet Friday to discuss the pause in J&J's single-dose vaccine.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here "I would be very surprised if we don't have a resumption in some form by Friday,” he said. "I don't really anticipate that they're going to want it stretch it out a bit longer."Fauci, who is President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, said he believed that federal regulators could bring the shots back with restrictions based on age or gender or with a blanket warning, so that it is administered in a way "a little bit different than we were before the pause."The J&J vaccine has been in limbo after the CDC and the Food and Drug Administration said last week they needed more evidence to decide if a handful of unusual blood clots were linked to the shot — and if so, how big the risk is.The reports are rare - six cases out of more than 7 million US inoculations with J&J vaccine. The clots were found in six women between the ages of 18 and 48. One person died.The acting FDA commissioner had said she expected the pause to last only a matter of days. Still, the decision last Tuesday triggered swift action in Europe and elsewhere.Fauci said he doubted very seriously that the US would permanently halt use of the J&J vaccine."I don't think that's going to happen," he said. "The pause was to take a look, make sure we know all the information we can have within that timeframe, and also warn some of the physicians out there who might see people, particularly women, who have this particular adverse event, that they treat them properly.""I think it'll likely say, OK, we're going to use it. But be careful under these certain circumstances.'”More than 6.8 million doses of the J&J vaccine have been given in the US, the vast majority with no or mild side effects. Authorities stressed they have found no sign of clot problems with the most widely used Covid-19 vaccines in the US - from Moderna and Pfizer.Fauci appeared on NBC's "Meet the Press," CNN's "State of the Union," ABC's "This Week" and CBS' "Face the Nation."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/anthony-fauci-expects-johnson-johnson-s-covid-19-vaccine-to-resume-this-week-101618760480494.html

There'll be a meeting on Monday over the current Covid-19 situation. But advice is there overextending the ongoing lockdown," the State Minister added.Bangladesh on Sunday reported over 100 Covid-19 single-day deaths for the third consecutive day.On Sunday, another 102 deaths were logged in 24 hours. Earlier on Saturday and Friday, 101 new deaths were recorded in a single day, the highest in the country so far since the first reported death on March 18, 2020.With the updated data, the death toll in the country stands at 10,385, and the total cases at 718,950.On April 14, the Bangladesh government enforced a fresh lockdown with harsher measures.

If people follow health guidelines properly and stay home, then the infection rate will come down," Hossain said.The National Technical Advisory Committee (NTAC) on Covid-19 has recommended a 14-day fresh lockdown and the ongoing lockdown might be extended for another week based on the recommendation.Replying to a question about the extension of the ongoing lockdown, Additional Secretary of the Cabinet Division Rafiqul Islam, said: "The decision in this regard will be known on Monday after an inter-ministerial meeting."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-likely-to-extend-lockdown-for-another-week-as-covid-19-worsens-101618756278020.html
18-04-2021||World||Signs of thaw on Iran nuclear standoff emerge in Vienna Talks||World powers working to end the standoff between Iran and the U.S. are due to reconvene Sunday amid signs of a thaw that may lead to a revival of the 2015 nuclear deal and reduce tensions in the energy-rich Persian Gulf.Iran’s lead negotiator, Deputy Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, said Saturday a “new understanding” was taking shape at the talks in Vienna and that his country would start work on a full draft text for negotiators to discuss. While the U.S. hasn’t yet responded, the European Union and Russia echoed his optimism without suggesting a breakthrough was imminent.The remarks inject new hope into a process rocked last week by an attack on an Iranian nuclear facility that prompted the Islamic Republic to enrich uranium at levels nearer to weapons grade. The incident, which Iran blamed on Israel, was the latest in a series of flashpoints in the region that have included assassinations, attacks on energy installations and tanker seizures.The nuclear deal, which imposed strict limits on Iran’s atomic activity in exchange for sanctions relief, was a signature achievement of the Obama administration. Abandonment of the accord in 2018 by then-President Donald Trump and the reimposition of sanctions have kept relations between the longstanding foes close to breaking point.“The drafting of the text can begin now, and the Iranian delegation has prepared and presented its text on the nuclear sphere and the lifting of sanctions,” Araghchi told Iranian state TV, cautioning that serious disagreements remained.The talks underscore Washington’s changed stance toward Iran since Joe Biden entered the White House earlier this year. The U.S. president has pledged to return his country to the 2015 accord, but the administration has been reluctant to make any grand gestures or agree to remove sanctions all at once, something Iran insists Washington must do as the party that first violated the deal.In an apparent further sign of easing tension, the Financial Times reported Sunday that senior officials from Saudi Arabia and Iran have been holding talks to repair relations. The newspaper cited three unidentified officials. The meeting in Baghdad on April 9 included discussions about recent attacks and would be followed by another round of talks next week, it said.The International Atomic Energy Agency confirmed on Saturday that Iran has started the process of enriching uranium to 60%, an important step closer to weapons grade of 80% to 90%. Iran insists that the uranium will be used for medical purposes only. Biden criticized the move, saying it was contrary to the agreement, but said it wouldn’t derail the Vienna talks.The Islamic republic began in 2019 to gradually increase its atomic activity -- beyond the limit of 3.67% allowed in the deal -- in response to Trump’s so-called “maximum pressure” strategy.“The reality is that the alternative to reviving the nuclear deal is not attractive for either side,” said Ali Vaez, director of the Iran Project at the International Crisis Group. “But a lot of hard work remains, including on figuring out how to sequence the implementation of the measures and their verification.”Earlier this week, Araghchi said that Washington and Tehran had to specify the steps they would each need to take in order to restore the 2015 deal, including a tally of all Trump-era sanctions that Iran says the U.S. would need to remove.The European Union and Russia, which along with China are trying help the U.S. and Iran choreograph the restoration of the deal and full compliance to its terms, encouraged both sides to double down on efforts to reach an agreement.Enrique Mora, who’s leading the talks on behalf of the EU, tweeted that the discussions had been “intensive,” and that “progress has been made in a far from easy task.” The group now needs to focus on more detailed work, he added without elaborating.It was “key” that all the parties are committed to seeing the U.S. rejoin the accord and that it’s fully implemented by both Washington and Tehran, Mora said.Russia’s envoy to the International Atomic Energy Agency, Mikhail Ulyanov, said that the countries would continue working over the weekend and into next week as they agreed to “not waste time” and reach a successful outcome “as soon as possible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/signs-of-thaw-on-iran-nuclear-standoff-emerge-in-vienna-talks-101618740469430.html

18-04-2021||World||Iran sees highest Covid-19 daily death toll in months as cases surge||Iran's daily coronavirus death toll climbed over 400 for the first time in months on Sunday, as the country, which has long had the region's largest outbreak, battles a post-holiday infection surge.Iranian health authorities recorded 405 fatalities from the virus, pushing the total death toll to 66,732. Officials increasingly have warned about the impact of trends seen nationwide during the Persian New Year, or Nowruz. The two-week holiday last month brought increased travel, relaxed restrictions and large gatherings without precautions.After COVID-19 cases broke record after record earlier this month, the Health Ministry reported 21,644 infections on Sunday, bringing the total count over 2.2 million. Hospitals are rapidly filling across the country, particularly in the capital. Authorities reported 130 deaths in Tehran alone, according to Mohsen Hashemi, head of the Tehran municipal council. The single-day death toll nationwide reached a peak of over 480 last November.The coronavirus pandemic has hammered Iran for months, but the government has signaled it can't sustain the punishing lockdowns seen in the U.S. and Europe without risking economic catastrophe, especially for the nation's poorest. Its ailing economy has struggled under harsh U.S. sanctions, reimposed when former President Donald Trump abandoned the 2015 landmark nuclear deal that granted the country sanctions relief in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program.Still, Iran has restricted business operations in more than 250 cities for a period of 10 days, shuttering restaurants, beauty salons, malls and bookstores, confectionaries and public parks.The country's inoculation rollout has gotten off to a slow start, with Iran producing and promoting a range of domestically made vaccines and warning against the import of American-made ones amid deep-rooted suspicion of the West.However, President Hassan Rouhani stressed the importance of importing foreign-made vaccines in a speech last week.“We cannot wait for the domestic vaccine to reach mass production,” he said. "We need to expand vaccination this spring by importing vaccines in appropriate ways.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-sees-highest-covid-19-daily-death-toll-in-months-as-cases-surge-101618749738735.html

18-04-2021||World||Indianapolis shooter legally bought guns used in FedEx shooting: Police||The former employee who shot and killed eight people at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis legally purchased the two assault rifles used in the attack despite red flag laws designed to prevent that, police said.A trace of the two guns found by investigators at the scene revealed that suspect Brandon Scott Hole, 19, of Indianapolis, legally bought the rifles in July and September of last year, officials with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department said Saturday.IMPD did not share where Hole bought the guns, citing the ongoing investigation, but said Hole was witnessed using both rifles during the assault.Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt said Hole began firing randomly at people in the parking lot of the FedEx facility late Thursday, killing four, before entering the building, fatally shooting four more people and then turning the gun on himself.Indiana has had a “red flag law” allowing police or courts to seize guns from people who show warning signs of violence since 2005, when it became one of the first states to enact such a law after an Indianapolis police officer was killed by a man whose weapons had to be returned despite hospitalization months earlier for an emergency mental health evaluation.The law is intended to prevent people from purchasing or possessing a firearm if they are found by a judge to present “an imminent risk” to themselves or others.Authorities have two weeks after seizing someone’s weapon to argue in court that the person should not be allowed to possess a gun, according to the law. Officials have not said whether a judge made a red flag ruling in Hole’s case.Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI’s Indianapolis field office, said that agents questioned Hole last year after his mother called police to say that her son might commit “suicide by cop.” He said the FBI was called after items were found in Hole’s bedroom but he did not elaborate on what they were. He said agents found no evidence of a crime and that they did not identify Hole as espousing a racially motivated ideology.A police report obtained by The Associated Press shows that officers seized a pump-action shotgun from Hole’s home after responding to the mother’s call. Keenan said the gun was never returned.McCartt said Hole was a former employee of FedEx and last worked for the company in 2020. The deputy police chief said he did not know why Hole left the job or if he had ties to the workers in the facility. He said police have not yet uncovered a motive for the shooting.Investigators searched a home Friday in Indianapolis associated with Hole and seized evidence, including desktop computers and other electronic media, McCartt said.Hole’s family said in a statement Saturday they are “so sorry for the pain and hurt” his actions caused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianapolis-shooter-legally-bought-guns-used-in-fedex-shooting-police-101618752790332.html
18-04-2021||World||Most Americans want to end lifetime Supreme Court appointments: Poll||A majority of Americans want to end lifetime appointments for U.S. Supreme Court justices, according to an Ipsos poll for Reuters, though less than half are in favor of other efforts to reform the judiciary.The national opinion poll, conducted on Thursday and Friday, found that 63% of adults supported term or age limits for Supreme Court justices. Another 22% said they opposed any limits and the rest did not express an opinion.The poll also found that only 38% would support expanding the size of the court by adding four more justices. Another 42% said they would oppose doing so and the rest were unsure.Liberal activists and some legal scholars have been pushing for judicial reforms as Republican leaders in Congress built a 6-to-3 conservative Supreme Court majority over the past several years, in part by blocking a Democratic nominee and allowing Republican former President Donald Trump to install three picks during his single term.Some Democratic lawmakers on Thursday introduced legislation to expand the Supreme Court to 13 justices, a move that they believe would restore public confidence in the judicial branch. But the party's leadership appeared cool to the idea of pursuing that course.President Joe Biden has formed a bi-partisan committee to look at the merits of adding justices as well as other potential reforms to the court.While Congress has the power to change the number of justices who sit on the court, legal scholars believe it would likely require a constitutional amendment to end their lifetime appointments.The poll found that only 49% of Americans have a "great deal" or a "fair amount" of confidence in decisions made by Supreme Court justices. In comparison, 43% of respondents expressed a similar amount of trust in decisions made by the White House and 32% said the same of decisions made by Congress.The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. The survey gathered responses from 1,003 adults. The results have a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 4 percentage points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/most-americans-want-to-end-lifetime-supreme-court-appointments-poll-101618752809727.html
18-04-2021||World||'We don't have time': Navalny's team calls new protests in Russia||Activists for imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny on Sunday called for massive protests in the heart of Moscow and St Petersburg as Navalny's health reportedly is deteriorating severely while on hunger strike.Leonid Volkov, a top strategist for Navalny, said the demonstrations were called on short notice for Wednesday because “his life hangs in the balance...We don't know how long he can hold on...But it is clear we do not have time.”The 44-year-old Navalny, President Vladimir Putin's most visible and persistent critic, started a hunger strike more than three weeks ago to protest prison authorities' refusal to allow him to be seen by a private doctor for diagnosis of severe back pain and loss of feeling in his legs; the Russian penitentiary service says he is getting adequate care.On Saturday, a doctor said test results that he received from Navalny's family showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which could lead to cardiac arrest, and signs of kidney failure.“Our patient could die at any moment,” said the doctor, Yaroslav Ashikhmin.There was no immediate comment from police or government officials about the call for protests, but the response is likely to be harsh. Police arrested more than 10,000 people during nationwide protests in January calling for Navalny to be freed.The Wednesday protests have been called for symbolically resonant locations — Manezh Square in Moscow, just outside the Kremlin walls, and St Petersburg's sprawling Palace Square.Navalny was arrested on January 17 when he returned to Russia from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from Soviet nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian officials have denied any involvement and even questioned whether Navalny was poisoned, which was confirmed by several European laboratories.Navalny was ordered to serve 2 1/2 years in prison on the grounds that his long recovery in Germany violated a suspended sentence he had been given for a fraud conviction in a case that Navalny says was politically motivated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-don-t-have-time-navalny-s-team-calls-new-protests-in-russia-101618752069879.html

18-04-2021||World||UK Opposition urges Boris Johnson to cancel India visit over new 'double mutant' Covid-19 variant||Britain's Opposition Labour Party on Sunday joined calls for Prime Minister Boris Johnson to cancel his visit to India, starting next Sunday, amid growing concerns of a new variant of Covid-19 detected in the country.Public Health England (PHE) has said that 77 cases of the so-called “double mutant” Indian variant have been detected in the UK since last month and that it has now been classed as a Variant Under Investigation (VUI).Downing Street had earlier confirmed a much shorter schedule for the UK prime minister's visit, with the bulk of the programme including talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi set for a day-long agenda on Monday, April 26.“I can't see why the prime minister can't conduct his business with the Indian government via Zoom,” said Labour’s Shadow Communities Secretary Steve Reed.“The prime minister, like all of us in public life, needs to try and set an example. I'd much rather the prime minister did it by Zoom rather than travelling to India," he told ‘Sky News’, when asked if the visit should go ahead next week.A government minister, meanwhile, stressed that there is no evidence the Indian variant can evade vaccine protection or that it is more contagious."I'm told there is no evidence at the moment this particular variant is able to get around the vaccine or...that it is necessarily more contagious than the others – but we are looking at it, it will be studied," said Environment Secretary George Eustice.The variant – officially named B.1.617 – is believed to be almost certainly playing a part in the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in India and a major spike in infection rates. It has sparked concerns among academics and sections of the UK media, who have called for India to be added to the “red list”, which involves stricter travel restrictions with a compulsory 10-day hotel quarantine for anyone returning to the UK from such countries.Danny Altmann, a professor of immunology at Imperial College London, is among those who said that he finds it “mystifying” and “slightly confounding” that India is not yet on the red list and that those flying into the UK from there are not subjected to the compulsory hotel quarantine.“I think we should be terribly concerned about it,” Prof Altmann told the BBC.Meanwhile, speculation is rife that India has been kept off the red list to allow Johnson's visit to go ahead, even though cut short, and to ensure that India-UK trade negotiations are on track ahead of India’s negotiations with the European Union (EU).Downing Street has said that designations under the red list, which currently covers around 40 countries, are kept “under constant review” and so far the message is that the visit will go ahead in its shortened version."As with all the prime minister’s visits, his trip to India will prioritise the safety of those involved. All elements of the visit will be Covid secure,” the prime minister's spokesperson said.A lot is riding on the visit, previously postponed from a Republic Day tour in January, as the first major bilateral visit for Johnson outside Europe since the UK general election in December 2019 and the conclusion of the Brexit transition period at the end of December 2020. The priority is for both sides to agree to a ‘Roadmap 2030’, a plan for the next decade to pave the way to a free trade agreement (FTA) in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-opposition-urges-boris-johnson-to-cancel-india-visit-over-new-double-mutant-covid-19-variant-101618750356341.html

18-04-2021||World||Explained: Rise in Covid-19 cases in Pakistan, death toll and vaccination||Amid surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in South Asia, Pakistan on Sunday reported its highest single-day spike in new cases this year with 6,127 cases. The previous highest surge in Covid-19 cases was recorded last year on June 20 when the country reported 6,825 infections and 153 deaths. The country on Sunday reported 149 Covid-related fatalities- the second highest number of fatalities since the pandemic began- which pushed the death toll to 16,243. As the country scrambles to vaccinate its population, the infection tally in the country stands at 756,285 and the positivity rate continued to climb, reaching 8.5 percent on Sunday, as per a report in Dawn.Is the rise in Covid-19 cases reported throughout Pakistan?The rise in new Covid-19 cases is being reported in all the provinces in Pakistan. The highest number of Covid-19 cases was reported in the Punjab province which added 3,562 infections, thus marking the first time that the province reported more than 3,000 infections since the pandemic began. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa reported 958 new coronavirus cases on Sunday which were down from 1,061 on Saturday. Balochistan recorded 62 cases and the caseload in the province reached 20,822 on Sunday.What about the death toll, critical cases and the recoveries in Pakistan?The death toll in Pakistan has crossed the 16,000 mark and currently stands at 16,094 cases. Sunday marked the fifth consecutive day that the country reported more than 100 Covid related fatalities, reported Dawn. The active cases in Pakistan stand at 79,108 and according to the government’s Covid-19 portal 4,984 patients have been admitted to hospitals in the country and are in critical condition. The total number of recoveries in the country has reached 659,483 after 4,527 more recoveries were reported in the country on Sunday.Where does Pakistan stand on the vaccination front?With a population of over 220 million, the country’s vaccination programme has faced major challenges and remains slow owing to the lack of availability of the doses. Currently the country’s vaccination programme, which began on February 2, has only covered 1.3 million people. Amid rise in new cases, Pakistan’s government has announced that it will expand its vaccination programme to include people in the age group of 50-59 years from April 21. Till now, the immunization drive was restricted to people above the age of 60. The country’s vaccination programme is largely dependent on China’s Covid-19 vaccines although some private companies have imported a limited number of Sputnik V vaccines from Russia. The country had also expected to receive around 17 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine in March under the COVAX initiative but was unable to do so. Pakistan’s foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi tweeted about the same, saying that the country will now receive 15 million AstraZeneca jabs by June 30. “Following my meeting with Foreign Minister @HeikoMaas, I am happy to announce that Pakistan will receive 15 million doses of the #COVID vaccine under COVAX, with a commitment for these to be delivered by May,” Qureshi said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-rise-in-covid-19-cases-in-pakistan-death-toll-and-vaccination-101618749762130.html

"I hope that measures are taken to ensure Navalny's physical integrity, but also his freedom," he said."There is a major responsibility here for President (Vladimir) Putin."Navalny, Putin's most prominent opponent, was arrested in January on returning to Russia after recovering from a near-fatal poisoning attack he says was orchestrated by the Kremlin. The Kremlin denies the allegation.He is serving two and a half years on old embezzlement charges -- which he says are politically motivated -- in a penal colony in the town of Pokrov around 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Moscow.The 44-year-old began a hunger strike on March 31 to demand proper medical treatment for back pain and numbness in his legs and hands.On Saturday, several doctors close to Navalny warned that his health had rapidly deteriorated and he could "die any minute," demanding prison officials grant them immediate access."There is truly an authoritarian drift in Russia," Le Drian said."Russia is responsible for Navalny's health, it must assume its role," he added, saying the European Union was closely following his fate."We have already taken action," he said, referring to EU sanctions."The package of sanctions is already significant, but there may be others."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extremely-concerned-about-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-s-health-france-101618749792453.html

The authorities responded by arresting its leader, prompting supporters to hold protests and sit-ins across Pakistan. At least four people were killed, hundreds injured, and thousands arrested. Pakistan banned the group after the violence.A senior police officer and two paramilitary were among the six being held by supporters of (TLP), Lahore police spokesman Arif Rana told Reuters."The TLP activists have two fuel tankers containing thousands of liters of petrol. They are throwing petrol bombs and stones at security officials, and also shooting bullets as the result of which 11 officials are injured," Rana said, adding the operation was ongoing.TLP spokesman Shafiq Amini told Reuters four supporters had been killed on Sunday by police and several others were wounded.Pakistani news channels have been barred from providing coverage of the group since it was banned last week , and on Sunday mobile and internet services were down in the area where clashes were taking place.Roads leading to the headquarters of the group, in Lahore's Chowk Yateemkahan, have been blocked.Still, supporters of TLP have been sharing videos on social media of what they said were clashes on Sunday with police, and hashtags supporting the group were trending in Pakistan on Sunday.The videos, which Reuters could not independently verify, showed thousands of protesters clashing with police in riot-gear, as clouds of tear gas hung in the air and the crackle of gunfire could be heard. Other videos showed injured protesters being carried away.On Saturday Prime Minister Imran Khan said the group had been banned because it "challenged the writ of the state and used street violence & attacking the public & law enforcers."Last week France advised its citizens to temporarily leave Pakistan for their safety.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deadly-clashes-after-islamists-of-tlp-take-police-hostage-in-pakistan-s-lahore-101618749315318.html

As a result, we couldn't make up for unexpected events," she said. "We are confident that we will fulfill our commitment to deliver 300 million doses to the European Union this year."The Kurier interview did not directly address ongoing investigations into health concerns over the AstraZeneca shot. The EU has put a warning label on the vaccine over its possible linkage to extremely rare blood clots, Denmark has completely halted use of the vaccine and Britain has advised people under 30 to get another brand of vaccine.Asked about "thousands" of people in Austria who are cancelling their appointments for AstraZeneca shots, Walters said the company's plan was "to continue to transparently provide information about efficacy and safety to doctors, so that they can adequately inform people" of benefits and risks.British and European Union medicine regulators have said that the overall benefits of using the vaccine outweigh any risks of rare clotting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-could-have-covid-19-vaccine-against-variant-by-end-2021-report-101618747286666.html
18-04-2021||World||Nasa believes Ingenuity Mars helicopter will lift off this time. Here’s why||Nasa has completed a full-spin speed test of the Ingenuity helicopter and the team at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is going to attempt on Monday the first-ever controlled flight on Mars after multiple delays. The US space agency had previously postponed the flight attempt after an issue was flagged during a high-speed test of the rotor blades.Nasa JPL then revealed that the watchdog timer, which alerts the system about any potential issues, expiration occurred when the command sequence was trying to transition the flight computer from ‘Pre-Flight’ to ‘Flight’ mode. MiMi Aung, Ingenuity Mars helicopter project manager at Nasa's JPL, explained why they are optimistic about the helicopter taking off from the Martian surface this time.Aung wrote in a blog post that the team has been testing two solutions to address the watchdog timer issue that prevented the helicopter from transitioning to ‘Flight’ mode. The first solution was to adjust the command sequence from Earth to slightly alter the timing of this transition. It required adding a few commands to the flight operations sequence and was tested on both Earth and Mars.“From testing this technique on Ingenuity over the last few days, we know this approach is likely to allow us to transition to flight mode and prepare for lift-off about 85% of the time,” the project manager wrote.“This solution leaves the helicopter safe if the transition to flight mode is not completed. On Friday, we employed this solution to perform our first-ever high-speed spin test on Mars,” she added.Aung said that the first solution is the least disruptive to a helicopter since the team doesn’t need to change its configuration, and the Ingenuity has been behaving just as expected. However, if the first plan doesn’t work after subsequent attempts in the days following, the team has a backup plan which requires modification and reinstallation of Ingenuity’s flight control software.The Ingenuity helicopter team at the JPL has transmitted the new software for the second solution to Nasa’s Perseverance rover, which acts as the helicopter’s base station on Mars. The rover will send the new flight control software to the helicopter and the team would require several additional days for preparing to “load and test the new software on Ingenuity, redo the rotor tests in this new configuration, and recycle for a first flight attempt.”“Our team considers Monday’s attempted first flight like a rocket launch: We’re doing everything we can to make it a success, but we also know that we may have to scrub and try again,” Aung said.The rotorcraft weighing 1.8 kilograms is set to take off on Monday at 12:31am PDT (1:01pm IST) and hover 10 feet above the surface for up to 30 seconds. Data from the first flight attempt will return to Earth a few hours following the autonomous flight. The live coverage confirming Ingenuity’s first flight will begin at 3:15am PDT (3:45 pm IST) on Monday on Nasa’s website, app, and television. It will also be live-streamed on multiple social media platforms of the US space agency, including the JPL YouTube and Facebook channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-believes-ingenuity-mars-helicopter-will-lift-off-this-time-here-s-why-101618743462370.html
18-04-2021||World||Bangladesh arrests Hefazat-e-Islam leader Mamunul Haque after violent protests||Police in Bangladesh on Sunday arrested an influential leader of an Islamist group that led violent protests against last month's visit by India's prime minister to the Muslim-majority nation, officials said.Mamunul Haque of the group Hefazat-e-Islam faces charges of instigating violence, but police did not provide details on specific cases or whether the charges stem from Narendra Modi's visit. Harunur Rashid, a senior Dhaka Metropolitan Police official, said in a short briefing that Haque was arrested from a madrassa, or Islamic school, in the capital of Dhaka’s Mohammadpur area.Haque, 47, is a leading figure in the Hefazat-e-Islam group, which has a strong network of Islamic schools across Bangladesh. The group says it is not a political party, but its leaders in their sermons regularly talk about the country’s politics, advocating an Islamic revolution in the nation of 160 million people. Its leaders often challenge the basics of the country’s constitution and its legal system, which is based on based on British common law.The group criticized Bangladesh's Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina for inviting Modi to join a March 26 celebration of the country’s 50th anniversary of independence, and threatened to shed blood in the streets to undermine the visit. Critics accuse Modi’s Hindu-nationalist party of stoking religious polarization in India and discriminating against minorities, particularly Muslims.Modi’s two-day visit was overshadowed by the violence, and at least 17 supporters of Hefazat-e-Islam were killed in separate clashes with police as they attacked a police station and other government buildings, and blocked highways elsewhere in the country. In Dhaka, they clashed with police outside the country’s main Baitul Mokarram Mosque during the visit.In a speech to Bangladesh's parliament earlier this month, Hasina warned the group and its leaders that they would face consequences if they continue to resort to violence.Haque and his associates led a recent campaign against building a sculpture of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina’s father, saying sculptures are un-Islamic. The government backed off.Hefazat-e-Islam also wants Hasina's government to enact blasphemy laws, under which anyone convicted of criticizing Islam’s prophet would face the death penalty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-arrests-hefazat-e-islam-leader-mamunul-haque-after-violent-protests-101618745178290.html
18-04-2021||World||UK defends ex-PM Cameron as scale of lobbying scandal grows further||Former Prime Minister David Cameron didn’t get any “special favors” when he lobbied for financial aid to Greensill Capital, a top Cabinet minister said, as the furor engulfing the government over its ties to business intensified.Environment Secretary George Eustice said Sunday the government will wait for findings on the Greensill saga before committing to changing lobbying rules. Multiple inquiries into the issues have already started; another one due to be announced Monday is expected to call every living former Prime Minister who isn’t currently in politics for evidence, the Telegraph reported.“Did people give any special favors to David Cameron or indeed to Greensill? The answer to that is no,” Eustice said in an interview with Sky News. “He meticulously observed the rules there that he himself actually put in place after some concerns around lobbying a decade ago.”The scandal’s main focus has been Cameron, who sent text messages to ministers last year about financial aid for Greensill Capital, where he was an adviser. The scale of Greensill’s links to the government has broadened to senior civil servants, with revelations that some were also on Greensill’s payroll while in their government jobs.Cameron’s role as a lobbyist came into focus after Greensill, which offered supply-chain financing services, faced a credit squeeze and then went into administration last month, leading to thousands of threatened job losses.The Greensill revelations has also brought attention to the links between government officials and their financial interests more widely. Earlier this week, Health Secretary Matt Hancock was accused of “cronyism” over the award of contracts to a company he owns shares in.The controversies have become a source of embarrassment for the government just before local elections next month. Chancellor of the Exchequer Rishi Sunak was also implicated after it emerged he “pushed” officials to consider ways of helping Greensill following a request from Cameron. On Wednesday, opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer declared “the return of Tory sleaze.”“It is very clear to me, from what I can see, that the Chancellor has not acted at all improperly,” Eustice told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show on Sunday. “He flagged it, he looked at it, and nothing was done on that case.”Prime Minister Boris Johnson risks suffering electoral fallout over the scandal and could face defections of some of the Labour voters he won over for the Conservative party that drove his landslide election victory in 2019, a senior Tory official said.Those former Labour voters “will start to dismiss him unless he can show he is more open, more transparent and very different from the out-of-touch elite he defeated in the 2016 (Brexit) referendum and ousted from government,” Sir Bernard Jenkin, chair of the powerful Commons liaison committee, said in the Observer on Sunday.The drip-feed of revelations is likely to continue as more critical attention is paid to whether the U.K.’s lobbying scene descended into corruption. Developments reported over the weekend include:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-defends-ex-pm-cameron-as-scale-of-lobbying-scandal-grows-further-101618743482545.html

18-04-2021||World||France's Macron says 'clear red lines' should be drawn with Russia: Reports||World powers should draw "clear red lines" with Russia and consider possible sanctions against Moscow when they're crossed, French President Emmanuel Macron told US news network CBS in an interview."We have to define clear red lines with Russia," Macron said, according to a video excerpt of the interview to be aired later on Sunday."This is the only way to be credible. Sanctions are not sufficient in themselves but sanctions are part of the package," he said, adding that he also agreed with U.S. President Joe Biden's willingness to open a dialogue with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a time of festering tensions.Macron's remarks departed from France's previous stance on Russia and shifted the country closer to its U.S. ally.Since his election in 2017, the French leader had tried to reduce distrust between Russia and the West, hoping to enlist Russian help in solving the world's most intractable crises.Macron's comments come amid some of the worst friction between the United States and Russia since the 1989 end of the Cold War.The United States last week imposed a broad array of sanctions on Russia, including curbs to its sovereign debt market, over what it said was Moscow's interference in last year's US election, Russian cyber hacking, bullying of Ukraine and other alleged malign actions.Washington also expelled 10 Russian diplomats.In response, Russia on Friday told 10 US diplomats to leave the country and suggested the US ambassador return home for consultations.In Europe, tensions between Moscow and Kyiv have also been rising amid a build-up of Russian troops along the border with Ukraine and clashes in that country's east between the Ukrainian army and pro-Russian separatists.Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Friday for peace talks with Moscow.In another sign of broader tensions, the Czech Republic said on Sunday it had informed NATO and European Union allies about suspected Russian involvement in a 2014 ammunition depot explosion and the matter would be addressed at an EU foreign ministers' meeting on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/frances-macron-says-clear-red-lines-should-be-drawn-with-russia-reports-101618740281392.html

Rowling, wrote an open letter to President Vladimir Putin on Friday urging him to ensure Navalny gets medical care.A group of opposition regional lawmakers also called on Putin on Saturday to make sure Navalny is properly treated.Navalny has said prison authorities are threatening to put him in a straitjacket to force-feed him unless he abandons his hunger strike.Russia jailed Navalny for 2-1/2 years in February for parole violations he said were fabricated. He was arrested in January when he returned to Russia from Germany, where he had been recovering from a nerve agent poisoning attack he blamed on Putin.The Kremlin has said it has seen no evidence he was poisoned and has cast Navalny as a U.S.-backed subversive on a mission to destabilise Russia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daughter-of-jailed-kremlin-critic-alexei-navalny-says-he-needs-a-doctor-101618737293252.html

Investigations into how the transmission occurred are under way, it said.“All guests staying on the same floor of the hotel have been retested and returned negative results,” and staff who worked nearby are self-isolating and getting tests, New South Wales Health said.The incident adds to debate over possible shortcomings within the hotel quarantine system, given the rise of more-infectious strains of the virus. The new cases also fuel speculation that ventilation systems may be contributing to dispersion.Shadow Minister for Health and Ageing Mark Butler on Sunday called for national standards on quarantine and for dedicated facilities to be established away from the central business districts. Federal and state leaders will meet to strategise on the response to the virus and the vaccine rollout Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australia-s-sydney-cases-transmitted-during-quarantine-raise-concerns-101618735529288.html
18-04-2021||World||Canada likely to give nod to universal basic income programme||The idea of instituting a universal basic income or UBI programme is gaining ground in Canada ahead of the budget to be presented by the government on Monday.The budget will be first during the second term of the Liberal Party government led by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau since coming to power after the October 2019 federal elections. It will also be the first to be presented by deputy prime minister Chrystia Freeland, who assumed charge of the finance portfolio following the resignation of her predecessor Bill Morneau last year.Importantly, the Liberal Party passed a resolution supporting UBI during its national convention in the second week of April. The resolution was supported by 77% of party members who sought to “ensure that communities at risk (including indigenous people) are able to feel financially secure,” according to CBC News. The New Democratic Party convention also adopted a similar motion earlier this month.That momentum for UBI came as the Trudeau government already implemented the Canada Emergency Response Benefit (CERB) in March last year that paid out 2,000 Canadian dollars (US$1,599) per four-week period to those rendered unemployed or underemployed during the Covid-19 pandemic. That was later converted into the ongoing Canada Recovery Benefit (CRB).Experts believe a start could be made in the budget by studying various aspects of a UBI scheme. “I think you might see some funding in the budget for studying a basic income or maybe doing some pilots of a basic income,” professor Dionne Pohler, acting director of the University of Toronto’s Centre for Industrial Relations and Human Resources, said. However, she did not consider the CERB or CRB as having laid the groundwork towards UBI as they were forms of employment insurance. But, they may have change public perception of UBI, making more politically palatable. As she said in the past, the idea someone was poor was attributed to “character flaw or a moral failure or they’re just not working hard enough”. And, so I think that what Covid did for the public was make them realise, “You know this could happen to anyone losing their job and at what would you do if you didn’t have access to income?”Pohler believes a targeted basic income programme would be more viable in terms of cost and equity, with those making below a threshold income receiving a cash transfer which would be phased out as the beneficiaries’ income rose.Groups are also lobbying for a version of UBI given the current conditions of uncertainty caused by the coronavirus crisis. The Ottawa-based Basic Income Network has argued for an “architecture” for those in the 18 to 64 age bracket to “be put in place as soon as possible in order that everyone in Canada can contribute to, and benefit from, a healthier new normal”.The biggest roadblock could be the cost involved. The Trudeau government has already taken the federal deficit to nearly 382 billion Canadian dollars (US$306 bilion) by late March, according to an estimate by Parliamentary Budget Officer Yves Giroux.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-likely-to-give-nod-to-universal-basic-income-programme-101618736846396.html

His office says it is also dedicated to the bereaved “who could not accompany their relatives when they died and for whom important and comforting rituals of mourning were not possible.”Germany's confirmed death toll from Covid-19 stood at 79,914 on Sunday, an increase of 67 over the previous day. That is the fifth-highest total in Europe, after the U.K., Italy, Russia and France.Germany had a comparatively small number of deaths in the pandemic’s first phase, but saw much higher infection levels in the fall and winter. In January, more than 1,000 deaths per day were reported at times in the country of 83 million people.Infections have increased again over the past two months as a more contagious coronavirus variant first detected in Britain took hold. Germany has reported 3.14 million cases since the pandemic began.Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to get a bill through parliament that would mandate an “emergency brake” in areas where there are more than 100 weekly new cases per 100,000 inhabitants. The nationwide rate stood at 162 on Sunday.It would require the closure of stores, cultural and sports facilities, limits on personal contacts and nighttime curfews. The idea is to end the patchwork of measures that has characterized the pandemic response across Germany’s 16 states.Merkel says the plan is needed to prevent the health care system from becoming overwhelmed, but state governments and others have found fault with aspects of it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-remembers-nearly-80-000-dead-in-covid-19-pandemic-101618735604258.html

The way things are, there will be enough delivered vaccines for everyone who can be inoculated. We will be able to cover those over 16," Kono said.The minister also noted that the US had launched a vaccine certification process for children aged 12-15 and that Japan would do the same."I think that a request will be filed soon. We will discuss this with specialists, alongside our vaccination plans," the official added.Tokyo has vaccine supply deals with Moderna, AstraZeneca and Pfizer. However, only the Pfizer vaccine has been approved for use in the country so far and has been used to vaccinate the population since February.

The stock the couple bought split three times within the next two years, leaving them with 24 shares. Mary and Larry, whose second name was withheld for privacy reasons, sent an email to Bezos in March, thanking him for turning Amazon into a "great" company. The Amazon CEO attached their email in his final annual letter to the shareholders. "Due to the exponential growth in value, we decided to split the stock between ourselves and both of our children, Ryan and Katy. This year Ryan is buying a house and would like to sell some shares," the couple wrote in their email read. "Those two shares have had a wonderful influence on our family. We all enjoyed watching Amazon value grow year after year and it is a story we love to tell others," they added.The Amazon CEO, who is set to step down this year as Amazon Web Services' (AWS) founder Andy Jassy Amazon takes his place, said he is approached with similar stories all the time. "I know people who’ve used their Amazon money for college, for emergencies, for houses, for vacations, to start their own business, for charity – and the list goes on," he said. "I’m proud of the wealth we’ve created for shareowners. It’s significant, and it improves their lives," he added.According to Bezos, Amazon has created $1.6 trillion of wealth for its shareowners. "My Amazon shares have made me wealthy. But more than 7/8ths of the shares, representing $1.4 trillion of wealth creation, are owned by others," he said in his letter.Giving details about how the company has grown, Jeff Bezos said it hired 500,000 employees last year, and now directly employs 1.3 million people around the world. "We have more than 200 million Prime members worldwide. More than 1.9 million small and medium-sized businesses sell in our store, and they make up close to 60% of our retail sales. Customers have connected more than 100 million smart home devices to Alexa," he said in his letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-jeff-bezos-letter-mention-of-a-couple-that-bought-2-shares-of-amazon-in-1997-101618735198024.html

Canadian health authorities, however, have continued to recommend the jab for those above 55 years of age.The case was reported on Saturday in the province of Alberta in an unidentified man in his 60s. he had recently received a dose of the AZ vaccine manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) under the brand Covishield. The man was “diagnosed, treated promptly and is now recovering”, Deena Hinshaw, Alberta’s chief medical officer of health, tweeted.Canadian health authorities continue to urge people to get vaccinated and have defended the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine. During the course of a media interaction following the announcement of the case, Hinshaw said, “I continue to recommend AstraZeneca for anyone who is 55 and older, and to recommend that all Albertans get vaccinated as soon as they are able.” She pointed out that it was only the second case in the country after more than 700,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine had been administered.The “global rate” of such clots “has been estimated at only one case in 100,000-250,000 doses,” she said, adding that in contrast, “those age 55 and older who get Covid-19 have a one in 200 chance of dying” and is also “at least 1,500 times more likely to be hospitalised due to Covid-19 than experiencing this disorder” from the vaccine.The case was confirmed by Health Canada. The agency tweeted, “Based on all the evidence available internationally to-date, Health Canada continues to consider that the benefits of the #AstraZeneca and Covishield vaccines to protest against Covid-19 outweigh the potential risks.”It said it is continuing to monitor these adverse actions. “The report of this case shows that Canada’s vaccine safety monitoring system works,” it noted.Hinshaw elaborated that with health authorities aware of this reaction, they could “watch for it and reduce the risk of serious harm or death even further”.Canada’s first case of this particular reaction to Covishield was reported on April 14 in a patient, a Quebec-based woman, who is also said to be recovering.Canada received 500,000 doses of Covishield on March 3, and the entire consignment has been distributed across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-reports-2nd-case-of-blood-clot-from-az-jab-patient-recovering-101618733426043.html

18-04-2021||World||Nobody’s going to refuse a vaccine: Ukraine scoops up Europe's unwanted Astrazeneca Covid-19 vaccine shots||As safety concerns prompt western European countries to limit the use of AstraZeneca Plc’s coronavirus shot, Ukraine is leading a charge from the continent’s east to scoop up unwanted doses.The government in Kyiv, which has struggled to secure vaccine supplies, says it’s been talking to the European Union about potential purchases for months. With Denmark banning the use of the Astra jab altogether this week, the Czech Republic, Latvia and Lithuania have joined the pursuit.Eastern Europe has been the global epicenter for Covid-19 deaths and infections in recent weeks -- leaving the region desperate for more vaccine doses. The inoculation program in Ukraine is among Europe’s slowest, making people there more inclined to look past worries over blood clots and accept the Astra jab.“Nobody’s going to refuse a vaccine,” Ukrainian Health Minister Maksym Stepanov said this week in an interview in his office. “The benefits from all approved vaccines far outweigh the risk of side effects.”While Ukraine has signed contracts for 32 million doses, less than a million shots have arrived so far -- from AstraZeneca and China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. With Astra deliveries delayed as infections soar in India, where the producer is located, Ukraine has vaccinated just 433,000 of its 42 million population.Russia’s Sputnik V jab, which is being used by EU member Hungary, has been rejected, with tensions between the governments in Kyiv and Moscow flaring again recently.The health situation, meanwhile, is becoming more urgent: Daily new cases hit a record of more than 20,000 this month.No offers have emerged from EU countries selling unwanted shots, according to Stepanov. “Every country cares exclusively for its own citizens to the exclusion of everyone else,” he said.There could be other problems. A March survey found that while almost half the population wants to be vaccinated, more than two-thirds would refuse the Astra jab -- for which less than 0.25% of Ukrainians have reported side effects. More than two-fifths of people don’t know how to register for vaccination.Stepanov says the shortage of doses -- not hesitancy about their safety -- is the main reason for the slow pace of inoculation. Ukraine is in talks to secure another 16 million vaccine doses this year and wants to administer them all by year-end -- stepping up the pace to 5 million-6 million doses a month by using open-air stadiums, he said.Speed will be vital as hospitals in big cities reach capacity and people bristle at prolonged lockdown measures. As of Thursday, 187,731 jabs had been given in April, though 117,000 doses produced by Pfizer Inc arrived the next day as part of the World Health Organization-led Covax initiative.“We’re waiting for the vaccines,” Stepanov said. “We’re fully prepared.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nobodys-going-to-refuse-a-vaccine-ukraine-scoops-up-europe-s-unwanted-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-shots-101618732489185.html

The problem was that the refugee part was working on the crisis that ended up on the border with young people," Biden said according to a White House pool report, as cited by The Hill."We couldn't do two things at once. But now we are going to increase the number," he continued.According to The Hill, the comment comes a day after the White House reversed course on a decision to keep the number of refugees allowed into the US at levels that were in place under the former President Donald Trump. The decision was made following 'blowback' from Democrats who wanted to see a higher cap.The President signed an order on Friday maintaining the 15,000 cap on refugee admissions for fiscal year 2021, a controversial number set by the previous Trump administration. It is also far below the cap of 62,500 that Biden wanted to put in place for 2021.Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (Democrat from New York), called on the president to "keep [his] promise" to "welcome immigrants.""Upholding the xenophobic and racist policies of the Trump admin, incl the historically low plummeted refugee cap, is flat out wrong," she tweeted.The Hill reported that Like Biden's comments on Saturday, Psaki said the initial decision was due to changes made by Trump and ORR's handling of the influx of unaccompanied migrant children at the borderWhite House Press Secretary Jen Psaki later said that a new, higher ceiling would be set on May 15."For the past few weeks, he has been consulting with his advisors to determine what number of refugees could realistically be admitted to the United States between now and October 1," Psaki said in part. "Given the decimated refugee admissions program we inherited, and burdens on the Office of Refugee Resettlement, his initial goal of 62,500 seems unlikely.ORR is the office within the Department of Health and Human Services that is responsible for housing the minors.The Hill citing The Wall Street Journal reported that it has already went through $1.3 billion of its budget handling the influx of migrants, which would likely make it hard to raise the refugee cap.Biden is aiming to increase the refugee cap to 125,000 in his first year in office and has requested a USD 4.3 billion budget for ORR for 2022 with that goal in mind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-can-t-do-two-things-at-once-biden-defends-not-immediately-raising-refugee-cap-101618727591321.html

The day is dedicated to the conservation and promotion of cultural heritage through various activities undertaken by the International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS). To mark World Heritage Day, various programmes and tours are organised by heritage sites. People can also take part in seminars or group discussions on heritage-related topics.HistoryIn 1982, ICOMOS suggested United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (Unesco) that April 18 should be celebrated as the International Day for Monuments and Sites. Unesco approved the proposal during the 22nd General Conference in 1983.According to ICOMOS, the “essential aspect is to mark this day so that it becomes not only a day to celebrate your National Heritage but also a day of International Solidarity in favour of strengthening and safeguarding Heritage worldwide.”ThemeThis year, Unesco has decided on “Complex Pasts: Diverse Futures” as the theme for World Heritage Day celebrations. "The conservation of cultural heritage requires careful examination of the past, and its practice demands provision for the future," the world body said on its website.SignificanceThe day is observed to raise awareness about the cultural heritage that we see around us. It is also aimed at promoting historical monuments and sites through which we can actually preserve the cultural integrity of a community as well. "Deterioration or disappearance of any item of the cultural or natural heritage constitutes a harmful impoverishment of the heritage of all the nations of the world," the World Heritage Convention (1972) stated. "Together with ICOMOS, the UNESCO World Heritage Centre supports inclusive and diverse points of view in heritage identification, conservation and transmission to future generations," it also said on its site.As the day is being observed amid the Covid-19 crisis, it has invited people to participate in the celebrations by visiting Unesco World Heritage sites virtually through the online exhibits on Google Arts & Culture.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-heritage-day-2021-theme-history-and-its-significance-101618726111428.html

Growth brings great opportunity.” He made the comment while participating in a webinar organised by the Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce (ICCC).Moe is the senior-most Canadian leader to have openly supported the reforms even as protests against the farm laws in India have been echoed across the country, with many residents of Indian origin, mainly those with roots in Punjab, opposing the changes envisaged in the new laws.Moe compared the situation in India after last year’s agricultural deregulation measures to that in his province after the Canadian Wheat Board was abolished in 2012.That board, somewhat resembling the Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee system in India, had a monopoly over similar goods in western Canada, including in Saskatchewan. A release issued by the ICCC based on the discussion said “reform fraught with initial uncertainty subsequently led to a revolutionary transformation of the agriculture sector in these provinces and especially in Saskatchewan, leading to a continuous and exponential rise in production and exports”.Moe found more parallels between India’s journey in 2021 and Saskatchewan’s experience in 2012. He said the reforms brought challenges, but the province’s farmers adapted quickly to those changes, innovated, and were “far better off with the new opportunities. Saskatchewan’s grain exports nearly touched $17 billion and are rising exponentially”. The previous system, he pointed out, had become “archaic and unworkable. It stifled growth, innovation and opportunity”.Also participating in the discussion was India’s high commissioner to Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, who said, “There is a broad consensus in India that in the agriculture sector, change is imperative. There is consensus on the direction and nature of the reforms. The conversation about reforms is informed by global experience.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-province-s-premier-backs-india-s-farm-laws-says-they-will-yield-results-101618724065516.html
18-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Australia PM Morrison says in no hurry to reopen borders||Australia is no hurry to reopen its international borders and risk the country's nearly coronavirus-free lifestyle, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Sunday.Australia closed its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents in March 2020 and has been permitting only limited international arrivals in recent months, mainly its citizens returning from abroad.The border closure, together with snap lockdowns, swift contact tracking and high community compliance with health measures, have made Australia one of the world's most successful countries in curbing the pandemic, limiting coronavirus cases to under 29,500 infections and 910 deaths."Australia is in no hurry to open those borders, I assure you," Morrison said at a televised briefing."I will not be putting at risk the way we are living in this country which is so different to the rest of the world today."For months now, except for some short snap lockdowns, Australians have been able to dine out, gather nearly freely and stop wearing face masks in most places.They exchanged their international forays for local trips, with government figures showing big annual increases in intra-state travel in the first months of 2021.From Monday, Australians and neighbouring New Zealanders will be able to travel between both countries without the need to apply for an exemption or spend time in mandatory quarantine.New Zealand has had only 2,239 confirmed coronavirus cases and 26 related deaths.Morrison flagged on Sunday that vaccinated Australians could be able travel overseas "for essential purposes" and return via home quarantine in the second half of the year, but that possibility is only in "planning stages".Australia recently abandoned a goal to vaccinate nearly all of its 26 million population by the end of 2021 following advice that people under the age of 50 take Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine rather than AstraZeneca's shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-aus-pm-morrison-says-in-no-hurry-to-reopen-borders-101618721085833.html

One Type 45 destroyer armed with anti-aircraft missiles and an anti-submarine Type 23 frigate will leave the Royal Navy's carrier task group in the Mediterranean and head through the Bosphorus into the Black Sea, according to the report.RAF F-35B Lightning stealth jets and Merlin submarine-hunting helicopters will stand ready on the task group's flag ship, the carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth, to support the warships in the Black Sea, the report added.Tensions between Moscow and Kyiv have been rising amid a build-up of Russian troops along the border and clashes in eastern Ukraine between the army and pro-Russian separatists.Officials at the UK Ministry of Defence were not immediately available for comment.A ministry spokesman told the newspaper that the UK government was working closely with Ukraine to monitor the situation and continued to call on Russia to de-escalate."The UK and our international allies are unwavering in our support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity", the newspaper quoted the spokesman as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ukrainerussia-tensions-rise-uk-to-send-warships-to-black-sea-in-may-report-101618720582506.html
18-04-2021||World||Covid-19's deep scars on world economy will be visible even after recovery||Just as some patients recovering from Covid-19 suffer long-lasting symptoms, it’s becoming clear that the same will be true for the global economy once this year’s V-shaped rebound fades.While $26 trillion worth of crisis support and the arrival of vaccines have fueled a faster recovery than many anticipated, the legacies of stunted education, the destruction of jobs, war-era levels of debt and widening inequalities between races, genders, generations and geographies will leave lasting scars, most of them in the poorest nations.“It’s very easy after a gruelling year or more to feel really relieved that things are back on track,” said Vellore Arthi of the University of California, Irvine, who has examined the long-term health and economic hit from past crises. “But a lot of the effects that we see historically are often for decades and are not easily addressed.”All told, the decline in gross domestic product last year was the biggest since the Great Depression. The International Labour Organization estimates it cost the equivalent of 255 million people full-time jobs. Researchers at the Pew Research Centre reckon the global middle class shrank for the first time since the 1990s.The costs will fall unevenly. A scorecard of 31 metrics across 162 nations devised by Oxford Economics Ltd. highlighted the Philippines, Peru, Colombia and Spain as the economies most vulnerable to long-term scarring. Australia, Japan, Norway, Germany and Switzerland were seen as best placed.“Getting back to the pre-Covid standard will take time,” said Carmen Reinhart, the World Bank’s chief economist. “The aftermath of Covid isn’t going to reverse for a lot of countries. Far from it.”Not all countries will be affected equally. The International Monetary Fund sees advanced economies less affected by the virus this year and beyond, with low-income countries and emerging markets suffering more — a contrast to 2009, when rich nations were hit harder. With U.S. GDP next year forecast to be even bigger than projected before Covid-19, propelled by trillions of dollars in stimulus, the IMF’s projections show little residual scarring from the pandemic for the world’s No. 1 economy.The World Bank warned in a January report of “a decade of global growth disappointments” unless corrective action is taken. It estimated global output was on course to be 5% lower by 2025 than its pre-pandemic trend and that the growth rate at which inflation ignites is set to drop below 2% in the next decade, having already declined to 2.5% in the 2000s from 3.3% in the prior decade.Experts, including Arthi, say there needn’t be a lost decade if the right policy steps are taken, especially in the areas of reskilling workers and putting a floor under those hit hardest by the crisis. One way out includes encouraging policies that create incentives for business to innovate and invest, particularly in climate change. Central banks and most governments are already signaling they will keep stimulus running hot.The right kind of policy mix could push the rebound towards a full recovery, according to Catherine Mann, chief economist at Citigroup Inc.“Innovation supports higher productivity growth, and new investment raises living standards,” she said. “Key too are strategies to keep and train workers to take advantage of the higher productivity opportunities.”After the VCountries that were quick to control the virus are sending warning flares about the uneven road ahead. After initially enjoying a V-shaped recovery, New Zealand’s economy contracted in the final three months of 2020 as the absence of foreign tourists left a hole that locals couldn’t fill. Now, the country that consistently topped Bloomberg’s Covid resiliency rankings faces the prospect of a double-dip recession.In China, where the pandemic has been under control for almost a year, retail spending has lagged the broader recovery.What Bloomberg Economics Says:“Focusing on headline GDP, with the U.S and China engines humming the world is set for a triumphant 'V' shape recovery. Beneath the surface, divergence between advanced and emerging markets, superstar firms and their smaller rivals, and high- and low-skill workers points to scars that will take longer to heal.”—Tom Orlik, chief economistHow consumer confidence and spending patterns are shaped by ongoing concerns regarding health and hiring could end up being one of the crisis’ most important economic legacies, just as the Great Depression of the 1930s led to greater thrift. That’s a risk even though many people racked up savings during the past year.“There’s genuine uncertainty over how much people’s behavior in terms of consumption patterns changes as a result of this crisis,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. “If people go back to eating in restaurants, doing leisure travel, working out in gyms then a lot of those industries will revive. But it’s also possible that people’s tastes just genuinely change, in which case there is going to be transitionally more unemployment and there’s no good government fix for that.”History shows that five years after country-specific recessions, long-term growth expectations were typically 1.5 percentage points lower than in those without recessions, according to the World Bank.Lasting ChangeThe crisis has accelerated the use of robots in both manufacturing and in the services industry as workers and customers need to be protected from the spread of disease. While that’s spurring hopes for a revival in productivity growth, millions of jobs will be threatened with a question mark over whether enough new ones will be created in the process.Over 100 million people in eight of the world’s largest economies may need to switch occupation by 2030, according to McKinsey & Co. Those most likely to suffer skill gaps are the less educated, women, ethnic minorities and the young.The longer people are out of work the more their skills atrophy in a process known as hysteresis.“A lot of those jobs are gone forever,” said Eric Robertsen, Standard Chartered Plc’s global head of research. “Low-wage job in marginal companies or marginal sectors are gone as the companies have gone bankrupt or the sectors have been hollowed out. A lot of the more-adaptive companies will have filled the void but with fewer workers.”Even where jobs aren’t lost, work patterns have shifted and it remains an open debate about how those changes will impact wage packets.Longer-term effects will also be evident in human capital after the pandemic locked out children and university students from classrooms for as much as a year in some countries.The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development calculated in September that even a loss equal to a third of a year for pupils affected by closures when the pandemic was declared could curb a country’s GDP over the remainder of the century. Students in grades 1-12 may see 3% lower income over their lifetimes, the OECD warned, with the poor or those from minority backgrounds hardest hit.How to finance a full recovery will be complicated by the extra $24 trillion in borrowing that the world took on in 2020, bringing total debt to a new high of $281 trillion, according to the Institute of International Finance.Even without a debt crisis, once interest rates start to rise both governments and companies will come under pressure, according to Mark Zandi, chief economist of Moody’s Analytics.“The global economy will get back to full employment after the pandemic much more quickly than it did after the financial crisis,” he said. “But once back to full employment the global economy will be stuck in the low gear that prevailed prior to the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19s-deep-scars-on-world-economy-will-be-visible-even-after-recovery-lockdown-curfew-india-china-us-middle-class-banking-sector-101618717490017.html
18-04-2021||World||Ant is not exploring way for Jack Ma to sell his stake, denies report||Ant Group denied a report that the Chinese finance-technology company is exploring ways for founder Jack Ma to sell his stake and give up control as a means to ease pressure from the country’s regulators.Reuters reported earlier that officials from the People’s Bank of China and the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission held talks with Ma and Ant separately between January and March, where the possibility of Ma’s exit was discussed. The report cited people familiar with the matter.The company hoped that Ma’s stake would be sold to existing shareholders in Ant or its e-commerce partner Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., Reuters said.Ant issued a statement to the news agency that said the divestment of Ma’s stake wasn’t considered. The company reiterated the denial in a tweet following the report, saying the “divestment of Mr. Ma’s stake in Ant Group has never been the subject of discussions with anyone.”The Chinese’ government has been squeezing Ma’s internet empire as part of an effort to imprint its authority indelibly on the country’s technology industry. In landmark announcements this month, it slapped a record $2.8 billion fine on Alibaba for abusing its market dominance, then ordered an overhaul of Ant.Ant will effectively be supervised more like a bank, a move with far-reaching implications for its growth and ability to press ahead with a landmark initial public offering that the government abruptly delayed late last year.The overhaul outlined by regulators and the company will see Ant transform itself into a financial holding company, with authorities directing the firm to open its payments app to competitors, increase oversight of how that business fuels it crucial consumer lending operations, and ramp up data protections. It will also need to cut the outstanding value of its money-market fund Yu’ebao.Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Francis Chan said in a report earlier this week he expects Ant’s valuation to drop below 700 billion yuan ($107 billion) from 2.1 trillion yuan in an earlier attempt to go public.“Ant Group’s prospects could wane further after China halts improper linking of Alipay payments with Ant’s other products,” he said. “New curbs on Yu’ebao also hurts its wealth business.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ant-is-not-exploring-way-for-jack-ma-to-sell-his-stake-denies-report-101618717272301.html

18-04-2021||World||George Bush steps into US migration debate in op-ed and book||Former president George W. Bush has stepped into the US debate on immigration, saying migrants are "a force for good" and arguing for a gradual process to allow undocumented immigrants to earn legal status.Bush, a past governor of Texas -- a border state heavily impacted by migration -- made his points in an op-ed article in the Washington Post previewing his new book "Out of Many, One: Portraits of America's Immigrants."The book, whose name comes from the nation's Latin motto "E Pluribus unum," features portraits of immigrants done by Bush himself, who self-deprecatingly says he knows his paintings "may not set the art world stirring."But he says that by sharing the portraits of immigrants, each with "a remarkable story," he hoped "to humanize the debate on immigration and reform."His pro-immigrant message comes as President Joe Biden, who had promised to ease Donald Trump's severe immigration crackdown, has struggled with an uncontrolled surge of migrants coming through Mexico.The immigrant portraits drawn by Bush range from those of the unknown -- like a young French man who became an American soldier and won the country's Medal of Honor -- to the much better-known stories of two migrants, Madeleine Albright and Henry Kissinger, who fled prewar Europe and rose to become US secretaries of state.Bush asks in his op-ed how it is that "in a country more generous to new arrivals than any other, immigration policy is the source of so much rancor and ill will."The short answer, he adds, brings "little credit to either party."While offering no specific policy prescriptions, the former president advocates several "good-faith" steps: a path to citizenship for those brought to the US as children; greater securing of the southern border; a modernized asylum system; and increased legal immigration to allow "talented people (to) bring their ideas and aspirations here."As for the millions of undocumented migrants living in the US, Bush says that a grant of amnesty would be "fundamentally unfair" to those trying to come legally, but he adds that "undocumented immigrants should be brought out of the shadows through a gradual process in which legal residency and citizenship must be earned."Applicants should have to pay a fine and back taxes, document their work history, demonstrate English proficiency and knowledge of US history and civics, and provide a clean background check.After all, he adds, their determination to come to the US "is an affirmation of our country and what we stand for."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-bush-in-op-ed-and-book-steps-into-us-migration-debate-101618705291272.html

"Would like to drop matter."At that point, the pilot was already out of contact. When he returned to Cuba, Martinez told his handler that "he had no opportunity to arrange an accident such as we had discussed."The plot came to light as Castro, the 89-year-old brother of late revolutionary leader Fidel Castro, prepares to leave Cuban politics by stepping down as head of the all-powerful Community Party of Cuba.Raul's departure ends a near six-decade family hold on power in Cuba that started in 1959.The reins will now pass to 60-year-old Miguel Diaz-Canel, who has served as Cuba's president since 2018."These documents remind us of a dark and sinister past in US operations against the Cuban revolution," National Security Archive analyst Peter Kornbluh told AFP."As the Castro era officially comes to an end, US policymakers have the opportunity to leave this historical baggage behind and engage Cuba's post-Castro future."Fidel Castro defied 11 American presidents and survived numerous assassination plots -- 638 according to Guinness World Records -- as well as a failed 1961 attempt by 1,400 anti-Castro Cubans, who were trained and financed by the CIA, to land at the Bay of Pigs in an attempt to overthrow the communist regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-planned-to-assassinate-raul-castro-in-1960-declassified-documents-101618705041880.html

In response, the US president told reporters that it is "totally unfair" and "totally inappropriate."Navalny, who has been complaining about severe back and leg pain, went on a hunger strike at the end of March, after being denied a visit by a doctor of his own choice. Olga Mikhailova, his lawyer, says the 44-year-old is suffering from two spinal hernias. He has refused the treatment offered by the prison authorities.According to the Russian Federal Penitentiary Service, Navalny's health has been assessed as stable and satisfactory by medical professionals and he has been receiving all necessary care.In January, Navalny returned to Moscow from Berlin after receiving medical treatment for his alleged poisoning. The 44-year-old was arrested on arrival and referred to a court, which in early February rescinded his suspended sentence in the 2014 Yves Rocher fraud case over multiple probation breaches and replaced it with a 3.5-year term behind bars. A Moscow city court reinstated the ruling but reduced the sentence to 2.5 years.Navalny has been found guilty of defrauding the Russian subsidiary of French cosmetics firm Yves Rocher of 26 million rubles ($340,500).Last week, Russian Foreign Ministry's spokeswoman, Maria Zakharova, said that the United States is making up "stories" about Navalny's detention conditions while the US itself continues to violate the rights of prisoners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-says-situation-with-russia-s-navalny-totally-unfair-101618700041782.html
18-04-2021||World||Czechs blame Russia for 2014 blast, expel embassy staff||The Czech government alleged Russia was involved in a deadly blast at a munitions site in 2014 and said it’s expelling 18 embassy staffers, signaling that the country is joining growing international pressure to rein in President Vladimir Putin.Prime Minister Andrej Babis’s unexpected announcement coincides with concern in the U.S. and Europe about Russia’s military buildup on the border with Ukraine, and hacking alleged by the U.S.Acting Foreign Minister Jan Hamacek likened the explosion, which killed two people at a private munitions warehouse, to the 2018 poisoning of former Russian agent Sergei Skripal in Salisbury, England.“I’m very saddened that the Czech-Russian relations are going to suffer such significant damage, but the Czech Republic must respond,” Hamacek said Saturday. The Czech government has notified the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and is seeking their support, he said.The latest rift signals that relations between the Czech Republic, a member of NATO and the EU, and Russia may be headed toward the lowest point since the end of communist rule.Czech authorities suspect Russia’s GRU intelligence service helped orchestrate the 2014 blast at Vrbetice, Babis said at a briefing. Hamacek said the Russian embassy staff whom he described as spies must leave the country within 48 hours.An employee who answered the switchboard at the Russian Embassy in Prague outside business hours declined to comment.Russian PassportsCzech police said Saturday they’re searching for two men who visited the country using Russian passports with the same names that U.K. police have said they believe to be aliases of GRU agents who poisoned Skripal four years later.The men used the identities of Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, as well as passports with other names, when they traveled within the Czech Republic for about a week in October 2014. They are wanted in connection with “serious criminal activity,” according to a police statement that didn’t elaborate.The latest accusations risk escalating tension between Prague and Moscow to the highest level since the former Soviet satellite overthrew communist rule more than three decades ago. Relations have since included diplomatic clashes, such as when the Czechs expelled two Russian diplomats last year for what Prague said was fabrication of information on an alleged poisoning plot against municipal officials.President Joe Biden’s administration this week imposed further sanctions on Russia, including limits on buying newly issued sovereign debt. On Wednesday, the Czech government offered to host an as yet unscheduled Biden-Putin summit.Russia’s alleged role in the explosion marks “an absolutely unprecedented violation of the sovereignty and security of the Czech Republic,” said Jana Cernochova, head of the defense committee of the lower chamber of parliament. “This cannot be tolerated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/czechs-blame-russia-for-2014-blast-expel-embassy-staff-101618698205890.html
18-04-2021||World||Joe Biden says first golf as President leaves course record intact||President Joe Biden spent Saturday afternoon on the first golf outing of his presidency, playing at the Wilmington Country Club near his Delaware home.Speaking to reporters after his round, Biden said “the course record is still intact.”The president golfed with White House counselor Steve Ricchetti and Ron Olivere, father of his late son Beau Biden’s widow Hallie, the White House said.Biden was ranked one of Washington’s best golfers a few years ago, sporting a single-digit handicap, but took a break during his 2020 campaign for the White House.Like his most recent predecessors, Biden’s an avid golfer. Donald Trump played hundreds of rounds at his own clubs in Florida, New Jersey and Virginia, while Barack Obama frequently played at courses on military bases in the Washington area and in Hawaii during Christmas vacations.Many other presidents, from William Howard Taft to George W. Bush, have also golfed in office.While he was vice president, Biden occasionally played with Obama, including a 2011 round with two Republicans, then-House Speaker John Boehner and John Kasich, then the governor of Ohio.Kasich turned the experience into a punchline during a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention.“Joe Biden told me that he’s a good golfer and I can tell you that’s not true, as well as all the other things that he says,” Kasich said.Biden has been reported to have memberships at Fieldstone Golf Club, which he lists as his home course, and Wilmington, a 36-hole facility that’s hosted several national amateur championships. Both are just a few miles from his home.The course, busy with people playing and practicing, was visible to reporters when Biden’s motorcade pulled up. His visit wasn’t announced in advance, and club members were seen filming the event on mobile phones.In 2014 Biden joked with then-Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny that being in presidential politics had affected his game. “I don’t know about you, but if you want to keep your handicap in golf, don’t run for president,” Biden said. “So I expect strokes when we play.”In 2011, Golf Digest ranked Biden the 29th best golfer in Washington, with a 6 handicap. Biden had a 6.7 handicap in the U.S. Golf Association’s GHIN database in 2018, when his most recent scores were posted.Biden, 78, fractured a foot in November while playing with Major, one of his two dogs, although by February his doctor said it had fully healed. He’s expected to return to Washington on Sunday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-says-first-golf-as-president-leaves-course-record-intact-101618692231531.html
18-04-2021||World||Iran offers upbeat assessment of progress in nuclear talks||A senior Iranian official offered a cautiously upbeat assessment of progress in talks aimed at bringing the United States back into world powers' 2015 deal with Tehran on its nuclear program, saying Saturday that a “new understanding” appears to be taking shape.Iran has been negotiating with the five powers that remain in the agreement -- France, Germany, Britain, Russia and China — in Vienna over the past two weeks. An American delegation also has been in Vienna, but not talking directly to Iran.Iran’s deputy foreign minister said the talks had entered a new phase, adding that Iran had proposed draft agreements that could be a basis for negotiations.“We think that the talks have reached a stage where parties are able to begin to work on a joint draft,” Abbas Araghchi told Iranian state television. “It seems that a new understanding is taking shape, and now there is agreement over final goals.””The path is better known, but it will not be easy path,” Araghchi added. “It does not mean that differences of views have come to the end.”The accord is aimed at preventing Iran from developing a nuclear weapon, something it says it doesn't want to do. It restricted Iran’s nuclear program in return for relief from U.S. and international sanctions. In 2018, then-President Donald Trump pulled the U.S. unilaterally out of the accord, opting for restored and additional American sanctions.Since then, Iran has steadily violated restrictions in the deal, like the amount of enriched uranium that it can stockpile and the purity to which it can be enriched. Tehran’s moves have been calculated to pressure the other participants to do more to offset crippling U.S. sanctions. President Joe Biden has said he wants to bring the U.S. back into the deal but that Iran must reverse its violations.Additional complications have arisen: last weekend, Iran’s Natanz nuclear facility was sabotaged. The attack was widely suspected of being carried out by Israel, which opposes the nuclear deal, though authorities there have not commented.Iran responded by announcing it would increase uranium enrichment to 60% purity, far higher than ever before, and install more advanced centrifuges at the Natanz facility. On Saturday, the International Atomic Energy Agency said it had verified that Iran had begun the production of uranium hexafluoride enriched up to 60% at Natanz.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei on Wednesday dismissed offers seen so far in Vienna as “not worth looking at.” Still, he said he had confidence in his negotiators, and Iran's Saturday readout seemed upbeat.Diplomats from the six countries participating told expert-level working groups on sanctions-lifting and nuclear issues “to continue their activities on Saturday afternoon, Sunday and next week” to make further progress, Russian representative Mikhail Ulyanov tweeted.Enrique Mora, the European Union official who chaired the talks, tweeted that “progress has been made in a far from easy task. We need now more detailed work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-offers-upbeat-assessment-of-progress-in-nuclear-talks-101618689099468.html
18-04-2021||World||India, Pakistan deny reports on ministers’ meeting in UAE||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi will be in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) over the weekend though both countries said on Saturday that no meeting was planned between the two leaders.Hours after Qureshi began a three-day visit to the UAE, MEA spokesperson Arindam Bagchi announced on Twitter that Jaishankar would visit Abu Dhabi on April 18 at the invitation of his UAE counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan.The announcement triggered speculation about a meeting between Jaishankar and Qureshi, especially in the wake of the acknowledgement by a senior Emirati diplomat of the UAE’s role in facilitating secret talks between India and Pakistan.A person familiar with developments, however, said Jaishankar’s visit is “purely bilateral” and his engagements are “only with UAE dignitaries”. “He will be discussing some pressing economic and community welfare issues related to Covid-19.”In Islamabad, Foreign Office spokesperson Zahid Hafeez Chaudhri said: “No such meeting is scheduled during foreign minister Shah Mahmood Qureshi’s ongoing visit to the UAE.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-pakistan-foreign-ministers-to-be-in-uae-both-sides-say-no-meeting-planned-101618679062294.html
18-04-2021||World||US, Japan pledge to build a free Indo-Pacific||The United States and Japan on Friday pledged to build a “free, open, accessible, diverse, and thriving Indo-Pacific” working along with allies and partners such as India and Australia of the four-nation Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad), which they said, “has never been stronger”.US President Joe Biden and Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga did not announce the first in-person summit of the fledgling grouping more popularly called the Quad, contrary to its likelihood raised in an official preview of their meeting.But, it was certainly not for the lack of seriousness about the grouping. “Together, we will continue to work with allies and partners, including with Australia and India through the Quad, which has never been stronger, to build the free, open, accessible, diverse, and thriving Indo-Pacific we all seek,” they said in a joint statement.The leaders personally pledged commitment to the Quad several times in their remarks at the joint briefing. “Earlier this year, we - together with India and Australia - launched the landmark Quad Vaccine Partnership to expand the manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines and assist countries throughout the region with vaccination efforts,” Biden said in his opening remarks at the joint news conference.India will manufacture 1 billion does of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022 under this initiative which is being funded by the US and Japan. Australia will pay for its distribution. In his opening remarks, Suga underlined the importance of Quad in a free and open Indo-Pacific by cooperating with “other countries and regions, including the Asean, (and fellow Quad members) Australia, and India”.China hit back at the show of alliance during talks between Biden and Suga.“It cannot be more ironic that such attempt of stoking division and building blocs against other countries is put under the banner of ‘free and open’,” the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said on Saturday.With inputs from Associated Press||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-japan-focus-on-free-and-accessible-indo-pacific-to-keep-china-at-bay-101618638019881.html
18-04-2021||World||Indian-Americans grieve victims from community||Four members of the local Sikh community were among eight killed in a mass shooting at a FedEx facility in Indianapolis in the US state of Indiana on Thursday night, prompting concerns among Indian-Americans and calls for an investigation into possible racial or ethnic hatred as a factor.The victims were identified by local authorities as Amarjeet Kaur Johal, 66; Jaswinder Kaur, 64; Amarjit Sekhon, 48; and Jaswinder Singh, 68.“I am heartbroken to confirm that my naniji (maternal grandmother), Amarjeet Kaur Johal, is among those killed in the senseless shooting at the FedEx facility in Indianapolis,” Komal Chouhan, a member of the local Sikh community said in a statement released by the Sikh Coalition, an advocacy group.There were more than 160 workers at the FedEx facility at the time of the shooting, according to local reports. Though no counts were available of Sikhs among them, anecdotal accounts pointed to a sizable presence.”I have several family members who work at the particular facility and are traumatised,” Chouhan said further, adding: “My nani, my family, and our families should not feel unsafe at work, at their place of worship, or anywhere. Enough is enough — our community has been through enough trauma.”US President Joe Biden echoed the frustration in remarks from the White House. “This has to end. It’s a national embarrassment. It is a national embarrassment what’s going on,” he said at a joint news conference he addressed with his first foreign guest after taking office, Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar said in a tweet: “Deeply shocked by the shooting incident at FedEx facility in Indianapolis. Victims include persons of Indian American Sikh community. Our Consulate (in Chicago)@IndiainChicago is in touch with the Mayor and local authorities in Indianapolis as well as the community leaders.” “Will render all possible assistance.” Biden unveiled a modest package of gun law reforms last week to stop the “epidemic” of gun violence. A legislation is before the congress for expanding background checking, but experts say it has no chance of being passed. And there is no movement towards banning military-style assault rifles that have been used most frequently in mass shootings in the US.The police identified 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole as the shooter in the FedEx incident. He was previously employed at the facility, the police said, adding that he was found dead with an apparent gunshot wound at the facility. No details were available of the motive behind the crime. The Associated Press reported citing officials that police were searching a home in Indianapolis related to the shooter and that they seized certain items as evidence. The death of members of the Sikh community came to light later as victims had not been officially identified till Friday evening. The Sikh Coalition was first to report it late afternoon, saying it was “deeply saddened to learn” that Sikh community members were among those killed. It followed up with an update saying four of them were Sikhs.The community was still not sure how many of their members were injured in the shooting. “I have sat with families from our community and so many others at the (local) Holiday Inn Express as they wait to hear the fates of their loved ones,” said community member Maninder Singh Walia, in the statement from Sikh Coalition. The Sikh community has been battling social, religious and racial bias and violence for years in the US. The first person killed in the 9/11 backlash in 2001 was a Sikh man in Arizona, mistaken for a turbaned West Asian. In 2012, six members of the community were gunned down by a white supremacist at a gurdwara in Oak Creek, Wisconsin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/sikh-community-in-shock-after-four-members-die-in-indianapolis-shooting-101618634901198.html
