It is one of the most sensitive nuclear activities carried out by Iran.Rouhani again underlined at the ceremony, which coincided with Iran's National Nuclear Technology Day, that Tehran's nuclear programme is solely for "peaceful" purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-starts-up-advanced-centrifuges-in-nuclear-deal-breach-101618078406623.html

Here’s what happened||Nasa has rescheduled the first flight attempt of the Ingenuity helicopter on Mars to no earlier than April 14 based on data that arrived late Friday night. Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) on Saturday said that the decision to postpone the flight attempt was taken after an issue was flagged during a high-speed test of the blades. The rotorcraft weighing 1.8 kilograms was earlier expected to take off this weekend and hover 10 feet above the surface for up to 30 seconds.Nasa JPL said in a statement that the command sequence controlling the full-speed test ended early due to a “watchdog” timer expiration. The watchdog timer oversees the command sequence and alerts the system about any potential issues. The timer helps Ingenuity stay safe by not proceeding if an issue is encountered.The watchdog timer expiration occurred when the command sequence was trying to transition the flight computer from ‘Pre-Flight’ to ‘Flight’ mode. Nasa stressed that the Ingenuity helicopter, which had travelled to Mars being attached on the Perseverance rover’s belly, is safe and healthy and communicated its full telemetry set to Earth.“The helicopter team is reviewing telemetry to diagnose and understand the issue. Following that, they will reschedule the full-speed test,” said Nasa.After dropping from Perseverance belly, Ingenuity survived the first night on its own and successfully tested the blades at a lower speed. It is required to spin up rotor blades at planned flight speed for the first time on Mars while still on the surface. If all issues get resolved, it will lift off for the first time in the thin Martian atmosphere no earlier than April 14.Ingenuity’s guidance, navigation, and control systems will do the piloting for autonomous flight attempt, mostly because radio signals will take 15 minutes and 27 seconds to bridge the 278-million-kilometre gap between Mars and Earth. The live coverage confirming Ingenuity’s first flight will be available on Nasa’s website, app, and television. It will also be live-streamed on multiple social media platforms of the US space agency, including the JPL YouTube and Facebook channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-first-flight-on-mars-delayed-here-s-what-happened-101618076239444.html

The US said it was an “innocent passage through the … in the ‘vicinity’ of the Republic of the Maldives and that the US will continue to maintain the right, indeed the responsibility to fly, sail and operate in accordance with international law”.Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters on Friday that the USS John Paul Jones, a Navy destroyer, “asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Republic of the Maldives by conducting innocent passage through its territorial sea, in normal operations with its exclusive economic zone, without requesting prior permission and that’s consistent with international law”. “Again, we will continue to maintain the right, indeed the responsibility to fly, sail and operate in accordance with international law,” he added.Pressed further, the spokesperson said, “We do it all around the world. It’s not just something that - you know, we - we tend to talk about it in - in regard to China and their excessive maritime claims but it isn’t all just about China, it’s something we do all around the world.”US Navy’s 7th Fleet had said that on Wednesday, USS John Paul Jones “asserted navigational rights and freedoms” around 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law, as required by India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defends-freedom-of-navigation-ops-in-india-s-eez-101618072225616.html

A previous eruption in 1902 killed some 1,600 people.“The first bang is not necessarily the biggest bang this volcano will give,” Richard Robertson, a geologist with the University of the West Indies’ Seismic Research Center, said during a news conference.Conditions for many worsened overnight as heavy ash covered homes, cars and streets and even the runway of the airport at the opposite end of the roughly 20-mile (30-kilometer) long island from the volcano’s crater. People left footprints in the ash as they trudged away from their homes.Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves told NBC Radio, a local station, that officials were trying to figure out how to remove the ash.“It's difficult to breath,” Gonsalves said, adding that while the volcano's venting has diminished, a big plume of ash and smoke remained. “What goes up, must come down.”He asked people to remain calm, have patience and keep protecting themselves from the coronavirus as he celebrated that no deaths or injuries were reported after the eruption in the northern tip of St. Vincent, part of an island chain that includes the Grenadines and is home to more than 100,000 people.“Agriculture will be badly affected, and we may have some loss of animals, and we will have to do repairs to houses, but if we have life, and we have strength, we will build it back better, stronger, together,” he said.Gonsalves has said that depending on the damage caused by the explosion, it could take up to four months for life to return to normal. Some 3,200 people were staying in 78 government shelters while four empty cruise ships floated nearby, waiting to take other evacuees to nearby islands. Those staying in shelters were tested for COVID-19, and anyone testing positive would be taken to an isolation center.The first explosion occurred Friday morning, a day after the government ordered mandatory evacuations based on warnings from scientists who noted a type of seismic activity before dawn on Thursday that meant magma was on the move close to the surface.An ash column burst more than 33,000 feet (7 kilometers) into the sky, with lightning crackling through the still-towering cloud late Friday.The ash forced the cancellation of several flights and poor visibility limited evacuations in some areas. Officials warned that Barbados, St. Lucia and Grenada could see light ashfall as the 4,003-foot (1,220-meter) volcano continued to rumble. The majority of ash was expected to head northeast into the Atlantic Ocean.La Soufriere previously had an effusive eruption in December, prompting experts from around the region to fly in and analyze the formation of a new volcanic dome and changes to its crater lake, among other things.The eastern Caribbean has 19 live volcanoes, including two underwater near the island of Grenada. One of those, Kick ’Em Jenny, has been active in recent years. But the most active volcano of all is Soufriere Hills in Montserrat. It has erupted continuously since 1995, razing the capital of Plymouth and killing at least 19 people in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/st-vincent-awaits-new-volcanic-explosions-as-help-arrives-101618068619363.html

"Our project is a realistic one because the situation is urgent."On Friday, German companies presented a separate multi-billion-dollar plan to rebuild Beirut's port and neighbouring districts, confirming a previous report by Reuters.Dakkak said the German initiative was more focused on longer-term real-estate development but CMA CGM would be willing to contribute to the port part of that project if invited to.CMA CGM is controlled by the French-Lebanese Saade family and the group joined French President Emmanuel Macron in relief efforts in Beirut following the explosion last summer.The French government is not part of CMA CGM's reconstruction plan, Dakkak said, adding French companies and financial institutions had shown interest, and that the Lebanese state would have a role through a public-private partnership.As well as devastating the bulk section of Beirut port, last year's blast destroyed equipment in the container terminal. This has doubled waiting time for vessels, adding to longstanding inefficiencies at the port, according to Dakkak.CMA CGM is the leading shipping operator at Beirut port, accounting for 60% of volumes, and remains a candidate in partnership with Swiss-based MSC for the concession to run the container terminal, Dakkak said.It has been told a tender process to run the container terminal, held up by the political crisis, will be relaunched in two weeks, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/let-us-rebuild-beirut-s-port-in-less-than-three-years-says-french-company-101618068108971.html
10-04-2021||World||China's graft watchdog rebukes 'mukbang' binge-eating, drinking videos||China's corruption watchdog has called on online video-sharing platforms to take action against "mukbang" shows, in which people livestream themselves eating - or drinking - excessively, saying such content encourages food waste.Mukbang videos originated in South Korea and are increasingly popular in China, but they have faced sharp criticism from state media and regulatory crackdowns - especially since President Xi Jinping launched a campaign to curb food wastage last year.The country's graft watchdog, the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI), said video-hosting platforms should strengthen their supervision, stop and remove inappropriate broadcasts and block the accounts of offenders.Punishments for people uploading such content should also be toughened, the commission said in an article posted on its website on Saturday, noting that binge drinking videos have become more popular following a clampdown on heavy eating streams."Behaviour such as 'heavy drinking videos' not only damages the physical health of the presenters and causes food waste, but also promotes an ugly mentality and seriously harms the healthy ecology of the industry," it said.The watchdog said some people uploading mukbang videos were earning as much as 3,000 yuan ($458) in pledges by fans.China cracked down on "inappropriate" content on the video-sharing website Kuaishou in 2018, suspending the account of one user known as Hebei Pangzai, who regularly shared videos of himself drinking copious amounts of beer to his 400,000 followers. He now shares videos on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-graft-watchdog-rebukes-mukbang-binge-eating-drinking-videos-101618066125643.html
10-04-2021||World||Explained: Why is Russia massing troops in Donbas region of eastern Ukraine?||Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy is set to hold talks on Saturday with his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan amid rising tension with Russia over the conflict in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. Last week, Ukrainian commander-in-chief Ruslan Khomchak accused Moscow of pursuing an “aggressive policy” towards Kyiv by amassing troops near the contested region.The continued military build-up in the area around eastern Ukraine has triggered a strong response from the West as the United States has warned of “consequences”. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said at a daily briefing that the US is in close consultation with its allies in the region over Russia’s troop movements. “Of the actions that have already been taken, that we’ve had an ongoing review about we’ve been clear, There will be consequences, some unseen and some seen. We will hope to have more about those soon,” Psaki said on Friday.During a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel demanded a reduction in troops at the Ukrainian border. "One subject of their conversation was, among others, the increased Russian military presence near eastern Ukraine. The chancellor called for a reduction of these troop reinforcements to de-escalate tensions," the German government said in a statement.Also Read | Any attempt to start a new war in Donbas could destroy Ukraine: RussiaHowever, Moscow accused Kyiv of provocative actions which “has recently purposefully escalated the situation on the line of contact”. Kremlin said in a statement that Putin stressed the need for strict implementation of previously reached agreements to “legally formalise the special status of Donbas”.Ukraine, a country geographically divided between Europe and Russia, has pro-Russia and pro-West people. The fourth Ukrainian president, Viktor Yanukovych, was pro-Russia and backed away from EU Association Agreement in November 2013 to prevent the country from turning to the West. Yanukovych’s U-turn over signing the agreement triggered protests and he had to flee to Russia.The tensions later spread to Crimea and the territory was annexed by Russia following a controversial referendum, which Crimean Tatars, an East European Turkic ethnic group, and Ukrainians had objected to. The long-running conflict has claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2014. Pro-Russian separatists also claim control over the Donbas region, which includes Donetsk and Luhansk provinces.Minsk Agreements were signed between the pro-Russian separatists and the Kyiv administration to stop the armed conflict. The agreements called for a ceasefire in the region as well as prisoner exchange while allowing the Ukrainian government to make a constitutional amendment that would provide for special status to Donbas. But the implementation of those agreements has been hampered by multiple ceasefire violations for which the two sides have traded blames.Earlier this week, Zelensky urged Nato, an intergovernmental military alliance between Western powers, to speed up his country’s membership. In a phone call with NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg, the Ukrainian president said that it was the only way to end fighting with pro-Russia separatists and end the war in Donbas. Russia sees Ukraine’s entry into Nato as a threat and fears have been mounting of a major escalation in the conflict areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-why-is-russia-massing-troops-in-donbas-region-of-eastern-ukraine-101618065586026.html

The region accounts for 23% of the world's population of 7.59 billion people.India, the country with the third-highest coronavirus total, accounts for over 84% of South Asia's cases and deaths.The world's second-most populous country reported 145,384 new cases on Saturday, the fastest climb in the world and the country's fifth record this week, as well as 794 deaths. The government blames the current spike on crowding and a reluctance to wear masks.India is accounting for one in every six reported infections in its current surge.While ramping up its vaccination drive, inoculating about 4 million people a day, several states said they were rationing doses as the federal government was not refilling stocks in time.India's western neighbour Pakistan, the second-hardest hit in the region, is in its third wave, recording more than 700,000 cases and 15,000 related deaths.It has seen a sharp rise in cases in the past 10 days. Officials say there are now more people in intensive care than at any other point during the pandemic.Bangladesh, India's eastern neighbour, is reporting about 7,000 cases a day, totalling some 678,937 cases.Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has given Bangladesh 1.2 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine.At least 94.1 million people had received their first Covid-19 vaccine dose in southern Asia by Friday, according to figures from Our World in Data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-pandemic-south-asia-surpasses-grim-milestone-of-15-million-cases-101618063807185.html
10-04-2021||World||Strong earthquake kills 6 people in Java, Indonesia; no tsunami warning||A strong earthquake killed at least six people and damaged buildings on Indonesia's main island of Java and shook the tourist hotspot of Bali, officials said Saturday. No tsunami warnings were posted.The US Geological Survey said the magnitude 6.0 quake struck off the island's southern coast at 2:00 p.m. local time (0700 GMT). It was centered 45 kilometres south of Sumberpucung town of Malang District in East Java province, at a depth of 82 kilometres (51 miles).Rahmat Triyono, the head of Indonesia's earthquake and tsunami center, said in a statement the undersea earthquake did not have the potential to cause a tsunami. Still, he urged people to stay away from slopes of soil or rocks that have the potential for landslides.Falling rocks killed a woman on a motorcycle and badly injured her husband in East Java's Lumajang district, said Raditya Jati, spokesperson for the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.He said dozens of homes were damaged across the district, and rescuers had retrieved two bodies from the rubble of collapsed homes in the district's Kali Uling village. Two people were also confirmed killed in an area bordering Lumajang and Malang districts, while one person found dead under rubble in Malang.Television reports showed people running in panic from malls and buildings in several cities in East Java province.Indonesia's search and rescue agency released videos and photos of damaged houses and buildings, including a ceiling at a hospital in Blitar, a city neighboring Malang. Authorities were still collecting information about the full scale of casualties and damage in the affected areas.It was the second deadly disaster to hit Indonesia this week. On Sunday, a downpour triggered by Tropical Cyclone Seroja killed at least 165 people and damaged thousands of houses. Some were buried in either mudslides or solidified lava from a volcanic eruption in November, while others were swept away by flash flooding.Indonesia, a vast archipelago of 270 million people, is frequently struck by earthquakes, volcanic eruptions and tsunamis because of its location on the “Ring of Fire,” an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.In January, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake killed at least 105 people and injured nearly 6,500, while more than 92,000 displaced, after striking Mamuju and Majene districts in West Sulawesi province.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/strong-earthquake-kills-6-people-in-java-indonesia-no-tsunami-warning-issued-101618061596168.html
10-04-2021||World||With artillery guns and flowers, Britain salutes Prince Philip||Gun salutes were fired across Britain on Saturday to mark the death of Prince Philip as tributes flooded in for a man who was a pillar of strength for Queen Elizabeth during her record-breaking reign.Members of the public laid flowers outside royal residences, paying their respects to the 99-year-old prince who spent more than seven decades at his wife's side.On its official Twitter feed, the royal family put up a tribute paid by the queen to her husband on their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997."He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years, and I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know," she said.Members of the family have been visiting the grieving monarch at Windsor Castle where Philip died on Friday."The queen has been amazing," said a tearful Sophie, the Countess of Wessex, as she left with her husband Prince Edward, the youngest son of Elizabeth and Philip.The armed forces marked Philip's passing at noon (1100 GMT) with a Death Gun Salute. Artillery units in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and Gibraltar, and some navy warships, fired their guns.Buckingham Palace is expected to announce details of the funeral later on Saturday.It is likely to be a small, private affair, stripped of the grandeur of traditional royal occasions by Covid-19 restrictions and by the prince's own dislike of people making a fuss.Despite a request from the royal family for the public to obey pandemic social distancing rules and avoid visits to its residences, people laid cards and bouquets outside Windsor Castle and Buckingham Palace."It's not something I've ever done before," said Joanna Reesby, 60, who came to pay her respects at Buckingham Palace. "I brought yellow roses for friendship because I think that's what he exhibited to everyone who came into his world."'BELOVED HUSBAND'The queen, 94, announced the death of "her beloved husband", and she has lost her closest confidante, the one person she could trust and who was free to speak his mind to her. They had been married for 73 years and he would have turned 100 in June.Messages of condolence have poured in from world leaders.The Duke of Edinburgh, as Philip was officially known, was credited with helping to modernise the institution and supporting his wife as the monarchy faced repeated crises during her reign, which has lasted 69 years so far.The tenor bell at London's Westminster Abbey tolled 99 times, a traditional marking of the death of a royal family member.Flags at Buckingham Palace and at government buildings across Britain were lowered to half-mast and billboard operators replaced adverts with a photo and tribute to the prince.The BBC aired a special programme with interviews with the queen and Philip's children, including heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles.Philip "probably wanted to be remembered as an individual in his own right", said Charles."He didn't suffer fools gladly, so if you said anything that was in any way ambiguous, he would say: 'Make up your mind!' Perhaps it made one choose one's words carefully," Charles said.A Greek prince, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947 and broke the news of her father's death five years later while they were in Kenya, meaning that she was queen at the age of 25.He went on to play a key role helping the monarchy adapt to a changing world in the post-World War Two period, finally stepping back from public duties in 2017."I think he'll be remembered as a moderniser in many ways, as someone who both inside the palace and outside the palace was a force for change," Simon Lewis, the queen’s communications secretary from 1998 to 2001, told Reuters.He said Philip's loss would be a terrible blow to the queen."I think they were the most extraordinary partnership and that's going to be a huge, huge, gap," Lewis said. "I think he always saw himself partly as the eyes and the ears of the queen - that's gone forever."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-artillery-guns-and-flowers-britain-salutes-prince-philip-101618058550397.html
10-04-2021||World||UK's Prince Philip honoured with 41-gun salutes after death||Gun salutes across the U.K., in Commonwealth countries and at sea are marking the death of Britain’s Prince Philip on Saturday as military leaders honor the former naval officer and husband of Queen Elizabeth II.Batteries of cannons in London, Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and other cities fired 41 rounds at one-minute intervals starting at midday. The Australian Defense Force offered its salute at 5 p.m. local time outside Parliament House in Canberra, and New Zealand planned to give an artillery tribute on Sunday.“His Royal Highness leaves us with a legacy of indomitable spirit, steadfastness and an unshakeable sense of duty,’’ said General Nick Carter, chief of the U.K. Defense Staff. “From all of us who serve today and who have served, thank you.”Also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, Philip served in the Royal Navy during World War II and once had a promising military career. He joined the Royal Navy as a cadet in 1939 and won mentions during the war for his service aboard the battleship HMS Valiant at Cape Matapan, on Greece’s Peloponnesian peninsula. He rose to the rank of commander before he retired from active duty.Two years after the war ended, Philip married the future queen at Westminster Abbey when she was 21 and he was 26. His naval career came to an abrupt end when King George VI died in 1952 and Elizabeth became queen.At the queen’s coronation in 1953, Philip swore to be his wife’s “liege man of life and limb” and settled into a life supporting the monarch. The couple had four children — Charles, the heir to the throne, Anne, Andrew and Edward.Members of the public left flowers outside Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle on Saturday, ignoring appeals from authorities and the royal family to refrain from gathering because of the Covid-19 pandemic.“Oh, I think everyone’s in shock,” Maureen Field, a 67-year-old Staines resident, said. “ I think everyone would like to pay their respects. Because of the virus, a lot of people have to stay away. He didn’t want a big funeral. He wanted a very private time with his family to say their goodbyes. So, we’ve all got to respect that.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-prince-philip-honoured-with-41-gun-salutes-after-death-101618057176526.html
10-04-2021||World||New York City's next mayor could be decided in the Black church||The race to become New York City’s next mayor is playing out in the hallowed halls of Black churches.Long a dominating force in New York politics, Black churches have taken on even more importance during a pandemic that shuttered businesses and curtailed large gatherings. With many church services still held in-person and traditional campaign events rendered unthinkable, candidates are looking to weekly rites to connect with one of the most important voting blocs in the city before the June 22 Democratic primary.Black New Yorkers made up nearly a quarter of the city’s potential voters, according to Census Bureau data. While they don’t hold monolithic views, in New York they are more politically engaged than other demographics and lean Democratic in a city where Democrats already outnumber Republicans seven-to-one.Now, as the city focuses its massive vaccination program on houses of worship to reach the Black and minority residents who have been hardest-hit by Covid-19, the role of the church carries even more sway.“The Black church for generations has been the cornerstone and the backbone of the Black community,” said Laurie Cumbo, City Council majority leader and part of the body’s Black, Latino and Asian Caucus. “Because of that the Black church has been an instrumental platform in terms of political dynamics and political leadership.”Personal ConnectionOn a recent Sunday, New York City mayoral hopeful Ray McGuire made his way to Mount Olivet Baptist Church. Located in a Queens neighborhood that is 65% Black, Mount Olivet was buzzing with energy as children raced in between pews and congregants made their way to their seats after getting their temperatures checked at the door.For months, the pandemic had trapped McGuire on endless Zoom calls to preach his vision for the city. But as the former investment banker walked into the church, the tightness in his shoulders loosened. The frustrations of trying to break through a screen eased. Finally he could greet congregants face-to-face. Shake hands with the pastor. Make jokes. When a staffer asked if he felt comfortable in the pews, he recalled his poor Ohio childhood. “I grew up in the church,” he said “The church is my home.”It’s not just McGuire. Nearly every mayoral candidate is spending Sundays visiting Black churches, working with clergy on vaccine drives, and volunteering at church food pantries.“To be able to connect with people around these shared values and ideas and in this communal community space has been a very powerful and positive part of the campaign,” Dianne Morales, a Brooklyn native and former public school teacher running for mayor. “As someone who’s not religious at all, it’s been inspiring to enter into those spaces and find alignment and resonance in the message.”Civil rights lawyer Maya Wiley, who would become the city’s first female mayor, said she hired a staffer specifically to work with religious institutions. She regularly attends Sunday church and called religious institutions “key partners” in the city’s economic revival.Former presidential candidate Andrew Yang, who also tasked a top aide with religious outreach, has worshiped at the House of Justice alongside Reverend Al Sharpton and plans to visit several houses of worship throughout his campaign, a campaign spokesperson said.Yang was the first choice for 16% of likely Democratic voters, but only 13% of Black respondents in a March 24 poll by Fontas Advisors and Core Decision Analytics. By contrast, 19% of Black voters named Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams as their first choice, compared to 10% among all those surveyed. Wiley is ranked third overall, as well as with Black voters. However, pollster George Fontas cautioned that early polls, when broken out by demographics, remain inconclusive because half of those surveyed remain undecided. Black VotersBlack churches have played an outsize role in New York politics dating back to the 1940’s, when the city passed some of the nation’s first civil rights laws. Pastors like Harlem’s Adam Clayton Powell Jr. rose to national prominence and Martin Luther King Jr. famously condemned the Vietnam War in a 1967 speech at Manhattan’s Riverside Church. More recently, Mayor Bill de Blasio garnered 96% of votes cast by Black New Yorkers when he first ran for mayor in 2013, which propelled him to victory. “Black voters delivered a win for de Blasio,” said Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University.Nationally, Black voters came out in droves during the November presidential elections and January’s runoff election in Georgia, which thrust Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff to office and allowed Democrats to take the Senate. Roughly 115,000 runoff voters hadn’t cast a general election ballot and 40% of them were Black, according to Democratic voter-data firm TargetSmart. In New York City, nearly a third of Black workers belong to a labor union, according to a CUNY School of Labor and Urban Studies report. That’s the highest rate among all demographics in a city where unions dominate local elections and membership is double the national average.More than 80% of Black voters lean Democrat, according to a February study by the Pew Research Center. Black Protestants and Catholics are more politically engaged than unaffiliated peers and a quarter of Black Americans said houses of worship should offer sermons on political topics, Pew found.“The person that campaigns in our communities and has a solid plan to address our issues will win,” said Cheryl Watts, a retired correction officer who’s also a member of the Mount Pisgah Baptist Church in Brooklyn and a leader of Community Voices Heard, a New York advocacy group.Pastor NetworkReverend Kevin Miller, the pastor at Carter Community African Methodist Episcopal Church in Jamaica, Queens, said visiting one Black church can help candidates tap a larger network.“It’s not a case of talking to one particular congregation — you’re really talking to a collaboration of Black churches in the community,” said Miller, a member of the clergy engagement team for nonprofit Faith in New York. “Pastors are in communication with one another, we’re in alliances.”He said his members are looking for candidates to address communities of color with specific plans for issues like rent relief, immigration, pandemic recovery and education. “These candidates need to answer those questions,” Miller said. “People here have lost their jobs and are struggling. The stimulus checks are nice and wonderful but they can only go so far.” One major topic is criminal justice reform, which draws support from nearly 90% of Black adults, according to Pew. Candidates have promised to overhaul the city’s beleaguered police department and curtail the force’s budget but most have stopped short of calls to wholeheartedly defund the police — a rallying cry for activists during last summer’s Black Lives Matter protests.Adams, a former high-ranking police officer, has pledged to recruit more officers from communities of color and publicize the list of officers being monitored by the NYPD after violent incidents. He recently told congregants at Staten Island’s St. Philip’s Baptist Church how NYPD officers arrested and beat him and his brother as teens, an experience that shaped his views of police reform.“I have gone through some stuff,” he said from the church pulpit. “It’s time for us to have a mayor that has gone through some stuff so he can help people going through some stuff.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-city-s-next-mayor-could-be-decided-in-the-black-church-101618056560568.html
10-04-2021||World||Too much? BBC gets complaints over Prince Philip coverage||The U.K.’s national broadcaster switched instantly into mourning mode when Prince Philip’s death was announced Friday.The BBC canceled its regular programming and aired special coverage hosted by black-clad news anchors throughout the day. Popular prime-time shows such as the cooking contest “MasterChef” were supplanted, and the network’s music radio stations played instrumentals and somber tunes.Some Britons saw the BBC’s actions as a fitting mark of respect. For others, it was a bit much.The broadcaster received so many complaints alleging its reporting was excessive that it set up a special website page for viewers to register objections if they felt there was “too much TV coverage of the death of HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh.” It didn’t disclose how many people had complained by Saturday.Simon McCoy, a long-time BBC news presenter who recently left the network, suggested the wall-to-wall coverage was inordinate.“BBC1 and BBC2 showing the same thing. And presumably the News Channel, too. Why? I know this is a huge event. But surely the public deserve a choice of programming?” McCoy said on Twitter.The publicly funded BBC often finds itself under fire from all sides for its treatment of major national events. When the Queen Mother Elizabeth died in 2002, the broadcaster received criticism because the announcer who delivered the news did not wear a black tie.Britain’s other TV stations also gave extensive coverage to Philip’s death at age 99 and after 73 years of marriage to Queen Elizabeth II. Commercial network ITV aired news coverage and tribute programs all day Friday in place of scheduled programming.The BBC is under unique pressure, though, because it is taxpayer-funded. Scrutiny and questions about its role have grown in recent years as commercial rivals and streaming services give audiences more choice.The BBC has often irked governments with its coverage of their failings and scandals. Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s Conservative administration has been especially rankled, detecting a liberal bias in the broadcaster’s coverage of issues such as Brexit.For a time, the government refused to allow Cabinet ministers to appear on major BBC news programs, and it mulled the idea of scrapping the 159 pound ($218) a year license fee that households pay to fund the broadcaster.BBC Director-General Tim Davie has acknowledged the organization must evolve with changing times, but says it remains essential to British society.“We have a different purpose” than broadcasters such as Netflix, Davie told U.K. lawmakers last month. “I’m not running a business for profit. I’m running...an organization for purpose.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/too-much-bbc-gets-complaints-over-prince-philip-coverage-101618056556554.html

Businesses, schools, theatres and sports facilities have been forced to shut and gatherings are banned during the holy fasting month of Ramadan that begins on Wednesday. Iran’s coronavirus cases have surpassed 2 million with a new daily average of over 20,000 infections over the past week, according to the health ministry. It has reported more than 64,000 fatalities. “Unfortunately, today we have entered a fourth wave,” President Hassan Rouhani said in televised remarks. He blamed the surge foremost on the variant that first emerged in the UK which spread to Iran earlier this year from neighbouring Iraq.Other factors included widespread travel, weddings, and celebrations during the Iranian New Year holidays that began on March 20, he said.The UK variant is now predominant in the country, and 257 cities and towns are in red alert, Raisi said.Iran has been the epicentre of the pandemic in the Middle East. In February, it closed several crossing points with Iraq in an effort to stem the spread of the UK variant.The country's vaccination drive has also been slow going.Tehran says it has received more than 400,000 of 2 million Sputnik V vaccines on order from Russia, and that it is awaiting delivery of 4.2 million AstraZeneca shots.It has also received 250,000 doses of China’s Sinopharm vaccine and part of an order of 500,000 doses of India’s COVAXIN.With a population of 83 million, Iran had hoped to secure over 2 million vaccines by March 20 to vaccinate mainly healthcare workers. It is developing at least four local vaccine candidates, one in cooperation with Cuba, which are expected to reach production in a few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-orders-10-day-shutdown-amid-4th-wave-of-covid-19-pandemic-101618053739249.html

Schedule and what to expect||Nasa’s Ingenuity helicopter is ready for its first flight on Mars this weekend after completing almost all the important milestones before the historic liftoff. After dropping off from the belly of the Perseverance rover, the Ingenuity helicopter unlocked its blades and conducted a slow spin test of its blades on Thursday.Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which built and manages operations of the Perseverance rover, released a GIF image of the slow spin test, indicating that Ingenuity is well on its way to attempt the first powered, controlled flight on another planet. But unlike the landing of Perseverance on Mars, we won’t know right away if the flight was successful.The rotorcraft weighing 1.8 kilograms is expected to take off from its “airfield” at around 10:54pm ET on April 11 (8:24am IST on April 12) and hover 10 feet above the surface for up to 30 seconds.Ingenuity’s guidance, navigation, and control systems will do the piloting for autonomous flight attempt, mostly because radio signals will take 15 minutes and 27 seconds to bridge the 278-million-kilometre gap between Mars and Earth.The first data from the first flight attempt is expected to arrive at Nasa’s JPL in Southern California at around 4:15am ET on April 12 (1:45pm IST on April 12).The Martian atmosphere is 99 per cent less dense than Earth's, which makes it difficult to achieve enough lift. Successful flights of Ingenuity could provide an ambitious aerial dimension to future Mars exploration.“We do tech demos like this to push the envelope of our experience and provide something on which the next missions and the next generation can build,” Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for science at Nasa headquarters, said in a statement.“Just as Ingenuity was inspired by the Wright brothers, future explorers will take off using both the data and inspiration from this mission,” he added.Live coverage confirming Ingenuity’s first flight is targeted to begin around 3:30am ET, April 12, on Nasa’s website, app, and television. It will also be live-streamed on multiple social media platforms of the US space agency, including the JPL YouTube and Facebook channels.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-ready-to-fly-on-mars-schedule-and-what-to-expect-101618050733180.html
10-04-2021||World||China comes down hard on Alibaba group, fines $2.78bn||Chinese regulators have hit top e-commerce giant Alibaba with a record 18.23 billion yuan ($2.78 billion) fine for violating anti-monopoly laws, it was announced on Saturday.The fine, the largest anti-monopoly fine ever rolled out by Chinese authorities, was imposed after an investigation revealed an “exclusive dealing agreement” that violated Chinese monopoly laws. The fine is equal to 4% of Alibaba’s sales in 2019, the Xinhua news agency said in a report on Saturday.The strongly worded statement said the company “abused” its dominant market position since 2015.Founded by China’s most famous entrepreneur, Jack Ma, once a schoolteacher who became a multi-billionaire, Alibaba is possibly the world’s biggest e-commerce company with hundreds of millions of users and billions of dollars in turnover - according to Bloomberg, it is Asia’s “most valuable corporation”.Its three main sites Taobao, Tmall and Alibaba.com host millions of merchants and businesses.But in December, China’s State Administration for Market Regulation started an investigation on Alibaba Group for alleged monopoly conduct including implementing an ‘exclusive dealing agreement’,” Xinhua, China’s official news agency, had then announced.The investigation was preceded by the suspension of Ant’s planned IPO in early November, which itself was indication of the troubles ahead of the company.The announcement on Saturday was made at the end of the investigation. “The administration ordered Alibaba Group to stop illegal activities and pay a fine of 18.228 billion yuan (about $ 2.78 billion), which is equal to 4% of its sales in China in 2019,” the Xinhua said.“The penalty was imposed according to China’s anti monopoly law based on the outcome of an extensive investigation and the evidence gathered from Alibaba Group and other competitive platforms and businesses,” the report added.According to the investigation, Alibaba’s conduct of implementing an “…exclusive dealing agreement hinders competition in China’s services market involving online retail platforms, impedes the free flow of goods, services and resources, and infringes the legitimate rights and interests of merchants on the platform as well as the interests of consumers”.Since 2015, the group has abused its dominant market position by prohibiting merchants on its platform from opening stores or participating in promotional activities on other competitive platforms, the investigation found.It has also used market forces, platform rules, data, algorithms and other technical means to implement the “exclusive dealing agreement”, the investigation report added.“In accordance with the principle of combining punishment with education, the administration also issued administrative guidance to the group, requiring it to conduct comprehensive rectification and submit self-inspection reports to the administration for three consecutive years,” the Xinhua report added.“The $2.75 billion fine bill is not as big as we think - it’s almost a symbolic fine for Alibaba... The implications for the rest of China’s internet platforms are limited,” Liu Xu, researcher at the National Strategy Institute, Tsinghua University, told Reuters.“A true enhancement of China’s anti-trust efforts will depend on persistent determination from the central government and a more transparent, fair mechanism to help the anti-trust forces to get rid of various kinds of interference during their investigations and enforcement,” Liu added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-comes-down-hard-on-alibaba-group-fines-278bn-101618052963729.html

10-04-2021||World||Explained: What is behind the latest unrest in Northern Ireland?||Young people have hurled bricks, fireworks and gasoline bombs at police and set hijacked cars and a bus on fire during a week of violence on the streets of Northern Ireland. Police responded with rubber bullets and water cannons.The streets were calmer Friday night, as community leaders appealed for calm after the death of Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's 99-year-old husband. But small gangs of youths pelted police with objects and set a car ablaze during sporadic outbreaks in Belfast.The chaotic scenes have stirred memories of decades of Catholic-Protestant conflict, known as “The Troubles.” A 1998 peace deal ended large-scale violence but did not resolve Northern Ireland's deep-rooted tensions.A look at the background to the new violence:WHY IS NORTHERN IRELAND A CONTESTED LAND?Geographically, Northern Ireland is part of Ireland. Politically, it's part of the United Kingdom.Ireland, long dominated by its bigger neighbour, broke free about 100 years ago after centuries of colonisation and an uneasy union. Twenty-six of its 32 counties became an independent, Roman Catholic-majority country. Six counties in the north, which have a Protestant majority, stayed British.Northern Ireland's Catholic minority experienced discrimination in jobs, housing and other areas in the Protestant-run state. In the 1960s, a Catholic civil rights movement demanded change, but faced a harsh response from the government and police. Some people on both the Catholic and Protestant sides formed armed groups that escalated the violence with bombings and shootings.The British Army was deployed in 1969, initially to keep the peace. The situation deteriorated into a conflict between Irish republican militants who wanted to unite with the south, loyalist paramilitaries who sought to keep Northern Ireland British, and UK troops.During three decades of conflict more than 3,600 people, a majority of them civilians, were killed in bombings and shootings. Most were in Northern Ireland, though the Irish Republican Army also set off bombs in London and other British cities.HOW DID THE CONFLICT END?By the 1990s, after secret talks and with the help of diplomatic efforts by Ireland, Britain and the United States, the combatants reached a peace deal. The 1998 Good Friday accord saw the paramilitaries lay down their arms and established a Catholic-Protestant power-sharing government for Northern Ireland. The question of Northern Ireland's ultimate status was deferred: it would remain British as long as that was the majority's wish, but a future referendum on reunification was not ruled out.While the peace has largely endured, small Irish Republican Army splinter groups have mounted occasional attacks on security forces, and there have been outbreaks of sectarian street violence.Politically, the power-sharing arrangement has had periods of success and failure. The Belfast administration collapsed in January 2017 over a botched green energy project. It remained suspended for more than two years amid a rift between British unionist and Irish nationalist parties over cultural and political issues, including the status of the Irish language. Northern Ireland's government resumed work at the start of 2020, but there remains deep mistrust on both sides.HOW HAS BREXIT COMPLICATED THINGS?Northern Ireland has been called the “problem child” of Brexit, the UK's divorce from the European Union. As the only part of the UK that has a border with an EU nation — Ireland — it was the trickiest issue to resolve after Britain voted narrowly in 2016 to leave the 27-nation bloc.An open Irish border, over which people and goods flow freely, underpins the peace process, allowing people in Northern Ireland to feel at home in both Ireland and the UK.The insistence of Britain's Conservative government on a “hard Brexit” that took the country out of the EU's economic order meant the creation of new barriers and checks on trade. Both Britain and the EU agreed that border could not be in Ireland because of the risk that would pose to the peace process. The alternative was to put it, metaphorically, in the Irish Sea — between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK.That arrangement has alarmed British unionists, who say it weakens Northern Ireland's place in the United Kingdom and could bolster calls for Irish reunification.WHY HAS VIOLENCE ERUPTED NOW?The violence has been largely in Protestant areas in and around Belfast and Northern Ireland's second city, Londonderry, although the disturbances have spread to Catholic neighborhoods.Britain left the EU's economic embrace on Dec. 31, and the new trade arrangements quickly became an irritant to Northern Ireland unionists who want to stay in the UK. Early trade glitches, exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic, led to some empty supermarket shelves, fueling alarm. Border staff were temporarily withdrawn from Northern Ireland ports in February after threatening graffiti appeared to target port workers.There was anger that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who long insisted there would be no new checks on trade as a result of Brexit, had downplayed the scale of the changes wrought by leaving the EU. Some in Northern Ireland's British loyalist community feel as if their identity is under threat.“Many loyalists believe that, de facto, Northern Ireland has ceased to be as much a part of the UK as it was,” Ulster University politics professor Henry Patterson told Sky News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explained-what-is-behind-the-latest-unrest-in-northern-ireland-101618051580998.html
10-04-2021||World||Chinese TV censor foreign fashion brands amid Xinjiang cotton row: Report||Amid Beijing's ongoing tussle with foreign companies over forced labour issues in Xinjiang, Chinese television channels have censored the logos and symbols of brands on sneakers and t-shirts worn by their contestants in various shows.Since late March, streaming platforms in China have started blurring out logos of western brands like Adidas that are worn by contestants performing dance, singing and standup-comedy routines, The New York Times reported.This comes after the big-name international companies said they would avoid using cotton produced in the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, where the authorities are accused of mounting a wide-reaching campaign of repression against ethnic minorities, including Uyghurs.Recently, several companies including H&M and Nike came under tremendous pressure after they said that they were concerned about allegations that forced labour has been used to produce cotton in Xinjiang.They are also been subjected to pressure amid China's rising tension with the west.The ruling Communist Party lashed out at H&M, Nike and other shoe and clothing brands last week after the United States, the European Union, Britain and Canada imposed travel and financial sanctions on officials accused of abuses in Xinjiang in China's northwest.China has been rebuked globally for cracking down on Uyghur Muslims by sending them to mass detention camps, interfering in their religious activities and sending members of the community to undergo some form of forcible re-education or indoctrination.Ying Zhu, a media professor at the City University of New York and Hong Kong Baptist University, suggested that the censorship was a response to both state and grass-roots patriotism, especially as the opinions of nationalistic viewers become more prominent and loud."The pressure is both top-down and bottom-up," said Professor Zhu. "There is no need for the state to issue a directive for the companies to rally behind. Nationalistic sentiment runs high and mighty, and it drowns all other voices."Last month, Chinese media called for Chinese boycotts of Swedish multinational retailer H&M, sports apparel powerhouses Nike and Adidas; New Balance; Burberry and other members of the Better Cotton Initiative (BCI) that have voiced concerns or pledged not to use supply chain components produced in Xinjiang, South China Morning Post reported.H&M, the world's second-largest clothing retailer, has been pulled from major e-commerce stores in China and blocked by several major navigation, review and rating apps.Dozens of Chinese celebrities have terminated contracts or said they would cut ties with these brands, including Nike, Adidas, Puma, Converse, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, and Uniqlo -- a move lauded by state media.H&M was forced to close 20 stores in China following its statement on forced labour in Xinjiang that leads to uproar among Chinese nationals and authorities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-tv-censor-foreign-fashion-brands-amid-xinjiang-cotton-row-report-101618050435482.html

She reportedly paid $20 million to travel there as a tourist.The first Muslim in space was Saudi Prince Sultan bin Salman, who joined the crew of the shuttle Discovery in 1985.In 2019, Maj. Hazzaa al-Mansoori became the UAE's first astronaut in space, spending an eight-day mission aboard the International Space Station.The Emirates has had other recent successes in its space program. This February, the UAE put its Amal, or Hope, satellite in orbit around Mars, a first for the Arab world. In 2024, the country hopes to put an unmanned spacecraft on the moon.The UAE also has set the ambitious goal of building a human colony on Mars by 2117||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-arab-emirates-names-country-s-first-female-astronaut-for-space-program-101618049068817.html

During that period, 26 serving civil servants were arrested or charged over their suspected involvement in the social unrest.The figures were disclosed in papers released to lawmakers on Thursday by the Department of Justice, the Civil Service Bureau, and the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau.Of the 10,242 arrested, 2,521 had undergone or were undergoing judicial proceedings, including 720 charged with rioting. The rest have been charged with offences such as unlawful assembly, arson, desecrating the national flag, possession of an offensive weapon, assaulting a police officer, and stopping a vehicle on an expressway."Of the 2,521 arrestees having undergone or undergoing judicial proceedings, 883 have to bear legal consequences - including 614 convicted, 261 bound over, four subject to a care or protection order and four punished in civil proceedings for contempt of court," the justice department said."The charges against another 50 have been withdrawn and another 186 have been acquitted after trial, while the rest are undergoing judicial proceedings."According to the Civil Service Bureau, of the city's more than 170,000 civil servants, 26 were being investigated or had been charged, while there were "eight probationers whose service had been terminated under the Civil Service Regulations".The protests erupted in June 2019 over the now-withdrawn extradition bill. The bill was deemed as an example of increasing Chinese influence in Hong Kong.Hong Kong was rocked by months of protests, which were sparked by the now-withdrawn extradition bill in June 2019.The opposition to the bill morphed into wider and often violent civil unrest. It eventually led to Beijing imposing a national security law on the city last June. The law has been condemned by countries around the world and rights activists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-police-arrested-over-10-200-due-to-protests-in-last-20-months-101618047816309.html

The fleet included J-10 and J-16 fighter jets, electronic warfare and anti-submarine planes. Taiwan’s air force responded by sending patrol aircraft to the area and monitoring the Chinese planes with its air defense missile systems.Flights by small numbers of Chinese planes around Taiwan have become an almost daily occurrence over the past year, but Friday’s incident was the second significant incursion this week. On Wednesday, 15 PLA aircraft entered Taiwan’s ADIZ on the same day the USS John S. McCain destroyer sailed through the Taiwan Strait.Military action has steadily escalated in the seas and skies around Taiwan in recent months as the U.S. pushes back against Chinese attempts to intimidate the government in Taipei. The Chinese Communist Party views Taiwan as a part of its territory despite never having had control over the island. Taiwan’s government rejects China’s claim, asserting the island is already a de facto sovereign nation.U.S. President Joe Biden has so far largely continued the Trump administration’s robust support for Taiwan. The State Department on Friday eased restrictions governing official contacts with Taiwan in an effort to counter increasing encroachment by China on the island’s sovereignty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-aircraft-skirt-taiwan-in-second-show-of-force-this-week-101618045194867.html
10-04-2021||World||Indian doctors, nurses to benefit from UK’s fee-free 1-year visa extension||Indian doctors and nurses are among 14,000 applicants from across the world that are set to benefit from a one-year fee waiver for visa extensions announced on Friday for frontline workers dealing with the Covid-19 pandemic.The UK Home Office said that the free one-year visa extensions will be automatically granted to eligible overseas health and care workers and their dependents whose visas were due to expire before October 1.The extension will cover healthcare professionals working in the National Health Service (NHS) and the independent health and care sector, which includes a large number of Indian professionals.“The dedication and skill of overseas health and care workers who are leading the UK’s fight against coronavirus is truly extraordinary,” said UK Home Secretary Priti Patel.“Thousands of them have helped save countless lives throughout this pandemic and are now playing a vital part in the hugely successful vaccination rollout. Our offer of free visa extensions shows how our country values the contributions of these heroes,” she said.Periodic free visa extensions for health workers have been announced since last year at the peak of the pandemic and the Home Office said it has extended the visas of more than 10,000 people across the UK.The latest extension is intended for doctors, nurses, paramedics, midwives, occupational therapists, psychologists and others to be able to continue their crucial work in the fight against coronavirus as their visas will be extended for a year, free of all fees and charges, including the Immigration Health Surcharge.“Our overseas health and care workers make such a vital contribution to our health system and have been a key part of the fight against the pandemic. They are protecting our loved ones and vaccinating the public so that we can save lives and return to normalcy,” said UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock.“To help those staff from overseas, we are extending their visas to provide security while they continue to tackle this virus,” he said.The Home Office said that those benefiting from this extension will need to complete a simple online form to verify their identity, with employers asked to confirm eligibility.It also highlighted that the new Health and Care Visa, which launched in August last year, would make it "easier, cheaper and quicker" for the global health professionals to work in the NHS, the social care sector and for those organisations which provide commissioned services to the NHS. So far, more than 20,000 people have been granted a visa through the route.Last year, the Home Office also expanded the Bereavement Scheme to all NHS, health and social care workers to support the family of frontline healthcare workers who die in the line of frontline duties.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-doctors-nurses-to-benefit-from-uk-s-fee-free-1-year-visa-extension-101618043916930.html
10-04-2021||World||US loosens restrictions on Taiwan contacts, defies pressure from China||The State Department on Friday unveiled new rules for U.S. government contacts with Taiwan that are likely to anger China but appear to reimpose some restrictions that had been lifted by the Trump administration.The department announced the changed policy in a statement that said the Biden administration intends to “liberalize” the rules to reflect the “deepening unofficial relationship” between the U.S. and Taiwan. However, the revised guidelines don’t include all the changes put in place by former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo in the waning days of the Trump administration.Pompeo had lifted virtually all restrictions on contacts with Taiwan, including allowing Taiwanese military officers to wear uniforms and display the Taiwanese flag at meetings with U.S. officials. Friday’s changes were silent on those matters, although the rules do continue to permit U.S. officials to meet their Taiwanese counterparts in federal buildings.China regards Taiwan as a renegade province and opposes any attempt to treat the island as an independent country. China had condemned Pompeo's easing of the restrictions that had been in place since the U.S. recognized Beijing and dropped formal diplomatic relations with Taiwan in 1979.“These new guidelines will continue the U.S. government’s longstanding practice of providing clarity throughout the U.S. executive branch of how to implement our ‘one China’ policy,” the department said. “This new guidance is a step forward from earlier versions, including the contact guidance that was in place for virtually all of the previous administration, by encouraging engagement with Taiwan counterparts and removing unneeded restrictions.”Yet the statement contained no details about the new “contact guidance” and congressional aides briefed on the matter said the changes were actually more restrictive than those Pompeo had rolled out just 11 days before the end of the Trump administration.The department said Pompeo's changes had not made engagement with Taiwan easier but rather “had the practical policy effect of impeding our unofficial engagement with Taiwan — a problem that we are rectifying today with this new guidance.” It was not immediately clear how the new guidance rectified the matter.On Jan. 9, Pompeo issued a sweeping order that rescinded almost all U.S. restrictions on contacts with Taiwan.“The United States government took these actions unilaterally, in an attempt to appease the Communist regime in Beijing. No more," Pompeo said in a statement that announced the “lifting all of these self-imposed restrictions.” He said the U.S.-Taiwan relationship should not “be shackled by self-imposed restrictions of our permanent bureaucracy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-loosens-restrictions-on-taiwan-contacts-defies-pressure-from-china-101618044714896.html

Production tripled from Feb. 1 through late March to 5 million doses a day, the government said its most recent update.Leading vaccine manufacturer Sinovac Biotech said this month it had doubled its annual production capacity to 2 billion doses after completing its third production facility.The China National Pharmaceutical Group (Sinopharm) also has a combined annual production capacity of at least 1.1 billion for two separate vaccines. The company has said it aims to raise capacity to 3 billion but has not specified a timeframe.Sinopharm said on Friday that it will be able to supply 100 million Covid-19 vaccines a month starting from April.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-covid-19-vaccine-output-to-hit-3-billion-by-year-end-official-101618044453041.html

Martial law has been declared in the district, allowing courts martial to pronounce sentences.The military rulers who overthrew an elected government said on Friday that a protest campaign against its rule was dwindling because people wanted peace, and that it would hold elections within two years, the first timeframe it has given for a return to democracy.Troops fired rifle grenades at anti-coup protesters on Friday in the town of Bago, near Yangon, witnesses and news reports said. At least 10 people were killed and their bodies piled up inside a pagoda, they said.Myanmar Now news and Mawkun, an online news magazine, said at least 20 people were killed and many wounded. It was not possible to get a precise toll because troops had cordoned off the area near the pagoda, they said.Junta spokesman Brigadier General Zaw Min Tun told a news conference in the capital, Naypyitaw, that the country was returning to normal and government ministries and banks would resume full operations soon.More than 600 people have been killed by security forces cracking down on protests against the coup, according to an activist group. The country has ground to a standstill because of the protests and widespread strikes against military rule."The reason of reducing protests is due to cooperation of people who want peace, which we value," Zaw Min Tun said. "We request people to cooperate with security forces and help them."He said the military had recorded 248 deaths and he denied that automatic weapons had been used. Sixteen policemen had also been killed, he said.The Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group has said 614 people, including 48 children, had been killed by security forces since the coup, as of Thursday evening. More than 2,800 were in detention, it said."We are humbled by their courage and dignity," a group of 18 ambassadors in Myanmar said of the protesters in a joint statement."We stand together to support the hopes and aspirations of all those who believe in a free, just, peaceful and democratic Myanmar. Violence has to stop, all political detainees must be released and democracy must be restored."The statement was signed by the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, the EU, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Switzerland and several other European nations."The suggestions from neighbouring countries and big countries and powerful people in politics, we respect them," Zaw Min Tun said. He also accused members of deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy of arson and said the protest campaign was being financed by foreign money, but gave no details.Suu Kyi and many of her party colleagues have been in custody since the coup.Zaw Min Tun said reports that some members of the international community did not recognise the military government were "fake news"."We are cooperating with foreign countries and working together with neighbouring countries," the spokesman said.Ousted Myanmar lawmakers urged the United Nations Security Council on Friday to take action against the military."Our people are ready to pay any cost to get back their rights and freedom," said Zin Mar Aung, who has been appointed acting foreign minister for a group of ousted lawmakers. She urged Council members to apply both direct and indirect pressure on the junta."Myanmar stands at the brink of state failure, of state collapse," Richard Horsey, a senior adviser on Myanmar with the International Crisis Group, told the informal UN meeting, the first public discussion of Myanmar by council members.The UN special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, had wanted to visit the country but said she has been rebuffed by the generals.She said on Friday she had arrived in Bangkok, the capital of neighbouring Thailand."I regret that Tatmadaw answered me yesterday that they are not ready to receive me," Schraner Burgener said on Twitter, referring to the Myanmar military. "I am ready for dialogue. Violence never leads to peaceful sustainable solutions."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-military-sentences-19-to-death-says-anti-coup-protests-dwindling-101618042300986.html

The potential for widespread devastation is high," state Emergency Services Minister Fran Logan said on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)."We hope that we can get through these next few days without loss of life and without serious property damage. We need to work on the basis of worst case scenario," she said, adding that cyclonic winds had not been seen in the area for decades.Australia's Bureau of Meteorology forecasts destructive winds with gusts to 150 km per hour (93 miles per hour), and heavy rains that could cause significant damage to coastal communities as the cyclone moves across the coast and further inland.The most likely area to experience destructive wind gusts is on the coast between Geraldton, 200 km north of Perth, and Denham, 500 km north of Perth.This area is much further south of Port Hedland, the world's largest iron ore export hub, which withstands several cyclones a season and where houses are built to stronger standards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/western-australia-braces-for-worst-case-scenario-as-cyclone-seroja-nears-101618041033346.html

10-04-2021||World||WHO says Covid appropriate behaviour best way to curb transmission of virus||Adoption of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour is the best way to stop transmission of the virus and its variants, Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, Regional Director, WHO South-East Asia Region, said here as she underlined that efforts to test, trace, isolate, and treat need to be scaled up.In an interview to PTI on the recent surge in coronavirus cases, Singh also spoke about the importance of communities practising cough etiquette, hand hygiene and social distancing in the fight against the disease.India has been registering a record number of cases of coronavirus since April beginning. With a record 1,45,384 fresh cases, India's Covid-19 tally climbed to 1,32,05,926 on Saturday.The number of active cases of the disease has breached the 10-lakh mark again after around six-and-a-half months.Speaking to PTI, Singh said stringent implementation of public health and social measures remain the key to stop virus transmission.Physical distancing measures and movement restrictions can slow Covid 19 transmission by limiting contact between people, she said in response to a question."However, a careful risk assessment and staged approach is needed to balance the benefits and potential harms of adjusting these measures. Decisions to tighten or loosen or re-institute these measures should be based on scientific evidence and real-world experience and should take into account other critical factors, such as economic factors, food security, adherence to measures etc," she added.Asked about lockdowns, Singh said local epidemiology and risk assessment, including capacities of health systems, should guide decisions imposing such curbs."Regardless of lockdowns, public health and social measures remain the key to stop virus transmission. Efforts to test, trace, isolate, and treat must be scaled up along with communities practising cough etiquette, hand hygiene and social distancing," the World Health Organization (WHO) regional director added.On variants of the virus, she said information on their occurrence is currently not systematic and universal."But what we know for sure is that to limit the emergence of variants of concerns, we need to do all we can to curtail virus transmission," Singh added.She said WHO was tracking variants of interest through its Virus Evolution Working Group."WHO has also developed a Risk Monitoring Framework to identify, monitor and assess SARS-CoV-2 mutations, variants of interest and variants of concern. It will involve surveillance, through epi studies, molecular testing and genomic sequencing; research on variants of concern and evaluation of the impact on diagnostics, therapeutics and vaccines," Singh added."Virus variants need a quick and coordinated global response. WHO is leading discussions to shape an agile, global decision framework that can be activated to adapt vaccines, diagnostic tests, treatments, prevention measures and other tools if the need arises," she further said.Replying to a query on re-infection, Singh said most people develop an immune response within one-three weeks following the infection, but "we are still learning how strong the immunity is or how long it may last".There are studies showing that antibody response in people may last many months (possibly six or longer), but there are some differences in the strength of the response depending on the severity of the disease the person experienced (no disease, mild disease to severe disease), she said."There are some reports of reinfection, though this is not systematically monitored. From previous experience with other coronaviruses, we expect there to be an antibody response that declines over time. We need more research to answer this fully, especially longitudinal studies that follow the same individual over time and measure the neutralizing antibody response," Singh added."We urge everyone – whether they have had Covid-19 or not – to take precautions including physical distancing, hand and respiratory hygiene, wearing a mask and ensuring adequate ventilation to prevent getting or spreading Covid-19," she said.Asked how the second wave of the virus can be expected to proceed, Singh said from the epidemiology perspective, no one can predict where it is going."However, from our past experience from several countries in the last one year, we have evidence that implementation of public health measures and adoption of Covid-19 appropriate behaviours are proven strategies to curtail virus transmission," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-says-covid-appropriate-behaviour-best-way-to-curb-transmission-of-virus-101618039189332.html

We will hope to have more about those soon,” Psaki said on Friday.“As it relates to the escalating Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine, including Russia's troop movements on Ukraine's borders, we are, of course, in close consultation and working with partners and allies in the region to assess, to share intelligence, to determine what's happening, and what can be done about it,” Psaki said.Responding to a question, Psaki said there's ongoing diplomatic engagement between the US and a number of countries in the region, including Russia, including Ukraine, including European partners and allies who share a number of American concerns about the aggression of Russian movements on the border.The long-running conflict in Ukraine’s mainly Russian-speaking east has claimed more than 13,000 lives since 2014.Fighting in the conflict, which erupted after Russia’s annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014, subsided in 2020 as a new ceasefire agreement took hold last July.But clashes have picked up again since the start of the year. Ukrainian separatists are widely seen as having Russia’s political and military backing, which Moscow denies.Ukraine last week accused Russia of massing thousands of military personnel on its northern and eastern borders as well as on the Crimean peninsula.The Russian buildup has become the latest point of friction in icy relations between Moscow and the Biden administration. The two sides have differences over arms control, human rights and other issues.Meanwhile, media reports said that Biden Administration has completed its security review of Russia and is planning new sets of actions against Russia.“From his first phone call with President Putin, President Biden has been clear that the United States will respond to a number of destabilising Russian actions, in a manner and timing of our choosing,” a White House spokesperson said in response to a question.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/seen-and-unseen-consequences-us-warns-russia-on-aggression-in-eastern-ukraine-101618037394859.html
10-04-2021||World||Stalled at first jab: Vaccine shortages hit poor countries||As many as 60 countries, including some of the world’s poorest, might be stalled at the first shots of their coronavirus vaccinations because nearly all deliveries through the global program intended to help them are blocked until as late as June.COVAX, the global initiative to provide vaccines to countries lacking the clout to negotiate for scarce supplies on their own, has in the past week shipped more than 25,000 doses to low-income countries only twice on any given day. Deliveries have all but halted since Monday.During the past two weeks, according to data compiled daily by UNICEF, fewer than 2 million COVAX doses in total were cleared for shipment to 92 countries in the developing world — the same amount injected in Britain alone.On Friday, the head of the World Health Organization slammed the “shocking imbalance" in global Covid-19 vaccination. WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreysus said that while one in four people in rich countries had received a vaccine, only one in 500 people in poorer countries had gotten a dose.The vaccine shortage stems mostly from India’s decision to stop exporting vaccines from its Serum Institute factory, which produces the overwhelming majority of the AstraZeneca doses that COVAX counted on to supply around a third of the global population at a time coronavirus is spiking worldwide.COVAX will only ship vaccines cleared by WHO, and countries are increasingly impatient. Supplies are dwindling in some of the first countries to receive COVAX shipments, and the expected delivery of second doses in the 12-week window currently recommended is now in doubt. In a statement, the vaccine alliance known as GAVI told The Associated Press that 60 countries are affected by the delays.In vaccination tents set up at Kenyatta National Hospital in Nairobi, many of those who arrived for their first jabs were uneasy about when the second would arrive.“My fear if I don’t get the second dose, my immune system is going to be weak, hence I might die,” said Oscar Odinga, a civil servant.Internal WHO documents obtained by the AP show the uncertainty about deliveries "is causing some countries to lose faith in the COVAX (effort).” That is prompting WHO to consider speeding up its endorsement of vaccines from China and Russia, which have not been authorized by any regulators in Europe or North America.The WHO documents show the U.N. agency is facing questions from COVAX participants about allotments in addition to “uncertainty about whether all those who were vaccinated in round 1 are guaranteed a second dose.”WHO declined to respond specifically to the issues raised in the internal materials but has previously said countries are “very keen” to get vaccines as soon as possible and insisted it hasn't heard any complaints about the process.Concern over the link between the AstraZeneca shot and rare blood clots has also “created nervousness both around its safety and efficacy,” WHO noted. Among its proposed solutions is a decision to “expedite review of additional products” from China and Russia.WHO said last month it might be possible to greenlight the Chinese vaccines by the end of April.Some experts have noted that Sinopharm and Sinovac, two Chinese-made vaccines, lack published data, and there are reports of people needing a third dose to be protected.“If there is something that we miss from not having thoroughly evaluated the risks of serious adverse events from these vaccines, that would undermine the confidence in all the good products that we’re using that we know are safe,” said Dora Curry, director of health equity and rights at CARE International.Other experts worried that delays could erode faith in governments that were particularly efficient in their vaccination programs and were counting on second doses soon.“In the absence of high vaccination coverage globally, we risk dragging out the pandemic for several more years,” said Lavanya Vasudevan, an assistant professor at Duke University’s Global Health Institute. “Every day that the virus is in circulation is an opportunity for it to mutate into a more deadly variant.”Earlier this month, the WHO appealed to rich countries to urgently share 10 million doses to meet the U.N. target of starting COVID-19 vaccinations in every country within the first 100 days of the year. So far, countries have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars to COVAX. But there are simply no doses to buy, and no country has agreed to immediately share what it has.Bilateral donations of doses tend to go along political lines, rather than to countries with the most infections, and they aren't nearly enough to compensate for the goals that COVAX has set out. Think Global Health, a data site managed by the Council on Foreign Relations, identified 19 countries that have donated a total of 27.5 million doses to 102 nations as of Thursday.“You can make a strong argument that we’re better off making donations in crisis and getting the pandemic under control than vaccinating low-risk groups at home,” said Thomas Bollyky, director of the Global Health Program at the Council on Foreign Relations. Bollyky said COVAX was both a great disappointment and the only available option for most the world.According to the International Rescue Committee, COVID-19 cases and deaths last month surged in numerous crisis-hit countries: by 322% in Kenya, 379% in Yemen and 529% in northeast Syria.On Thursday, the agencies behind COVAX — WHO, vaccines alliance GAVI and CEPI, a coalition for epidemic preparedness — celebrated their delivery of 38 million lifesaving vaccines to more than 100 countries.Brook Baker, a vaccines expert at Northeastern University, said the laudatory message was misplaced.“Celebrating doses sufficient for only 19 million people, or 0.25% of global population, is tone deaf,” he said, adding it was time for WHO and partners to be more honest with countries.“WHO and GAVI have repeatedly overpromised and underdelivered, so why should we believe that they will suddenly be able to ramp up production and deliveries in a couple of months?” he said.Outside the vaccination tents in Nairobi on Thursday, Dr. Duncan Nyukuri, an infectious disease physician, tried to reassure people getting their first dose.“If you receive the first dose and you fail to receive the second dose, this does not mean that your body will be any weaker or you will be at an increased risk of getting any infection," he said. "What it means is your body will have developed some immunity against the coronavirus infection. But this immunity is not as good as somebody who has received both doses.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/stalled-at-first-jab-vaccine-shortages-hit-poor-countries-101618035999767.html
10-04-2021||World||Only 43% Canadians feel Trudeau has handled Covid-19 well: Poll||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s approval rating has fallen to its lowest level in a year, according to a new survey.The numbers released by the non-profit public polling agency Angus Reid Institute or ARI on Friday show that just 43% believe he is doing a ‘good job’ when it comes to dealing with the third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. That is sharply in contrast to the 62% approval rating he enjoyed in April last year, as the virus first started to make its presence felt in Canada and across the world.These approval numbers have dropped a point from last month, while those who think his performance is not up to the mark remains at 52 per cent.More interestingly, support from within the cohort that voted for Trudeau’s Liberal Party in the October 2019 Federal elections has dropped from 90% to 73%.These figures come even as Canada faces simultaneous challenges of not just a surge in infections, but also continuing shortfall in the availability of vaccines as well a steep increase in cases caused by variants of the coronavirus. Canada recorded 6,471 new cases on Friday, a 63% increase over the daily case load two weeks earlier, taking the total infections to 1,042,499. Covid-19 has also resulted in 23,247 deaths.ARI pointed out that “as Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reinforces that the country is facing a ‘very serious’ third wave of the virus, Canadians continue to reinforce that they do not perceive an improvement in his handling of this file”.Concern over the impact of the virus is also rising among Canadians, undoing the optimism that was noticeable in the beginning of the year due to the belief that ample vaccines would soon be available for administration. As ARP stated, “The first quarter of 2021 began with optimism on some fronts in the battle against Covid-19. Concern over becoming sick with the virus began to dissipate slightly within the Canadian public.” However, the situation has changed as “highly infectious variants of the virus” have been spreading in the country leading to the concern returning to “closer to peak levels” with two-thirds of Canadians worried about becoming sick themselves. A larger percentage, 81%, “worry about a friend or close family member potentially contracting Covid-19”.Trudeau has tried to calm citizens by repeating on Friday that a flood of vaccines will flow into the country in June and that 10.5 million doses have already been delivered, though just about half those have been administered so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/only-43-canadians-feel-trudeau-has-handled-covid-19-well-poll-101618034962985.html
10-04-2021||World||Protest erupts in Pakistan demanding Imran Khan's apology over rape statement||A protest erupted here against Pakistan Prime Minister Imran Khan, demanding a public apology from him for his statement blaming "vulgarity" in society for rape and sexual violence.The demonstration was organised on Thursday by Rights activist and civil society representatives outside the National Press Club here, Pakistan's News International reported.The protestors criticised Khan for what they called "victim-blaming" and called for an apology for the comment he made during a question and answer session with the public when he was asked for suggesting a solution to rising child abuse cases in the country.The protestors were holding placards and banners inscribed with their demand for an apology and said that such statements would encourage rapists."It can be considered an opinion when a common person says such thing but if a prime minister makes such comment, it becomes a policy statement. We cannot ignore such a statement which puts the burden of such crimes on the way women dress up. It is a dangerous statement for women like us who work in offices, fields and factories," said one protestor.Last week, Khan has blamed "fahashi" (vulgarity) for surge in rape and sexual violence instead of the deteriorating law and order situation in the country.As he took calls from the people on Sunday, Khan -- when asked by a caller what the government plans to do in the light of rising incidents of rape and sexual violence, especially against children -- said that there are some fights that governments and legislation alone cannot win and that the society must join in the fight. He said it was important for societies to protect themselves against "fahashi" (vulgarity), reported Geo News.The prime minister said incidents of rape and sexual violence that make their way to the media are just one per cent of the actual horrific crimes of such nature that take place.Khan said when he went to the UK, during the '70s to play cricket, the "sex, drugs and rock n roll" culture was taking off. He said nowadays, divorce rates "have gone up by as much as 70 per cent due to vulgarity in that society". He said the whole concept of 'pardah' (or covering up, or modesty) in Islam has a purpose to it which is to "keep temptation in check".His remarks sparked outrage in the country where women are subjugated and deprived of basic rights like educations.Human rights activist Tahira Abdullah said this outrage against Khan's statement is because he was asked about rise in child abuse cases but in response, he started blaming the rise in vulgarity and lack of 'pardah' among women for such incidents. "If these are the reasons then why dead women, animals and children get raped in our society," she asked.She demanded the Prime Minister to take his words back and apologise.Meanwhile, former secretary Women's Parliamentary Caucus Shaista Pervaiz Malik, MNA, said Prime Minister Khan needed to do some reality check and speak only after reviewing the bigger picture of our societal fabric.Official statistics in Pakistan have revealed that at least 11 rape incidents are reported in the country every day, with over 22,000 cases reported to the police in the last six years.However, only 77 of the accused have been convicted which comprises 0.3 per cent of the total figure, reported Geo News.These statistics were obtained from the Police, Law, and Justice Commission of Pakistan, Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, the Women's Foundation, and provincial welfare agencies.Moreover, in February, in an insensitive move, the Forensics Department of Khyber Medical College University proposed a plan to charge rape victims Pakistani ₹25,000 for medical examination and ₹5,000 for an autopsy for the local residents of Peshawar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/protest-erupts-in-pakistan-demanding-imran-khan-s-apology-over-rape-statement-101618033318373.html

Flags on public buildings will fly at half-mast.Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s government is relaxing pandemic restrictions in England from Monday, with the re-opening of non-essential shops, while pubs and restaurants will be able to serve customers outdoors.But social-distancing rules will remain in place, including limiting gatherings to up to six people or two households. That could potentially put authorities in a difficult position if large crowds gather ahead of Prince Philip’s funeral.That ceremony will also have to take into account pandemic rules, which limit the number of mourners able to attend to 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-urges-mourners-for-prince-philip-not-to-gather-or-lay-flowers-due-to-pandemic-101618029170843.html

10-04-2021||World||IMF, World Bank urged to ensure timely delivery of Covid vaccines||Asserting that the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic will be felt for years, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have been urged by a joint ministerial committee of the two global financial bodies to ensure timely delivery of safe and effective vaccines across all countries."Timely delivery of safe and effective vaccines across all countries is critical to ending the pandemic, especially as new variants emerge. Developing countries need to strengthen their readiness for vaccination campaigns and develop coordinated strategies to reach vulnerable populations," a joint ministerial committee of the World Bank and the IMF said in a communique.The Development Committee Communique at the conclusion of the Spring Meetings of the IMF and the World Bank said the Covid-19 pandemic has caused an unprecedented public health, economic, and social crisis, threatening the lives and livelihoods of millions.The economic shock is increasing poverty, worsening inequalities, and reversing development gains. As the global economy begins a gradual recovery, uncertainty surrounds near- and medium-term prospects, it said."We call for sustained, differentiated, and targeted financial and technical support for an adequate policy response, strong coordination across bilateral and multilateral organisations, and further support to the private sector. We urge the World Bank Group (WBG) and the International Monetary Fund (IMF), in line with their respective mandates, to work closely together and with other partners to contain the impacts of the pandemic," the communique said.The communique called for redoubling the efforts to support manufacturing capacity for vaccines and the pandemic-related medical supplies in developing countries."The pandemic has triggered far-reaching consequences, and we must strengthen global preparedness for future pandemics, and at the same time make progress in building robust health systems with universal coverage," it said.As poorer countries face the crisis with increased resource constraints, limited fiscal space, and rising public debt levels, more of them, including small states, are vulnerable to financial stress, the communique note.The rapid initial response under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative (DSSI) has provided much-needed liquidity for IDA countries, it said."The effects of the Covid-19 crisis will be felt for years. Mobility restrictions and lockdowns have triggered job losses, especially for women, youth, and vulnerable groups, and can undermine social inclusion," the communique said.School closures have caused unprecedented disruption to education, especially for girls, damaging human capital, with long-term economic implications. Inflation and depleted incomes have raised household indebtedness and food insecurity, it said, urging the IMF and the World Bank to scale-up its work to address rising levels of food insecurity and to support countries in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 and nutrition for all.Commending the WBG's scale-up of climate finance over the past two years, its continuing role as the largest multilateral source of climate investments in developing countries, its emphasis on biodiversity, and its technical and financial support for adaptation, mitigation, and resilience, the communique also welcomed the WBG and IMF's work to assess the impact of climate change on macroeconomic and financial stability.Observing that a vibrant private sector will be essential for client countries to recover, create jobs, and embrace economic transformation, the communique urged the World Bank Group to continue its work to help crowd-in private capital and finance, and to support the private sector.Earlier in his address to the Development Committee, World Bank Group President David Malpass said the world is developing a better line of sight forward, and our collective efforts to poverty, climate change, and inequality will be the defining choices of our age."It's time to move urgently toward opportunities and solutions that achieve sustainable and broad-based economic growth without harming climate, degrading the environment, or leaving hundreds of millions of families in poverty," he said.Malpass strongly welcomed the G20's decision to extend the DSSI to end-2021."We are working closely with the IMF to support the implementation of the G20 Common Framework, as detailed in this joint paper. I welcome the clear statement in the G20's communique that the need for debt treatment, and the restructuring envelope that is required, will be based on an IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis as an input to the creditor committee deliberations," he said.To recover from Covid-19, we will need integrated, long-run strategies that emphasise green, resilient, and inclusive development (GRID), Malpass said."This must be aligned with the need for policies that help countries increase literacy, reduce stunting and malnutrition, ensure clean water and energy access, and provide better healthcare," he said."We must help countries improve their readiness for future pandemics. We need to help them accelerate the development and adoption of digital technologies. We need to work to improve and expand local supply chains and strengthen biodiversity and ecosystems," Malpass said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imf-world-bank-urged-to-ensure-timely-delivery-of-covid-vaccines-101618028389574.html
10-04-2021||World||The Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine bet that paid off||With a strategic alliance, 24-hour production and a bit of luck, Pfizer and BioNTech were able to roll out their Covid vaccine at a brisk pace and relatively free of controversy.US pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and BioNTech, a smaller German biotech firm, joined forces on April 9, 2020, as the world reeled from the pandemic, with deaths soaring and nations under lockdown.The companies set an ambitious goal: Producing hundreds of millions of jabs in 2021 -- an incredibly short timeline when vaccines usually take years to develop and secure regulatory approval.Seven months later, Pfizer announced promising results from clinical tests showing the vaccine developed by BioNTech was 90-percent effective against the novel coronavirus.The shot -- using the hitherto unproven mRNA method to deliver vaccines -- has since proven a success in public rollouts across the world.In March, BioNTech even promised 2.5 billion doses this year, a quarter more than initially planned.The vaccine currently plays a leading role in European vaccination campaigns and in the United States.- Exhausted employees -The shot's success has helped overcome suspicions the companies were driven by the chance to make profits.In November 2020, Pfizer CEO Albert Bourla raised some eyebrows when he raked in millions from selling company shares just after the announcement of the positive clinical test results, although the share sale was long planned.Then in January, another controversy erupted when Pfizer announced that its vaccine vials contain six doses instead of five.The company had a lot to gain with the change. With the stroke of a pen, it boosted its deliveries by 20 percent.But in Europe, and to a lesser extent in the United States, health professionals worried they didn't have enough special syringes to get the sixth dose out of the vial.Two months later the controversy has been forgotten. French and US health authorities, when contacted by AFP, said they are not aware of any problems obtaining enough of the special syringes."That has never been a problem," said Romain Comte, who runs a vaccination clinic in Paray-le-Monial in the centre of France. "Now that things have been cleared up, we even manage to get a seventh dose of the Pfizer vaccine" from the vials.Pfizer has also escaped labour difficulties despite its staff coming under enormous pressure, such as in its facility in the Belgian town of Puurs."In the Covid departments, we work 24/7," said Patrick Coppens, a representative of the FGTB union, adding that wages are low."Many of my colleagues are on the edge of nervous breakdowns as they've been doing this for a full year," he said. "It can't continue like this."Despite disagreement about wages in the sector, labour unions have called on workers at the Puurs plant not to go on strike given the pandemic.Another sensitive subject is the vaccine's price.According to documents accidently disclosed by a Belgian official, the EU is paying 12 euros ($14) for each Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine dose.While cheaper than what Moderna charges for its vaccine, it costs 10 euros more than the AstraZeneca/Oxford University jab.- Cold storage -Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna used the innovative messenger RNA (mRNA) technique for their vaccines.The downside is that the doses must be kept at ultralow temperatures, though Pfizer has managed to demonstrate that its vaccine can be kept up to two weeks at less intense cold."Pfizer and Moderna are very aware at the moment they can only use their vaccines in developed countries because the storage and distribution are going to be quite difficult," said Adam Barker, a health industry expert at London-based asset manager Shore Capital.With hundreds of millions of doses in production at the Serum Institute of India, the world's largest manufacturer of vaccines, AstraZeneca could eventually overtake Pfizer.It is stored at a warmer temperature and billed as the vaccine of choice for poorer countries since it can be transported more readily than some counterparts."AstraZeneca of course know their vaccine will be used much more widely in the developing world," due to its price and easier handling, Barker said.But AstraZeneca's jab has faced some setbacks as several countries have halted its use among younger people over concerns about rare cases of blood clots in some recipients.The British company has also been reprimanded by the European Union over delays in delivering tens of millions of doses.Pfizer also had some delays earlier this year, notably in Puurs, which the company said was due to efforts to step up the speed of production.Pfizer has since made up for the delays.Other rivals have fared worse.French pharmaceutical giant Sanofi is months behind in its main vaccine development, while US firm Merck dropped its vaccine candidate.By joining forces with a larger company like Pfizer, BioNTech was able to produce many more doses than Moderna, which relies on subcontractors.But the biggest bet was using the mRNA technique. Already used for animal vaccines, it had promising potential but no guarantee it would work."If we had this conversation a year ago, I would have been advising caution," said Dan Mahony, health specialist at British fund Polar Capital."It worked a lot better than I would have thought."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-pfizer-biontech-covid-19-vaccine-bet-that-paid-off-101618023439060.html
10-04-2021||World||China fines Alibaba record $2.75 billion for anti-monopoly violations||Chinese regulators have fined Alibaba Group Holding Ltd 18 billion yuan ($2.75 billion) for violating anti-monopoly rules and abusing its dominant market position, marking the highest ever antitrust fine to be imposed in the country.The penalty, equivalent to around 4% of Alibaba's revenues in 2019, comes amid an unprecedented regulatory crackdown on the home-grown technology conglomerates in the last few months that have weighed on company shares.Alibaba's billionaire founder Jack Ma's business empire has been particularly put under intense scrutiny after his stinging criticism of China's regulatory system in late October.In late December, China's State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) announced it launched an antitrust probe into the company. That came after authorities halted a planned $37 billion IPO from Ant Group, Alibaba's internet finance arm.SAMR said on Saturday that after an investigation launched in December, it had determined that Alibaba had been "abusing market dominance" since 2015 by preventing its merchants from using other online e-commerce platforms.It said the practice violates China's anti-monopoly law by hindering the free circulation of goods and infringing on the business interests of merchants.The SAMR ordered Alibaba to make "thorough rectifications" to strengthen internal compliance and protect consumer rights."This penalty will be viewed as a closure to the anti-monopoly case for now by the market. It's indeed the highest profile anti monopoly case in China," said Hong Hao, head of research BOCOM International in Hong Kong."The market has been anticipating some sort of penalty for some time ... but people need to pay attention to the measures beyond the anti-monopoly investigation, such as the divestment of media assets."Alibaba said in a statement posted on its official Weibo account that it "accepted" the decision and would resolutely implement SAMR's rulings. It said it would also work to improve corporate compliance.The Chinese e-commerce giant said it will hold a conference call on Monday to discuss the penalty decision.Alibaba had come under fire in the past from rivals and sellers for allegedly forbidding its merchants from listing on other e-commerce platforms.The practice of preventing merchants from listing on rival platforms is a long-standing one, and the regulator spelled out in rules issued in February that it was illegal."The fine bill is a milestone and road sign with great importance," Shi Jianzhong, antitrust consultant committee member of the State Council and professor of China University of Political Science and Law, wrote in state-backed Economic Times."It indicates that the antitrust law enforcement on internet platforms has entered a new era, and released clear policy signal."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-fines-alibaba-record-2-75-billion-for-anti-monopoly-violations-101618022980291.html
10-04-2021||World||Aggressive US climate plan puts pressure on China, India||An ambitious pledge to cut greenhouse-gas emissions under consideration by the U.S. gives President Joe Biden more leverage when he hosts leaders for a climate change summit later this month -- presenting a particular challenge to China’s Xi Jinping.The White House may commit to emissions cuts of 50% or more from 2005 levels by 2030, Bloomberg reported this week. Officials are looking at opportunities across the federal government on standard-setting, clean energy investments and resilient infrastructure plans, according to people familiar with the deliberations.It’s uncertain whether the U.S. can actually deliver on such a bold plan, but the indication that Biden is willing to significantly up the ante on emissions targets may put pressure on China, which has already tried to position itself as a leader in reducing greenhouse gases.The U.S. administration is fashioning the aggressive target as it seeks to rebuild trust with nations wary after former President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris agreement and dismantled domestic policies key to driving the country’s promised emissions cuts.At stake is the ability to create standards and develop equipment and technologies that will be used for decades to transition the global economy away from fossil fuels with advances in everything from renewables to electric vehicles to greener steelmaking.“You can cancel regulation, but you can’t erase technological advances,” said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst with Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air. “Hopefully the U.S. domestic plans will be followed by ambitious programs to invest in the low-carbon transition in emerging countries.”Tackling climate change has been an effective foreign policy tool for Xi since he became China’s president in 2013. He and former President Barack Obama worked out a bilateral emissions agreement in 2014 that helped pave the way for the 2015 Paris climate pact. When Trump’s administration left that, Xi began to assert more of a global leadership role in the area.Xi last year announced that China would reach net-zero emissions by 2060. His policies have also led China to a world-leading role in manufacturing solar panels, wind turbines and electric vehicles.Also hanging in the balance may be the shape of India’s energy transition. The world’s third-biggest polluter has yet to publicly commit to a pathway toward net zero emissions. During the summit, Biden is likely to press for a commitment from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who may seek to tie a pledge to energy transition aid, according to BloombergNEF analyst Ali Izadi-Najafabadi.Here’s a look at how other Asian countries attending the April 22-23 event may be impacted by a larger U.S. climate pledge, according to Izadi-Najafabadi:||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/aggressive-us-climate-plan-puts-pressure-on-china-india-101618021900604.html
10-04-2021||World||Richer nations getting most Covid-19 jabs, rues WHO||The head of the World Health Organization (WHO) said that over 87% of the more than 700 million doses of coronavirus vaccine that have been administered worldwide have been given in wealthier countries.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that on average, one in four people in rich countries have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, compared to only one in 500 people in low-income countries.“There remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines,” Tedros told reporters on Friday.He called COVAX, the UN-backed initiative to distribute vaccines fairly, “a strong mechanism that can deliver vaccines faster and more efficiently than any other mechanism”. He noted that COVAX so far has delivered about 38 million doses worldwide, or enough to cover about 0.25% of the global population.Tedros criticised countries that plan to donate vaccines directly to other nations instead of going through COVAX. “These bilateral arrangements run the risk of fanning the flames of vaccine inequity,” he said, without explaining why donations that bypass COVAX were problematic.Meanwhile, Europe’s vaccine roll-out faced multiple shocks on Friday as EU regulators said they were reviewing side effects of the Johnson & Johnson shot and France further limited its use of the AstraZeneca jab.As Europe continues to reel from constant rows over AstraZeneca’s jab, the EU’s medicine regulator announced it would be probing a second jab over blood-clot concerns. The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said four “serious cases” of unusual blood clots had been reported - one of them fatal - with the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel’s spokeswoman said the government will draw up legislation to ensure that restrictions are imposed uniformly in regions with high coronavirus infection rates.‘Vaccine nationalism’China urged the international community to resist “vaccine nationalism” and to coordinate policy to make vaccines accessible for developing countries in order to contain the pandemic and for the sake of the global economy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/richer-nations-getting-most-covid-19-jabs-rues-who-101618021041242.html
10-04-2021||World||Prince Philip, the Queen's husband, dead||Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband and a pivotal figure in the British royal family for almost seven decades, has died aged 99, Buckingham Palace said on Friday.The Duke of Edinburgh, as he was officially known, had been by his wife’s side throughout her 69-year reign, the longest in British history. During that time he earned a reputation for a tough, no-nonsense attitude and a propensity for occasional gaffes.‘DEEP SORROW’“It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh,” the palace said. “His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle. Further announcements will be made in due course. The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.”A Greek prince, Philip married Elizabeth in 1947. He went on to play a key role in modernising the monarchy in the post-World War II period, and behind the walls of Buckingham Palace was the one key figure the queen could turn to and trust.“He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years,” Elizabeth said in a rare personal tribute to Philip, made in a speech marking their 50th wedding anniversary in 1997.“I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim, or we shall ever know.”Philip spent four weeks in hospital earlier this year for treatment for an infection and to have a heart procedure, but returned to Windsor in early March. He died just two months before he was to celebrate his 100th birthday.FLAGS LOWEREDFlags at Buckingham Palace and at government buildings across Britain were lowered to half-mast.No details about his funeral were disclosed yet, but ceremonies are likely to eschew the grand displays of pomp that often follow royal deaths.’SECOND HANDSHAKE’In private, the prince was regarded as the unquestioned head of his family, but protocol obliged the man dubbed “the second handshake” to spend his public life literally one step behind his wife. “There was no precedent. If I asked somebody ‘what do you expect me to do?’, they all looked blank - they had no idea, nobody had much idea,” he said in an interview to mark his 90th birthday.After completing more than 22,000 solo appearances, Philip retired from public life in August 2017, although after that he occasionally appeared at official engagements.His last appearance was last July at a military ceremony at Windsor Castle, the royal palace west of London where he and the monarch have resided during Covid-19 lockdowns.ALL EYES ON THE QUEENThe death of the queen’s husband will raise questions over whether she might consider abdication, but royal commentators say there is little or no chance than this will happen.In recent years, the queen has cut the number of official engagements she carries out and has passed many royal duties and patronages onto Prince Charles, his son William.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/buckingham-palace-loses-its-fillip-101618021079910.html
10-04-2021||World||Nepal foreign minister raises delay in delivery of Made in India vaccines||Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali on Friday raised the issue of delay in delivery of a million doses of Made in India Covid-19 vaccines during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.Kathmandu was expecting the million doses of Covishield vaccine contracted from the Serum Institute of India (SII) last month, and the delay in delivery has affected the roll-out of the second phase of the neighbouring country’s inoculation drive, Nepali officials have said.In a separate development, Iran, too, raised the need to expedite the delivery of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin doses that it has already paid for. The issue figured in a set of tweets from the Iranian embassy.India’s decision to calibrate vaccine exports to cope with a surge in domestic infections and the expansion of its inoculation programme has affected several nations, including Nepal, the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam.Nepal signed an agreement with SII for two million doses, half of which were supplied and used for the first phase of the national inoculation drive. The delay in delivering the second million doses has left people waiting for more than six weeks for a second jab, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.According to a readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry, Gyawali requested Jaishankar “for necessary facilitation for the supply of vaccines for Nepal to continue administering the second dose of vaccination for people at highest risk”.Jaishankar assured Gyawali of “continued support to Nepal in its fight against the pandemic, including through the supply of vaccines”, the readout said.There was no official word on the conversation from the Indian side. Nepal has already made 80% of the payment for the doses and the remaining amount will be paid when the consignment moves out of SII’s facilities in Pune, the people said.The Iranian embassy said in a tweet on purchase of vaccines from India that Tehran conveyed its needs to Indian government and Bharat Biotech.Following this, Iran had received the first consignment of 125,000 doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-foreign-minister-raises-delay-in-delivery-of-made-in-india-vaccines-101618015846411.html
10-04-2021||World||Blinken is set to return to Brussels for more NATO meetings||Secretary of State Antony Blinken is set to return to Brussels next week for more meetings with NATO officials, according to three people familiar with the matter, as the U.S. grows increasingly concerned about Russian troop movements near Ukraine.The meetings will take up most of the week, said the people, who asked not to be identified discussing plans that haven’t been made public. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin will be in Brussels at the same time, for a meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.Blinken traveled to Brussels in late March on his first trip to Europe after being confirmed by the U.S. Senate. That visit was intended to assure allies that President Donald Trump’s “America First” era was over and the U.S. was fully committed to NATO. Trump often criticized the alliance and complained that European countries were not paying enough for their defense.The State Department declined to comment.Earlier this week, Russia announced the beginning of mass military drills, heightening concerns about the risk of new clashes along the country’s border with Ukraine that could lead to a broader conflict. Some 13,000 people have died in seven years of combat.Ukraine is just one of the many foreign policy challenges facing President Joe Biden and his administration. China’s latest threats against Taiwan have generated widespread concern. The U.S. also faces a May 1 deadline to withdraw troops from Afghanistan under a deal the Trump administration made with the Taliban, though Biden has made clear he won’t meet that timeframe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/blinken-is-set-to-return-to-brussels-for-more-nato-meetings-101618015693051.html
10-04-2021||World||US, Iran clash on sanctions; US sees possible 'impasse'||US and Iranian officials clashed on Friday over what sanctions the United States should lift to resume compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal, with Washington predicting an impasse if Tehran sticks to a demand that all sanctions since 2017 be removed.The two nations laid out tough stances as indirect talks in Vienna on how to bring both back into full compliance with the agreement wound up for the week, with some delegates citing progress.The talks, in which European Union officials are shuttling between the remaining parties to the deal and the United States, aim to restore the bargain at the core of the agreement - restrictions on Iran's nuclear activities in exchange for the lifting of U.S. and other international sanctions.The United States was the first to renege on that bargain under then-President Donald Trump, who vehemently opposed the deal and sought to wreck it. He pulled out, reimposed the sanctions that were lifted, and brought in many more. Iran responded by breaching many of the nuclear restrictions."All Trump sanctions were anti-JCPOA & must be removed—w/o distinction between arbitrary designations," Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said on Twitter, referring to the deal by its full name, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.The United States says it is prepared to lift "sanctions that are inconsistent with the JCPOA". While it has declined to elaborate, that appears to exclude sanctions formally unrelated to nuclear issues covered by the deal.A senior U.S. State Department official told reporters the United States had seen some signs of Iranian seriousness about returning to the nuclear pact but "certainly not enough.""If Iran sticks to the position that every sanction that has been imposed since 2017 has to be lifted or there will be no deal, then we are heading towards an impasse," the senior U.S. official told reporters on a conference call.Whether the statements are opening gambits or more firm positions remains to be seen. European officials said Iran was bargaining hard at the outset.The remaining parties to the accord - Iran, Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia - met again on Friday after talks formally began on Tuesday and they agreed to keep going, Russian and Chinese envoys said."The #JCPOA participants took stock of the work done by experts over the last three days and noted with satisfaction the initial progress made," Mikhail Ulyanov, Russia's envoy to the United Nations' International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said on Twitter after the meeting formally known as the Joint Commission."The Commission will reconvene next week in order to maintain the positive momentum."The remaining parties have formed two expert-level working groups whose job is to draw up lists of sanctions that the United States will lift and of nuclear restrictions Iran will implement. Their work continues between Joint Commission meetings."All parties have narrowed down their differences and we do see the momentum for gradually evolving consensus," Wang Qun, China's ambassador to the IAEA, told reporters.'IRAN IS THE PACE CAR'Iran's foreign ministry said in a statement diplomats would meet again on Wednesday in Vienna. Talks are expected to drag on for weeks."Given the technical complexity of the nuclear aspects and legal intricacies of sanctions lifting, it would be very optimistic to think a few weeks," a senior European diplomatic source said.Some diplomats hope agreement can be reached before Iran's June 18 presidential election or else talks risk being pushed back until later in the year."Iran is the pace car for progress. If Tehran decides to push forward swiftly before the June presidential elections, the U.S. will almost certainly be receptive," Henry Rome, an analyst with the Eurasia Group research firm, said in a note."That would require Iran to compromise on its sanctions and sequencing demands. If Tehran is unsatisfied with the U.S. position, or if Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei is wary about the political consequences of a diplomatic breakthrough in the midst of a presidential campaign, Tehran will tap the brakes."Khamenei, who has the last say on all state matters, has opposed any gradual easing of sanctions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-iran-clash-on-sanctions-us-sees-possible-impasse-101618011940737.html
10-04-2021||World||No region in the world spared as Covid-19 cases, deaths surge||Hospitals in Turkey and Poland are filling up. Pakistan is restricting domestic travel. The US government will send more help to the state with the country's worst infection increase.The worldwide surge in coronavirus cases and deaths includes even Thailand, which has weathered the pandemic far better than many nations but now struggles to contain Covid-19.The only exceptions to the deteriorating situation are countries that have advanced vaccination programs, most notably Israel and Britain. The US, which is a vaccination leader globally, is also seeing a small uptick in new cases, and the White House announced Friday that it would send federal assistance to Michigan to control the state’s worst-in-the-nation transmission rate.The World Health Organization said infection rates are climbing in every global region, driven by new virus variants and too many countries coming out of lockdown too soon.“We’ve seen rises (in cases) worldwide for six weeks. And now, sadly, we are seeing rises in deaths for the last three weeks,” Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, said at a briefing in Geneva.In its weekly epidemiological update, the WHO said over 4 million Covid-19 cases were reported in the last week. New deaths increased by 11% compared to last week, with over 71,000 reported.The increasing infections, hospitalizations and deaths extend to countries where vaccinations are finally gaining momentum. That leaves even bleaker prospects for much of the world, where large-scale vaccination programs remain a more distant prospect.In Turkey, which is among the badly hit countries, most new cases of the virus can be traced to a variant first found in Britain.Ismail Cinel, head of the Turkish Intensive Care Association, said the surge was beginning to strain the nation’s relatively advanced health care system and “the alarm bells are ringing” for intensive care units, which are not yet at full capacity.“The mutant form of the virus is causing more harm to the organs,” Cinel said. “While 2 out of 10 patients were dying previously, the number is now 4 out of 10. And if we continue this way, we will lose six.”Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan eased Covid-19 restrictions in early March to minimize pain to his nation’s ailing economy. The new spike forced him to announce renewed restrictions, such as weekend lockdowns and the closure of cafes and restaurants during Ramadan, which starts April 13.Turkish medical groups say the reopening in March was premature and that the new measures do not go far enough. They have been calling for full lockdowns during the holy Muslim month.In the US capital, President Joe Biden's administration outlined how the federal government planned to help Michigan better administer the doses already allocated to the state, as well as expand testing capacity and the availability of drugs. The effort will not include any extra vaccine doses, a move Gov. Gretchen Whitmer sought.Doses are currently allocated to states proportionally by population. Whitmer has called for extra doses to be shifted to states like hers experiencing a sharp rise in cases. She also urged a voluntary two-week halt to in-person high school classes, youth sports and indoor restaurant dining, but stopped short of issuing new restrictions.In Brazil, which has the second-highest death toll in the world after the US, Sao Paulo has started night burials to cope with demand, and school vans have been used to transport coffins. With the pace of vaccination already slow — less than than 3% of Brazil’s 210 million people have received both vaccine doses, according to the research site Our World in Data — some governors have expressed concern about vaccine supplies.The death toll in Iran is also rising, prompting new restrictions that will take effect for 10 days in 257 cities beginning Saturday. They involve the closure of all parks, restaurants, confectionaries, beauty salons, malls and bookstores.Authorities in Pakistan, which is in the middle of a third surge of infections, are restricting inter-city transportation on weekends starting at midnight Friday.Elsewhere in Asia, authorities in Thailand ordered new restrictions Friday in an effort to contain a growing coronavirus outbreak just days before the country’s traditional Songkran New Year’s holiday, when millions of people travel.In Germany, Poland and other countries in the 27-member European Union, vaccination programs are finally ramping up after a slow start blamed on delivery shortages.Thousands of German medical practices joined the vaccination campaign this week, helping the country reach consecutive daily records for doses administered. So far, 14.7% of the population has received at least one dose and 5.8% has received both shots.Yet German health officials are warning of a steep rise in intensive care patients and are calling for stronger action to contain infections.Neighboring Poland is also seeing a dramatic spike in deaths, and hospitals have been forced to turn away cancer and other patients as ICU and other hospital beds are taken by Covid-19 patients. Hospitalizations of virus patients there have jumped 20% in the past two weeks.Harris, from the WHO, said the world knows how to fight these surges. She cited good news from the UK, where new coronavirus cases dropped 60% in March amid a strong vaccination program, “but we have to do it all.”“We have to keep on social distancing. We have to avoid indoor crowded settings," she said. “We have to keep wearing the masks, even if vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-region-in-the-world-spared-as-covid-19-cases-deaths-surge-101618003484790.html
