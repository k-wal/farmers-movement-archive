They were seen chatting and walking together after the service concluded.It was the first time the brothers had been together in public since Harry stood down from royal duties and moved to the U.S. with his wife Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex, and their son Archie in early 2020.Tensions between Harry, 36, and William, 38, came to the fore after Harry and Meghan gave a revealing interview to US talk show host Oprah Winfrey last month. The couple portrayed the royal family as indifferent to Meghan’s mental health struggles, and Harry described his relationship with William as “space at the moment.”On Saturday, William and Harry walked in silence on either side of their cousin, Peter Phillips, as they joined other senior royals in Philip’s funeral procession. At one point Phillips fell behind slightly to allow the brothers to walk side by side — a visual echo of the moment the pair, as boys in 1997, walked behind the coffin of their mother Princess Diana in another royal funeral televised around the world.The brothers sat opposite each other in St. George's Chapel for the funeral, which was attended by only 30 people because of coronavirus restrictions. While William sat next to his wife Kate, Harry was on his own because Meghan is pregnant with their second child and was advised by her doctor not to make the long trip.Afterwards, Harry, William and Kate strolled together outside the chapel. Moments later, the brothers walked together alone while Kate spoke to Zara Tindall, another of Queen Elizabeth II's eight grandchildren who is William and Harry’s cousin.Rumors of a rift between the brothers — William, the heir, and Harry, the “spare” — have rumbled at least since 2019. That's when Harry and Meghan separated from the Royal Foundation, originally set up as the brothers’ joint charitable venture, to set up their own platform. That year, Harry said he loved his brother dearly but they were “on different paths” and have “good days” and “bad days.”Many believe that William was angered and hurt by Harry’s decision to speak so publicly about the royal family's issues during the Winfrey interview. In one explosive allegation, they said a family member — not the queen or Philip — had expressed “concerns” about Archie's possible skin color before he was born. Meghan has a Black mother and a white father.Days after the interview aired, William insisted "we are very much not a racist family,” and said he had not spoken to Harry since the broadcast.It's unclear whether the passing of their grandfather will help the brothers heal their rift. It wasn’t immediately clear how long Harry, who has been self-isolating in line with the U.K.'s coronavirus restrictions since arriving from California early this week, will stay in his home country.Saturday's funeral was limited to only 30 people, who all had to wear masks, sit in family bubbles and remain socially distanced in the same church that had hosted hundreds of people for Harry and Meghan's royal wedding in 2018. And Britain's continued coronavirus restrictions may limit how much opportunity the brothers will get to smooth over their differences.“Because of the restrictions of COVID, it’s difficult to get down to decent conservations,” said royal biographer Penny Junor. “It’s probably quite difficult to sit down as they normally would over a beer and discuss things.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/harry-william-seen-chatting-after-prince-philip-s-funeral-101618681086104.html

But they have not responded in overwhelming numbers to the vaccination campaign, prompting officials to offer the vaccines to a younger cohort.Pakistan hopes to receive 15 million Covid-19 vaccine doses through the UN-backed COVAX program by next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-to-vaccinate-beneficiaries-between-50-to-59-yrs-from-next-week-101618681184189.html
17-04-2021||World||Dogecoin frenzy overloads Robinhood crypto order system||The frenzy around digital tokens is taking its zaniest turn yet in the price of a token created as a joke, buckling the crypto trading system at Robinhood Markets.Dogecoin, boosted by the likes of Elon Musk and Mark Cuban, rallied more than 110% Friday before dropping by 26% on Saturday, according to CoinMarketCap.com. It now has a market value of more than $36 billion and is still up 13,400% from a year ago, when it traded for $0.002 and was worth about $250 million.Demand was so brisk for the token that investors trying to trade it on Robinhood crashed the site, the online exchange said in a blog post Friday. Some $68 billion worth of Dogecoin changed hands in the prior 24 hours as of 4:45 p.m. Friday in New York, the most since June, CoinMarketCap.com data showed.Doge’s surge is part of a rise in altcoins, a term for all the digital tokens that have sprung up in imitation of Bitcoin. Like most of them, its use case is limited, making it a tool for speculators and raising concern that a bubble is inflating in a crypto world now worth more than $2.25 trillion.“This reminds me of the dot com days. We knew something big was going on, a lot of investors were chasing it hard. That led to a bubble,” Scott Knapp, chief market strategist at CUNA Mutual Group, said. “For every Amazon.com there were 10 pets.com that went bankrupt. Is Dogecoin the pets.com of the cryptocurrency era?”Interest in crypto is on the rise again after companies from PayPal to Square started enabling transactions in Bitcoin on their systems, and Wall Street firms like Morgan Stanley began providing access to the tokens to some of the wealthiest clients. All along, crypto die-hards who say the blockchain technology will rewire the financial community have been plugging crypto, getting rich in the process.The Shiba-Inu themed Dogecoin was created as a joke by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer in 2013. Musk sparked a rally in it earlier this year when he posted a photo of a faux magazine “Dogue” featuring a dog in a red sweater.But Michael Novogratz, chief executive officer of Galaxy Digital Holdings, isn’t buying the hype, since Dogecoin “doesn’t really have a purpose.”“It’s reminiscent of GameStop,” he said in an interview with Bloomberg TV, referring to the meme stock mania that gripped markets in February. “I would be very, very worried if one of my friends was investing in Dogecoin at these prices.”With little to back up the case for buying cryptocurrencies, the likelihood of them cratering remains high, leaving novice traders who jumped in on the hype vulnerable to steep losses.“The government has pumped so much monetary and fiscal stimulus into the economy now, even worthless assets are being bid up,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading.Yet alt-coin popularity is hard to ignore. While Bitcoin is worth more than $1 trillion, the total market cap of the token universe now exceeds $2.25 trillion, according to CoinGecko.com, which tracks more than 6,700 coins.Bitcoin’s dominance in the crypto world has declined 28% since the beginning of the year, according to OKEX Insights Analyst Robbie Liu, citing data from Tradingview. The waning influence started to accelerate this month, he said in an email Friday, and Bitcoin now accounts for less than 54% of the crypto market capitalization -- the lowest level in nearly two years.“On the altcoins front, we continue to see strong momentum,” said Pankaj Balani, the CEO of Delta Exchange, a leading crypto derivatives exchange, in a note Thursday. He noted Ether’s recent record and increased activity in decentralized finance or DeFi, adding that “decentralized exchange coins will be in focus in the next few days, given that the market has validated Coinbase at a $100 billion valuation.”Other tokens with shaky to no fundamentals are also rising. Cardano and Polkadot, both in the top 10 cryptocurrencies by market cap, have surged this week.“Polkadot and Cardano have very few ‘users’” currently, said Shashwat Gupta, founder of Altcoinbuzz.io, in an email Wednesday, though he added that there’s a substantial amount of development being built on them.And it looks like Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong may have been on to something when he said after the listing that it marks a “shift in legitimacy” for crypto.The Coinbase listing “ultimately will deliver more ‘use cases’ for cryptos and should keep the crypto market growing,” said Edward Moya, senior market analyst for North America at Oanda Corp.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dogecoin-frenzy-overloads-robinhood-crypto-order-system-101618680815478.html

17-04-2021||World||Prince Philip laid to rest as sombre Queen Elizabeth II sits alone||As military bands played and a procession of royals escorted his coffin to the church, Prince Philip was laid to rest Saturday in a funeral ceremony that honored his lifetime of service to the U.K., the crown and his wife of 73 years, Queen Elizabeth II.The widowed British monarch, setting an example amid the coronavirus pandemic, sat alone at the ceremony, dressed in black and with her head bowed in prayer.Philip, who died April 9, two months shy of his 100th birthday, was honored at Windsor Castle in a service that was steeped in military and royal tradition but also pared down and infused with his own personality. The entire royal procession and funeral took place out of public view within the grounds of the castle, a 950-year-old royal residence 20 miles (30 kilometers) west of London, but was shown live on television.Coronavirus restrictions meant that instead of the 800 mourners expected in the longstanding plans for Philip's funeral, only 30 people were allowed inside the castle's St. George’s Chapel, including the queen, her four children and her eight grandchildren.Following strict social distancing rules during the pandemic, the queen set an example even in grief, sitting apart from family members who were arrayed around the church.Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, sat opposite the monarch alongside his wife, Camilla. Prince Andrew was two seats to the queen's left. Prince William and his wife, Kate, sat directly opposite from his brother, Prince Harry, who had traveled back from California without his pregnant wife, Meghan.People across Britain observed one minute of silence in honor of Philip just before the funeral got underway. Under soft spring sunshine, some locals earlier stopped outside the castle to leave flowers, but people largely heeded requests by police and the palace not to gather because of the pandemic.Philip's coffin traveled to the chapel on a specially adapted Land Rover designed by the prince himself. The coffin was draped in his personal standard and topped with his Royal Navy cap, sword and a wreath of flowers.For the procession, senior military commanders lined up in front of the vehicle. The children of Philip and the queen — Charles, Princess Anne, Andrew and Prince Edward — walked behind the hearse, while the 94-year-old queen traveled to the chapel in a Bentley car.Grandsons Prince William and Prince Harry also walked behind the coffin, although not side by side. The brothers, whose relationship has been strained amid Harry’s decision to quit royal duties and move to California, flanked their cousin Peter Phillips, the son of Anne.For many viewers, the moment stirred memories of William and Harry at 15 and 12, walking behind the coffin of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997, accompanied by their grandfather Philip, in a London ceremony televised around the world.Later Saturday, the two brothers were seen walking together and chatting as the mourners left the chapel after the service.The funeral reflected Philip's military ties, both as a ceremonial commander of many units and as a veteran of war. More than 700 military personnel took part, including army bands, Royal Marine buglers and an honor guard drawn from across the armed forces.Inside the Gothic chapel, the setting for centuries of royal weddings and funerals, the service was simple and somber.The ceremony began with Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby entering the chapel ahead of the coffin, followed by Philip’s children and three of his eight grandchildren, as a four-member, socially distanced choir sang “I am the resurrection and the life.”There was no sermon, at Philip’s request, and no family eulogies or readings, in keeping with royal tradition. But Dean of Windsor David Conner said the country had been enriched by Philip’s “unwavering loyalty to our queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith.”Philip spent almost 14 years in the Royal Navy and saw action in the Mediterranean Sea, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific during World War II. Several elements of his funeral had a maritime theme, including the hymn “Eternal Father, Strong to Save,” which is associated with seafarers and asks God: “O hear us when we cry to thee/For those in peril on the sea.”Leading a prayer, Conner said: “Grant unto him the assurance of thine ancient promise that thou wilt ever be with those who go down to the sea in ships and occupy their business in great waters.”As Philip’s coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault, Royal Marine buglers sounded “Action Stations,” an alarm that alerts sailors to prepare for battle. Its inclusion, after the traditional bugle call of “The Last Post,” was a personal request from Philip.Philip was placed in the vault alongside the remains of 24 other royals, including three kings of England. But it will likely not be his permanent resting place. After the queen's death, she and Philip are expected to be buried in the Royal Burial Ground on the Frogmore Estate close to Windsor Castle.Along with Philip’s children and grandchildren, the 30 funeral guests included other senior royals and several of his German relatives. Philip was born a prince of Greece and Denmark and, like the queen, is related to a thicket of European royal families.Ahead of the funeral, Buckingham Palace released a photo of the queen and Philip, smiling and relaxing on blankets in the grass in the Scottish Highlands in 2003. The palace said the casual photo was a favorite of the queen.For decades, Philip was a fixture of British life, renowned for his founding of the Duke of Edinburgh’s Awards program that encouraged youths to challenge themselves and for a blunt-spoken manner that at times included downright offensive remarks. He lived in his wife’s shadow, but his death has sparked a reflection about his role, and new appreciation from many in Britain.“He was a character, an absolute character,” said Jenny Jeeves as she looked at the floral tributes in Windsor. “He was fun, he was funny. Yes, he made quite a few gaffes, but it depends which way you took it, really. Just a wonderful husband, father, and grandfather, and a good example to all of us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-laid-to-rest-as-sombre-queen-elizabeth-ii-sits-alone-101618678915308.html
17-04-2021||World||US West prepares for possible 1st water shortage declaration||The man-made lakes that store water supplying millions of people in the U.S. West and Mexico are projected to shrink to historic lows in the coming months, dropping to levels that could trigger the federal government's first-ever official shortage declaration and prompt cuts in Arizona and Nevada.The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation released 24-month projections this week forecasting that less Colorado River water will cascade down from the Rocky Mountains through Lake Powell and Lake Mead and into the arid deserts of the U.S. Southwest and the Gulf of California. Water levels in the two lakes are expected to plummet low enough for the agency to declare an official shortage for the first time, threatening the supply of Colorado River water that growing cities and farms rely on.It comes as climate change means less snowpack flows into the river and its tributaries, and hotter temperatures parch soil and cause more river water to evaporate as it streams through the drought-plagued American West.The agency’s models project Lake Mead will fall below 1,075 feet (328 meters) for the first time in June 2021. That's the level that prompts a shortage declaration under agreements negotiated by seven states that rely on Colorado River water: Arizona, California, Colorado, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming.The April projections, however, will not have binding impact. Federal officials regularly issue long-term projections but use those released each August to make decisions about how to allocate river water. If projections don't improve by then, the Bureau of Reclamation will declare a Level 1 shortage condition. The cuts would be implemented in January.Arizona, Nevada and Mexico have voluntarily given up water under a drought contingency plan for the river signed in 2019. A shortage declaration would subject the two U.S. states to their first mandatory reductions. Both rely on the Colorado River more than any other water source, and Arizona stands to lose roughly one-third of its supply.Water agency officials say they’re confident their preparation measures, including conservation and seeking out alternative sources, would allow them to withstand cuts if the drought lingers as expected."The study, while significant, is not a surprise. It reflects the impacts of the dry and warm conditions across the Colorado River Basin this year, as well as the effects of a prolonged drought that has impacted the Colorado River water supply,” officials from the Arizona Department of Water Resources and Central Arizona Project said in a joint statement.In Nevada, the agency that supplies water to most of the state has constructed “straws” to draw water from further down in Lake Mead as its levels fall. It also has created a credit system where it can bank recycled water back into the reservoir without having it count toward its allocation.Colby Pellegrino, director of water resources for the Southern Nevada Water Authority, reassured customers that those preparation measures would insulate them from the effects of cuts. But she warned that more action was needed.“It is incumbent upon all users of the Colorado River to find ways to conserve,” Pellegrino said in a statement.The Bureau of Reclamation also projected that Lake Mead will drop to the point they worried in the past could threaten electricity generation at Hoover Dam. The hydropower serves millions of customers in Arizona, California and Nevada.To prepare for a future with less water, the bureau has spent 10 years replacing parts of five of the dam's 17 turbines that rotate to generate power. Len Schilling, a dam manager with the bureau, said the addition of wide-head turbines allow the dam to operate more efficiently at lower water levels. He said the turbines will be able to generate power almost to a point called “deadpool,” when there won't be enough water for the dam to function.But Schilling noted that less water moving through Hoover Dam means less hydropower to go around.“As the elevation declines at the lake, then our ability to produce power declines as well because we have less water pushing on the turbines," he said.The hydropower costs substantially less than the energy sold on the wholesale electricity market because the government charges customers only for the cost of producing it and maintaining the dam.Lincoln County Power District General Manager Dave Luttrell said infrastructure updates, less hydropower from Hoover Dam and supplemental power from other sources like natural gas raised costs and alarmed customers in his rural Nevada district.“Rural economies in Arizona and Nevada live and die by the hydropower that is produced at Hoover Dam. It might not be a big deal to NV Energy,” he said of Nevada's largest utility. “It might be a decimal point to Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. But for Lincoln County, it adds huge impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-west-prepares-for-possible-1st-water-shortage-declaration-101618678267990.html
17-04-2021||World||China carrying out drives to recruit Tibetans amid border standoff with India||China’s military has stepped up efforts to recruit more Tibetans amid the dragging border standoff with India on the Line of Actual Control (LAC), holding special recruitment drives across Tibet Autonomous Region since the beginning of the year, people familiar with developments said.People’s Liberation Army (PLA) officials have criss-crossed the Tibet Autonomous Region to hold recruitment drives and to pick up Tibetan recruits who were already at PLA camps, the people cited above said on condition of anonymity.There are also reports the PLA intends to create a Special Tibetan Army Unit, the people said, citing intelligence reports and communications intercepts from three separate intelligence agencies. If this were to go ahead, this would be the first PLA formation comprising soldiers from a specific ethnicity, the people added.PLA officials from Lhasa visited Rudok town in Ngari Prefecture in the far west of Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) in the third week of February to recruit Tibetans as soldiers, according to an intelligence report. These officials later travelled to Zanda or Tsamda County, one of the border counties of TAR to select Tibetan recruits from several PLA camps for possible induction into the special unit, the report said.The PLA also reportedly carried out a recruitment drive in Lhasa to induct a sizeable number of Tibetans. This drive was conducted against the backdrop of the standoff in Ladakh and the PLA is expected to raise more border defence regiments comprising Tibetans, the people said.Security officials in New Delhi have been keeping a close watch on these developments, which come at a time when the disengagement process along the LAC has stalled after a limited drawdown of troops, armoured formations and artillery on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February.The latest meeting of senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held on April 9 ended without any forward movement on disengagement at other friction points such as Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, though the two sides agreed to maintain stability on the ground and avoid any new incidents.“These new recruitment drives are being held at a time when there are reports that mainstream Chinese troops from lower altitudes faced problems during their deployment in Tibet. We have intercepts showing their troops suffered from health problems such as severe mountain sickness and high altitude pulmonary oedema,” said an official.“It is also meant to send a message to India and to Tibetans in India,” the official added.According to reports in the PLA Daily, China’s military has been introducing guidelines to prevent troops serving on the Tibetan plateau from getting altitude sickness. “Altitude sickness is a common problem that has been affecting troops stationed on the plateau for a long time,” an unnamed army officer was quoted as saying by PLA Daily.Last August, India deployed the Special Frontier Force (SFF), a secret paramilitary force comprising ethnic Tibetans, for an operation to take over strategic heights on the south bank of Pangong Lake. A Tibetan soldier was killed in a landmine blast during the operation and senior Indian officials attended his funeral – the first acknowledgement of the SFF being used along the LAC and a move seen as a signal to China.The people said the special recruitment drives are meant to induct Tibetans into the PLA and not the Tibetan militia units, which play a role in patrolling, logistics and transporting supplies using mules and horses. These militia units specialise in operating at high altitudes and their training too has been intensified since last year, according to reports in China’s state media.The special recruitment drives for Tibetans also come in the wake of informal efforts by the Chinese side last year to forge a special relationship with the Nepali Army on the lines of its relationship with the Indian Army. The Nepal Army chief is an honorary chief of the Indian Army and the same honour is conferred by the other side and Nepalese Gurkha soldiers serve in the Indian Army.“The Chinese side made an informal proposal in this regard, hoping it could open the doors for possible recruitment of Gurkha soldiers but it was rebuffed,” said a person familiar with developments.A second person confirmed the matter and said the moves in Nepal and Tibet were aimed at opening new fronts against India.According to China’s official statistics from 2010, there were 2.1 million Han servicemen, compared to 4,300 Tibetans. More recent figures aren’t readily available.India-based Tibet specialist Claude Arpi said altitude sickness or lack of oxygen has been an issue with the PLA. Unlike Indian soldiers, most PLA soldiers aren’t trained enough to acclimatise to high altitude, and only local Tibetan scouts may be accustomed to such altitudes, he said.“There have been repeated articles in Chinese state media on the oxygen issue,” Arpi said, adding that on the Indian side, troops drawn from Ladakh or ethnic Tibetans are more accustomed to high altitudes and genetically face fewer problems.Given the secrecy with which PLA functions, there is little evidence in the open of China putting together a single ethnicity-based unit but the incidence of altitude sickness among border soldiers could be one reason why the PLA would want to recruit more Tibetans.From the propaganda aspect, recruitment of Tibetans would be interesting as TAR will celebrate its 70th anniversary of what Beijing calls the “peaceful liberation” this year, Arpi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-conducting-special-drives-to-recruit-more-tibetans-amid-lac-standoff-101618677562088.html
17-04-2021||World||5 killed in Bangladesh after police open fire at Chinese joint venture||At least five people were killed and several others left injured in a clash between police and workers on Saturday at a Chinese joint venture coal-fired plant in Banshkhali of Bangladesh's Chittagong region, said police. The workers had been protesting against the authorities since Friday over non-payment of dues and flexibility in work hours to let them perform Islamic rituals during the month of Ramzan.The eyewitnesses said that a Chinese supervisor even kicked the workers who were offering Namaz the previous day. The agitated workers attacked the power plant when a meeting between their leaders and the management failed to resolve the crisis. According to the eyewitnesses, the workers set a fire inside the power plant.Chittagong Range Deputy Inspector General Anwar Hossain said that police were attacked when they tried to intervene, compelling them to open fire on the workers. Banshkhali Police Station OC (investigation) Azizul Islam confirmed that five people died in the clash, adding that six police personnel were also injured. While four people died on the spot, one succumbed to injuries after he was admitted to Chattogram Medical College Hospital.The five dead workers have been identified as Rony Hossain, Mohammad Rahat, Shuvo, Mahmud Reza, and Raihan.The under-construction power plant in Banshkhali has been marred with controversy ever since the S. Alam Group, a leading Bangladeshi industrial conglomerate, signed a joint venture agreement with two Chinese companies for the 1224 MW power project. The Chinese companies are working as engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractors for the plant.In 2016, four people lost their lives during a clash after locals protested against S. Alam Group’s acquisition of land in the West Boroghona area for plant’s construction. The S. Alam Group paid a penalty of 2 billion Takas to keep the controversial project alive. The plant was scheduled to start supplying electricity to the national grid from November 2019 but controversies surrounding the project have jeopardised the progress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/5-killed-in-bangladesh-after-police-open-fire-at-chinese-joint-venture-101618671782068.html

"However, in these videos, Phelps also made statements about killing Vice President Harris."In one of the videos, "Phelps stated: 'Kamala Harris you are going to die. Your days are numbered already," added the complaint.In another video on February 18, Phelps stated, "I'm going to the gun range. ... I swear to God, today is your day you're gonna die. 50 days from today, mark this day down."Phelps expressed how she believes Harris not actually 'Black' and how during inauguration she disrespectfully put her hand on her clutch purse instead of the Bible.The complaint said investigators also found a photo that showed Phelps at a shooting range, holding a pistol and smiling next to a target with bullet holes.She also applied for a concealed weapons permit in February, the complaint said.On March 3, the Secret Service and detectives from the Miami-Dade Police Department went to Phelps' residence to interview her, but she refused to speak with them at the time, according to the complaint.On March 6, a Secret Service agent went to speak with Phelps at her home. According to the complaint, Phelps said, "She was angry at the time about Kamala Harris becoming Vice President but that she is 'over it now.'||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-you-are-going-to-die-florida-woman-charged-over-alleged-threats-101618671472976.html

The Interfax news agency earlier cited the FSB as saying Oleksandr Sosoniuk was taken into custody when he tried to obtain classified information from Russian law enforcement databases during a meeting with a Russian citizen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-beefs-up-warship-presence-in-black-sea-as-ukraine-tensions-simmer-101618662958101.html

17-04-2021||World||Pressure mounts for German Chancellor Merkel's bloc to end its power struggle||Pressure mounted Saturday on the two contenders hoping to lead German Chancellor Angela Merkel's center-right bloc into September's national election to end their power struggle and agree which of them will run to succeed her.Armin Laschet, the leader of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, and Markus Soeder, the head of its smaller Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union, have both declared their interest in running for chancellor.Germany’s parliamentary election Sept. 26 will determine who succeeds Merkel, who isn’t seeking a fifth term after nearly 16 years in power.Laschet and Soeder are the governors of Germany’s two most populous states, North Rhine-Westphalia and Bavaria respectively. Soeder has much better poll ratings, but Laschet is the recently elected leader of the political party that is by far the largest one.On Monday, Laschet rallied the CDU leadership behind his bid and called for a quick decision. But Soeder said the matter shouldn't be resolved “only in a small back room,” pointing to his superior poll ratings — angering many in the CDU.On Tuesday, the two contenders appeared at a closed-door meeting of the Union bloc's joint parliamentary group in Berlin that, according to German media reports, laid bare the divisions in the CDU. They held out the prospect of a decision by the end of the week.There has been little sign of movement since, but mounting calls for a decision amid fears that the power struggle could do significant damage.Defense Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, Laschet's predecessor as CDU leader, appealed Saturday for Laschet and Soeder to come to an agreement.“No one can relieve them of this leadership responsibility,” she said, according to the dpa news agency.Friedrich Merz, whom Laschet defeated in January to become the party leader, said: “Reach an agreement, Markus Soeder and Armin Laschet. This country needs prospects. This country needs leadership.”The center-left Social Democrats nominated Finance Minister Olaf Scholz as their candidate for chancellor months ago. The environmentalist Greens are to announce Monday which of their co-leaders, Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck, will make their first run for the chancellery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pressure-mounts-for-german-chancellor-merkel-s-bloc-to-end-its-power-struggle-101618668873025.html
17-04-2021||World||Iran nuclear talks set to resume in Vienna||Talks on Iran's nuclear programme aimed at salvaging a 2015 nuclear deal were set to resume Saturday, a day after Tehran said it had started producing uranium at 60 percent purity.The Islamic republic had declared it would sharply ramp up its enrichment of uranium earlier this week, after an attack on its Natanz nuclear facility that it blamed on arch-foe Israel.The incidents cast a shadow over talks in Vienna aimed at rescuing the nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers that then US president Donald Trump abandoned almost three years ago.The European Union said Saturday's talks would involve EU officials and representatives from Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran.The talks are aimed at determining which sanctions the United States should lift and the measures Iran has to take to come into compliance with the accord.The Russian ambassador to Vienna, Mikhail Ulyanov, spoke of "slow but steady progress in the negotiations on restoration of the nuclear deal" on Twitter.Ali Akbar Salehi, head of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, confirmed Iran was now producing uranium enriched to 60 percent purity, taking the country closer to the 90 percent level required for use in a nuclear weapon."The enrichment of uranium to 60 percent is underway" in Natanz, he said, quoted by Tasnim news agency.Iran has repeatedly insisted it is not seeking an atomic bomb, but at that rate of production, it could take the Islamic republic 322 days to produce the amount of 60 percent enriched uranium needed to make one bomb, based on the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) criteria.But this would require Iran to have a sufficient amount of 20 percent enriched uranium, which it does not have, according to the latest IAEA data.Tehran has gradually rolled back its nuclear commitments since 2019, a year after Washington withdrew from the accord and began imposing sanctions.The 2015 deal, known formally as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), gave Iran relief from sanctions in return for curbs on its nuclear programme.Under the accord, Iran had committed to keep enrichment to 3.67 percent, though it had stepped this up to 20 percent in January.Negotiations aimed at ensuring the return of the United States to the JCPOA and the lifting of sanctions resumed this week in Vienna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-talks-set-to-resume-in-vienna-101618667555769.html

17-04-2021||World||‘More aggressive’: Brazil asks women to delay pregnancy ‘if possible’ over coronavirus variant||Brazil has asked women to postpone pregnancy “if possible”, saying the variants of coronavirus have been more aggressive in pregnant women, according to CNN. Raphael Camara, secretary of primary health care of the Brazilian health ministry, told a news conference that women should consider delaying pregnancy “a bit to a better time so that (they) can have a more peaceful pregnancy.""We cannot say this to those who are 42, 43 years old, of course, but for a young woman who can, the best thing is to wait for a little," Camara was quoted by CNN as saying.Brazil is the second worst-hit country in terms of deaths related to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and a team of public health experts warned this week that the Latin American nation could be head for even worse times because of a “dangerous combination of inaction and wrongdoing.” Brazil has so far reported more than 368,000 deaths related to Covid-19, according to Johns Hopkins University.Camara said that although the ministry is still working on the studies related to pregnancy and coronavirus variants, “the clinical view of experts shows that the new variant has a more aggressive action on pregnant women”, per CNN. “Before, [severity] was linked to the end of the pregnancy, but now (they) see a more serious evolution in the second trimester and even in the first trimester," he added.In a report published in the journal Science, a team of researchers highlighted the factors behind the worsening situation in Brazil, including the promotion of chloroquine as treatment despite a lack of evidence and lack of coordinated national strategy. The report was authored by Marcia Castro of the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, experts at the University of São Paulo and elsewhere.The variant of concern (VOC), P.1, first emerged in the Brazilian city of Manaus is estimated to be 1.4-2.2 times more transmissible, with the ability to evade immunity from previous non-P.1 infection, according to a modelling study. Researchers at the University of São Paulo, in collaboration with Imperial College London and the University of Oxford, recently estimated that the P.1 variant evades 25-61% of protective immunity arising from infection with previously circulating variants.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-asks-women-to-postpone-pregnancy-if-possible-over-coronavirus-variant-101618662883059.html

Authorities are trying to establish whether he contracted the virus in Dubai where he works, on the flight or in Hong Kong.“This case is very worrisome,” Chuang Shuk-kwan, head of the communicable disease branch of the Hong Kong health department, said at a briefing on Saturday. “We can’t rule out the possibility that he contracted it from the community. We have never identified a local case with the variant.”Covid Claims 3 Million Lives as Burden Shifts to Poorer NationsThe preliminary test result from the confirmed case involved the N501Y mutant strain of the coronavirus, which is highly transmissible, she said. The building is “relatively old” and houses some sub-divided units, according to a government statement.Asymptomatic residents in the 48 units on all 11 floors were transferred to quarantine centers, while those with symptoms were hospitalized, according to the statement. Authorities also ordered compulsory testing for anyone who had visited the building for more than two hours in the eight days since April 9.Hong Kong reported 18 new confirmed cases on Saturday, eight of which were locally transmitted and the source of six of those was untraceable.“Given the possible resurgence of cases, we need to be vigilant and we urge everyone to get vaccinated as soon as possible,” Ronald Lam, controller of the Centre for Health Protection, said at the briefing.As of late Friday, the city had reported a total of 11,635 Covid-19 cases and 209 deaths. Hong Kong has administered more than 1 million doses of vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-81-tenants-of-a-building-quarantined-after-mutant-strain-detected-101618657672367.html
17-04-2021||World||Expert warns ‘double mutant’ variant could derail UK’s ‘escape plan’, says no travel ban on India 'mystifying'||Amid a massive surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in India, a leading scientist has warned that the emergence of double mutation variant could detail Britain’s roadmap out of the lockdown. The British government is expected to lift all coronavirus-induced restrictions by June 21 as nearly half of the population has so far received at least one dose of authorised Covid-19 vaccines.Danny Altmann, an immunology professor at Imperial College, told BBC that the UK should be on its guard against another wave of infections after 77 cases of the B.1.617 variant, which was first detected in India, were found. The new strain with two mutations, the E484Q and L452R, is thought to be driving India’s new wave of infections that has made it the second worst-hit country, surpassing Brazil."I think we should be terribly concerned about it," Altmann told BBC News. “They (variants of concern) are things that can most scupper our escape plan at the moment and give us a third wave. They are a worry,” he added.However, the Public Health England (PHE) has currently designated the new strain as a variant under investigation (VUI) and not as a variant of concern (VOC). The UK has also not placed India on its “red list”, which means incoming travellers from India won’t be required to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 10 days.Also Read | India is fighting double mutant virus variant. Should we worry?Altmann said he found it “mystifying” and “slightly confounding” that travellers from India were not required to stay in a hotel. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to visit India later this month, which has reportedly been shortened because of the Covid-19 situation in the country.Apart from the UK, the double mutation has been detected in countries like the US, Australia, New Zealand, Germany, Singapore, Belgium, and Ireland, according to a statement released by India’s ministry of health and family welfare. “Higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet,” the ministry said.Paul Hunter, professor in medicine at the University of East Anglia, said that there’s laboratory evidence that the variant has two ‘escape mutations’, which makes it easier for the virus to slip past antibodies.“Basically, applying what we know about other human coronaviruses would suggest that this is going to be even less controlled by vaccine,” Hunter told ITV. “But we don't know that for certain at the moment,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-double-mutant-variant-could-derail-uk-s-escape-plan-warns-expert-101618655206673.html

The fire has been contained but the hospital has been closed for seven days, said David Makhura, premier of Gauteng province where Johannesburg is located.Four hundred patients have already been moved to other public hospitals in the metropolitan area and an additional 270 patients will be moved y the end of Saturday, Makhura said.Early Saturday morning the fire caused the third floor of the hospital’s parking garage to collapse.Sixty firefighters have been battling the blaze through the night. The fire started Friday morning and had been doused by the afternoon but then it reignited in the evening and continued burning overnight.The fire has caused extensive damage to the hospital, which has more than 1,000 beds and serves Johannesburg, a city of 6 million people, and the surrounding Gauteng province. It is one of the biggest public hospitals in the country.It is also a designated treatment center for Covid-19 in Gauteng. According to Makhura, the hospital had 13 Covid-19 patients, two in ICU and 11 in general wards at the time of the fire. They have all been transferred to other hospitals.“The fire has been contained into some areas. We are shutting down the hospital as a precautionary measure because there is a lot of smoke that went into other areas, including wards," said Makhura.The fire started in a storeroom for dry surgical supplies, according to officials.Firefighters reported that the blaze re-started from smoldering medical supplies, including supplies of personal protective equipment used by staff treating patients with Covid-19, Makhura said. An investigation into the fire will be launched, he said.“Our firefighters have been receiving help from others in neighboring municipalities. It has been a tedious process trying to move patients. At first, we moved them to wards that were far away from the fire but we started to evacuate them,” said Gauteng health spokeswoman Kwara Kekana. “That is still a process that is ongoing, we are now referring all patients to other hospitals.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fire-breaks-out-at-johannesburg-hospital-nearly-700-patients-being-evacuated-101618655976688.html

It showed a passport-style photograph of a man it identified as Karimi, saying he was born in the nearby city of Kashan, Iran.The report did not elaborate how Karimi would have gotten access to one of the most secure facilities in the Islamic Republic.The report also aired what appeared to be an Interpol “red notice” seeking his arrest. The arrest notice was not immediately accessible on Interpol's public-facing database. Interpol, based in Lyon, France, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The TV report said “necessary actions” are underway to bring him back to Iran through legal channels, without elaborating. The supposed Interpol “red notice” listed his travel history as including Spain, the United Arab Emirates, Kenya, Ethiopia, Qatar, Turkey, Uganda, Romania and another country that was illegible.The report also showed centrifuges in a hall, as well as what appeared to be caution tape up at the Natanz facility.The attack Sunday, suspected to have been carried out by Israel, has inflamed a shadow war between the two nations. Iran has begun enriching a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity — its highest level ever — in response amid talks in Vienna aimed at saving its tattered nuclear deal with world powers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-names-suspect-in-natanz-nuclear-facility-attack-says-he-fled-country-101618655068225.html

A shotgun was seized from his home.FBI agents who interviewed the teenager last April found no criminal violation at the time and determined he possessed no "racially motivated violent extremism ideology," said Paul Keenan, special agent in charge of the FBI's Indianapolis field office.But the New York-based Sikh Coalition, a civil rights advocacy group, called for a full investigation into "the possibility of bias as factor" in the FedEx killings.Four members of the Sikh faith - three women and a man - were among the dead in Thursday night's shooting spree, and at least one Sikh individual was wounded, said Gurinder Singh Khalsa, a businessman and leader of the local Sikh community who said he was briefed by victims' families.Singh Khalsa also told Reuters the majority of employees at the FedEx site are Sikhs, whose religion originated in the Punjab region of the Indian subcontinent.He said the FedEx center was known for hiring older members of the local Sikh community who did not necessarily speak fluent English.The Sikh Coalition's executive director, Satjeet Kaur, said more than 8,000 Sikh-Americans live in Indiana.SPATE OF VIOLENCEThe recent surge in U.S. mass gun violence began on March 16 when a gunman shot eight people to death, including six Asian woman, at three Atlanta-area day spas before he was arrested.That rampage heightened tensions already brewing over a rise in hate crimes and discrimination directed at Asian Americans in recent years, stoked in part by racially inflammatory rhetoric about the coronavirus pandemic's origins in China.Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on the United States perpetrated by the Islamist militant group al Qaeda, Sikh men have sometimes been confused publicly with Muslims because they wear turbans with their hair and beards uncut.The eight people killed in Thursday night's violence ranged in age from 19 to 74. The shooting lasted only a couple of minutes and was over by the time police responded to the scene, Craig McCartt, the Indianapolis police department's deputy chief, said on Friday.Witnesses described a chaotic attack, as the gunman opened fire with a rifle in the parking lot before entering the facility and continuing to shoot, leaving victims both inside and outside the building. Officers found the suspect dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound.McCartt told reporters the suspect was believed to have last worked at the plant in the fall of 2020.Asked what brought him back to the facility on Thursday night, McCartt replied: "I wish I could answer that."Neither authorities nor FedEx officials would say what ended Hole's employment at FedEx.(Reporting by Mark Hosenball in Washington, Alexandra Ulmer in San Francisco, Maria Caspani, Joseph Ax and Barbara Goldberg in New York, and Shubham Kalia and Kanishka Singh in Bengaluru, India.

Alam Group, does not meet environmental impact standards and was built without public consultation.It is one of the biggest investments made by Chinese companies in Bangladesh. The deal was one of many announced when President Xi Jinping visited in 2016.S.

17-04-2021||World||'They said they'd protect me': French nationals refuse embassy call to leave Pak||The French community in Pakistan is torn between disbelief, fear and annoyance in reaction to their embassy's call for them to leave the country after Francophobic rioting this week by an extremist Islamic party.Most, it seems, have decided to stay put.In a terse three-line email, accompanied by the words "urgent", the embassy in Islamabad on Thursday recommended its nationals and French companies temporarily leave Pakistan, because of "serious threats".The email, which did not specify the nature of the risks, caused shock and consternation among the few hundred-strong French community.Jean-Michel Quarantotti, who has taught French at the American school in Islamabad for three years, was first alerted to the embassy advisory by a student."I won't hide from you that at first I felt a little bit of fear, panic," he told AFP."It's not my first foreign country -- I did a lot before arriving in Pakistan -- but I was really shocked. I didn't expect to go through this."His first thought was to pack up and leave, but after discussing the situation with colleagues he said reason took over from emotion."The Pakistanis around me advised me to stay," he said. "They told me that they would protect me."It was very touching to see the solidarity around me, from people who told me: 'We are here for you, do not worry, we will defend you'."The embassy announcement came after days of violent protests orchestrated by the radical Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP) after the arrest in Lahore Monday of leader Saad Rizvi, who had called for a march on the capital to demand the expulsion of the French ambassador.Four policemen were killed in the rioting.The TLP has been behind several anti-France rallies since President Emmanuel Macron defended the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to repupublish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad -- an act deemed blasphemous by many Muslims.'Highs and lows'Many of the French people contacted by AFP questioned the timing of the embassy's message as the Pakistani government had just announced the ban on the TLP and seemed to have the situation under control."Yes, there are a lot of risks to live here," said Quarantotti, "but we don't need to panic the French community with words that are badly chosen."We wonder a little why France needed to publicise this message at the international level, when it could have given a much more discreet message to the (French) community".Fellow national Julien -- an assumed name because he does not wish to divulge his identity -- has also chosen to stay put."It's a recommendation, so I won't leave," he told AFP.He also refused his employer's offer to repatriate him to Europe or put armed guards outside his home."Anyway, since October, November, it's been all ups and downs. So we'll wait for it to calm down," the Islamabad resident said."The watchword is vigilance," added Laurent Cinot, a consultant for the World Bank who arrived in the capital less than two months ago.He said any threat was not from ordinary Pakistanis, but only the TLP.Another Frenchman living in Lahore -- who is not allowed to give his name or that of his French company for security reasons -- has spent nearly ten years in Pakistan in two stints."Since I've been here a long time, I didn't really panic," he said.Still, he is the only French national contacted by AFP who will leave -- on the orders of his employers.For Cinot, the embassy message will have the unfortunate effect of sending back another very negative picture of Pakistan to France."It does not deserve it because, honestly, it is a magnificent country with people who are quite fascinating and kind... extremely kind," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/they-said-they-d-protect-me-french-nationals-refuse-embassy-call-to-leave-pak-101618651418576.html
17-04-2021||World||Global fatalities due to Covid-19 cross 3 million-mark: Report||The global death toll from the coronavirus topped a staggering 3 million people Saturday amid repeated setbacks in the worldwide vaccination campaign and a deepening crisis in places such as Brazil, India and France.The number of lives lost, as compiled by Johns Hopkins University, is about equal to the population of Kyiv, Ukraine; Caracas, Venezuela; or metropolitan Lisbon, Portugal. It is bigger than Chicago (2.7 million) and equivalent to Philadelphia and Dallas combined.And the true number is believed to be significantly higher because of possible government concealment and the many cases overlooked in the early stages of the outbreak that began in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019.When the world back in January passed the bleak threshold of 2 million deaths, immunization drives had just started in Europe and the United States. Today, they are underway in more than 190 countries, though progress in bringing the virus under control varies widely.While the campaigns in the US and Britain have hit their stride and people and businesses there are beginning to contemplate life after the pandemic, other places, mostly poorer countries but some rich ones as well, are lagging behind in putting shots in arms and have imposed new lockdowns and other restrictions as virus cases soar.Worldwide, deaths are on the rise again, running at around 12,000 per day on average, and new cases are climbing too, eclipsing 700,000 a day.“This is not the situation we want to be in 16 months into a pandemic, where we have proven control measures,” said Maria Van Kerkhove, one of the World Health Organization’s leaders on Covid-19.In Brazil, where deaths are running at about 3,000 per day, accounting for one-quarter of the lives lost worldwide in recent weeks, the crisis has been likened to a “raging inferno” by one WHO official. A more contagious variant of the virus has been rampaging across the country.As cases surge, hospitals are running out of critical sedatives. As a result, there have been reports of some doctors diluting what supplies remain and even tying patients to their beds while breathing tubes are pushed down their throats.The slow vaccine rollout has crushed Brazilians’ pride in their own history of carrying out huge immunization campaigns that were the envy of the developing world.Taking cues from President Jair Bolsonaro, who has likened the virus to little more than a flu, his Health Ministry for months bet big on a single vaccine, ignoring other producers. When bottlenecks emerged, it was too late to get large quantities in time.Watching so many patients suffer and die alone at her Rio de Janeiro hospital impelled nurse Lidiane Melo to take desperate measures.In the early days of the pandemic, as sufferers were calling out for comfort that she was too busy to provide, Melo filled two rubber gloves with warm water, knotted them shut, and sandwiched them around a patient’s hand to simulate a loving touch.Some have christened the practice the “hand of God,” and it is now the searing image of a nation roiled by a medical emergency with no end in sight.“Patients can’t receive visitors. Sadly, there’s no way. So it’s a way to provide psychological support, to be there together with the patient holding their hand,” Melo said. She added: “And this year it’s worse, the seriousness of patients is 1,000 times greater.”This situation is similarly dire in India, where cases spiked in February after weeks of steady decline, taking authorities by surprise. In a surge driven by variants of the virus, India saw over 180,000 new infections in one 24-hour span during the past week, bringing the total number of cases to over 13.9 million.Problems that India had overcome last year are coming back to haunt health officials. Only 178 ventilators were free Wednesday afternoon in New Delhi, a city of 29 million, where 13,000 new infections were reported the previous day.The challenges facing India reverberate beyond its borders since the country is the biggest supplier of shots to COVAX, the UN-sponsored program to distribute vaccines to poorer parts of the world. Last month, India said it would suspend vaccine exports until the virus’s spread inside the country slows.The WHO recently described the supply situation as precarious. Up to 60 countries might not receive any more shots until June, by one estimate. To date, COVAX has delivered about 40 million doses to more than 100 countries, enough to cover barely 0.25% of the world’s population.Globally, about 87% of the 700 million doses dispensed have been given out in rich countries. While 1 in 4 people in wealthy nations have received a vaccine, in poor countries the figure is 1 in more than 500.In recent days, the US and some European countries put the use of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine on hold while authorities investigate extremely rare but dangerous blood clots. AstraZeneca’s vaccine has likewise been hit with delays and restrictions because of a clotting scare.Another concern: Poorer countries are relying on vaccines made by China and Russia, which some scientists believe provide less protection that those by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.Last week, the director of the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention acknowledged the country’s vaccines offer low protection and said officials are considering mixing them with other shots to improve their effectiveness.In the US, where over 560,000 lives have been lost, accounting for more than 1 in 6 of the world’s Covid-19 deaths, hospitalizations and deaths have dropped, businesses are reopening, and life is beginning to return to something approaching normalcy in several states. The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits tumbled last week to 576,000, a post-Covid-19 low.But progress has been patchy, and new hot spots — most notably Michigan — have flared up in recent weeks. Still, deaths in the US are down to about 700 per day on average, plummeting from a mid-January peak of about 3,400.In Europe, countries are feeling the brunt of a more contagious variant that first ravaged Britain and has pushed the continent’s Covid-19-related death toll beyond 1 million.Close to 6,000 gravely ill patients are being treated in French critical care units, numbers not seen since the first wave a year ago.Dr. Marc Leone, head of intensive care at the North Hospital in Marseille, said exhausted front-line staff members who were feted as heroes at the start of the pandemic now feel alone and are clinging to hope that renewed school closings and other restrictions will help curb the virus in the coming weeks.“There’s exhaustion, more bad tempers. You have to tread carefully because there are a lot of conflicts,” he said. “We’ll give everything we have to get through these 15 days as best we can.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/global-fatalities-due-to-covid-19-cross-3-million-mark-report-101618650714316.html
17-04-2021||World||Royal funerals: A very public affair with pomp, pageantry and sometimes privacy||With a limited guest list, social distancing, and a congregation in facemasks due to coronavirus guidelines, Prince Philip's funeral on Saturday will be a royal funeral like no other.Major send-offs for senior royals since World War II have tended to be very public affairs, with pomp, pageantry and popular fervour.1952: King George VIOn February 6, 1952, King George VI died suddenly after a long illness at the age of 56.At his funeral on February 15, his coffin was carried to Paddington station in west London on a gun carriage from Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster, where he lay in state.It was then transported to St George's Chapel in Windsor where he was laid to rest.A silent crowd lined the route along London's foggy streets during the three-hour procession. Big Ben rang out 56 times to mark the age of the king.His eldest daughter, who at the age of 25 had become Queen Elizabeth II, followed in a horse-drawn coach.A year later on March 24, George's mother, the dowager Queen Mary, died aged 85. Over two days, 120,000 people paid homage at Westminster.1979: Lord MountbattenOn August 27, 1979, Louis Mountbatten, the Queen's cousin and last viceroy of India, was killed at the age of 79, by an IRA bomb placed on his boat.The assassination rocked the United Kingdom. Mountbatten was a decorated naval commander, the uncle of Philip, and mentor of his eldest son, Charles, Prince of Wales.On September 5, hundreds of thousands of people gathered in London along with representatives of the British armed forces, US Marines and French, Canadian, Indian and Burmese soldiers to pay him a solemn farewell.After the service at Westminster Abbey, an escort of six tanks took the coffin to Waterloo station where it was then taken to Romsey, near Southampton, southern England, for burial at the town's abbey.1997: Princess DianaOn September 6, 1997, the country came to a standstill for the funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales, who died in Paris on August 31 in a car crash aged 36.Her death sent shockwaves around the world. Millions of people lined the streets and an estimated 2.5 billion people watched the service on television.When the procession passed Buckingham Palace, Queen Elizabeth II, who had been criticised for her stand-offish initial reaction to the death of the former wife of Prince Charles, publicly bowed her head.Her young sons, princes William and Harry, walked, heads bowed, behind their mother's coffin.Elton John sang his reworked hit "Candle in the Wind" at the Westminster Abbey service. Diana's brother Charles Spencer rebuked the royal family in his eulogy.Diana was buried at Althorp, the family's historic home in Northamptonshire, on an island in the middle of a lake.2002: Princess MargaretLed by Queen Elizabeth II's frail 101-year-old mother, also called Elizabeth, the royal family on February 15, 2002 buried the monarch's younger sister Princess Margaret, who had died six days earlier aged 71 after a series of strokes.The private funeral was attended by some 450 family and friends, including 30 or so members of the royal family such as the Queen, Margaret's ex-husband Lord Snowdon, and her two children Viscount Linley and Lady Sarah Chatto.Despite concerns over her own health, the Queen Mother attended the sombre service at St George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.It was exactly 50 years since she buried her husband, King George VI. In a break with royal tradition, Margaret was cremated.2002: Queen Elizabeth the Queen MotherJust seven weeks after Margaret, Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother died in her sleep on March 30 at Windsor. Her funeral on April 9 marked the end of an era.The royal matriarch was the last empress consort of India and a link to a bygone age. She was much loved as a symbol of resistance to the Nazi enemy during World War II.Over four days, more than 200,000 people filed past her coffin paying their respects.The funeral at Westminster Abbey was attended by more than 2,000 people, including monarchs and representatives from numerous countries.The abbey's tenor bell chimed for 101 minutes to mark every year of the Queen Mother's life.More than a million people lined the 37-kilometre-(23-mile) route taken by the funeral procession to Windsor.She was interred with her husband at the King George VI memorial chapel, where Margaret's ashes also lie.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/royal-funerals-a-very-public-affair-with-pomp-pageantry-and-sometimes-privacy-101618650934924.html
17-04-2021||World||Vaccinated nations fear quick reopening, hurt hopes of aviation revival||Countries that have quickly rolled out coronavirus vaccines are only cautiously reopening for international travel, a sign it will take time for a hoped-for rebound in air traffic to develop.UK airline capacity remains stuck at about one-tenth of 2019 levels, as the government weighs a May 17 target to restart international travel. Israel, where almost 55% of the population has been fully vaccinated, is preparing to welcome visitors in groups from May 23 if they can show they’ve had the jab.Decision makers face a tough balancing act. A second summer in a row without significant air travel would deal a major setback to an already struggling aviation industry, and also to hotels, shops and restaurants that rely on tourism. Meanwhile, there are concerns that premature reopenings will help spread newer strains of the coronavirus and undermine progress toward slowing the spread of the disease.The US may provide a test case. The country has struggled to keep infection rates down, even as a powerful vaccination campaign gathers pace. While international trips to most destinations are still off-limits, domestic capacity is ramping up, with airlines planning to add flights in coming weeks.Chile is already in full retreat. The Latin American country secured supplies from China’s Sinovac Biotech Ltd. and has fully vaccinated more than a quarter of its population. After reopening for air travel in November, it has now backtracked, closing its borders to most this month in response to a spike in Covid-19 cases.Cautious ApproachIn the UK, about half the population has received at least one dose. The government, determined to protect hard-won success bringing down infection rates, has said it’ll look at the data early next month on which countries should be green-listed in its traffic-light system, before making a final decision on the May 17 target to lift the ban on non-essential travel.Airlines have clamored for Britain to lead the way toward a reopening in the region. Wizz Air Holdings Plc Chief Executive Officer Jozsef Varadi said this week that he was no longer counting on a rebound in European air travel during this summer’s high season, citing travel restrictions and problems with vaccine rollouts.Israel has led the world in vaccinations, and while eager to restart tourism, the government has said it will reopen only in stages starting May 23. Groups will go first because they’re easier to monitor, according to Haaretz. No date has been set to allow individual travelers, and health officials will be monitoring infection rates before making a decision.Holding PatternThe nearby United Arab Emirates has remained open to air travel for months, while focusing on rapid vaccinations. Yet its long-distance hubs in Dubai and Abu Dhabi are hovering at about 50% of capacity, dependent on big countries in Europe and Asia to lift curbs.Asia has generally relied on social-distancing measures to keep infection rates low. Singapore has one of the highest vaccination rates in the region, with about 20% of its population receiving at least one dose. Visits from low-risk countries like New Zealand are allowed in certain circumstances. Under one program, business visitors stay in a confined zone near Changi Airport and conduct meetings with locals through a glass wall.Dominant Singapore Airlines Ltd. has been hit hard by travel restrictions because the city-state has no local aviation market. The government is in talks with several countries to set up air travel bubbles, including Hong Kong and Australia.Hungary has administered at least a first vaccine dose to more than 30% of its population. Still, daily infection levels remain elevated, and virus mortality is among the highest in Europe.While foreigners are still barred from entry for personal travel, the Eastern European country has kept its borders open for freight transit. With airline capacity 92% below 2019 levels, the government is eager to vaccinated host soccer fans in June at the Euro 2021 soccer tournament.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccinated-nations-fear-quick-reopening-hurt-hopes-of-aviation-revival-101618650631308.html
17-04-2021||World||14 of nearly 2,600 townships in Mexico refuse Covid-19 vaccination: Authorities||Mexican health authorities said Friday that 14 of the country's roughly 2,600 townships have refused to allow vaccination teams to administer anti-coronavirus doses there.Assistant Health Secretary Hugo López-Gatell said the townships were concentrated largely in the heavily Indigenous southern states of Chiapas and Oaxaca.He did not give specific reasons why those communities did not want to be vaccinated, citing only “cultural and perhaps religious beliefs.”López-Gatell said the decision to refuse vaccines had been made by town councils, adding “we respect that decision.” He said authorities are trying to set up a scheme in which people who wanted vaccines could get them in a neighboring township.Indigenous municipalities in southern Mexico have some degree of autonomy, and some are governed by traditional "use and custom" schemes without political parties or formal elections.Some Chiapas townships dominated by the Zapatista rebels have rejected other government programs, but it was unclear whether they were among those refusing vaccines.Local media in Chiapas reported some communities distrusted the vaccines, or did not think there were enough local cases to justify it.Mexico is currently vaccinating people over 60, as well as some health care workers and teachers. Mexico has administered almost 13.5 million doses to date, still a small amount for a country of 126 million.Mexico has suffered 211,693 test-confirmed deaths, but because the country does so little testing, authorities acknowledge the real toll is over 330,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/14-of-nearly-2-600-townships-in-mexico-refuse-covid-19-vaccination-authorities-101618648904451.html
17-04-2021||World||Biden scraps pledge for quick expansion of allowing refugees into US||President Joe Biden's administration announced Friday he was scrapping his pledge for a rapid expansion in the number of refugees allowed into the United States, but seemed to backtrack later in the day after fierce blowback from within his Democratic Party.The outcry came after a senior administration official said Biden would maintain the historically low ceiling of 15,000 people resettled a year, a number set by predecessor Donald Trump who had imposed hardline border policies.The Biden administration had recently stated it wanted to allow in about 60,000 refugees annually, ramping up to double the following year. That aim had been part of the Democrat's broader promise to end harsh anti-immigrant and anti-refugee sentiment whipped up by Trump.Instead, the White House will keep the strict 15,000 limit so that it can "rebuild" a broken program and deal with pandemic-related complications, said the official, who asked not to be identified.After a top Democrat and refugee aid groups slammed Biden's target as "appallingly low" and "deeply disappointing," the White House issued a statement later Friday saying the number was provisional.Noting that Biden has green-lighted settlement of refugees from previously blocked regions and signed off on flights from those areas to begin within days, the White House said it expected Biden "to set a final, increased refugee cap for the remainder of this fiscal year by May 15," but added that "his initial goal of 62,500 seems unlikely."The admissions system left by the Trump administration was "even more decimated than we'd thought, requiring a major overhaul in order to build back toward the numbers to which we've committed," the senior official said.White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan also said the refugee program needs rebuilding."We will use all 15,000 slots... and work with Congress on increasing admissions and building back to the numbers to which we've committed," he tweeted.About 7,000 slots are reserved for refugees from Africa, 1,000 from East Asia, 1,500 from Europe and Central Asia, 3,000 from Latin America and the Caribbean, plus 1,500 from the Near East and South Asia. There is a reserve of 1,000 slots.- 'Moral leadership' -The policy marks a strong reversal from the Biden administration's vow to let in 62,500 refugees, with 125,000 next year."We offered safe havens for those fleeing violence or persecution" in previous years, when America's "moral leadership on refugee issues" encouraged other nations to open their doors as well, Biden said, promising to make good on his campaign promise of restoring US leadership.Senate Foreign Relations Chair Bob Menendez had sharply criticized the White House, saying it "has not only stymied the number of refugees permitted entrance, it has prevented the State Dept from admitting vetted refugees currently waiting in the system."In a letter to Biden, Menendez called 15,000 "appallingly low.""As we face the largest global refugee crisis in history, with 29.6 million refugees worldwide, resettlement serves as a critical tool in providing protection to those fleeing persecution," he wrote.LIRS, one of the chief organizations helping refugees in the United States, said that as of this month, only 2,000 refugees have been resettled in the current fiscal year.Krish O'Mara Vignarajah, CEO of the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, said "it is deeply disappointing that the administration has elected to leave in place the shameful, record low admissions cap of its predecessor.""There is far more work ahead to reclaim global leadership. The challenge of ramping up admissions to President Biden's pledge of 125,000 is daunting, but it is an occasion we can rise to."Another refugee settlement organization, Kids in Need of Defense, said "our nation is at its best when it honors its commitments.""KIND recognizes that the gutted immigration system inherited by the current administration poses significant challenges, but the need to restore -- and in some cases completely reestablish -- these vital systems cannot be used as an excuse to sidestep America's longtime commitment to protecting refugees fleeing for their lives," president Wendy Young said.Following Biden's apparent change of heart on the refugee numbers, firebrand Democratic congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez cheered the news."This is a testament to the power that people's movements, community advocates, & progressive coalitions have built," she tweeted. "Now let's get these families to their new homes here in the United States."sms-acb/axn||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-scraps-pledge-for-quick-expansion-of-allowing-refugees-into-us-101618636116744.html
17-04-2021||World||Coronavirus is airborne. Experts give 10 reasons in support||SARS-CoV-2, the virus which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), is predominantly transmitted through the air, according to a new study published in The Lancet journal. "There is consistent, strong evidence that SARS-CoV-2 spreads by airborne transmission. Although other routes can contribute, we believe that the airborne route is likely to be dominant. The public health community should act accordingly and without further delay,” according to the analysis by six experts from the UK, the US and Canada.The team of experts, led by the University of Oxford's Trisha Greenhalgh, reviewed published research and identified 10 evidence to support the predominance of the airborne route.The experts pointed out that superspreading events account for substantial SARS-CoV-2 transmission, saying “such events may be the pandemic's primary drivers.” “Detailed analyses of human behaviours and interactions, room sizes, ventilation, and other variables in choir concerts, cruise ships, slaughterhouses, care homes, and correctional facilities, among other settings, have shown patterns—eg, long-range transmission and overdispersion of the basic reproduction number (R0), discussed below—consistent with airborne spread of SARS-CoV-2 that cannot be adequately explained by droplets or fomites.”Also watch: How Covid variants & mass gatherings led to surge of cases in India I HT InsightLong-range transmission of SARS-CoV-2 between people in adjacent rooms but never in each other's presence has been documented in quarantine hotels, they said. “Historically, it was possible to prove long-range transmission only in the complete absence of community transmission,” they added.According to the experts, asymptomatic or presymptomatic transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing is likely to account for "at least a third, and perhaps up to 59%, of all transmission globally and is a key way the virus has spread around the world."Also read | India's Covid-19 tally over 14.52 million with 234,692 fresh infectionsThe transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is higher indoors than outdoors and is substantially reduced by indoor ventilation. “Both observations support a predominantly airborne route of transmission,” they added. “Fifth, nosocomial infections have been documented in health-care organisations, where there have been strict contact-and-droplet precautions and use of personal protective equipment (PPE) designed to protect against droplet but not aerosol exposure,” they added.As the sixth evidence, experts say that viable SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in the air. “In laboratory experiments, SARS-CoV-2 stayed infectious in the air for up to 3 h with a half-life of 1·1 h. Viable SARS-CoV-2 was identified in air samples from rooms occupied by COVID-19 patients in the absence of aerosol-generating health-care procedures13 and in air samples from an infected person's car,” they pointed out in the study.Also read | Daily Covid-19 deaths may soar past 2,000: ReportThey also said that other studies have failed to capture viable SARS-CoV-2 in air samples, saying sampling of airborne virus is technically challenging for several reasons. They said limited effectiveness of some sampling methods for collecting fine particles, viral dehydration during collection, viral damage due to impact forces, reaerosolisation of virus during collection, and viral retention in the sampling equipment are among them.SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in air filters and building ducts in hospitals with Covid-19 patients, according to the study as the researchers pointed out that such locations could be reached only by aerosols. As their eighth evidence, they cited studies involving infected caged animals that were connected to separately caged uninfected animals through an air duct have shown transmission of SARS-CoV-2 that “can be adequately explained only by aerosols.”Also read | Covid-19 in Brazil: Graveyard workers say 600 graves dug every day“Ninth, no study to our knowledge has provided strong or consistent evidence to refute the hypothesis of airborne SARS-CoV-2 transmission,” the experts said. Some people have avoided contracting the coronavirus disease when they have shared air with infected people, but this situation could be explained by a combination of factors. These factors, they said, include variation in the amount of viral shedding between infectious individuals by several orders of magnitude and different environmental (especially ventilation) conditions. “Individual and environmental variation means that a minority of primary cases (notably, individuals shedding high levels of virus in indoor, crowded settings with poor ventilation) account for a majority of secondary infections, which is supported by high-quality contact tracing data from several countries,” they added.There is limited evidence to support other dominant routes of transmission—respiratory droplet or fomite—they said. “Ease of infection between people in close proximity to each other has been cited as proof of respiratory droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2. However, close-proximity transmission in most cases along with distant infection for a few when sharing air is more likely to be explained by dilution of exhaled aerosols with distance from an infected person,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-is-airborne-experts-give-10-reasons-in-support-101618634132170.html

The clause will not apply in cases of sexual assault.The legislation also considers incestuous sex with a minor under 18 to be rape.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-changes-child-rape-law-101618625267810.html

International inspectors already said Iran planned to do so above-ground at its Natanz nuclear site.The move is likely to raise tensions even as Iran negotiates in Vienna over a way to allow the US back into the agreement and lift the crushing economic sanctions it faces. However, its scope provides Iran with a way to quickly de-escalate if it chose.The announcement also marks a significant escalation after the attack that damaged centrifuges at Natanz, an attack this past weekend suspected of having been carried out by Israel. While Israel has yet to claim it, it comes amid a long-running shadow war between the two Mideast rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-an-eye-on-vienna-n-talks-iran-enriching-uranium-to-its-highest-level-101618624682280.html

China has strongly denied the charge.A team of WHO experts, which probed the origin of the coronavirus, concluded last month that “all hypotheses” included the allegation that COVID-19 could have emanated from a bio lab "remained open".World Health Organisation (WHO) Director-General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, while receiving the report of the international experts’ team which visited Wuhan, said on March 30 that “as far as the WHO is concerned, all hypotheses remain on the table”.“This report is a very important beginning, but it is not the end. We have not yet found the source of the virus, and we must continue to follow the science and leave no stone unturned as we do,” he said.Significantly, Tedros said the team has concluded that leak from the WIV as alleged by former US president Donald Trump is the “least likely hypothesis” but it requires further probe.“The team also visited several laboratories in Wuhan and considered the possibility that the virus entered the human population as a result of a laboratory incident.“However, I do not believe that this assessment was extensive enough. Further data and studies will be needed to reach more robust conclusions,” Tedros said.“Although the team has concluded that a laboratory leak is the least likely hypothesis, this requires further investigation, potentially with additional missions involving specialist experts, which I am ready to deploy,” the WHO chief added.Yang Zhanqiu, deputy director of the pathogen biology department at Wuhan University, told the Global Times on Thursday that the law on biosafety is a timely move for China to detail the construction and management of biosafety labs and provide a legal shield for scientific projects on biosafety, including infectious diseases, to be carried out in a scrupulous and professional manner.According to John Hopkins coronavirus tracker, China has so far reported 102,152 cases and 4,845 deaths. Globally the contagion has infected 139,228,122 people and killed 29,89,103, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-builds-more-bio-labs-amid-questions-over-wuhan-lab-s-role-in-covid-origin-101618623140417.html

17-04-2021||World||'NASA rules,' says Elon Musk as SpaceX wins $2.9 billion moon lander contract||NASA awarded billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk's space company SpaceX a $2.9 billion contract to build a spacecraft to bring astronauts to the moon as early as 2024, the agency said on Friday, picking it over Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin and defense contractor Dynetics Inc.Bezos and Musk - the world's first and third richest people respectively, according to Forbes - were competing to lead humankind's return to the moon for the first time sine 1972.Musk's SpaceX bid alone while Amazon.com founder Bezos's Blue Origin partnered with Lockheed Martin Corp, Northrop Grumman Corp and Draper. Dynetics is a unit of Leidos Holdings Inc.Also Read: NASA says SpaceX wins $2.9 billion contract for moon spacecraft"NASA Rules!!" Musk wrote on Twitter after the announcement.The U.S. space agency awarded the contract for the first commercial human lander, part of its Artemis program. NASA said the lander will carry two American astronauts to the lunar surface."We should accomplish the next landing as soon as possible," Steve Jurczyk, NASA's acting administrator, said during the video conference announcement."If they hit their milestones, we have a shot at 2024," Jurczyk added.NASA said SpaceX's Starship includes a spacious cabin and two airlocks for astronaut moon walks and that its architecture is intended to evolve to a fully reusable launch and landing system designed for travel to the Moon, Mars and other destinations in space.SpaceX also responded on Twitter, writing, "We are humbled to help @NASAArtemis usher in a new era of human space exploration."Unlike the Apollo landings from 1969 to 1972 - the only human visits to the moon's surface - NASA is gearing up for a longer-term lunar presence that it envisions as a steppingstone to an even more ambitious plan to send astronauts to Mars. NASA is leaning heavily on private companies built around shared visions for space exploration.SpaceX will be required to make a test flight of the lander to the moon before humans make the journey, NASA official Lisa Watson-Morgan told reporters.NASA had been expected to winnow the lunar lander contest to two companies by the end of April, but instead it picked only SpaceX, a move that deepens their cooperation. On Thursday, NASA said it would send its crew to the International Space Station aboard a SpaceX rocket on April 22.The agency aims to create regular service to the moon and said it will have a separate competition for that contract."We have to be able to provide for recurring lunar services," said Mark Kirasich, deputy associate administrator for NASA's Advanced Exploration Systems division.The announcement added to an extraordinary run for Musk, who has turned electric car maker Tesla Inc. into the world's most-valuable automaker, with a market capitalization of $702 billion.Musk has become a one-person technology conglomerate, launching or controlling companies pursuing space flight, electric cars, neural implants and subterranean tunnel boring.A factor in the choice of SpaceX was "what's the best value to the government," said Kathy Lueders, associate administrator for NASA's Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate.NASA said in a news release that SpaceX's HLS Starship, designed to land on the moon, "leans on the company's tested Raptor engines and flight heritage of the Falcon and Dragon vehicles."NASA's decision was a setback for Bezos, a lifelong space enthusiast who is now more focused on his space venture after having announced in February he would step down as Amazon CEO.The contract was seen by Bezos and other executives as vital to Blue Origin establishing itself as a desired partner for NASA, and also putting the venture on the road to turning a profit.Musk has outlined an ambitious agenda for SpaceX and its reusable rockets, including landing humans on Mars. But in the near term, SpaceX's main business has been launching satellites for Musk's Starlink internet venture, and other satellites and space cargo. SpaceX announced on Wednesday it had raised about $1.16 billion in equity financing.An uncrewed SpaceX Starship prototype rocket failed to land safely on March 30 after a test launch from Boca Chica, Texas. The Starship was one in a series of prototypes for the heavy-lift rocket being developed by SpaceX to carry humans and 100 tons of cargo on future missions to the moon and Mars. A first orbital Starship flight is planned for year's end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-rules-says-elon-musk-as-spacex-wins-2-9-billion-moon-lander-contract-101618618275944.html
17-04-2021||World||Joe Biden-Yoshihide Suga maiden meet focuses on reducing China's growing clout||President Joe Biden welcomed Japan’s Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga to the White House Friday for conversations centered on a growing concern for both leaders: what to do about China.Suga said he and Biden agreed to pursue collaboration on climate change, Covid-19 and the global shortage of semiconductors. But China’s increasingly assertive role in the region loomed large in the talks, Biden’s first in-person meeting at the White House with a foreign leader since taking office.“We committed to working together to take on the challenges from China, and on issues like the East China Sea, the South China Sea as well as North Korea to ensure a future of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Biden said at joint news conference in the White House Rose Garden. Suga said the leaders pledged “peace and stability” in the Taiwan Strait.But the two didn’t announce any major new agreements on China, and Japan must strike a balance between deterring China while keeping Beijing, its largest trading partner, from lashing out. Asked by a reporter, Suga said he wouldn’t provide details of his “diplomatic exchanges” with Biden over the Taiwan Strait.On other topics, Suga said he won Biden’s backing for hosting the Tokyo Olympics, which are set to begin in July, despite the continuing coronavirus pandemic. And Biden said the two leaders agreed to collaborate on technology, including the supply shortage on semiconductors that has idled some U.S. auto manufacturing and created shortages of some consumer products.“We’re going to work together across a range of fields,” Biden said. “From promoting secure and reliable 5G networks to increasing our cooperation on supply chains for critical sectors like semiconductors, to driving joint research in areas like AI, genomics, quantum computing and much more.”Asked about Iran, Biden criticized the Islamic Republic’s decision to further enrich uranium but signaled that the move won’t prevent indirect talks in Vienna aimed at restoring a 2015 nuclear accord from proceeding.Suga had breakfast on Friday with former US Ambassador to Japan Caroline Kennedy and then took part in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery. He also met with Vice President Kamala Harris.Shift to AsiaThe timing of the meeting -- just days after Biden announced a withdrawal from Afghanistan -- provides the most visible sign yet that the American president is determined to shift the center of gravity of US foreign policy to the Indo-Pacific. And for Japan, being first into the White House gives Suga a prime chance to set the tone for ties with Washington over a slew of issues for years to come.Friday’s meeting builds on Secretary of State Antony Blinken’s first visits abroad last month to Japan and South Korea, and it comes amid China’s continuing aggressiveness over Hong Kong, Taiwan and the South China Sea.Ahead of the Biden-Suga talks, China’s foreign ministry spokesman expressed “serious concerns” about negative moves and collusion between the US and Japan, the Associated Press reported. Spokesman Zhao Lijian said the two nations should “avoid words and actions that interfere in China’s internal affairs and harm China’s interests,” according to the AP.China escalated its military intimidation of the government in Taipei by sending 25 fighters, bombers and other planes into the southwest section of Taiwan’s air defense identification zone early this week. Chinese military activity has steadily picked up around democratically ruled Taiwan in recent months.Suga said he and Biden “agreed to oppose any attempts to change the status quo by force or coercion in the East or South China Seas and intimidation of others in the region.”He added: “At the same time, we agreed on the necessity for each of us to engage in frank dialogue with China, and in so doing to pursue stability of international relations while upholding universal values.”Last month, Blinken, his Japanese counterpart Toshimitsu Motegi and both nations’ defense ministers made unusually explicit references to China’s “coercion and destabilizing behavior” and to concerns over human rights.Yet despite Japan’s willingness to criticize China and step up its commitments on climate change, the US and Japanese approaches aren’t entirely in lockstep.While Japan is investing heavily in green energy and has set a zero-emissions target for 2050, it has been criticized for not moving aggressively enough to reduce emissions by 2030. Biden and Suga said they agreed to cooperate on climate change and green energy.And while Japan is worried about China’s military buildup, it is arguably just as concerned about undercutting economic ties. China is Japan’s biggest export market, with more than 13,000 Japanese companies are operating in China, according to a survey published last year.Suga has come under pressure, including from lawmakers in his own party, for Japan to join other major democracies in imposing sanctions on China over human rights abuses. But Japan lacks a legal framework to take such a step, and some members of its business community are opposed.Suga treated lightly on questions about human rights abuses in China. “As we engaged in an exchange of views over the recent situation we also discussed the circumstances in Taiwan and Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region as well,” Suga said.A senior Japanese official said that while Tokyo is becoming increasingly vocal against China on human rights, it doesn’t think that sanctions and trade restrictions are a productive way to deal with Beijing. The official added that Japan and the US plan to work closely on supply-chain resilience, focusing on key areas such as raw materials and semiconductors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-yoshihide-suga-maiden-meet-focuses-on-reducing-china-s-growing-clout-101618617539669.html
17-04-2021||World||Epstein sex-trafficking case: Ghislaine Maxwell to stand trial||Ghislaine Maxwell must stand trial on sex-trafficking charges after a USjudge rejected her dismissal request, paving the way for a trial that could begin as soon as July.The ruling by US District Judge Alison Nathan is the latest blow to the British socialite, who has been jailed in a high-security jail in New York since her arrest in July. While Maxwell, 59, is likely to file additional dismissal bids, the decision Friday defeats many of her key legal arguments.Maxwell is accused of recruiting girls for sex for former boyfriend Jeffrey Epstein in a scheme that ran from 1994 to 2004. She advanced numerous grounds for a dismissal, including a claim that federal prosecutors in Manhattan were barred from charging her as part of a deal that US prosecutors in Florida reached with Epstein in 2007.Nathan rejected the argument, calling Maxwell’s reading of the deal “an improbable interpretation.” In it, the Florida federal prosecutors agreed not to prosecute Epstein if he pleaded guilty to state charges, as he did. Maxwell wasn’t a party to the agreement.“The non-prosecution agreement was expressly limited to the Southern District of Florida” and did not apply in New York, Nathan said.Maxwell denies wrongdoing and has said her accusers are lying. Her lawyers didn’t immediately return an email seeking comment. Jim Margolin, a spokesman for US Attorney Audrey Strauss, declined to comment.In a 34-page decision, Nathan also concluded that prosecutors in New York didn’t wait too long to file charges, as Maxwell claimed, because the government has additional time to bring a case involving sex abuse of minors. The US Attorney in Manhattan began investigating in 2018 after a series of stories in The Miami Herald newspaper.“The court sees no evidence that the government’s delay in bringing these charges was designed to thwart Maxwell’s ability to prepare a defense,” Nathan said.Nathan granted one of Maxwell’s requests, saying she could have a separate trial to defend herself on two perjury charges. Prosecutors say Maxwell lied under oath in 2016 during a civil defamation suit brought by Epstein accuser Virginia Guiffre.Epstein, charged in New York with sex-trafficking in July 2019, was found dead in his jail cell the next month, in what authorities ruled a suicide.Maxwell has asked that her trial, now set for July 12 in Manhattan, be delayed so she can review evidence relating to additional allegations filed against her last month. She’s also appealing the judge’s refusal to release her from jail.The case is US v. Maxwell, 20-cr-330, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/epstein-sex-trafficking-case-ghislaine-maxwell-to-stand-trial-101618616920029.html

At the end of the service Philip will be interred in the chapel's Royal Vault.Who will attend?Only 30 mourners are permitted because of COVID-19 rules. These will include the queen, all senior royals including the duke's grandchildren and their spouses, and members of Prince Philip's family including Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden, and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.Also Read | Prince Philip’s funeral: Here’s the list of 30 attendees; How to watchMembers of the Royal Family will be wearing morning coat with medals, or day dress. The congregation will adhere to national coronavirus guidelines and wear masks for the 50-minute service.A small choir of four will sing pieces of music chosen by the prince before his death and there will be no congregational singing. The queen will be seated alone during the service.The details (note: all times local, GMT is one hour behind British Summer Time)At 11 a.m., Philip's coffin, covered by his standard (flag), a wreath, his naval cap and sword, will be moved by a bearer party from the Queen's Company, 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards from the Private Chapel in Windsor Castle - where it has been lying in rest - to the Inner Hall of the castle.At 2 p.m. the ceremonial aspect begins, and within 15 minutes military detachments drawn from Philip's special military relationships such as the Royal Navy, the Royal Marines, the Grenadier Guards, the Royal Gurkha Rifles, the Intelligence Corps and the Highlanders will line up in the castle's quadrangle.The Foot Guards and the Household Cavalry will line up around the perimeter of the quadrangle.Between 2.20 p.m. and 2.27 p.m., the royals and members of Philip's family not taking part in the procession will leave by car for St George's Chapel.At 2.27 p.m., a specially-coverted Land Rover that Philip helped design will enter the quadrangle.At 2.38 p.m., the coffin will be lifted by the bearer party from the Inner Hall.Bands in the quadrangle will stop playing at 2.40 p.m. and the coffin will emerge from the State Entrance one minute later.The royals in the procession including Philip's four children - Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, along with grandsons William and Harry - will leave the State Entrance behind the coffin, which will be placed onto the Land Rover.At 2.44 p.m., the queen, with a lady-in-waiting, will leave the Sovereign's Entrance in a car known as the State Bentley. The national anthem will be played and as the car reaches the rear of the procession, it will pause briefly.At 2.45 p.m., the procession will step off with the band of the Grenadier Guards leading. The Land Rover will be flanked by pall bearers.As it moves to the chapel, Minute Guns will be fired by The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery and a Curfew Tower Bell will sound.The queen's Bentley will stop outside the Galilee Porch where she will be met by the dean of Windsor, David Conner, who will escort her to her seat in the quire of the Chapel.The coffin will arrive at the foot of the west steps of St George's Chapel at 2:53 p.m. to a guard of honour and band from the Rifles. Positioned in the Horseshoe Cloister will be the Commonwealth defence advisers from Canada, Australia, New Zealand and Trinidad and Tobago.The west steps will be lined by a dismounted detachment of the Household Cavalry. A Royal Naval Piping Party will pipe the "Still" once the Land Rover is stationery at the foot of the steps. A bearer party from the Royal Marines will lift the coffin from the Land Rover as the Piping Party pipe the "Side".The coffin will pause for the national minute of silence at 3 p.m. A gun fired from the East Lawn will signify the start and end.The coffin will then be taken to the top of the steps where it will be received by the dean of Windsor and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby. As the chapel doors close, a piping party will pipe the "Carry On".The coffin will move through the nave to the catafalque in the quire, with senior royals processing behind.Philip's "insignia" - essentially the medals and decorations conferred on him, his field marshal's baton and Royal Air Force Wings, together with insignia from Denmark and Greece, will be positioned on cushions on the altar.The funeral service will then be conducted by the dean of Windsor.

17-04-2021||World||Joe Biden calls spate of mass shootings a ‘National Embarrassment’||President Joe Biden called the spate of mass shootings in the U.S. a “national embarrassment” and challenged the Senate to take up a gun-control bill passed by the House.Biden spoke at a joint news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga on Friday, a day after a gunman opened fire at a FedEx Corp. facility near Indianapolis International Airport, killing eight people and wounding several others before apparently taking his own life.Biden said that most Americans, including gun owners, support background checks for weapons purchases. “I call on my friends in the Senate to bring up the House-passed bill now,” he said, while acknowledging he doesn’t control the Senate agenda.“Who in God’s name needs a weapon that can old 100 rounds or 40 rounds?” Biden asked, referring to high-capacity magazines. “It’s just wrong.”“I’m not going to give up until it’s done,” he added.Earlier Friday, Biden ordered U.S. flags to fly at half-staff after the Indianapolis shooting, the latest in series of massacres that have shaken the nation.The recent spate of shootings have thrust gun violence back into the national spotlight and created another domestic challenge for a president already confronting the coronavirus pandemic, a historic migrant influx and police shootings of Black Americans.Biden signed several executive actions last week aimed at curbing gun violence and called on Congress to pass gun legislation, though he acknowledged the difficulty of enacting new laws with the House and Senate closely divided along party lines.Nonetheless, the president has said action is needed and that the number of mass shootings has humiliated the U.S. in the eyes of the world.“It’s a national embarrassment,” Biden said in the Rose Garden with Suga listening alongside him.Recent shootings in Colorado and Georgia left 18 people dead and caused gun-control advocates and Democratic lawmakers to ramp up pressure on Biden to address the issue.Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris were briefed earlier Friday on the Indianapolis shooting. White House chief of staff Ron Klain had contacted the city’s mayor, and Homeland Security Adviser Elizabeth Sherwood-Randall was in touch with local law enforcement, according to the White House.Five people were hospitalized after Thursday night’s shooting including one with critical injuries, according to the Associated Press. Police said the gunman apparently killed himself after shooting the others, the AP reported.Biden’s executive actions would crack down on “ghost guns,” which can be assembled from kits and are not traceable by law enforcement because they lack serial numbers, as well as braces for pistols that make firearms more stable and accurate.The president also announced federal funds would go toward community violence intervention and prevention programs that are designed to de-escalate conflicts in urban communities before they turn violent. His proposed infrastructure bill includes $5 billion over eight years for the programs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-fedex-mass-shooting-a-national-embarrassment-101618611346892.html

17-04-2021||World||‘Double mutant’ variant now also spreading in UK||UK health authorities announced that they have detected at least 77 infections with B.1.617 variant first found in India and have designated it as a VUI, or variant under investigation, with experts expressing concern at the sudden spurt in its prevalence.B.1.617 has also been called the ‘double mutation’ variant in India, where authorities found it in high numbers among people in Maharashtra at the start of the wave in March that has now driven an unprecedented surge in infections.“PHE has identified 77 cases of this variant in the UK and all appropriate public health interventions will be undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing. This variant has been designated VUI-21APR-01. PHE and international partners continue to monitor the situation closely,” said the April 15 update by Public Health England (PHE).World Health Organization (WHO) officials too said they were treating it as a variant of interest. “This is a variant of interest we are following,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the WHO’s technical lead officer on Covid, told reporters on Friday, Bloomberg reported.“Having two of these mutations, which have been seen in other variants around the world, are concerning,” she said, adding that there was a similarity with mutations that increase transmission as well as reduce neutralisation, possibly stunting the ability of vaccines to curb them.The variant is now among seven that is under investigation by the UK health agency. It was found in 73 infections in England and four in Scotland, the latest of PHE’s weekly briefing said.“77 appears to be a relatively high number of first detected cases for the B.1.617 variant under investigation first detected in India... I await PHE’s expert analysis of the particular risks of B.1.617,” said Dr Duncan Robertson, a policy expert at Loughborough University, in a tweet.Also Read | ‘Stricter lockdown’ if people violate Covid-19 norms: Maharashtra ministerTypically, new variants begin appearing gradually in samples if surveillance is adequate. The Covid-19 genomics UK consortium (COG-UK) sequences roughly 10% of all cases, a rate that experts say India must attempt to match.The Indian Sars-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (Insacog), by comparison, has 13,614 sequences since it began functioning in December, the Union health ministry said on Friday. This comes to about 0.34% of the 3.9 million positive cases recorded in India since January 1, 2021.An analysis of genome sequences uploaded by Indian scientists to the global repository of viral pathogen GISAID Initiative has shown that the B.1.617 has been found in increasing number of samples of late, becoming the most common of variants to be detected in the 60 days up till April 2.While Indian authorities are yet to disclose this data, top officials have said that it is increasing in prevalence. “From barely existing in December, it is now found pretty much everywhere we look. We have a separate column for the variant for every state now,” said Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, one of the 10 labs under Insacog, on Thursday.Once studies determine that a VUI can cause a more severe outbreak or evade immunity conferred by a vaccine or a previous infection, it is classified as a VOC, or a variant of concern.B.1.617 has two mutations -- E484Q (glutamate is replaced by glutamine at the 484th spot of the spike protein) and L452R (substitution of leucine with arginine at the 452nd position) – among others that are being investigated for giving the virus an ability to evade immunity.L452R has also been found in a variant spreading in California, US, where it was implicated in a large outbreak earlier this year.At present, there are five VOC’s. The first, B.1.1.7 was found in the UK and has been confirmed to be more transmissible and was also implicated in a large resurgence of cases across the UK.US considers the California variant as VOC as well, while globally, the other VOCs are the South African variant (B.1.351) and the Brazilian variant (P.1).“As on 15/04/2021, 13,614 WGS (whole genome samples) samples have been processed at the 10 designated INSACOG labs. Of these, 1,189 samples have tested positive for variants of concern for Sars-Cov-2 in India. This includes 1,109 samples with UK variants; 79 samples with South African variant and 1 sample with the Brazil variant,” the Union health ministry said on Friday. It did not give a breakdown of how many were found in samples from travellers or those taken from community sampling.The government added that the test kits being used in India “do not miss these mutations as the RT-PCR tests being used in India target more than two genes”. The clarification was amid increasing anecdotes from several parts of the country that there has been a rise in false negatives.“The detection of these mutations does not change the strategy of management which remains to test, track, trace and treat. The use of masks remains as the most important shield to prevent the spread of Covid 19,” the health ministry statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/double-mutant-variant-now-also-spreading-in-uk-101618602680491.html
17-04-2021||World||Police ID killer in FedEx shooting as 19-year-old man; Sikh community members among wounded, killed||Police scoured a Fedex facility in Indianapolis and searched the suspected gunman's home Friday looking for a motive for the latest mass shooting to rock the US, as family members of the eight victims spent agonizing hours awaiting word on their loved ones.The shooter was identified as 19-year-old Brandon Scott Hole of Indiana, two law enforcement officials briefed on the matter told The Associated Press. The investigators searched a home in Indianapolis associated with Hole and seized evidence, including desktop computers and other electronic media, the officials said. The officials could not discuss the matter publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.Indianapolis police said earlier that they had not yet discovered the gunman's motive for opening fire with a rifle late Thursday night at a FedEx processing center near the Indianapolis airport.Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt said the gunman started randomly shooting at people in the parking lot and then went into the building and continued firing. He said the shooter apparently died by suicide shortly before police entered the building.“There was no confrontation with anyone that was there,” he said. “There was no disturbance, there was no argument. He just appeared to randomly start shooting."McCartt said four people were killed outside the building and another four inside. Several people were also wounded, including five who were taken to the hospital.The carnage took just a couple of minutes. “It did not last very long,” he said.Officials with the coroner's office began the process of identifying victims Friday afternoon, a process they said would take several hours.Police Chief Randal Taylor noted that a “significant” number of employees at the facility are members of the Sikh community, and the Sikh Coalition later confirmed that members of the community were among the wounded and killed.The coalition, which identifies itself as the largest Sikh civil rights organization in the U.S., said in a statement that it expected authorities to “conduct a full investigation — including the possibility of bias as a factor.”The coalition's executive director, Satjeet Kaur, noted in the statement that more than 8,000 Sikh Americans live in Indiana.The families' agonizing waiting was exacerbated by the fact that most employees aren't allowed to carry cellphones inside the FedEx building, making contact with them difficult.“When you see notifications on your phone, but you're not getting a text back from your kid and you're not getting information and you still don't know where they are … what are you supposed to do?” Mindy Carson said early Friday, fighting back tears.Later Friday morning, Carson said she had heard from her daughter Jessica, who works in the facility and that she was OK. She was going to meet her, but didn't say where.FedEx said in a statement that cellphone access is limited to a small number of workers in the dock and package sorting areas to “support safety protocols and minimize potential distractions.”FedEx Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Frederick Smith called the shooting a “senseless act of violence.”“This is a devastating day, and words are hard to describe the emotions we all feel,” he wrote in an email to employees.The killings marked the latest in a string of recent mass shootings across the country and the third mass shooting this year in Indianapolis.Five people, including a pregnant woman, were shot and killed in the city in January, and a man was accused of killing three adults and a child before abducting his daughter during at argument at a home in March. In other states last month, eight people were fatally shot at massage businesses in the Atlanta area, and 10 died in gunfire at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado.Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett said the community must guard against resignation and “the assumption that this is simply how it must be and we might as well get used to it.”President Joe Biden said he had been briefed on the shooting and called gun violence “an epidemic” in the U.S.“Too many Americans are dying every single day from gun violence. It stains our character and pierces the very soul of our nation,” he said in a statement.House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she was “horrified and heartbroken” by the shooting and called for congressional action on gun control.“As we pray for the families of all affected, we must work urgently to enact commonsense gun violence prevention laws to save lives & prevent this suffering,” the Democratic leader said in a tweet.A witness said he was working inside the building when he heard several gunshots in rapid succession.“I see a man come out with a rifle in his hand and he starts firing and he starts yelling stuff that I could not understand,” Levi Miller told WTHR-TV. “What I ended up doing was ducking down to make sure he did not see me because I thought he would see me and he would shoot me.”A man told WTTV that his niece was sitting in the driver's seat of her car when the gunfire erupted, and she was wounded.“She got shot on her left arm,” said Parminder Singh. “She's fine, she's in the hospital now.”Gov. Eric Holcomb ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until April 20, and he and others decried the shooting.Chris Bavender, a spokesperson for the FBI's Indianapolis office, said the bureau is helping with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-id-killer-in-fedex-shooting-as-19-year-old-man-sikh-community-members-among-wounded-killed-101618601397699.html
