A suspect is in custody. Both officers are injured. All three have been transported to the hospital.”The incident brought back memories of the storming of the US Capitol by supporters of then president Donald Trump on January 6. In a message to congressional offices, the police said, “All US Capitol Campus Buildings, no entry or exit is permitted at this time. You may move throughout the building(s) but stay away from exterior windows and doors.

02-04-2021||World||US caught the most migrants in two decades at Mexico border in March||US authorities caught more than 171,000 migrants at the US border with Mexico in March, according to preliminary data shared with Reuters, the highest monthly total in two decades and the latest sign of the mounting humanitarian challenge confronting President Joe Biden.The preliminary March arrest totals at the US-Mexico border represent the highest monthly level since April 2000, when border patrol agents caught more than 180,000 migrants.The total includes about 19,000 unaccompanied migrant children and 53,000 family members traveling together, the figures show. Single adults made up roughly 99,000 of the total.The Biden administration is struggling to house newly arrived unaccompanied children, who are exempted from expulsion under a Covid-19 health order known as Title 42. Children have been backed up in crowded border stations and processing centers for days.The shelter system that houses the children has been overwhelmed and US officials have scrambled in recent weeks to open emergency shelters, including sites in convention centers in Dallas and San Diego.Central American and Mexican migrants have made up the bulk of arrivals in recent months, in keeping with trends in recent years.The March figures show a 178% increase in the number of migrant families caught at the border compared with last month.While Biden said last week that the "vast majority" of families are being sent back to Mexico under Title 42, US government data suggests that is not the case.More than half of the 19,000 family members caught at the border in February were not expelled, according to public U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) data, with many released into the United States to pursue immigration court cases.Reuters also obtained three daily US border enforcement reports in March that showed only 14-16% of family members were expelled on those days.A CBP spokesman said official statistics would likely be released next week and declined to comment further.US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman Sarah Peck said last week that given fluctuating migration flows, "one day or week of statistics doesn’t reflect the full picture."Peck said the department's policy is still to expel families "and in situations where expulsion is not possible due to Mexico’s inability to receive the families, they are placed into removal proceedings."US border agents have encountered more repeat crossers in the past year compared with recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-caught-the-most-migrants-in-two-decades-at-mexico-border-in-march-101617386439687.html
02-04-2021||World||Coronavirus resurgence a bigger worry than inflation for US: Economic adviser||The United States is not at risk of a dangerous spell of inflation after a banner month of gains for workers, a top Biden economic official said on Friday, but the fast pace of business reopenings could cause a coronavirus resurgence."We must contain the virus in order to get the economy up and running, and people are seeing a lot more confidence," said Heather Boushey, a member of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, after the administration ramped up vaccines and signed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill."The question is are we moving too fast, too soon."A Labor Department report earlier on Friday showed the US economy creating the most jobs in seven months in March, a report that could mark the start of the strongest economic performance this year in decades.President Joe Biden's administration aggressively pushed a $1.9 trillion stimulus bill through Congress in his first weeks in office and is working towards a goal to have enough vaccine in stock to cover all of the country's adults by May.A new plan from the administration released Wednesday would add more than $2 trillion in additional spending on infrastructure and other jobs over the coming 8 years.Boushey said the administration has not yet produced its own estimate on how many jobs that effort would create because "it really does depend on how some of the details work out" as the administration negotiates with Congress. But she said a projection of the jobs that will be created will come "in the not-too-distant future."Biden said Friday some studies show it could create 19 million jobs.There is little sign that administration policies are leading to the economy overheating, she said."We start to be concerned about inflation overheating if we have too many dollars chasing not enough stuff, and right now we still have an unemployment rate of 6%," she said."There's a lot of slack in the labor market still. We're 8.4 million jobs fewer than where we were pre-pandemic."The administration remains cautious on whether states should be reopening as aggressively as they have been, warning governors that a spike in COVID-19 cases could ultimately derail the economy and the response to a pandemic that has killed more than half a million Americans.Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the biggest gain since last August, with data for prior months revised higher than initial reports.As of Tuesday morning, the United States had administered 147.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and most households were receiving $1,400 checks as a result of the stimulus bill Biden made his top priority on taking office in January.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/coronavirus-resurgence-a-bigger-worry-than-inflation-for-us-economic-adviser-101617385932145.html
02-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Fully vaccinated and want to travel in US? Here are key points you need to know||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday announced revised travel guidelines for people fully vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The health agency said that vaccinated individuals can safely travel at "low risk", lifting the earlier guidance that advised all Americans to avoid non-essential travel. However, CDC director Rochelle Walensky, at a separate White House briefing, advocated against “general travel overall”.“Our guidance is silent on recommending or not recommending fully vaccinated people travel; our guidance speaks to the safety of doing so. If you are vaccinated, it’s lower risk,” said Walensky.The United States has administered more than 153 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines so far. Last week, US President Joe Biden announced a new vaccination goal of 200 million Covid-19 shots within his first 100 days in office.Here are key points of the latest travel guidelines released by CDC:1. People are considered fully vaccinated two weeks after their second dose in a 2-dose regimen, such as the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, or two weeks after receiving a single-dose vaccine, such as Johnson & Johnson’s Janssen vaccine.2. Fully vaccinated travellers are less likely to get and spread Covid-19 and can travel safely within the United States.3. They do not need to get tested before or after the travel unless their destination requires it.4. Fully vaccinated travellers do not need to self-quarantine.5. People who have recovered from Covid-19 in the past 3 months do not need to get tested or self-quarantine.6. They should still follow CDC’s recommendations for safe travel, including wearing a mask over and staying 6 feet away from others.7. Fully vaccinated individuals should self-monitor for Covid-19 symptoms after travel and isolate and get tested if they develop symptoms.8. People with a condition or who are taking medication that weakens their immune system may not be fully protected even if they are fully vaccinated. Such individuals may need to continue taking all precautions even after getting fully vaccinated.9. Unvaccinated individuals should get tested 1-3 days before their trip.10. They should get also tested 3-5 days after travel and stay home and self-quarantine for a full 7 days after travel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-announces-revised-guidance-for-fully-vaccinated-people-10-points-101617383410410.html

After initial data from the older teens is reviewed, the trial will expand to add adolescents ages 12 to 15.J&J says the first teens are being enrolled in the United Kingdom and Spain. Teens in the United States, Canada and the Netherlands will be added, followed by teens in Brazil and Argentina.The study is testing the safety and efficacy of both one-dose and two-dose regimens of the vaccine, with the two-dose regimens being studied at intervals of one, two and three months after the first shot.Dr. Mathai Mammen, global head of research and development for the company’s Janssen pharmaceuticals unit, says it also expects to initiate studies in pregnant women and children.A total of 100 million J&J doses are pledged for the US by late May or June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/johnson-johnson-starts-testing-covid-19-vaccine-on-teens-101617382971042.html

They haven’t been open since. Gyms, nail salons and barber shops have been shut almost as long. The mayor’s hair has grown so thick, it’s become a talking point on Twitter.When spring arrived, there was a glimmer of hope. Restaurants were allowed to set up outdoor patios; hair salons were told they could open on April 12. Those plans were canceled on Thursday when Ontario’s government invoked a four-week “emergency brake” that tightens restrictions again and extends them across the province of 14.7 million people.Ontario Premier Doug Ford, a conservative elected in 2018 with strong support from business, pleaded for understanding. The virus left him with no choice, he said. “This decision weighs extremely heavy on me,” he said. “I know what this means for people, to be here over a year into this pandemic. It’s frustrating and it’s very, very difficult.”For some business owners, “difficult” has turned to desperation. They’re chafing at the interminable restrictions and the slow pace of Canada’s vaccine program. In a national survey of companies released in March, 10% of firms said they could carry on for less than 12 months at current levels of revenue and expenses.Only 13.3% of the Canadian population has received at least one Covid-19 shot. In the U.S., it’s 30%, according to the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.Read more: Vaccine Trickle Becomes Torrent as U.S. Eligibility Rules WidenPrime Minister Justin Trudeau has set a goal of vaccinating every adult by September. In the meantime, the Canada-U.S. border remains closed to most travelers, as it has been for more than a year, threatening airlines, hotels and tourism businesses with a second barren summer.“The mood of the business community has shifted dramatically,” said Dan Kelly, chief executive officer of the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, a small-business lobby group. It’s gone from acceptance of necessary measures to “rage” at government, he said.At lunchtime on a recent weekday, a signboard outside Chotto Matte, a Japanese-Peruvian restaurant across the street from Royal Bank of Canada’s headquarters, declared the patio open for dining. Not a person was seated there, despite sunny and warm spring weather.Wall Street firms may be planning to bring back many staff to the office soon, but on Toronto’s Bay Street, the scene is quiet and is almost certain to remain that way for most of 2021.At Bank of Montreal’s headquarters, less than 10% of staff have been coming into the office regularly over the past year. Most of those working from home will stay there until vaccines are broadly available, Mona Malone, Bank of Montreal’s chief human resources officer, said in an interview.In the long run, Malone expects the bank will adopt a hybrid model, with some employees staying home part of the time. “People do miss the connectivity with their colleagues, but it’s going to be different,” Malone said. “They won’t be returning to a pre-Covid-type experience.”Toronto’s banks adapted quickly to the pandemic and are now earning bigger profits than before Covid-19 as the Canadian housing market soars. But the small businesses that surround them are beginning to snap.Tom Antonarakis owns two seafood restaurants in downtown Toronto and is looking to offload them at a reduced price. Both are in food courts that rely on a lunch crowd of office workers.“I’m in the process of trying to sell those two locations almost 30 cents to the dollar,” Antonarakis said. “We tried opening up after the first lockdown, and then they closed us down again.” He also sold one of his two food trucks and has been operating the other out of a mall in the suburbs.Ford and his top officials acknowledge the financial pain but say the numbers justify extending restrictions.Ontario has seen about 160 new virus cases daily per million population over the past week. That’s far fewer than neighboring Michigan and New York and still well below the peak of the province’s second wave.But Ontario hospitals hit a new high for Covid-19 patients in intensive care this week. The problem is a new variant of the virus, known as B.1.1.7, that is making people sicker.“It’s spreading far more quickly than it was before and we cannot vaccinate quickly enough to break this third wave,” Adalsteinn Brown, a doctor who is co-chair of the Ontario Covid-19 Science Advisory Table, said at a news conference Thursday.Politics are a significant factor too, according to Nelson Wiseman, a professor of political science at the University of Toronto.Ford got high marks from voters for decisive action early in the pandemic. He’s fearful of being seen as overruling the advice of the medical community, Wiseman said. Toronto’s top doctor, Eileen de Villa, has been a consistent advocate of strict measures including indoor dining bans.“The guy was scared stiff at first and has rolled over,” Wiseman said in an interview. “Our authorities have taken the advice of their medical officers, unlike Houston, unlike Miami, places like that.”The Ford and Trudeau governments have offered an array of grants and loans to help businesses that have been hurt by Covid-19 restrictions. But it isn’t enough for companies whose revenue depends on activities that are now banned.“It’s been a long road and going on 25 weeks of being shutdown,” said Liz Clark, owner of Chair Decor, a linen supplier for events. “The subsidies they have been providing are helping, but we are still bleeding money every day. We have a burn rate of C$10,000 a month.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gruelling-covid-19-lockdown-has-toronto-businesses-at-the-breaking-point-101617382893839.html
02-04-2021||World||Dispute over Pentagon funds part of White House budget delay||The Pentagon and the White House budget office have been at odds over the first defense budget under President Joe Biden.The disagreement may be at least partly to blame for delays in releasing the budget outline that was widely expected this week, according to two people familiar with the situation who asked not to be named because the information isn’t public.The Pentagon has been crafting a fiscal 2022 budget plan that assumes the military will receive $704 billion to $708 billion, essentially a flat budget instead of the increase anticipated under former President Donald Trump.The White House didn’t provide specifics on when it would release its budget priorities. “I know it’ll be out soon,” White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Thursday.Robert Friedlander, a spokesman for the Office of Management and Budget said the document would be released “soon.” Two people familiar with the process said the budget preview wouldn’t be released until next week.The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Trump administration had planned to propose about $722 billion for the Defense Department in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 -- although lawmakers of both parties have predicted less would be available amid competing spending demands and rising deficits from coronavirus relief packages.The Pentagon-only budget doesn’t include defense spending that goes to other agencies, primarily to the Energy Department, which maintains the nation’s nuclear weapons.Decrease in Real TermsA “topline” of $704 billion to $708 billion under Biden would amount to a decrease of about 2% in real terms, adjusting for inflation from this year’s enacted appropriation of about $704 billion. The topline proposed by the OMB is still unclear.Lawmakers are also expected to focus on how much of the Pentagon funds come from the Overseas Contingency Operations account, or OCO, a separate pool of money that funds Afghanistan and Iraq operations and personnel costs. The last Trump plan earmarked a $20 billion placeholder figure.The topline considered by the Pentagon is in contrast to real growth in the budget of 3% to 5% first endorsed by then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in 2017, then by the National Defense Strategy Commission in 2018 and by a group of GOP defense hawks led by Representative Mike Rogers of Alabama, the top Republican on the House Armed Services Committee.Democrats Split on SpendingDemocrats face a wide rift over defense spending. In a March 16 letter to Biden, 50 progressive Democrats, including Representatives Ro Khanna of California and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, suggested cuts of more than 10% to the Pentagon budget.“While we are heartened that your administration is not contemplating expanding the Pentagon’s already inflated budget, our new Democratic majorities in Congress along with your administration should go further,” they wrote. “Rather than requesting a flat Pentagon budget, we urge you to seek a significantly reduced Pentagon topline.”Senator Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who now leads the Budget Committee, has long called for cutting the defense budget by 10%.Pentagon personnel were working under “not to exceed” guidance from the Office of Management and Budget, rather than the formal “passback”--a back-and-forth process between Pentagon and OMB that sets the budget specifics.The fiscal 2022 budget will be the first in a decade in which defense and non-defense spending aren’t constrained by budget caps, meaning that Congress has an opening to shift funds from defense to non-defense spending, or the reverse.Congressional math is likely to prevent Democrats from taking a scalpel to the Pentagon’s budget. Senate committees are evenly split between Democrats and Republicans, so every proposal would have to attract Republican votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dispute-over-pentagon-funds-part-of-white-house-budget-delay-101617381896760.html

Three patients had extensive pulmonary embolisms. One died and one also had a brain haemorrhage," it said.Roughly 400,000 people were vaccinated with AstraZeneca in the Netherlands in the period and the reports "seem comparable to other reports in Europe," Lareb said.It came a day after Germany halted use of the vaccine for people under 60 and a death was reported in the Netherlands of a woman between the ages of 25 and 65 who had received the AstraZeneca vaccine.The Netherlands has recorded about 1.2 million coronavirus cases in total and more than 16,500 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/netherlands-halts-use-of-astrazeneca-vaccine-for-people-under-60-101617382098308.html

A figure above 1 suggests the disease is growing.The figures showed the daily growth rate of infections in England was between -4% to 0%, meaning the number of new infections was shrinking by between 0% and 4% each day, also the same rate as recorded the previous week.Health chiefs had cautioned progress in limiting infection would slow after millions of children returned to school at the start of March, although the Office for National Statistics said on Thursday an estimated 1 in 370 people in England had Covid-19 last week, the lowest share since mid-September and compared with 1 in 340 in the previous week.The R number has been used a guide to the state of the pandemic but the health ministry said the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE) had not agreed figures for the whole of the United Kingdom this week."Given the increasingly localised approach to managing the epidemic, particularly between nations, UK-level estimates are less meaningful than previously and may not accurately reflect the current picture of the epidemic," the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/england-covid-19-reproduction-rate-steady-at-0-8-to-1-report-101617380657717.html
02-04-2021||World||India pitches for further easing of oil production cuts by OPEC+||India on Friday pushed for further easing of oil production cuts by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) and 10 more countries, saying high crude prices were affecting consumption-led recovery around the world. OPEC+, which includes the 10 additional oil exporting countries led by Russia, agreed on Thursday to gradually ease oil output cuts from May in response to the US administration’s call for ensuring that energy remains affordable for consumers. The group, which comprises 13 major crude producers such as Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Iran, put in place deep cuts after oil prices collapsed in 2020 due to the Covid-19 crisis. The group has now agreed to ease production curbs by 350,000 barrels per day (bpd) in May, 350,000 bpd in June and around 400,000 bpd in July. “We have noted that OPEC and OPEC+ have announced a slight easing of crude production cuts, even though it is still far below the originally announced schedule of cuts,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi told a regular news briefing. India, he said, has been appealing to the crude oil producing countries since the beginning of this year to ease crude oil production cuts announced last year because “high crude prices hurt the consumption-led recovery of several countries, including India”, he said. “Crude supply should be market determined rather than artificially managed. Our ministry of petroleum and natural gas is reviewing closely the global crude supplies and price situation,” Bagchi added. In addition to rising crude prices, India has been hit by the stopping of oil imports from Iran because of US sanctions imposed by the previous Donald Trump administration. In recent weeks, India has mulled the possibility of organising diplomatic efforts by oil-consuming countries against OPEC+ as producers have kept crude prices artificially high by restricting supply. India has also begun looking at the possibility of resuming imports of cheaper energy from Iran and Venezuela to counter the oil cartel. The restriction of supplies by OPEC+ has become a major concern for New Delhi as it tries to boost economic recovery in the post-pandemic period. India is the third largest oil consumer in the world, after the US and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-pitches-for-further-easing-of-oil-production-cuts-by-opec-101617380765161.html

These decreases in people-to-people contact are already paying off," said the mayor.The occupancy rate of intensive care beds in the city remains at over 90 percent, as Brazil battles its toughest phase of the outbreak so far.March was the deadliest month for Brazil since the pandemic first started, with 66,573 deaths -- more than double the previous record set in July 2020.Brazil's death toll of over 325,000 is second only to that of the United States with more than half-a-million.Rio de Janeiro state, with more than 37,000 dead, has a mortality rate of 215 per 100,000 inhabitants, higher than the national average of 141.Paes said schools in Rio city will reopen for in-person lessons on Tuesday.But non-essential business -- bars and restaurants, cinemas, museums and theaters included -- will not be allowed to reopen before Friday, and then with restricted hours.The city's famous beaches will remain off limits until April 19, when a daily curfew from 11:00 pm to 05:00 am will also be lifted and dance clubs reopened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-rio-de-janeiro-city-extends-covid-19-restrictions-101617380105771.html

Opportunity is coming. And at long last, there's hope for so many families."The economy regained 916,000 jobs last month, the largest increase since August, pushing the unemployment rate down to 6.0 percent from 6.2 percent in February.Biden gave credit for the encouraging figures to his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, the third major relief bill passed by Congress to help consumers and businesses after the Covid-19 crisis caused a massive economic downturn."We're going continue to implement that law in the weeks ahead. By April 7, next week, over 130 million households will have gotten their $1,400 per person rescue check," he said."Funds are on their way to local communities to put educators, health care workers, home health care aides, police, firefighters, sanitary workers back on the job."However, even as the economy begins to recover from the Covid-19 shutdowns, employment is still 8.4 million jobs lower than the pre-pandemic peak, the jobs report said.In addition, there are nearly six million more workers now than before the crisis who are working part time because they cannot find a full time position, or are on the sidelines because they have not been able to find work.After a slow start, the US vaccination campaign has gathered pace since late January and Biden has promised that 90 percent of America's adults will eligible for a vaccine by April 19.The president urged Americans to keep up their guard against Covid-19, despite the optimism fueled by the vaccination drive."I plead with you. Don't give back the progress we've all fought so hard to achieve... We need to finish this job," he said."We need every American to buckle down and keep their guard up in this homestretch."He implored people to continuing wearing masks, and maintain social distancing and hand washing."Get vaccinated when it's your turn. That's how we're going to beat the virus," he added. "Cast off the weight of the pandemic that's holding our economy back."ft/ec||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-hails-march-jobs-numbers-as-source-of-hope-101617380183441.html

They raised overall fatalities in Russia linked to the epidemic to 225,572 after the death toll for January was revised up slightly.President Vladimir Putin opted against a return to lockdown as cases began to rise late last year, helping cushion the economic impact of the pandemic but contributing to the third-most deaths globally after the U.S. and Brazil.The health crisis has eased recently, with the number of new daily infections currently under 10,000 from nearly 30,000 at the end of December, the deadliest month of the pandemic.Russia remains well behind many other nations in its vaccination campaign, sparking fears of a third wave of Covid-19 infections.

All you need to know||Nasa’s InSight lander detected two strong, clear quakes on Mars last month, recording over 500 quakes to date since its touch down on the Red Planet in November 2018. According to the mission control, the two quakes of magnitude 3.3 and 3.1 originated in a region called Cerberus Fossae, the same place where two other strong quakes were recorded earlier in the mission. The previous strong marsquakes were of magnitude 3.6 and 3.5.Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said that the quakes further supported the idea that Cerberus Fossae is seismically active. “InSight has recorded over 500 quakes to date, but because of their clear signals, these are four of the best quake records for probing the interior of the planet,” Nasa JPL said in a statement.InSight science team seeks to develop a better understanding of Mars’ mantle and core by studying the quakes. Mars doesn’t have tectonic plates like Earth but it does have volcanically active regions that can shake the surface, as per the US space agency.Also Read | Nasa shares pic of nighttime view of ship traffic jam on Suez CanalTaichi Kawamura of France’s Institut de Physique du Globe de Paris, which helped provide InSight’s seismometer, said in a statement that the mission has observed two different types of marsquakes. According to Kawamura, one type of marsquake was more “Moon-like”, which tends to be very scattered, while the other type was more “Earth-like”, where waves travel more directly through the planet.“Interestingly, all four of these larger quakes, which come from Cerberus Fossae, are ‘Earth-like,’” Kawamura added, according to the Nasa JPL website.The mission noted another common feature between the latest marsquakes and the previous top seismic events which occurred almost a full Martian year ago - all of them occurred in the Martian northern summer. Scientists had predicted that Martian northern summer, when winds would become calmer, would be an ideal time to listen for quakes as the wind causes enough vibration to obscure some marsquakes.I’m getting ready for one of my next activities: burying the tether that runs out to my seismometer. I’ve done some test scrapes, and soon I’ll start scooping material to begin covering it. pic.twitter.com/ZDJ9GrRup8The mission team has started trying to partially insulate the cable, that connects the seismometer to the lander, from extreme temperature variations. The scoop on the end of InSight’s robotic arm is being used to drop soil on top of the domed Wind and Thermal Shield which subsequently trickle down onto the cable.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-insight-lander-has-recorded-over-500-quakes-on-mars-all-you-need-to-know-101617378481937.html

You saw the Galwan incident, how many soldiers lost their lives. Tibet is just a beginning as it is the palm but five fingers are still out there which Chinese CPC (Chinese Communist Party) is trying hard to get," claimed Lobsang, president of the Central Tibetan Administration (Tibetan government-in exile).The Five Fingers of Tibet is a Chinese foreign policy that considers Tibet to be the palm of China's right hand, with five fingers on its periphery: Ladakh, Nepal, Sikkim, Bhutan, and Arunachal Pradesh, and that it is China's responsibility to "liberate" these regions."India needs to understand, what is happening in Tibet is the blueprint and it is happening in Xinjiang and Hong Kong. Understand China and deal with it," Lobsang said.He said pluralism and diversity, human rights and freedom binds India together."Pluralism is the foundation of India. Pluralism and diversity binds India together, human rights and freedom binds India together but China is bringing a more autocratic system so for Asia - development with democracy and diversity is better than the Chinese model," he said.Lobsang also alleged that Chinese expansionist policies are a "threat" to the world community."... Therefore the world community must wake up to its designs sooner than later. Standing against China in relation to its record on human rights violations of minorities in Tibet and Xinjiang is not in the control of one country or a small group of countries but the whole world community needs to stand in solidarity," he said.He further claimed that in the name of poverty alleviation, the Chinese government is employing mainland Chinese discourses in minority regions such as Tibet thereby creating an environment which might lead to endangering of Tibetan identity."Not authoritarian policies of China but democratic policies for development that respect diversity is what the world needs," he said.He highlighted that India's model of development with democracy is better than Chinese model of development without democracy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tibet-occupation-just-beginning-china-trying-hard-to-get-five-fingers-lobsang-sangay-101617375624215.html
02-04-2021||World||Fully vaccinated people can resume travel at 'low risk', says US CDC in its revised guidance||The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on Friday said fully vaccinated people can safely travel at "low risk" after the agency had held off for weeks on revising guidance that discouraged all non-essential trips.The announcement lifting the agency's guidance that all Americans should avoid non-essential travel should be a shot in the arm for a US travel industry still significantly struggling since the Covid-19 crisis began in early 2020. The new CDC guidance specifically greenlights vaccinated grandparents getting on airplanes to see grandchildren.A group representing major US airlines including American Airlines, Delta Air lines, United Airlines Southwest Airlines and other trade groups on March 22 had urged the CDC to immediately update its guidance to say "vaccinated individuals can travel safely."The new guidance will also say fully vaccinated people do not need to get a Covid-19 test before or after travel and do not need to self-quarantine after travel.The CDC said grandparents that have been fully vaccinated can fly to visit grandkids without getting a Covid-19 test or self-quarantining as long as they follow CDC advice for traveling safely.But the administration is not lifting restrictions that bar most-non US citizens from the United States who have recently been in China, Brazil, South Africa and most of Europe. It is also keeping requirements that nearly all international U.S. air visitors getting a negative Covid-19 test before traveling to the United States.The CDC did not revise guidance for non-vaccinated people."Vaccines can help us return to the things we love about life, so we encourage every American to get vaccinated as soon as they have the opportunity," CDC director Rochelle Walensky said in a statementThe CDC's new guidance says fully vaccinated people do not need Covid-19 tests before international travel unless it is required by the international destination and vaccinated people returning from foreign travel do not need to self-quarantine after returning to the United States, unless required by state or local authorities.The CDC had repeatedly declined in recent weeks to change the guidance and repeated it was still discouraging all non-essential travel because of a concern about new variants.Many Americans have not been heeding the CDC's advice. The Transportation Security Administration screened 1.56 million people at US airports, just below Sunday's 1.57 million, which was the highest daily total since March 2020. The last time the number of airport passengers screened was below 1 million was March 10.The Biden administration has taken steps to reduce international travel and mandated masks in nearly all forms of public transit. The administration is not eliminating any mask rules.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccinated-people-can-resume-travel-at-low-risk-says-us-cdc-101617376787690.html

But we believe this is a healthy step forward," State Department spokesman Ned Price said."We do not anticipate presently that there will be direct talks between the United States and Iran through this process, though the United States remains open to them," he said.The European Union announced Friday an in-person meeting in Vienna of all parties to the 2015 nuclear deal, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, from which former president Donald Trump withdrew.The Europeans said it would have "separate" contacts in Vienna with the United States and Iran quickly rejected a direct meeting with its arch-enemy as it presses President Joe Biden first to lift sanctions.Price said that the "primary issues" for discussion in Vienna will be "the nuclear steps that Iran would need to take in order to return to compliance with the terms of the JCPOA, and the sanctions relief steps that the United States would need to take in order to return to compliance as well."Iran has insisted that the United States must act first on removing the Trump sanctions, which include a unilateral effort to stop all its oil exports, before it will roll back measures away from compliance that it had taken as a protest.The Vienna talks will also include the governments of Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia which all remain parties and supporters of the nuclear deal negotiated under former US president Barack Obama.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-open-to-direct-talks-with-iran-at-nuclear-meet-101617372306275.html

We had to save the person. We did everything at the highest level," surgeon Valentin Filatov was quoted as saying by REN TV. He said it had been a heart by-pass operation.The ministry said 128 people were immediately evacuated from the hospital as the fire broke out on the roof."The clinic was built more than a century ago, in 1907, and the fire spread like lightning through the wooden ceilings of the roof," the ministry said.No one was reported hurt."A bow to the medics and firefighters," said Vasiliy Orlov, the local regional governor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-doctors-complete-open-heart-surgery-as-tsarist-era-hospital-burns-101617372474570.html

Important dates||The first scheduled flight of Nasa's Ingenuity helicopter on Mars will take place no earlier than April 11, the space agency’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) announced on Thursday. The Ingenuity helicopter, a technology experiment and companion of Nasa’s Perseverance rover, was previously slated to take off no sooner than April 8. It will be the first aircraft to attempt controlled flight on another planet, a feat with a high degree of difficulty.“Come fly with us. Mars Helicopter is preparing to do something that's never been done: controlled, powered flight on another planet. Takeoff is now slated for no earlier than April 11, with data arriving on Earth on April 12,” tweeted Nasa JPL.Come fly with us. #MarsHelicopter is preparing to do something that's never been done: controlled, powered flight on another planet. Takeoff is now slated for no earlier than April 11, with data arriving on Earth on April 12. https://t.co/TNCdXWcKWE pic.twitter.com/JSep5lcKhROne of the first objectives of the helicopter was to survive the frigid Martian night, given the nights at the Red planet are as cold as minus 90 degrees Celsius. The other capabilities it needs to prove before it can take off and land include autonomously keeping warm and charging itself with its solar panel. The rover will continue to assist in communications related to the helicopter’s commissioning and flight test campaign back and forth from Earth.The Perseverance rover dropped a debris shield on March 21 that protected Ingenuity during landing and made its way to the "airfield" where the helicopter will attempt its flights. The rover has been slowly releasing the helicopter on the Martian surface. On Tuesday, Nasa JPL shared a photograph of Ingenuity with all four legs reaching out.“We’re in the home stretch. The Mars Helicopter has lowered all four legs and is in position to touch down on the Martian surface. Once it’s fully ready, NASA Perseverance will release it gently to the surface,” JPL tweeted.An interactive webinar preview of the flight will be held at 11:00pm IST on April 5 via Zoom, a video-conferencing platform. Experts will come together to discuss the helicopter at 10:30pm IST on April 8 which will be streamed on the YouTube channel of Nasa JPL’s Education Office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasa-ingenuity-helicopter-s-first-flight-on-mars-delayed-important-dates-101617370346406.html
02-04-2021||World||US: 7 Texas officers fired after custodial death of Black inmate||Seven officers involved in the in-custody death of a Black jail inmate in Texas whose family members say may have been suffering a mental health crisis have been fired, a sheriff said.The detention officers violated sheriff's office policies and procedures leading up to the death of Marvin Scott III, Collin County Sheriff Jim Skinner said in a news release Thursday. An eighth officer resigned.Scott, 26, was arrested March 14 at an outlet mall in Allen on a marijuana possession charge, authorities have said. Allen officers took Scott to a hospital because he was reportedly acting erratically. Scott was released and police took him to the county jail.While at the jail, Scott began to exhibit “some strange behaviour,” Skinner said at a March 19 news conference. Detention officers placed Scott on a restraint bed, used pepper spray and covered his face with a spit mask. Scott became unresponsive at some point and later was pronounced dead at a hospital.Law enforcement's use of face coverings such as spit hoods on people — and the frequent reliance on police to respond to mental health emergencies — drew new attention last year following Daniel Prude’s suffocation in Rochester, New York. The mesh coverings have been linked to other deaths.In Texas, the Collin County medical examiner’s office has not yet released a cause of death for Scott. The Texas Rangers were continuing to investigate Scott’s death, according to Skinner’s statement.Family members have said that Scott had schizophrenia and may have been suffering a mental health crisis. Scott’s family has hired a forensic pathologist to conduct an independent autopsy.Civil rights lawyer Lee Merritt, who is representing Scott's family, has said he thinks Scott was jailed for marijuana possession because he was Black and viewed as a criminal rather than as someone in crisis.Names and races of the officers haven’t been released.A statement Thursday by Merritt noted that Scott's funeral was Wednesday.“Just one day after the funeral of Marvin Scott III, the Collin County Sheriff has fired seven detention officers in connection with his death,” the statement said. “We are pleased with this decision and consider this progress.”The statement also asks that the fired officers “be arrested and brought to justice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-7-texas-officers-fired-after-custodial-death-of-black-inmate-101617370235320.html

At the time, Canal officials said that more than 420 ships had been waiting for the Panama-flagged, Japanese-owned ship Ever Given to be freed so they could make the crossing.Leth Agencies said that a total of 357 vessels have crossed the Canal since the ship was re-floated by a flotilla of tugboats, helped by the tides.The Ever Given had crashed into a bank of a single-lane stretch of the canal about 6 kilometers (3.7 miles) north of the southern entrance, near the city of Suez. That forced some ships to take the long, alternate route around the Cape of Good Hope at Africa’s southern tip — a 5,000-kilometer (3,100-mile) detour that costs ships hundreds of thousands of dollars in fuel and other costs. Others waited in place for the blockage to be over.The unprecedented shutdown, which raised fears of extended delays, goods shortages and rising costs for consumers, added to strain on the shipping industry, already under pressure from the coronavirus pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/traffic-jam-eases-further-in-suez-canal-after-ship-unblocked-says-report-101617368630350.html
02-04-2021||World||Parties to Iran nuclear deal plan talks in Vienna next week||Iran and the remaining world powers in the 2015 nuclear deal will hold in-person talks in Vienna next week to discuss possible sanctions-lifting measures among other issues, in what appeared to be a step forward from stalled diplomacy.The European Union, which chaired a video conference on Friday with the deal participants including Iran, Russia, China, Germany, France and the UK, said the next round of talks aims “to clearly identify sanctions lifting and nuclear implementation measures.” The bloc will intensify “separate contacts” between the deal’s participants and the United States, it added.The US has been trying to use Europe as an intermediary with Iran after Tehran rebuffed talks with the Biden administration on reviving the accord that former President Donald Trump abandoned. After Trump’s withdrawal from the agreement, Iran breached some of the limits that it placed on its nuclear program.“The members considered the prospect of the United States’ full return to the JCPOA and emphasized their readiness to investigate the issue with a positive outlook and with collective effort,” Iran’s foreign ministry said in a statement after Friday’s meeting, using the abbreviation for the deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said a follow-up meeting would take place in Vienna on Tuesday. His deputy, Abbas Araghchi, said the Iranian delegation would not negotiate with their US counterparts “at any level” during Tuesday’s talks, the semi-official Fars news agency reported.‘The right track’China on Friday called for the US to lift all “illegal” sanctions on Iran, saying the country’s nuclear issue was at a “critical stage.” Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying blamed Washington’s unilateral exit from the Iran deal as the “root cause” of the problem, while saying China welcomes the return of the US. Russia’s envoy to the UN’s atomic agency, Mikhail Ulyanov, wrote in a tweet: “The impression is that we are on the right track but the way ahead will not be easy.”“There’s no time to lose,” German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said in a statement. “A fully respected agreement would be an advantage for the security of the region, and the best basis for talks about other important aspects of regional stability.”US State Department spokesman Ned Price told reporters on Thursday that Washington welcomed the European effort as a positive step. He said the US was ready to return to compliance with the 2015 agreement “consistent with” Iran doing the same and has been exploring “the best way to achieve this, including through a series of mutual, initial steps.”“We have been looking at options for doing so, including with indirect conversations through our mutual European partners,” Price said.Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said this month that his nation was in “no hurry” to revive the nuclear deal and said US policy was doomed to fail unless sanctions against the Islamic Republic were first removed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/parties-to-iran-nuclear-deal-plan-talks-in-vienna-next-week-101617367999109.html
02-04-2021||World||Human rights violated in Syria under Moscow's watch: Russian activists||Russian human rights activists released a report on Friday that chronicles alleged war crimes and violations of international humanitarian law during the 10-year conflict in Syria.Activists from the Memorial Human Rights Center, the Civic Assistance Committee and other groups interviewed over 150 Syrian refugees in Lebanon, Jordan, Turkey, several European nations and Russia.The organizations analyzed accounts of arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, torture, extrajudicial executions, the use of prohibited weapons against civilians, starvation, sexual violence and other abuses.The authors said their goal was to fill an information vacuum in Russia regarding the conflict in Syria. They said many Russians remain unaware of the scope of human rights violations and war crimes even though Moscow has waged military action in Syria since 2015.Russia's military involvement has shored up Syrian President Bashar Assad's rule and allowed his government to reclaim control over much of the country.“The ongoing violence in Syria and the continued failure to secure justice for those harmed make it more critical than ever that the Russian public is informed about the grave human rights abuses that have occurred in Syria over the last decade, including those committed under Russia’s watch and, since 2015, with its participation,” the report said.The authors wrote that the Syrian government's military operations conducted jointly or with support from the Russian air force had a “clear pattern of indiscriminate and targeted attacks that did not correspond to the presence of military targets.” The Russian military has staunchly denied striking Syrian civilians.Given Moscow's role in keeping Assad in power, the activists urged the Russian government to “use its influence on Syrian authorities to end arbitrary arrests, torture and degrading treatment in prisons, extrajudicial killings, and enforced disappearances...(and) support the immediate release of those arbitrarily detained and reveal the fates of the disappeared."They also called on Russian civil society to build contacts with the Syrian public to conduct joint investigations and prevent rights abuses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/human-rights-violated-in-syria-under-moscow-s-watch-russian-activists-101617367606881.html
02-04-2021||World||US job growth accelerates in March; unemployment rate falls to 6.0%||US employers hired more workers than expected in March, spurred by increased vaccinations and more pandemic relief money from the government, cementing expectations that an economic boom was underway.Nonfarm payrolls surged by 916,000 jobs last month, the Labor Department said on Friday. That was be the biggest gain since last August. Data for February was revised higher to show 468,000 jobs created instead of the previously reported 379,000.Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls increasing by 647,000 jobs in March. The unemployment rate fell to 6.0% last month from 6.2% in February. The unemployment rate has been understated by people misclassifying themselves as being "employed but absent from work."The closely watched employment report marked a painful anniversary for the labor market. The March 2020 employment report was the first to reflect the mandatory closures of non-essential businesses such as restaurants, bars and gyms to slow the onset of the just-emerging Covid-19 pandemic.Nearly 1.7 million jobs were lost that month, and another 20.7 million would vanish in April. Economists estimate it could take at least two years to recoup the more than 22 million jobs lost during the pandemic.As of Tuesday morning, the United States had administered 147.6 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the country and distributed 189.5 million doses, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The White House's massive $1.9 trillion pandemic relief package approved in March is sending additional $1,400 checks to qualified households and fresh funding for businesses.Economists expect job growth will average at least 700,000 per month in the second and third quarters. That, combined with the fiscal stimulus and about $19 trillion in excess savings accumulated by households during the pandemic, is expected to unleash a powerful wave of pent-up demand.First-quarter gross domestic product estimates are as high as a 10.0% annualized rate. The economy grew at a 4.3% pace in the fourth quarter. Growth this year could top 7%, which would be the fastest since 1984. The economy contracted 3.5% in 2020, the worst performance in 74 years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-job-growth-accelerates-in-march-unemployment-rate-falls-to-60-101617367440211.html
02-04-2021||World||White House trying to craft Biden's gun executive orders that can't be undone||The White House is trying to craft a series of executive actions for President Joe Biden to sign to try to limit gun violence, hoping they cannot be quickly dismantled in court, according to aides and gun safety groups.Among the measures being considered - and strongly encouraged by activists - is one directing the Department of Justice (DOJ) to reinterpret existing law on untraceable "ghost guns."So-called "ghost gun" kits are self-assembled from parts purchased online or at gun shows and are increasingly associated with crimes. But they are not classified as firearms and so can be legally sold without serial numbers or background checks.The U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has said more than 30% of the illegal weapons it has confiscated in some areas of California are ghost guns.Changing the designation of such weapons would likely set off an instant legal challenge, as have other attempts to limit gun ownership in recent years, for instance former President Donald Trump's December 2018 ban on "bump stocks."Two top White House aides, Cedric Richmond and Susan Rice, held a series of meetings early in the Biden administration to begin soliciting views on gun violence policy from safety activists and community leaders. Justice Department officials have met with the gun industry.Among the topics discussed, according to attendees, were "ghost guns", pushing the DOJ to bring more cases against firearms dealers and manufacturers, limiting exemptions for private sales from background check rules, and alerting local law enforcement when someone fails a federal background check.Mass shootings last month in Georgia and Colorado have put pressure on the White House to act, as swift legislation is not likely through Congress. Press secretary Jen Psaki reiterated on Thursday that the administration is looking at executive orders.Police say the deadly shootings at spas in the Atlanta area and a supermarket in Boulder were carried out by suspects using legally-purchased firearms.Biden has said the administration is exploring whether he has the authority to take action on firearms made using 3D printers as well as on imported guns."We stand ready and all options are on the table," said Amy Hunter, a spokeswoman for the pro-gun National Rifle Association, when asked about the possibility of presidential executive orders.White House and Department of Justice lawyers are working to anticipate a raft of legal challenges, aides and allies said.The gun lobby is "a litigious group and will potentially take action in court - but their track record with litigation is remarkably poor," said Nick Suplina, managing director for law and policy at Everytown for Gun Safety Action Fund Inc, an advocacy group that works with the administration."We're optimistic that we will see action from the White House in the near future."The Department of Justice needs to create a paper trail to show that any rule change was not abrupt or political, that it has a strong foundation in law, and that officials followed a reasoned and orderly process before making the change, lawyers and activists say."They are talking about the levers that they have to address gun violence," said Christian Heyne, vice president of policy at the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, a group that has met with White House. "That's reflected in some of the meetings they had."The administration is also studying previous legal challenges from the gun industry, like the one that followed Trump's ban on "bump stocks." The devices, which enable semiautomatic weapons to fire in rapid, sustained bursts, were used in the October 2017 mass shooting at a Las Vegas concert that killed 60 and wounded more than 400.The Supreme Court has allowed that ban to go into effect as lawsuits continue in lower courts to try to overturn it.A group of 18 state attorneys general have called on Biden's Justice Department chief Merrick Garland to close what they consider the legal loophole on "ghost guns" himself.Absent congressional legislation that cements any U.S. presidents' executive orders or other policies into law, the conservative-leaning Supreme Court could have the final say.Last June it sidestepped a major gun ruling, however, by dismissing a challenge to restrictions on handgun owners in New York City and also turned down a slew of other cases seeking to expand gun rights.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-trying-to-craft-biden-s-gun-executive-orders-that-can-t-be-undone-101617366057450.html

As of the end of 2020, the number of ATM machines in China was 1.0139 million units, a decrease of 83,900 from the end of 2019, new data showed, adding that the number of ATMs per 10,000 people nationwide was 7.24, a year-on-year decrease of 7.95%.The decline in the number of ATM units in China began in 2018 but the rate rapidly increased last year. The fall in ATM number has been driven by businesses switching over to accepting online payment spurred by Covid-19 pandemic while vendors and fruit stores have increased their online and offline payment integration.In comparison, the total number of ATMs in India stood at 234,244 by the end of September 2020, marginally down from 234,357 in March 2020, according to the Reserve Bank of India data, quoted by fortuneindia.com in January this year.While industry reports say the first ATM was unveiled in China in 1985, the Bank of China, one of the country’s leading banks, says it issued the first ATM card in 1987.China’s push towards the use of digital yuan, its own digital currency, could further shrink those numbers in the coming years.Data from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), quoted by thepaper.cn, showed a sharp increase in non-cash payments in 2020. “According to data released by the central bank, in 2020, banks across the country handled a total of 354.621 billion non-cash payment services,” the article said.The amount of money involved in non-cash payments, including commercial papers, bank cards and online payment vehicles, totaled 4013.01 trillion yuan (about $613.84 trillion) last year, up 6.18% year-on-year, according to the PBOC.The country had 854 million online payment users as of December last year, an increase of more than 86 million since March 2020, said a report from the China Internet Network Information Centre.Results of a financial survey carried out last year but released in February showed that mobile payment penetration continues to rise in China as more consumers go digital.“In 2020, 98% of the 65,000 surveyed listed mobile payments as their most commonly used channel, up 5 percentage points from the previous year,” according to the report jointly released by China UnionPay, a domestic financial institution, and 17 commercial banks and payment institutions.“Affected by the epidemic, more offline payment scenarios have been migrating online…Meanwhile, small physical stores such as vendors and fruit stores have increased their online and offline payment integration, winning them customers during the epidemic,” the official news agency, Xinhua, reported, quoting from the survey.ATM manufacturers are adapting to the change and moving into making VTMs (virtual teller machines) and STM (smart teller machines.)However, ATM machines will not disappear in the immediate future, explained Yu Baicheng, the dean of Zero One Research Institute, a Beijing-based think-tank focused on finance. “Starting in 2015 and 2016, the transaction volume of bank deposits and withdrawals began to decline. Affected by this, banks’ demand for traditional ATM machines has declined, and some ATM suppliers have even withdrawn from the market,” Yu was quoted as saying by thepaper.cn.“However, ATM machines will not completely disappear, China’s regional development is quite different, and mobile payment cannot completely replace cash transactions,” Yu added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-atm-numbers-shrink-as-more-opt-for-cashless-payments-101617365823554.html
02-04-2021||World||Myanmar: Internet blackout widens, protesters vow to keep up the resistance||Opponents of military rule in Myanmar marched, observed strikes and sought alternative ways to communicate after most users were cut off from the internet on Friday, undaunted by the bloody suppression of protests during the past two months.Hundreds of people have been killed demonstrating since the Feb. 1 coup, and many people have been using social media to publicise the security forces' excesses and to organise against military rule.The authorities, who have already shut down mobile data, ordered internet providers from Friday to cut wireless broadband, depriving most customers of access. In response, anti-coup groups have shared radio frequencies, mobile apps such as maps that work without a data connection, and tips for using SMS messages as an alternative to data services to communicate."In the following days, there are street protests. Do as many guerrilla strikes as you can. Please join," Khin Sadar, a protest leader, said on Facebook in anticipation of the internet blackout, referring to quick protests in unexpected places that break up when the security forces appear."Let's listen to the radio again. Let's make phone calls to each other too."The military did not announce or explain its order to providers to cut wireless broadband. Internet was available only on fixed lines, rare in Myanmar where most homes and businesses connect through wireless networks.Authorities have been struggling to stifle an opposition demanding the restoration of civilian rule and release of elected government leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other figures.Violent incidents are occurring regularly in different parts of the country between the security forces and people set against military rule.In the town of Tamu on the Indian border, a policeman who supported the democracy movement was killed on Friday in a clash with security forces, the Monywa Gazette reported.Separately, security forces opened fire at a rally near the central city of Mandalay, wounding four people, two critically, according to three domestic media organisations.In the commercial hub of Yangon, a Myanmar employee of South Korea's Shinhan Bank died on Friday after being shot in the head while travelling in a minibus two days earlier, the bank said, adding it was discussing the situation with the government.Adding to the chaos in the former British colony, also known as Burma, hostilities between the armed forces and ethnic minority insurgents have broken out in at least two regions.Across the country, demonstrators held "flower strikes", leaving bouquets, some with messages of defiance, at places associated with activists killed by the security forces.People held up roses while making three-finger salutes, a symbol of resistance. Entire benches were covered in flowers and anti-coup messages.One arrangement of dandelions and red roses on a lakeside walkway read: "Myanmar is bleeding".Charged under the Official Secrets Act Despite the internet shutdown, users were still able to upload pictures of marches, flower strikes and a funeral of a slain protester.An image shared widely on social media showed an overhead view of hundreds of flickering candles on a dark road, forming the words "we will never surrender".Nobel laureate Suu Kyi and four allies have been charged with violating a colonial-era official secrets act, her chief lawyer said on Thursday, the most serious charge filed against her. Violations are punishable by up to 14 years in prison.Another of her lawyers, Min Min Soe, attended Suu Kyi's latest video-conference hearing on Thursday and said she was unable to tell whether the ousted leader, the figurehead of a decades-long fight against military dictatorship, was aware of the situation in the country.Some 543 people have been killed in the uprising, according to the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) advocacy group, which is tracking casualties and detentions. The military has repeatedly said those killed had instigated the violence.Protesters have been burning copies of the 2008 constitution after remnants of Suu Kyi's administration declared that it had repealed the military-drafted charter.Western countries have condemned the coup and the violence and some have imposed limited sanctions.Britain on Thursday blacklisted one of the military's conglomerates, following similar measures from other Western countries. Fashion brand Next announced it had suspended orders from Myanmar's factories.While Southeast Asian countries have traditionally been reluctant to criticise or sanction their neighbour, there are signs of growing dismay with a country that has for decades raised international concerns over its domestic repression.The Philippines, Malaysia, Indonesia, Singapore and most recently Thailand have called for an end to the violence.Several Southeast Asian foreign ministers have been meeting separately this week with their counterpart from China, which is among the few countries able to influence Myanmar's generals.In an interview transcript made available late on Thursday, Singapore Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said he was "alarmed and appalled" at the violence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-internet-blackout-widens-protesters-vow-to-keep-up-the-resistance-101617363615143.html

The death toll may rise, he added.In a separate roadside bomb attack in western Herat province, seven women travelling in a minivan were wounded, the provincial governor's office said.No one immediately claimed responsibility for the attacks, but Afghanistan has seen a nationwide spike in bombings, targeted killings, and violence on the battlefield as peace negotiations in Qatar between the Taliban and the Afghan government have stalled.Meanwhile, in a statement late Thursday, the Islamic State group claimed responsibility for the killing of a policewoman in eastern Nangarhar province earlier that day. The statement said that she was working with the “apostate” Afghan security services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/roadside-bombs-kill-5-wound-7-civilians-in-afghanistan-101617362473393.html
02-04-2021||World||Severe Covid-19 travel curbs in South America as WHO blasts EU vaccine rollout||South American nations severely tightened coronavirus travel curbs including shutting their borders with Brazil, where infections are spiralling, as the WHO slammed Europe's "unacceptably slow" vaccine rollout.Many European Union nations are reeling from dramatic spikes in cases that have forced the reimposition of unpopular restrictions, including in Belgium where police used water cannon to disperse thousands who had gathered in violation of Covid-19 rules.Spikes in South America have reached alarming levels, fuelled by a more contagious variant first detected in Brazil, as Chile closed all borders, Bolivia sealed its frontier with Brazil, and Peru went into a lockdown over Easter."We are in a very critical moment of the pandemic," Chilean government spokesman Jaime Bellolio said Thursday, as the nation announced a border closure starting Monday.Intensive care units in Chile are close to capacity, and authorities are trying to speed up vaccinations in a bid to stem the spread of Covid-19.Neighboring Peru started a four-day national lockdown for the Easter weekend as it recorded its highest number of new cases since the start of the pandemic.The country has a ban in place on all flights from Brazil, Britain and South Africa until April 15 to try and keep out the variants first detected there.Ecuador's president also announced fresh curbs against an outbreak he described as a "public calamity".Brazil is the epicentre of the coronavirus wave sweeping South America, reporting a staggering 66,500 Covid-19 deaths in March alone.At a field hospital in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, one doctor said she was alarmed at the spread of the virus -- and frustrated to see many of her compatriots ignore face masks, shun social distancing guidelines and even flood to underground parties."I see no difference in people's behaviour. People don't seem to understand the magnitude of this," said 53-year-old surgeon Marise Gomes.'Unacceptably slow'Europe is also struggling to stop dramatic surges in infections, as the World Health Organization warned Thursday that its sluggish vaccination drive was prolonging a pandemic that has already claimed more than 2.8 million lives worldwide."Vaccines present our best way out of this pandemic... however, the rollout of these vaccines is unacceptably slow," said WHO director for Europe Hans Kluge."We must speed up the process by ramping up manufacturing, reducing barriers to administering vaccines, and using every single vial we have in stock."Only 10 percent of Europe's total population has received one vaccine dose, and four percent have received two, according to the WHO.The EU's stalling roll-out stands in stark contrast with China, where the virus first originated, where biopharmaceutical firm Sinovac said Friday a third production line for its Covid-19 vaccine has been put into use, doubling its annual capacity of the jabs to two billion doses.Amid surging cases, authorities in many EU countries including France, Italy and Belgium have been forced to reimpose restrictions, but after more than a year under such measures, populations are becoming increasingly weary.Frustrations boiled over in Belgium on Thursday, where police used water cannon to disperse a crowd of 2,000 people that had come to a Brussels park despite strict coronavirus restrictions against such gatherings.AFP journalists at the scene saw projectiles thrown at police in riot gear in the Bois de la Cambre park, venue of a fake concert announced on social media as an April Fool's Day prank.'We can't do anything'There was more concern about the AstraZeneca shot on Friday, as Australian health officials said they were investigating a possible link between the vaccine and a case of blood clotting in a man who received it.Several countries, including some EU nations, have temporarily suspended the AstraZeneca shot over concerns about side effects in recent weeks, but have so far found no evidence linking it with blood clots.The WHO, EU regulators and AstraZeneca say the jab is safe.War-torn Syria's first shipment of the AstraZeneca vaccine under the global Covax scheme has been delayed until at least May, as the country's intensive care facilities are overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases."There are many patients who need intensive care," said Asma Sbayni, a doctor at the Mouwasat Hospital in Damascus."Unfortunately, there are many critical cases who die in front of us... We can't do anything for them."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/severe-covid-19-travel-curbs-in-south-america-as-who-blasts-eu-vaccine-rollout-101617361640375.html

The violent clashes left scores injured and several motorcycles burnt, Pakistan's News International reported.The clash continued for over 90 minutes until police reinforcements and Sindh Rangers personnel controlled the situation and forced the devotees out of the premises.There was reportedly a thin deployment of the police at the shrine as the relevant authorities appeared remiss that the gathering of tens of thousands of devotees in the small town could create a law and order situation, Express Tribune reported.During the clash, the mob broke down barriers and set on fire several vehicles, including motorcycles. This followed a free for all and soon a large group tore open the main door of the shrine to make their way inside.As the coronavirus cases in Sindh increase, the provincial government has decided to shut down shrines across the province.A few days back, the Sindh Government has announced its decision to close all shrines and Dargahs in the province for 10 days while the annual Urs of Hazrat Lal Shahbaz Qalandar was cancelled in view of the third wave of Covid-19 in the country.Sindh has reported over 266,000 coronavirus cases so far. The province has also reported 4,500 fatalities due to the infection.On Thursday, Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah announced that the province was set to impose more stringent restrictions in view of a spike in the number of Covid-19 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/clashes-in-pakistan-over-closure-of-shrine-as-covid-measure-leave-scores-injured-101617360844415.html

Sanders did not provide a date.The repairs included maintenance on the heating, ventilation and air conditioning system, replacing chimney liners and refurbishing some of the hardwood floors in the 19th century Victorian house, Sanders said.Officials had said it would be easier to do the work while the house was unoccupied after former Vice President Mike Pence and his wife moved out.Harris and Emhoff have spent the months since her inauguration on Jan. 20 living temporarily at Blair House, the president's official guest residence on Pennsylvania Avenue, across from the White House.Harris, a former U.S. senator from California, and her husband, were flying home to Los Angeles on Thursday with plans to remain there through Easter.The vice president has public events Monday in Oakland, California, and Tuesday in Chicago before her scheduled return to Washington later Tuesday evening.District of Columbia police recently arrested a man near the vice president’s official residence on a weapons charge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-to-move-into-official-vp-residence-next-week-101617359881584.html

In June 2020, then US President Donald Trump temporarily suspended employment-based nonimmigrant visas, including H-1B, to “prioritise the highest-skilled workers and protect American jobs” amid coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic. The ban on foreign workers visa was later extended to March 31, 2021, which expired two days ago.“Visa applicants who were previously refused visas due to the restrictions of Presidential Proclamation 10052 may reapply by submitting a new application including a new fee,” the state department’s travel advisory stated.The department also assured that the visa applications of those who have not yet been interviewed or scheduled for an interview will be prioritised and processed in accordance with the existing phased resumption of routine visa services. No specific dates have been declared by the department for the resumption of specific visa services at each US mission or when they will return to the processing at pre-pandemic workload levels.“The resumption of routine visa services, prioritized after services to U.S. citizens, is occurring on a post-by-post basis, consistent with the Department’s guidance for safely returning our workforce to Department facilities,” the state department added.Last year, Tech leaders like Google CEO Sundar Pichai and Apple CEO Tim Cook had expressed disappointment over the Trump administration’s decision to temporarily ban nonimmigrant visas and reform the H-1B immigration program. Pichai, an immigrant himself, said that immigration has contributed immensely to the economic success of the United States, making it a global leader in technology.H-1B visa allows US employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in speciality occupations and Indian IT professionals looking for onshore opportunities heavily depend on it. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Tuesday announced the completion of the H-1B cap lottery process for the fiscal year 2022 as they received enough e-registrations to reach the H-1B quota of 85,000, including the master’s cap.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/foreign-workers-impacted-by-trump-travel-ban-can-reapply-for-h-1b-visa-101617358684873.html
02-04-2021||World||Myanmar's neighbour Thailand unlikely to toughen stance on coup||Thailand has slightly hardened its language on Myanmar by saying it is "gravely concerned" about escalating bloodshed since a Feb. 1 coup, but close military ties and fears of a flood of refugees mean it is unlikely to go further, analysts say.That leaves Thailand out of step with some members of the 10-strong Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as they seek to ramp up pressure on the junta, but could also position it as a possible mediator."(Thailand’s position) is difficult, but I think there is an opportunity because we’ve become an important partner," Panitan Wattanayagorn, a political scientist at Bangkok's Chulalongkorn University, told Reuters.The closeness of the Thai and Myanmar armies was underscored by a request from Myanmar's junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, to Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha to "support democracy" within days of ousting elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi.Prayuth, who voiced that support, had himself seized power in a 2014 coup when army chief, before taking on his current civilian role in 2019 and rejecting opposition accusations that the vote was manipulated.The personal relationship began much earlier: within armies that appear to have long put behind them the historic rivalry between countries that used to be known as Burma and Siam.In 2018, Min Aung Hlaing was awarded Thailand's King Grand Cross of the Most Exalted Order of the White Elephant "in honour of the support he has shown for the Thai military," the Bangkok Post said at the time.Brotherhood"For them, the military brotherhood is very, very important," said Lalita Hingkanonta, a history professor at Thailand's Kasetsart University."I don't think that the escalation of violence will change the decision of the Thai government to accept more refugees...I think they just want to be friends with Myanmar more."Thailand potentially has more at stake in Myanmar than any other member of ASEAN, as it shares a 2,400-km (1,500-mile) border that is also Myanmar's longest with any neighbour.The geographical position, and a tradition of cautious diplomacy have been reasons for its particular care in remarks on the coup - only toughening its wording slightly after the civilian death toll topped 500 in Myanmar's crackdown on anti-coup protesters.Thailand's wording has still been much milder than that of ASEAN democracies Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Singapore.The border risks were highlighted by a surge of several thousand refugees this week fleeing bombing by Myanmar's forces of ethnic Karen rebels, an exodus reminiscent of the tens of thousands who fled Myanmar's wars in previous decades.Although Thailand denied that the latest refugees were being pushed back, they complained of having been blocked by Thai border guards, while a local Thai official told a meeting that it was official policy to bar their entry.GesturesWhile Thailand might come under diplomatic pressure to accept refugees or take a tougher stance, Lalita said Prayuth's government was unlikely to be moved."They would do something to respond to the international pressure, they would do some small things, just to show that, hey, we are responding very well to your concern. But that's it."Business links are also strong.Foreign direct investment by Thai businesses ranks behind only China and Singapore, with more than $11 billion approved since 1988.Annual cross-border trade stood at more than $9 billion in 2019 and many Thai businesses rely on Myanmar migrant workers - who officially number 1.6 million.Thailand matters even more for Myanmar, accounting for nearly a quarter of exports in 2019, mostly natural gas.But Thailand was unlikely to use its potential economic leverage with any sanctions on trade, said Piti Srisangnam, of the ASEAN Studies Center at Chulalongkorn University.He suggested Thailand might best pursue diplomacy behind the scenes, to try to encourage Myanmar's generals to curb violence and launch talks with ousted civilians now locked up or branded as traitors."If you have one friend you've known for a very long time, and one day he commits murder, it doesn't mean you won't be friends with him, right?" he said."You are still friends, but the best thing is to talk to him, to show that the thing he has done is very wrong."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-neighbour-thailand-unlikely-to-toughen-stance-on-coup-101617356918267.html
02-04-2021||World||UK sees 25 new blood-clot cases after AstraZeneca shots||The UK reported 25 new cases of rare blood clots possibly linked to AstraZeneca Plc’s Covid-19 vaccine, adding to the numbers that have caused some European countries to adopt precautionary measures.The fresh reports lift the total number of cases to 30 as of March 24, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency said in a statement Thursday. The benefits of the shot continue to outweigh the risks, the regulator said.AstraZeneca’s vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford, is under mounting scrutiny and has faced dwindling support in Europe. Still, countries are counting on the shot to help them exit the pandemic, and millions of doses have been administered across the region.Blood Clots, Anaphylaxis and Other Vaccine Fears: QuickTakeThe U.K. agency said that the 30 incidents were out of 18.1 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine given by March 24. Prior to that, the agency disclosed five cases on March 18, out of 11 million shots.With the new reports, the rate of incidents with the AstraZeneca shot in the U.K. is about 1 in 600,000. There were no reports of the same reactions to the vaccine from Pfizer Inc. and BioNTech SE, which is also being used in Britain.“On the basis of this ongoing review, the benefits of the vaccines against Covid-19 continue to outweigh any risks and you should continue to get your vaccine when invited to do so,” the MHRA said. The AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines have shown “very high levels of protection” against Covid-19, the agency said, adding that “all vaccines and medicines have some side effects.”U.K. ProgramThe U.K. has one of the world’s fastest-moving vaccine programs, administering shots to more than half of all adults by late March. New daily Covid cases and deaths have fallen to the lowest levels since September, even as infections surge anew across much of the European Union, where immunizations have lagged.Earlier this week, the EU drugs regulator said a link between the AstraZeneca vaccine and a rare type of blood clot is possible, identifying at least 62 cases of the condition. The European Medicines Agency said its safety committee will probably issue an updated recommendation next week.Read more: EU Regulator Sees Possible Link Between Astra Shot and ClotsGermany has restricted younger people from taking the AstraZeneca vaccine amid growing concerns about side effects. That followed reports of 31 cases of the rare clots, mostly in women.Norway and Denmark extended suspensions on the use of the shot, which has also been the subject of a tussle over supplies between the EU, the U.K., and others.On Friday, Australia reported one case of clotting disorders following inoculation with the AstraZeneca vaccine and is investigating, according to a joint statement by government agencies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-sees-25-new-blood-clot-cases-after-astrazeneca-shots-101617355963340.html

They killed one suspected jihadi, whose wife then killed herself by activating an explosive belt, the statement said. The explosion killed her baby in her arms, while an older daughter also at the scene survived, according to the ministry.Authorities said it was the first time they had reported the presence of a woman among the jihadis taking refuge in the area.In a second operation, in the Mount Mghila area, security forces killed a suspected leader of Tunisia's Jund Al Khilafa brigade, the statement said. The brigade pledged allegiance to the Islamic State group and is believed to be behind several attacks in Tunisia in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/extremist-kills-self-her-baby-in-tunisia-suicide-bombing-101617355205569.html

It’s a long way from her life as a live-in housekeeper in California years ago, and further still from a childhood working in El Salvador’s coffee fields.What has indelibly marked the path of the 44-year-old marketing specialist is a government program that lets people from disaster-stricken and war-torn countries live and work legally in the United States. While the Trump administration tried to cancel the program for many immigrants, President Joe Biden is backing legislation that would give Chavez and hundreds of thousands of people like her a shot at becoming American citizens.It’s a monumental shift from six months ago, when a court gave the Trump administration the right to halt Temporary Protected Status, or TPS, for four countries, stoking fear among many of the program’s 411,000 recipients that they could be sent back to their homelands.Now, these immigrants are pinning their hopes on the Senate after the House passed a sweeping bill to let them call the United States their permanent home. The legislation, which faces uncertain prospects, would offer an eight-year pathway to citizenship to an estimated 11 million people in the U.S. illegally and put immigrants brought to the country as children and TPS recipients on an even faster track to becoming Americans.For Chavez, who lives in Springdale, Arkansas, and has been renewing her temporary status for two decades, the legislation could put an end to fears of deportation. It also would let her travel more easily to see her mother and sister in their humble Salvadoran hometown.“We really hope everything is going to change in our favor now,” Chavez said.While temporary, the program can be renewed by U.S. officials and has been repeatedly. If supporters and critics agree on anything, it’s that a temporary program should not last decades.Last fall, there were 10 countries designated for the program by the U.S. Homeland Security secretary. The Biden administration, which has eased some of Trump’s hardline immigration policies and is facing an uptick in migration, has recently added two more — Myanmar and Venezuela.More than half of those with the status are from El Salvador, which was designated for the program after a 2001 earthquake. Many have lived in the U.S. for decades and have no plan of returning to a country that still sees thousands of people leave each year in search of economic stability and safety from gangs.Giving these immigrants the ability to stay could drive many of them to buy homes and invest in businesses in U.S. communities still reeling from the coronavirus pandemic, said Manuel Orozco, director of the Center for Migration and Economic Stabilization at the development organization Creative Associates International.“It’s almost like the logical thing to do because they are de facto Americans,” Orozco said. “It definitely will create better conditions for them not only to integrate but also strengthen their economic roots, improving the economy.”On the outskirts of the Salvadoran city of Santa Ana, Chavez's sister Iris Franco runs an at-home bakery and delivers the bread on a bike. It’s how she supports herself and her four children, the oldest of whom is studying to be a doctor — the first in her family to attend college.In 1994, the family reluctantly agreed Chavez would head north to stay with relatives in Los Angeles and work for three years. Initially, Chavez was a housekeeper and later worked the night shift at a gas station.Chavez ended up staying because she got married and had children but kept sending money home. Once she had TPS, she got better jobs in stores and restaurants, moved to Oklahoma and later Arkansas, and eventually landed work in a chiropractor’s office.Franco, 41, said the family lives humbly in El Salvador but better thanks to her sister’s assistance. Chavez sends money to help cover their mother's diabetes medication and helped Franco rebuild her home after flooding.“It changed our life, because we knew that we had my sister in that place, and so in whatever she could, she has helped us,” Franco said.Not that migration hasn’t come at a price. Franco remembers her sister crying when their mother was ill and she couldn’t be there and on the many Mother’s Days she missed.The sisters finally saw each other four years ago when Chavez filed paperwork with the U.S. government to travel to El Salvador. After her trip, Chavez joined with Franco to start a nonprofit to give children in their Salvadoran neighborhood school supplies and a gift at Christmas.In Arkansas, Chavez is raising two young sons with her husband — a Brazilian-born chef at a well-known restaurant — while leading a networking initiative she hopes will lead to Springdale’s first Latino chamber of commerce. Her oldest son will get married this year, and the next in line works as a delivery driver. Both are from a previous marriage.Chavez said she's grateful for her temporary status, which the government extended pending the outcome of litigation over the Trump administration's push to end the program. But she has no guarantee of permanency in the United States.TPS also doesn't solve her own immigration problems. Chavez's U.S. citizen husband has sponsored her for a green card, but she needs an old immigration court order cleared to apply.The bill in Congress could change that, giving her assurance that she’ll never be separated from her children.“If there were an amnesty or residency for all those on Temporary Protected Status, I’d automatically be in,” she said. “I’d always be protected from deportation. It would have a big impact.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/immigrants-with-temporary-status-have-grown-deep-roots-in-us-101617352669509.html

He told EU representatives he hoped European pharmaceutical firms would consider more investment in Vietnam.Long on Wednesday met with Chinese, Indian and Russian diplomats to discuss vaccines.Vietnam has been praised for its record in containing its coronavirus outbreaks through mass testing and tracing and strict quarantining, which has kept its cases to just 2,617, with 35 deaths.It aims to immunize 70% of its population and has so far inoculated 51,200 people. The request for help come as some countries express concern about vaccine shortages.Four Vietnamese companies are engaged in vaccine research and production and two are at the human trial stage.Its first home-grown vaccine called Nanocovax is expected to be put into use in 2022.With vaccinations underway in many parts of the world, flag carrier Vietnam Airlines and budget airline Vietjet Air have resumed some outbound flights.However, inbound flights remain suspended other than those carrying foreigners with special permission, or returning Vietnamese nationals.A proposal by aviation authorities to allow vaccinated foreigners into the country from September without quarantine is pending government approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vietnam-asks-for-foreign-support-in-procuring-covid-19-vaccines-101617352878500.html

02-04-2021||World||Indonesia's tourism mega-project 'tramples' on human rights: UN||A tourism mega-project on the Indonesian island of Lombok has uprooted local and indigenous people, and destroyed homes, fields, rivers, and religious sites, UN human rights experts said.The Mandalika, located in Lombok's West Nusa Tenggara province, includes a Grand Prix motorcycle circuit, hotels and a golf course, and is part of the "10 New Balis" strategy proposed by President Joko Widodo in 2016 to boost tourism revenues.In developing the 2-hectare (5-acre) site, "local residents were subjected to threats and intimidations, and forcibly evicted from their land without compensation", said Olivier De Schutter, UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights.Businesses and the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that funded the ongoing project, failed to do due diligence "to identify, prevent, mitigate and account for how they address adverse human rights impacts", he said in a statement.The AIIB said its operations adhered to its environmental and social guidelines, and that it had responded "swiftly" to complaints related to the project and commissioned an independent consultant to engage with the Indonesian government, businesses and local residents."The final report found no evidence of the alleged coercion, direct use of force, and intimidation relating to land acquisition and resettlement," it said in a statement late on Thursday.AIIB and the state-owned Indonesia Tourism Development Corporation (ITDC) have agreed on an action plan "to improve stakeholder engagement ... with project-affected people, village heads and local government officials, and more widely with civil society and the wider population of Lombok," it added.The ITDC and the Mandalika Grand Prix Association, which are both involved in the Mandalika development, did not respond to requests for comment.Globally, there is a growing awareness - and backlash against - the negative impacts of tourism, including environmental damage and the destruction of neighbourhoods as local residents are priced out.Poorer countries in Southeast Asia are particularly ill-equipped to limit the "invisible burden" of overtourism, said a 2019 report from The Travel Foundation charity in Britain.After the coronavirus pandemic devastated tourism-reliant economies of islands such as Indonesia's Bali and Thailand's Phuket, authorities are prioritising hospitality industry workers for vaccines in order to attract foreign tourists - a move criticised by human rights groups.The Mandalika was touted by authorities as critical to create jobs and improve livelihoods in the impoverished province, but human rights activists say the project - like many other tourism developments - has hurt indigenous people most."Indigenous people have no legal protections over their land and are not consulted or involved in the decision-making on these projects that do not benefit them," said Rukka Sombolinggi, secretary general of the Indigenous Peoples Alliance of the Archipelago (AMAN)."The government is keen to draw investors in industry, mining and tourism to revive the economy, but these are false solutions that hurt indigenous people, and have a big environmental impact, as well," she told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.The Mandalika development "tramples on human rights (and) is fundamentally incompatible" with the concept of sustainable development, De Schutter said."The time has passed for massive transnational tourism infrastructure projects that benefit a handful of economic actors rather than the population as a whole," he added.Instead, governments keen to build back better after Covid-19 "should focus on empowering local communities", enhancing livelihoods, and enabling their participation in decision-making, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesias-tourism-mega-project-tramples-on-human-rights-un-101617350680470.html

We are in the process of assessing it. There will be a new evalutaion in the coming days", Le Maire told CNews television when asked if he was sticking to the government's economic growth target for this year. It has forecast growth of 6% for 2021.Le Maire reiterated that the new lockdown measures would force the temporary closure of 150,000 businesses at a cost of 11 billion euros per month.Bank of France Governor Francois Villeroy de Galhau said on Thursday he did not expect the new restrictions to have an impact on the bank's forecast of 5.5% growth in 2021, provided the restrictions do not last beyond early May.France reported more than 50,000 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday and 308 deaths, while the number of people in intensive care units rose to 5,109.Le Maire repeated his calls for the European Union to accelerate the implementation of its economic stimulus plan."Europe must understand that we must move fast and that the stimulus funds promised to European citizen must now arrive in member states... In 2022 or 2023 it will be too late. The Chinese and the Americans will be ahead of us," he said.Though the 27-nation bloc agreed the landmark stimulus fund last summer, EU governments are still submitting detailed plans on how they aim to spend money from the fund, which many still need to ratify.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-restrictions-to-impact-french-growth-finance-minister-101617349910325.html

They agreed to a “sustained dialogue” in the future, it said.Vietnam and the U.S. “will continue to actively cooperate to comprehensively address the concerns to maintain stable trade relations,” the trade ministry said in a statement posted on its website.Vietnam’s currency had become a target in the Trump administration even as the former enemies continued to become closer to counter China’s rising military and economic might in the region. The U.S. has refrained from hitting Vietnam with punitive tariffs even after the U.S. Treasury designated the Hanoi government as a currency manipulator and the U.S. Trade Representative labeled Vietnam’s currency actions unreasonable and restrictive to American businesses.The USTR’s determination in January was the result of an investigation that started last year under section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 -- the same legislation the Trump administration used to apply tariffs on billions of dollars of imports from China.Vietnam’s central bank has maintained it doesn’t use the exchange rate to create an unfair competitive advantage in international trade. The Southeast Asian nation’s wood industry has vowed to tighten regulations and buy more American lumber to avoid punitive tariffs that would devastate the sector.Tai and Anh plan to hold a meeting later this year under the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement to work on “resolving bilateral issues,” according to the U.S. readout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-trade-chief-raises-concerns-on-vietnam-currency-policy-101617341543308.html

02-04-2021||World||World Autism Awareness Day 2021: Theme, significance of the day||World Autism Awareness Day is observed every year on April 2 with the aim to spread awareness about autism and make people understand the challenges faced by those with the developmental disorder. The United Nations General Assembly unanimously declared April 2 as World Autism Awareness Day from 2008 after the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities came into force. The UN Department of Global Communications and UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs, in collaboration with the Specialisterne Foundation, will organise a virtual event to commemorate the day which will include moderated panel discussions with individuals on the autism spectrum who have themselves experienced the challenges, according to the United Nations (UN) website.“Persons with autism have long faced many of these inequalities, which have only been further exacerbated by the pandemic. It’s a problem made worse by long recognized discriminatory hiring practices and workplace environments that present major obstacles for persons with autism; all of which contribute to the unemployment or severe underemployment of a large majority of adults on the autism spectrum,” the UN said.Autism, which is also called autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a complicated condition used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental disorders which are related to communication, social interaction, restricted, repetitive and stereotyped interests or patterns of behaviour.According to the 2011 Census of India, there are 7,862,921 children with disabilities below the 19 year age group in the country, among which 595,089 have an intellectual disability. According to a study done by INCLEN Trust International in 2018, about 1 in 100 children in India under age 10 have autism, and nearly 1 in 8 has at least one neurodevelopmental condition.Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan tweeted on World Autism Day and called for a “conducive space” for those with autism. “Interventions for people dealing with Autism need to be accompanied by broader actions. Let's do our bit to build an inclusive and supportive society by creating a conducive space for them,” he posted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-autism-awareness-day-2021-theme-significance-of-the-day-101617341930495.html
02-04-2021||World||Taiwan train derailment: 41 dead, many injured||A passenger train smashed into a vehicle on its tracks and partially derailed outside a rail tunnel in Taiwan on Friday, killing at least 41 people and injuring dozens. Survivors climbed out windows and onto roofs to reach safety in Taiwan's deadliest railway disaster.Officials in Hualien county said rescue efforts were continuing on the train reportedly carrying 350 passengers. The crash occurred early on a public weekend, and Taiwan's extensive rail system is popular with people avoiding treacherous mountainous roads.Most other people on the train have been rescued though rescuers are searching wrecked cars for “several people” who may be stuck in awkward places, railways news officer Weng Hui-ping said. He said the 36 confirmed dead was Taiwan’s worst-ever in terms of death toll.Weng said a construction site truck operated by the railway administration slid onto the track from a work site on the hillside above. The truck was off duty at the time. He said the speed of the train was uncertain when it crashed into the vehicle at 9:28 a.m. near the Toroko Gorge scenic area.The train had only partially emerged from the tunnel, and with much of it still inside, escaping passengers were forced to scale doors, windows and roofs to reach safety.Television footage and photos posted by people at the scene on the website of the official Central News Agency showed people climbing out the open door of a railcar just outside the entrance to the tunnel. The inside of one car was pushed all the way into the adjacent seat.In a tweet, Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen said emergency services “have been fully mobilized to rescue & assist the passengers & railway staff affected. We will continue to do everything we can to ensure their safety in the wake of this heartbreaking incident."The accident came on the first day of the four-day Tomb Sweeping Festival, an annual religious festival when people travel to their hometowns for family gatherings and to worship at the graves of their ancestors.Taiwanese Premier Su Tseng-chang said the Railways Administration would be required to immediately conduct checks along other track line to “prevent this from happening again.”Taiwan's last major rail crash was in October 2018 when an express train derailed while rounding a tight corner on the northeast coast, killing at least 18 people and injuring nearly 200.In 1991, a collision in western Taiwan killed 30 people and another accident a decade earlier had also killed 30. Those were said to the worst previous crashes on the railway system that dates from the late 19th century.Taiwan is a mountainous island where most of its 24 million people are squeezed onto flatlands along the northern and western coasts that is home to most of the island's farmland, biggest cities and high-tech industries. The lightly populated east is popular with tourists, many of whom arrive along the coastal railway lines to avoid treacherous mountain roads.Taiwan's extensive rail system has undergone substantial upgrades in recent years, particularly with the addition of a high-speed line connecting the capital Taipei with west coast cities to the south.The train involved in Friday's accident, the Toroko No. 408 is one of Taiwan's newer models and requires tickets to be reserved in advance with no standing allowed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/taiwan-train-derailment-36-suspected-dead-many-injured-101617337739779.html
02-04-2021||World||A fifth of world's food-output growth has been lost to climate change||Climate change has been holding back food production for decades, with a new study showing that about 21% of growth for agricultural output was lost since the 1960s.That’s equal to losing the last seven years of productivity growth, according to research led by Cornell University and published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The study was funded by a unit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.The revelation comes as the United Nations’ World Food Programme warns of a “looming catastrophe” with about 34 million people globally on the brink of famine. The group has cited climate change as a major factor contributing to the sharp increase in hunger around the world. Food inflation is also on the rise as farmers deal with the impact of extreme weather at a time of robust demand.This is the first study to look at how climate change has historically affected agricultural production on a global scale, using econometrics and climate models to figure out how much of the sector’s total productivity has been affected, across crops and livestock.The loss of productivity comes even as billions has been poured into improving agricultural production through the development of new seeds, sophisticated farm machinery and other technological advances.“Even though globally agriculture is more productive, that greater productivity on average doesn’t translate into more climate resilience,” said Ariel Ortiz-Bobea, an author of the paper and associate professor at Cornell’s Charles H. Dyson School of Applied Economics and Management.The damages to productivity growth aren’t evenly spread across regions. Warmer areas -- especially those in the tropics -- are more detrimentally affected. Ortiz-Bobea said that coincides with many countries where agriculture makes up a bigger share of the economy.He was also warned that current research into improving production may not enough consider the pace of climate change.“I worry that we’re breeding or preparing ourselves for the climate we’re in now, not what is coming up in the next couple of decades.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-fifth-of-world-s-food-output-growth-has-been-lost-to-climate-change-101617321065646.html
02-04-2021||World||Moderna gets nod in US to speed up virus vaccine output with bigger vials||The US drug regulator gave Moderna Inc clearance to speed up output of its Covid-19 vaccine by letting it fill a single vial with up to 15 doses, with the United States banking on rapid immunisation to stem the spread of the deadly virus.The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) also authorized vaccinators to extract a maximum of 11 doses from the current vials, instead of the ten previously permitted.In a statement, Moderna said its vaccine can now can be supplied in vials containing 11 or 15 doses, and it expected to begin shipping 15-dose vials in coming weeks."Both of these revisions positively impact the supply of Moderna COVID-19 Vaccine, which will help provide more vaccine doses to communities and allow shots to get into arms more quickly," Peter Marks, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, said.However, the regulator also warned that without proper syringes and needles it may not be possible to extract more that 13 doses from Moderna's 15 dose vials, and more than 10 doses from the current vials.Moderna has supplied 100 million doses of its vaccine to the United States as of March 29. Pfizer/BioNTech and Johnson & Johnson's shots are the other two vaccines approved in the country.With rising cases and several states even lifting mask mandates and with more infectious variants also spreading, health authorities are hoping that the contracts it struck with the currently approved vaccine makers will be enough for its entire population.U.S. top infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci told Reuters on Thursday that the country may not need AstraZeneca's COVID-19 vaccine even if it wins U.S. regulatory approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/moderna-gets-nod-in-us-to-speed-up-virus-vaccine-output-with-bigger-vials-101617334572735.html
02-04-2021||World||UK politicians oppose use of ‘divisive’ Covid-19 passports||Prime Minister Boris Johnson risks triggering a major backlash among members of the ruling Conservative Party if his UK government opts to use so-called Covid passports to help re-open the economy.More than 70 members of Parliament from three parties -- including 41 from Johnson’s Tories -- pledged to oppose the use of vaccine certificates, calling them “divisive and discriminatory.” They include former Conservative Party leader Iain Duncan Smith, former Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn and Liberal Democrat Party leader Ed Davey.“We oppose the divisive and discriminatory use of Covid status certification to deny individuals access to general services, businesses or jobs,” the pledge reads, according to a statement Friday from civil liberties campaign group Big Brother Watch. The pledge came as it emerged the government is considering using Covid certification as part of trials to re-open large scale events such as sports matches, concerts and conferences.The opposition from across the political spectrum suggests the premier may struggle to get the measure through Parliament if he pursues it. The government is studying Covid certification as a potential means to bolster confidence in returning to restaurants and entertainment venues while also helping to keep coronavirus cases under control.The Telegraph late Thursday reported that the government is set to trial passports demonstrating a person’s Covid status at sporting and cultural events within weeks. But a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that while such a policy is under consideration, no final decision has been taken, pending a review by the Cabinet Office over the feasibility of Covid certification.FA Cup FinalThe person also said that events including soccer’s FA Cup Final, one of the cup semi-finals, and the Snooker World Championships will take part in a pilot program in April and May to reopen large-scale events with less social distancing and larger crowds than currently permitted under Covid rules. The Brit Awards for music are also under consideration, according to the person, who spoke anonymously about unannounced plans.The pilot program forms part of the government’s road map for unlocking the economy, and will use “enhanced testing approaches,” according to the government plan published in February.The Cabinet Office report on certification is due for publication by June 21, though Johnson’s office has indicated interim findings are likely April 5 -- the same day the government is due to give an early indication on how foreign travel will re-open, something ministers have said won’t happen before May 17 at the earliest.“There’s definitely going to be a world in which international travel will use vaccine passports,” Johnson told reporters Thursday during a trip to northeast England. He also said proof of someone’s Covid status -- whether it’s immunity from having had the disease or an inoculation, or a negative test -- could be “useful” in re-opening the domestic economy.‘Useful’“Those three things working together will be useful for us as we go forward,” he said.Johnson’s comments contrast with those of Labour leader Keir Starmer, who told the Telegraph newspaper on Wednesday that using Covid passports for everyday social activities goes against the British “instinct.”As the vaccine is rolled out and deaths diminish, “there will be a British sense that we don’t actually want to go down this road,” he said.Starmer said he would examine any proposals before deciding Labour’s stance. But if the 41 Tories signing Friday’s pledge joined with all opposition MPs to vote against any measures on Covid certification, they’d have the numbers to defeat the government.Labour Member of the House of Lords Shami Chakrabarti called domestic Covid passports “an authoritarian step too far.” Influential rank-and-file Conservative Graham Brady said: “We should aim to return to normal life, not to put permanent restrictions in place.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-politicians-oppose-use-of-divisive-covid-19-passports-101617321152382.html

She wore a black mask and a black pantsuit and had short black hair.A few minutes later, “Jasmine” reemerged without the wig — revealing herself to be Jill Biden, laughing and proclaiming, “April Fools!”The first lady's aides told reporters that they were just as surprised to discover the true identity of “Jasmine.”In her 2019 memoir, “Where the Light Enters,” Biden admitted she enjoys playing pranks. When her husband was vice president during the Obama administration, she once hid in an overhead bin on Air Force Two, frightening the first person who was unlucky enough to try to pack his luggage there.“I've always believed you've got to steal the joyful moments when you can,” she wrote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-first-lady-jill-biden-treats-reporters-to-april-fools-day-prank-101617333827459.html

And in front of all of the friends who are here, I just have to tell you he has been tireless for months and months, working on this issue," Harris said during a virtual meeting to discuss COVID-19 public education efforts."So, in front of everyone, I want to thank you, Vivek, for all you have been doing to lift us up as a nation and to also lift up the importance of following the science and the fact that we are in this together, and so lifting up the power and significance of the collective," Harris said.Murthy, who was sworn in as the surgeon general last week, introduced Harris at the virtual meeting."I'm so honoured to introduce one of our nation's most important leaders. One who has broken barriers and lifted up communities, a leader who is kind, and strong, and who inspired millions of people, including myself and a daughter, who called her Kamala auntie," Murthy said."To serve as a surgeon, in my role, I'm charged with looking out for the health and well-being of each and every American. I consider this to be as a sacred responsibility, particularly in this great moment. When we are living through a once in a century," he said.Observing that COVID-19 has caused tremendous suffering for millions of Americans, he said many of them lost family members to this virus."I myself have lost seven, including my uncle earlier this year. Many of us have also felt what it's like to be worried about your loved ones getting killed, especially family members of ours who are elderly, or who might work on the frontlines," he said.In her remarks, Harris talked about racial inequalities."It is very important to the President that we speak truth and address racial inequities across the board, but on this topic, in particular, in our healthcare system. And, again, these disparities existed long before," she said."When we look at the rates of infection and death in the Asian community, in the African American community, Latinos, our native community, the numbers are really unacceptable and tragic. In terms of the impact on these communities, of course, profound,” she said.This is something that the administration has been addressing, she said."We have a Racial Equity Task Force that is very much a part of our whole approach to this. And, in addition, you will often hear the president and all of us talk about the importance of equitable distribution of resources and support," Harris said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-surgeon-general-murthy-hailed-by-vp-harris-for-tireless-work-against-covid-101617330777047.html

We isolated this batch and it will be disposed of properly," the statement said on Thursday. "Discarding a batch of bulk drug substance, while disappointing, does occasionally happen during vaccine manufacturing, which is a complex and multi-step biological process.""We are pleased we have met our commitment to deliver enough single-shot vaccines by the end of March to enable the full vaccination of more than 20 million people in the United States. This is part of our plan to deliver 100 million single-shot vaccines to the U.S. during the first half of 2021, aiming to deliver those doses by the end of May," the statement further read.Emergent BioSolutions said in the statement it remains confident the requirements it will meet the safety requirements and standards of the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was approved for emergency use in the United States at the end of February, becoming the third vaccine to be authorized by the FDA in addition to the ones produced by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna.On Wednesday, Johnson & Johnson said in a statement that it was still planning to supply 100 million doses by the end of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-j-j-covid-19-vaccine-supplier-acknowledges-botch-101617328980605.html

This first batch is part of 1.9 million doses that Yemen will initially receive throughout 2021.External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar had tweeted: “Arrival in Aden. Made in India vaccines land in Yemen,” with the hashtag ‘VaccineMaitri’.UNICEF Representative Philippe Duamelle and WHO Representative Dr Adham Ismail took delivery of the vaccines in Aden, together with the Minister of Health and Population Dr Qasim Buhaibeh, and the Deputy Minister of Public Health and Population Dr Ali Alwaleedi."The arrival of the Covid-19 vaccine doses is a critical moment for Yemen,” Duamelle said."As Covid-19 continues to claim lives around the world, Yemen now has the capacity to protect those most at risk, including health workers, so that they can safely continue to provide life-saving interventions for children and families. Vaccines work, vaccines save lives, now let’s start getting people vaccinated,” he added.Ismail said the shipment represents an important step in the fight against Covid-19 in Yemen.“It will help save lives, including those at highest risk of serious disease, and will help protect the health system. These safe and effective vaccines will be a game changer, but for the foreseeable future we must continue wearing masks, physically distance and avoid crowds," he said.Rehan Hafiz, Senior Country Manager Yemen, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance expressed delight that Sana’a has received its first COVAX vaccine doses."We look forward to the launch of the vaccination campaign. Thanks to the work of the Government of Yemen and of the COVAX partners, and with the support of our donors, we are now able to protect our most vulnerable populations,” Hafiz said, adding that their work is only beginning, but the arrival of the first COVAX Covid-19 doses is a major milestone for Yemen.COVAX, the vaccines pillar of the Access to Covid-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, is co-led by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance (Gavi) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – working in partnership with UNICEF as key implementing partner, as well as civil society organisations, vaccine manufacturers, the World Bank, and others.Spokesman for UN Secretary-General Stephane Dujarric also told reporters during the daily press briefing that Yemen received 360,000 vaccine doses shipped via the COVAX Facility.“These vaccines, licensed and manufactured by the Serum Institute of India, will enable health workers and other vulnerable populations to be protected against the virus,” he said.Dujarric said the first batch of vaccines along with 13,000 safety boxes and 1,300,000 syringes are critical for the safe and effective roll-out of the vaccination campaign in the country.Nearly 2 million doses are expected for Yemen this year, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/madeinindia-covid-19-vaccines-in-yemen-a-game-changer-un-official-101617326658111.html

Navalny told her off in front of a line of prisoners for 15 minutes, calling her a parasite and servant of the thieves in power," they said.Alexei Barinov, a doctor, told Reuters early on Thursday that Navalny's lawyers had asked him to treat Navalny and that they had asked the prison service either to allow him into the prison or to let Navalny out to a clinic."We're waiting for a decision from the FSIN (prison service)," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-kremlin-critic-navalny-lost-8kg-due-to-sleep-deprivation-say-allies-101617326652440.html
02-04-2021||World||'Deep concern': UN condemns violence against Myanmar protesters and deaths||The U.N. Security Council late Thursday strongly condemned the use of violence against peaceful protesters and the deaths of hundreds of civilians in Myanmar, but dropped the threat of possible future action against the military following the Feb. 1 coup.The British-drafted press statement approved by all 15 council members after intense negotiations that began Wednesday expressed “deep concern at the rapidly deteriorating situation” in Myanmar and reiterated the council's call on the military “to exercise utmost restraint.”The original draft was much stronger and would have expressed the Security Council’s “readiness to consider further steps,” which could include sanctions. It would also have “deplored” the use of violence against peaceful protesters and “condemned in the strongest terms the killing of hundreds of civilians by the security forces.”Also Read | Myanmar orders wireless internet shutdown: Telecoms But at China’s insistence, the reference to “further steps” was eliminated and the stronger language, including the words “killing" and “deplore," was softened in the final statement, council diplomats said, speaking on condition of anonymity because discussions were private.The reference to “further steps" was replaced in the final statement with a sentence saying council members “stressed that they continued to monitor the situation closely and would remain actively seized of the matter.”The final council statement also called “on all sides to refrain from violence” -- which diplomats said Russia demanded -- and “reiterated the need to fully respect human rights and to pursue dialogue and reconciliation in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar.”It also noted U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' March 27 statement “calling for a firm, unified and resolute response from the international community."The press statement followed Wednesday’s closed council meeting at which the U.N. special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, warned that the country faces the possibility of civil war “at an unprecedented scale” and urged the Security Council to consider “potentially significant action” to reverse the coup and restore democracy.She didn’t specify what action she considered significant, but she painted a dire picture of the military crackdown and told the council in a closed briefing that Myanmar “is on the verge of spiraling into a failed state.” She urged the council “to consider all available tools to take collective action” and do what the people of Myanmar deserve — “prevent a multidimensional catastrophe in the heart of Asia.”The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades had languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi’s rise to leadership in 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country.At Wednesday's virtual meeting, Schraner Burgener denounced the killing and arrest of unarmed protesters seeking to restore democracy. She cited figures from Myanmar’s Assistance Association for Political Prisoners that as of Wednesday, some 2,729 people have been arrested, charged or sentenced since the coup and an estimated 536 have been killed.This was the second press statement approved by the council since the coup.The council also adopted a presidential statement -- one step below a resolution -- on March 10 calling for a reversal of the coup, strongly condemning the violence against peaceful protesters and calling for “utmost restraint” by the military. It stressed the need to uphold “democratic institutions and processes” and called for the immediate release of detained government leaders including Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.The statement approved Thursday also calls for their immediate release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/deep-concern-un-condemns-violence-against-myanmar-protesters-and-deaths-101617324945641.html
02-04-2021||World||Myanmar orders wireless internet shutdown: Telecoms||Myanmar's wireless broadband internet services were shut down on Friday by order of the military, a local provider said, as protesters continued to defy the threat of lethal violence to oppose the junta's takeover.A directive from the Ministry of Transport and Communications on Thursday instructed that "all wireless broadband data services be temporarily suspended until further notice,” according to a statement posted online by local provider Ooredoo.Fiber-based landline internet connections were still working, albeit at drastically reduced speeds.Also Friday, the New York-based Human Rights Watch issued a report saying that Myanmar's military has forcibly disappeared hundreds of people, including politicians, election officials, journalists, activists and protesters and refused to confirm their location or allow access to lawyers or family members in violation of international law.“The military junta's widespread use of arbitrary arrests and enforced disappearances appears designed to strike fear in the hearts of anti-coup protesters,” said Brad Adams, Human Rights Watch's Asia director. “Concerned governments should demand the release of everyone disappeared and impose targeted economic sanctions against junta leaders to finally hold this abusive military to account.”The crisis in the Southeast Asian nation has expanded sharply in the past week, both in the number of protesters killed and with military airstrikes against the guerrilla forces of the Karen ethnic minority in their homeland along the border with Thailand.In areas controlled by the Karen, more than a dozen civilians have been killed since Saturday and more than 20,000 have been displaced, according to the Free Burma Rangers, a relief agency operating in the area.About 3,000 Karen fled to Thailand, but many returned under unclear circumstances. Thai authorities said they went back voluntarily, but aid groups say they are not safe and many are hiding in the jungle and in caves on the Myanmar side of the border.The UN Human Rights Office for Southeast Asia called on countries in the region “to protect all people fleeing violence and persecution in the country” and “ensure that refugees and undocumented migrants are not forcibly returned,” UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters at UN headquarters in New York.The UN Security Council late Thursday strongly condemned the use of violence against peaceful protesters. The press statement was unanimous but weaker than a draft that would have expressed its “readiness to consider further steps,” which could include sanctions. China and Russia, both permanent Council members and both arms suppliers to Myanmar's military, have generally opposed sanctions.The statement came after the UN special envoy for Myanmar warned the country faces the possibility of civil war and urged significant action be taken or risk it spiraling into a failed state.Earlier this week, an opposition group consisting of elected lawmakers who were not allowed to be sworn into office February 1 put forth an interim charter to replace Myanmar's 2008 constitution. By proposing greater autonomy for ethnic minorities, it aims to ally the armed ethnic militias active in border areas with the mass protest movement based in cities and towns.More than a dozen ethnic minority groups have sought greater autonomy from the central government for decades, sometimes through armed struggle. Even in times of peace, relations have been strained and cease-fires fragile. Several of the major groups — including the Kachin, the Karen and the Rakhine Arakan Army — have denounced the coup and said they will defend protesters in their territories.The coup reversed years of slow progress toward democracy in Myanmar, which for five decades languished under strict military rule that led to international isolation and sanctions. As the generals loosened their grip, culminating in Aung San Suu Kyi's rise to leadership in 2015 elections, the international community responded by lifting most sanctions and pouring investment into the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-orders-wireless-internet-shutdown-telecoms-101617324996542.html
02-04-2021||World||Corporate criticism of GOP-led voting bills spreads to Texas||The ranks of big corporations now criticizing GOP efforts to restrict voting access spread Thursday to Texas as measures that would reduce options to cast ballots and limit polling hours advanced in the state Capitol.American Airlines, which is based in Fort Worth, came out against restrictive voting measures that have a favorable path to reaching Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's desk in the coming weeks.The opposition came the same day a package of sweeping elections changes cleared the GOP-controlled Senate and, notably, a day after some of Georgia’s most prominent corporate leaders came out publicly against a new election law after civil rights activists criticized their silence.“To make American’s stance clear: We are strongly opposed to this bill and others like it,” the airline said in a statement.Unlike in Georgia, the corporate criticism in Texas to the election bills comes before they have been signed into law. Corporate interests carry big clout in the Texas Capitol, but Abbott and other Republicans have given no indication of wavering in their pursuit of passing the measures before the session ends in May.The passage of Senate Bill 7 along party lines after midnight early Thursday was a key marker in the GOP's campaign to impose new restrictive voting rules in America's biggest red state.Hours later, House Republicans began efforts to move a similar bill, known as House Bill 6, to the floor with nearly 200 people signed up to testify.Billionaire Michael Dell, whose tech company is headquartered in suburban Austin, tweeted Thursday, “Governments should ensure citizens have their voices heard. HB6 does the opposite, and we are opposed to it."Critics of the Texas legislation say the efforts particularly target expanded access put into place during last year's election in Harris County, which is home to more than 2 million voters, controlled by Democrats and a key Texas battleground that includes Houston.One measure would eliminate drive-thru voting, which more than 127,000 people around Houston used during early voting last year. More than half of those voters were Black, Latino or Asian, said Democratic state Sen. Carol Alvarado.“Hearing all of that, who are you really targeting when you're trying to get rid of drive-thru voting?" she said.Republicans rejected accusations that the bill was designed to suppress turnout.“None of what we've discussed is voter suppression. And none of what we've discussed is Jim Crow,” Republican state Sen. Paul Bettencourt said.The voting packages in Texas mirror a nationwide campaign by Republicans after former President Donald Trump made false claims about election fraud.Voting rights groups say the measures would disproportionately impact racial and ethnic minority voters. In Texas, which already has some of the strictest voting laws in the U.S., the proposed legislation grants more power to partisan poll watchers and eliminates the option to cast a ballot via drive-thru. The bill also includes a provision requiring a doctor’s note for people with disabilities who want to vote by mail, although Republicans signaled during the debate that language could change.Trump won Texas but by fewer than 6 points. It was the closest victory by any GOP presidential nominee in Texas since 1996, underscoring Republicans' loosening iron grip on the state.The Senate bill cleared a committee last week following hours of testimony by voters. Some said the ongoing coronavirus pandemic is forcing them to choose between their health and their right to be heard by their government after weighing the risk of testifying on the bill in-person at the Texas capitol, where masks are not enforced.Ofelia Alonso, 25, a volunteer with civil rights advocacy group Texas Rising and volunteer deputy registrar, said Friday she drove hundreds of miles from Cameron County along the U.S.-Mexico border, which has been hit extremely hard by COVID-19, to testify in Austin for the members of her community who couldn't afford the health risk.“Honestly, because we all work doing voter registration, we know how nonsensical this bill is," Alonso said. "It makes absolutely no sense to criminalize people for wanting to participate in democracy, which should be our goal. It is almost like Texans get punished for coming out and voting in large numbers.”___Associated Press writer Acacia Coronado contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/corporate-criticism-of-gop-led-voting-bills-spreads-to-texas-101617324180421.html

The list of 13 symptoms included fatigue, muscle pain and difficulty concentrating as well as loss of taste and smell.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageWomen were more more likely (14.7 percent) to report such long-lasting symptoms than men (12.7 percent).Those aged 35-49 were most likely to report symptoms at five weeks (25.6 percent).The study of UK patients was based on a random sample of 21,622 participants who tested positive from swabs and were asked about their symptoms monthly.A control group who were unlikely to have been infected was also set up. It found they were eight times less likely to have such symptoms.A larger survey of 1.1 million people self-reported long Covid over the four weeks ending March 6, 2021, the ONS said.Ben Humberstone, Head of Health Analysis and Life Events at the ONS said this was its first analysis of new data and "our understanding of it and its quality will improve over time".Long Covid "is an emerging phenomenon that is not yet fully understood", he added.Britain, one of the countries worst hit by the pandemic, has recorded nearly 127,000 deaths from Covid and 4,350,266 cases.However, the number of daily deaths and positive tests have fallen steadily amid a strong vaccination campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/almost-1-in-7-suffers-long-covid-uk-study-101617324570471.html
02-04-2021||World||A ghostly set of images, and a glimpse of danger at the southern US border||A border wall. Smugglers. Small children being dropped into America in the darkness.A grainy video released Wednesday by authorities — its figures visible only in ghostly white outline, its stark storyline dramatic and obvious — captures, in mere seconds, the dangers for migrant children at the southern US border.A man straddling a 14-foot barrier near Santa Teresa, New Mexico, lowers a toddler while holding onto one arm. With the child dangling, he lets go. She lands on her feet, then falls forward face first into the dirt. The smuggler does the same thing with a slightly larger child, who falls on her feet and then her bottom. Then the smuggler and another man run off into the desert, deeper into Mexico.The simple scene caught by a remote camera is an extreme case. But it embodies so much of the saga playing out on the border amid a spike in migrant arrivals, particularly children.There is implied desperation — a family willing to subject their children to such risks in hopes of changing their future. There is the callousness of the smugglers handling kids like rag dolls.And there is that barrier over which so many have fought — a symbol of American strength for some, a decidedly un-American thing altogether for others. A fence that, despite its height, is relatively easily overcome.For immigrant advocates, scenes like this underscore why immigration laws need to be overhauled with a focus on unifying families and making legal immigration easier. For many opponents of such reform, scenes like this are confirmation that the nation's rule of law isn't being respected, that a reform of immigration policies could never even be contemplated while such things are happening. And Americans of all political stripes may debate what circumstances, if any, justify parents taking such actions.While such debates happen, thousands of migrants from Mexico, Central America, and countries further south are arriving every day to the Mexico-U.S. border. Many are fleeing violence or other hardships in their home countries. Others are simply looking for better economic opportunities. They arrive by boat or wade through the Rio Grande River in Texas, or come on land into California, Arizona and New Mexico.Many are children traveling alone. Border authorities encountered more than 9,000 children without a parent in February, the highest single month since May 2019, when 11,000 unaccompanied minors came to the border.Unlike their parents in many situations, all unaccompanied minors are allowed to stay in the U.S. That dynamic has prompted many parents to either send kids on the journey to America alone, or get to the border and let them go the rest of the way. Most end up at least temporarily in shelters that are currently way beyond capacity.Border authorities said the children caught on video were sisters, ages 3 and 5, and from Ecuador. They were found alert, taken to a hospital and cleared or any physical injuries. As of Thursday, they remained at a Border Patrol temporary holding facility pending placement by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department.The girls’ mother is in the United States and authorities are in contact with her, Roger Maier, a spokesman for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told The Associated Press on Thursday. Maier couldn’t provide more details.Many children arriving alone have relatives in the United States. If they are too young to remember names or phone numbers, as these girls likely were, they may come with contact information written down on paper or directly on their bodies. After being processed by the Border Patrol, they are transferred to Health and Human Services. Eventually they will be released to a sponsor, usually a parent or close relative.The hope of those who send the children is that they will eventually be reunited with family in the U.S. But the risks to get to that point are enormous.They can come from traveling without parents. They can come from the actual crossing, whether by river, crammed into a vehicle or on foot through the desert and traversing a wall; last year, a woman died after falling from a barrier in the Santa Teresa area where the girls were found. Finally, the risks can come from unscrupulous smugglers.“People considering using the services of smugglers need to know that smugglers don’t have the kids’ best interest at heart. It’s entirely too dangerous,” said Maier, who added this about the girls being dropped: “Had it not been an area that was monitored, these children would have been fending for themselves.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/a-ghostly-set-of-images-and-a-glimpse-of-danger-at-the-southern-us-border-101617324093643.html

Over the past 13 days, the average daily number of new cases of Covid-19 has increased by about 17%, from 5,5591 on March 19 to 6,4814 on March 31. Total cases stand at 30,562,884, including 552,932 deaths."We're already seeing surges in other parts of the country, likely driven by variants," Santa Clara Health Officer Sara Cody said in a statement. "Combined with the data we are seeing locally, these are important warning signs that we must continue to minimize the spread."The rise in cases comes despite unprecedented efforts to vaccinate people worldwide and across the United States, where nearly 30% of the population had received at least one vaccine dose by Thursday, according to data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).Many U.S. states are moving to ease pandemic public health restrictions, and people who have been vaccinated are starting to venture out from a year of staying mostly at home.But with the vast majority of the population still unvaccinated, experts warn that could be a recipe for a deadly fourth wave of the disease.In California, the most populous U.S. state with 40 million residents, about 5.6 million people, or 17.3% percent of the population, had received one vaccine dose, the CDC said.As cases have leveled off in recent weeks, state officials have reopened activities like restaurant dining and are making plans to send children back to school.However, California Governor Gavin Newsom warned that with at least seven variants of the virus in circulation, the state is not close to achieving so-called herd immunity, which would require the vast majority of people to be inoculated."Now is not the time to spike the ball," said Newsom, who received his own vaccination on Thursday in Los Angeles. "Now is not the time to announce, "mission accomplished."In neighbouring Canada, officials in the province of Ontario declared a limited lockdown beginning on Saturday, while French president Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday ordered his country into its third national lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pandemic-poised-to-surge-again-in-california-s-silicon-valley-tech-hub-101617324058604.html

The sources spoke on condition of anonymity.France's foreign ministry spokeswoman told reporters in a daily briefing that the European powers were working closely with Russia and China - the other remaining parties to the deal - to find a solution to the deadlock and had been talking with both Tehran and Washington."These exchanges are more than necessary because Iran has not accepted to take part in direct contacts between the other participants of the JCPOA and the United States ... which would have eased discussions," spokeswoman Agnes von der Muhll said.Without elaborating, she said that they were now looking at alternative formats to enable talks.U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said the United States welcomed the meeting as "a positive step.""We have been clear for weeks now that we are ready to pursue a return to compliance with our JCPOA commitments consistent with Iran also doing the same," said Price, adding that Washington was willing to achieve that "through a series of initial mutual steps."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-world-powers-to-discuss-us-return-to-nuclear-deal-compliance-today-101617324202932.html

My general feeling is that given the contractual relationships that we have with a number of companies, that we have enough vaccine to fulfill all of our needs without invoking AstraZeneca."Late last year, the drugmaker and Oxford University published data from an earlier trial with two different efficacy readings as a result of a dosing error. Then in March, more than a dozen countries temporarily suspended the use of AstraZeneca's vaccine after reports linked it to a rare blood clotting disorder.Also in March, a U.S. health agency said data from the company gave an incomplete picture of its efficacy. Days later AstraZeneca published results showing diminished, though still strong, efficacy.Fauci said that "If you look at the numbers (of doses) that we're going to be getting, the amount that you can get from J&J, from Novavax from Moderna if we contract for more, it is likely that we can handle any boost that we need, but I can't say definitely for sure."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fauci-says-us-may-not-need-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101617320275376.html
02-04-2021||World||How Floyd's 'spark of life' played out at trial||Prosecutors trying a white former Minneapolis police officer in George Floyd’s death put Floyd's girlfriend on the witness stand Thursday in an effort to humanize him for the jury, but her testimony also gave the defense an opportunity to delve into Floyd's drug use.Prosecutors used a legal doctrine called “spark of life” to call Courteney Ross to testify about Floyd's life, and are expected to call a Floyd family member to the witness stand later. They are trying to portray Floyd's complicated life, from his childhood in Houston’s Third Ward, where he came to be seen as a mentor, to his struggle with drug addiction in Minneapolis.But the “spark of life” doctrine, which is rare outside Minnesota, is controversial among defense attorneys and could complicate the trial. Here's how legal experts see that playing out:WHAT IS THE “SPARK OF LIFE” DOCTRINE?The doctrine emerged in 1985 when a defendant accused of killing a police officer argued to the Minnesota Supreme Court that the prosecutor prejudiced the jury with a speech about the officer’s childhood, his parents and his marriage. The prosecutor became so emotional the trial court had to take a recess.The court ruled that prosecutors can present evidence that a murder victim was “not just bones and sinews covered with flesh, but was imbued with the spark of life. The prosecution has some leeway to show that spark and present the victim as a human being as long as it is not an attempt to invoke any undue sympathy or inflame the jury’s passions.”WHAT DID THE JURY LEARN?Ross told jurors that she and Floyd were both drug addicts stemming from their struggles with chronic pain. She said they “tried really hard to break that addiction many times.”“We’re learning that Floyd is not a perfect person, as none of us are,” said David Schultz, a law professor at the University of Minnesota.After watching the first days of testimony, Schultz said it was clear prosecutors were “pulling at the emotional strings of the jury” to make a case for convicting Derek Chauvin of the most severe charges.Chauvin, 45, is charged with murder and manslaughter. Prosecutors say he knelt on Floyd's neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, pinning the handcuffed man to the ground. The most serious charge — 2nd-degree murder — against the former officer carries up to 40 years in prison.“What the spark of life is bringing in, is painting a picture of perhaps Chauvin was indifferent to the problems to the health and the life and safety of George Floyd,” Schultz said.DID IT BACKFIRE?When Chauvin's defense attorney Eric Nelson cross-examined Ross, he questioned her on Floyd's drug use, driving hard for her to talk about how Floyd was hospitalized in March 2020 and how she had speculated that it was because he had used heroin. Ross drove Floyd to the emergency room because he was suffering from extreme stomach pain, and she later learned he had overdosed.“It was the defense’s best day in terms of testimony,” said F. Clayton Tyler, a prominent local defense attorney. “The fact that he overdosed, I thought that was huge.”Legal experts expect Floyd's cause of death to be key at trial. The defense has argued Floyd’s death was caused by his drug use, underlying health conditions and the adrenaline flowing through his body. An autopsy found fentanyl and methamphetamine in his system.Attorneys for both sides will bring expert witnesses to provide competing testimony about what killed Floyd. Jurors will have to decide.“It’s an excellent tactic for the state to try to get jurors to feel sorry for a person because he’s an addict, but in this case, being an addict means he’s violating the law,” said Joe Friedberg, a defense attorney.Some legal experts have said if prosecutors go too far to invoke undue sympathy, Chauvin's defense could have grounds for an appeal. But Friedberg doubted that would happen, saying Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill would halt testimony if it goes too far.Tyler also reasoned that the defense was bound to highlight Floyd's drug addiction at some point anyway, so by using “spark of life” prosecutors can address it head-on while showing "who he was as an individual.”___Associated Press writer Todd Richmond contributed from Madison, Wisconsin.___Find AP’s full coverage of the death of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/how-floyd-s-spark-of-life-played-out-at-trial-101617320200492.html

Jennifer Amat also revealed that the gunman had chained gates to the complex closed, forcing officers who responded Wednesday to engage him from outside.Police recovered an automatic handgun and a backpack with pepper spray, handcuffs and ammunition.Police withheld the identities of the dead but said one was a 9-year-old boy. The others were a man and two women. The wounded victim was only identified as a woman.The gunman was also wounded and hospitalized. It was unclear whether the suspect suffered a self-inflicted wound or was shot by police.Wednesday's shooting happened in the city of Orange southeast of Los Angeles. When officers arrived, shots were ringing out at the building that includes a mobile home brokerage.The violence was the third U.S. mass shooting in just over two weeks.California Gov. Gavin Newsom in a tweet called the killings “horrifying and heartbreaking.” “Our hearts are with the families impacted by this terrible tragedy tonight,” he said.Amat said the shooting happened on both levels of the building.Signs outside indicated a handful of businesses are located there — including an insurance office, a financial consulting firm, a legal services business and a phone repair store.People gathered outside the building after the shooting hoping to get word about loved ones.Paul Tovar told KTLA-TV that his brother owns a business in the building, Unified Homes, a mobile home broker.“He's not answering his phone, neither's my niece,” Tovar said. “I'm pretty scared and worried ... right now I'm just praying really hard.”Charlie Espinoza also was outside the building and told The Orange County Register that he could not reach his fiancee, who works for a medical billing company.Cody Lev, who lives across the street from the office building, told the newspaper he heard three loud pops that were spaced out, then three more. There was a period of silence and then Lev said he heard numerous shots, followed by sirens and more shots.A Facebook livestream posted by a resident who lives near the office appeared to show officers carrying a motionless person from the building and officers helping another person.Tim Smith's home is separated from the office's parking lot by a backyard wooden fence. He was in the back of his house when he heard a volley of three gunshots, then a volley of three and a final volley of four.“The first words I heard after the shots were fired were Don't move or I will shoot you,'” Smith, 64, recounted Thursday morning.Smith said he heard that repeated twice more by a man's voice and believes it was a police officer speaking. He did not hear other voices or more shots. He later peeked over the fence and saw SWAT officers marching in a line in the building's courtyard.“It saddens me so much,” he said. “A senseless loss of life.”The killings followed a mass shooting at a supermarket in Boulder, Colorado, last week that left 10 dead. A week before that, six Asian women were among eight people killed at three Atlanta-area spas.“Enough is enough," U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, tweeted. ”We have to do something about the guns on our streets."Orange is about 30 miles (48 kilometers) from Los Angeles and home to about 140,000 people. Amat said the shooting was the worst in the city since December 1997, when a gunman armed with an assault rifle attacked a California Department of Transportation maintenance yard.Arturo Reyes Torres, 41, an equipment operator who had been fired six weeks earlier, killed four people and wounded others, including a police officer, before police killed him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gunman-knew-victims-in-california-building-attack-police-101617315605621.html
02-04-2021||World||Biden admin lauds talks on readmitting US to Iran nuke deal||The Biden administration on Thursday welcomed a European Union announcement that the participants in the Iran nuclear deal will meet this week to discuss a possible return of the United States to the 2015 accord.Friday’s virtual meeting of officials from Britain, China, France, Germany, Russia and Iran comes as the US is exploring ways to rejoin the deal that former President Donald Trump withdrew from in 2018. The State Department praised the meeting and said it would be watched closely by US officials.“We obviously welcome this as a positive step and that’s precisely because we have been clear for weeks now that we are ready to pursue a return to compliance with our (nuclear deal) commitments consistent with Iran also doing the same,” spokesman Ned Price said. “It’s a positive step, especially if it moves the ball forward on that mutual return to compliance that we’ve talked about for a number of weeks now.”Earlier Thursday, the EU said one of its top diplomats, Enrique Mora, would chair the meeting. “Participants will discuss the prospect of a possible return of the United States to the (nuclear deal) and how to ensure the full and effective implementation of the agreement by all sides,” it said.President Joe Biden has said the US will to return to the deal if Iran comes back into compliance with it. Thus far, Iran has refused to entertain the offer unless the U.S. rescinds sanctions that Trump imposed on it. Iran already rejected an EU proposal for a meeting that included the United States. That proposal came in response to a Biden administration statement that it would accept an invitation to attend such talks.Meanwhile, the State Department said it had extended a waiver that allows Iraq to continue to buy power from Iran without being subject to U.S. sanctions. penalties. The waiver was renewed for 120 days, an increase in shorter extensions that had become commonplace during the Trump administration.Price said the extension was granted because of progress Iraq is making in developing its own electricity generation to reduce its reliance on outside sources of power. U.S. and Iraqi officials are resuming a strategic dialogue soon that places energy near the top of priorities and Washington hopes “will ultimately allow Iraq to develop its energy self-sufficiency, and we hope to end its reliance on Iran,” Price said.“In the interim, renewal of the sanctions waiver is appropriate, until the agreement and development of the Iraqi energy sector can be fully realized and implemented.," he said. Price added that the U.S. believed the four-month extension was long enough for Iraq “to take meaningful action to promote energy self-sufficiency and to reduce its dependence on expensive Iranian energy.”The Trump administration had only reluctantly approved such extensions because they ran counter to its “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran. Former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had been granting the waivers but reducing their length to push Iraq to wean itself from Iranian electricity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-admin-lauds-talks-on-readmitting-us-to-iran-nuke-deal-101617314527926.html
02-04-2021||World||At first cabinet meeting, Biden says team 'looks like America'||President Joe Biden's first Cabinet meeting looked and felt different from those of his predecessor.Biden's full Cabinet met Thursday in the spacious White House East Room, not the comparatively cramped West Wing room that bears the group's name, to allow for social distancing during the coronavirus pandemic.Many smaller tables were pushed together to create one gigantic square. Department secretaries and other participants wore face masks. And the portion of the meeting opened to press coverage lacked the over-the-top, hail-to-the chief tributes that came to define Donald Trump's Cabinet meetings.Biden immediately pointed out the diversity of his Cabinet, which includes the first Black defense secretary in Lloyd Austin, the first openly gay Cabinet member in Pete Buttigieg at transportation, the first Native American secretary in Deb Halaand at Interior and the first female treasury secretary in Janet Yellen, among others.Vice President Kamala Harris is the first woman, Black person and Indian American elected to her office.Biden declared the group “looks like America" and added, "That's what we promised we were going to do, and we've done it.”Trump's Cabinet was largely white and male.Thursday's meeting came a week after the Senate confirmed the final Cabinet member and a day after Biden released his infrastructure plan, which was a major item on the agenda.The White House allowed press to witness just the opening three minutes, where Biden announced that he had asked five Cabinet secretaries “to take special responsibility to explain the plan to the American public.” He directed Transportation's Buttigieg, Energy's Jennifer Granholm, Housing and Urban Development's Marcia Fudge, Labor's Marty Walsh and Commerce's Gina Raimondo to be especially visible to the public and lead outreach on Capitol Hill.Biden also directed the entire Cabinet to examine agency spending to ensure it follows his “Buy American” commitment.With the sales blitz for the infrastructure plan just beginning, the focus of the meeting was on how the package can be relevant across government, as well on continuing to emphasize benefits Biden expects from the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill he signed into law this month, said White House deputy press secretary Andrew Bates.Cabinet meetings in the modern era are less about setting administration policy than ensuring that all the government agencies are on the same page, say former officials. The sessions also offer presidents an opportunity to make their priorities and values clear. Deeper debates are generally reserved for smaller, subject-specific gatherings of Cabinet officials and senior advisers, such as the National Security Council and the Domestic Policy Council.“As the federal government has become increasingly complex over the years, the role of the Cabinet has evolved as well," said Chris Lu, President Barack Obama’s first-term Cabinet secretary. “In addition to serious policy discussions, Cabinet meetings are an opportunity for the president to lay out broad directions for how his team should operate."“The meetings can help align priorities, build morale, and allow Cabinet members to develop relationships with colleagues who they don’t normally see,” Lu said.All 16 permanent members of the Cabinet — the vice president and heads of the executive departments, including Yellen, Austin and Secretary of State Antony Blinken — attended in person on Thursday. So did other Cabinet-rank officials, including White House chief of staff Ron Klain and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines.Shalanda Young, acting budget chief, participated after Neera Tanden, Biden’s first choice for that job, withdrew her nomination amid Senate opposition. Biden is also awaiting the confirmation of Eric Lander to lead the Office of Science and Technology Policy, a post the president has elevated to Cabinet rank.In all, 25 people were there, the White House said.In normal times, scheduling an in-person Cabinet meeting would require weeks of planning to block off time in the travel schedules of the various principals. These days, most remain in Washington due to the pandemic.Trump’s Cabinet meetings became known for their high level of presidential adoration, with “Dear Leader”-esque praise coming from attendees. His first full Cabinet meeting, held in June 2017, began with Vice President Mike Pence declaring that it was “the greatest privilege of my life to serve as the vice president to the president who is keeping his word to the American people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-first-cabinet-meeting-biden-says-team-looks-like-america-101617314288344.html

In the US alone, the efficacy rate was 92.6%, according to a report on Thursday by the two companies.At the same time, the companies provided some of the first data on how their vaccine might handle the immune-evading B.1.351 variant that arose in South Africa.Pfizer also said the vaccine was highly effective against the South African variant in the latest phase of ongoing clinical trials. No cases of the disease were observed in South Africa during the phase-three trial study among participants who had received their second dose, it said in a joint statement with BioNTech.French President Emmanuel Macron, meanwhile, has announced a nationwide four-week lockdown starting on Saturday, closing schools and business, in the latest sign that Europe is yet again losing control of the pandemic.The World Health Organization lambasted Europe’s “unacceptably slow” vaccine roll-out, adding that the continent’s surge in cases was “worrying”.In Germany, President Frank-Walter Steinmeier received the first dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine, two days after authorities recommended use of the jab only for people aged 60 and over.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-vaccine-91-effective-after-6-months-new-findings-101617312171581.html

It was not.Indian professionals account for more than 70% of the 85,000 H-1B visas granted by the US every year, against petitions filed by American employers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trumpera-ban-on-h-1b-visas-expires-101617301919835.html
02-04-2021||World||Indian workers get less wage premium in US than English-speaking immigrants: Study||American companies hire foreign students due to skills shortage and not because they are a source of cheap labour, according to a new working paper by the Center for Growth and Opportunity, a university-based academic research centre in Utah. The previous administration had introduced a series of changes in visa policy, including a temporary ban on employment-based nonimmigrant visas, intended to prevent US employers from hiring low-cost foreign workers and push the so-called protectionist policy.During the last days of the Trump administration, the then secretary of labour Eugene Scalia had said that the administration was taking those steps to strengthen “wage protections, address abuses in visa programs, and protect American workers from being undercut by cheaper foreign labour.”US President Joe Biden on Thursday let the ban on foreign workers visa, including H-1B, lapse amid ongoing policy debates over the use of work visas by American companies to hire foreign professionals. H-1B visa, B-1 and B-2 visas, and F-1 visa are some prominent non-immigrant visas. H1-B visa allows US employers to temporarily hire foreign workers in speciality occupations that require theoretical or technical expertise. Indian IT professionals looking for onshore opportunities heavily depend on H-1B.Omid Bagheri, assistant professor of Economics at the Kent State University at Salem (Oregon) and author of the study, examined the wage gap between college graduate immigrants working in the US on a work visa and their native counterparts. Bagheri suggested that the demand for skilled workers exceeds the supply of skilled workers in the United States and companies pay “significant premiums to hire foreign workers.”The study estimated that on average, skilled immigrants with temporary work visas have a wage premium of 29.5% compared to similar natives. However, the wage premium, according to the study, is less for individuals originally from countries like India and Iran and more for English-speaking immigrants. The findings also showed a significant decline in the wage premium from 2010 to 2017."The immigrants’ wage premium that we found in this study might suggest that the demand for these workers outweighs the supply," the author noted.According to the report, easing immigration rules for foreign workers may be very helpful to the US economy and even prevent companies from moving jobs overseas. It further suggested that the US needs to encourage native-born workers to pursue training and education that meets the needs of its labour market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indians-get-less-wage-premium-in-us-than-english-speaking-immigrants-study-101617300958173.html
