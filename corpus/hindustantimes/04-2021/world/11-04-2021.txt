Pence, a potential 2024 presidential candidate, didn’t attend the event, and neither did McConnell, but some U.S. senators were in the room.Top Republicans, including Representative Liz Cheney and Senator John Thune, criticized the remarks in Sunday talk-show appearances as being unhelpful to the party’s efforts to rebuild after 2020.Trump’s prepared remarks for Saturday had been cast as a call for building on certain gains the party made under him as the path to recovery, even though the GOP lost control of the House, the Senate and the White House during his presidency.“We are gathered tonight to talk about the future of the Republican Party -- and what we must do to set our candidates on a course to victory,” Trump planned to say at Mar-a-Lago, where he’s lived since leaving the White House.“I stand before you this evening filled with confidence that in 2022, we are going to take back the House and we are going to reclaim the Senate -- and then in 2024, a Republican candidate is going to win the White House.”A person familiar with Trump’s thinking said the former president wasn’t explicitly acknowledging he may or may not run again, but rather is keeping everyone guessing, including the various Republicans considering their own 2024 campaigns.And a person who attended the event said the former president teased a potential run while speaking largely off-script for about an hour.‘Power Center’Republicans converged on Florida this weekend for various events aimed at charting the party’s course back to power. Attendees at the RNC spring donor retreat in Palm Beach made a side trip to Trump’s club, reflecting the former president’s dominant position.While Trump has talked about helping the party retake control of Congress in the 2022 midterms and the White House in 2024, he remains focused on his election loss and lashing out at McConnell, the Republicans who voted to impeach him, and others he considers disloyal or doesn’t like, such as Anthony Fauci, the head of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.Some GOP donors and leaders want the party to move on from the twice-impeached Trump. They’re concerned his prodigious ability to fundraise could crowd out hard-to-win campaign cash, and that he might use it to fuel battles within the party that could hamper its efforts to regain control of Congress in 2022.“Anything that’s divisive is a concern and is not helpful for us fighting the battles in Washington and at the state level,” Arkansas GOP Governor Asa Hutchinson said in an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”No Stolen ElectionCheney of Wyoming, the No. 3 House Republican and a target of Trump and his allies after voting to impeach him, said the GOP needs to be focused on the future and “embracing the Constitution, not embracing insurrection” that Trump provoked on Jan. 6.“The election wasn’t stolen,” Cheney said on “Face the Nation” on CBS. “If you attack the judicial process and you attack the rule of law, you aren’t defending the Constitution. You’re at war with the Constitution. And for us as a party going forward, we have to embrace the Constitution.”Thune, the chamber’s No. 2 Republican, whom Trump threatened to oppose with a primary challenger after the South Dakotan wouldn’t support overturning the election, dismissed his comments as “part of the style and tone that comes with the former president.”But Thune also suggested on “Fox News Sunday” that Trump’s comments will divide the party, and that his efforts to oppose Republicans who crossed him by backing primary challenges to them could hurt the party in general election races it needs to win.“Republicans are much better off when we’re united and working to defeat Democrats,” Thune said. Making sure Republicans have candidates “electable in a general election” is what should unite Trump, McConnell and others, he said.Trump, 74, is endorsing candidates he considers loyal to him and his agenda or are challenging Republicans that crossed him, including those that supported his impeachment. He relaunched an online store this week to sell merchandise, and Trump adviser Jason Miller has said the former president’s Save America political action committee has more than $80 million on hand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-criticises-mitch-mcconnell-other-republicans-over-election-loss-101618161294776.html

So the increase for this age group is very significant," said Dr. Ederlon Rezende, co-coordinator of the project, an initiative of the Brazilian Association of Intensive Medicine (AMIB).He said various factors could be driving the increase.Patients over 80, who fell from 13.6 percent to 7.8 percent of the total in Brazil's ICUs in March, are now largely vaccinated.Young people are also more likely to expose themselves to the virus, whether because they have to leave home to work or believe they are less vulnerable, he said.Another factor may be the new Brazilian variant, known as P1, which experts say is partly responsible for the country's Covid-19 death toll exploding in March.The numbers suggest that P1, which can re-infect people who have had the original strain of the virus, may also be more virulent, Rezende said."The patients arriving in ICUs now are younger, have no pre-existing conditions and are developing more severe cases of the virus, too," he told AFP.The number of ICU patients without pre-existing conditions increased by nearly a third in March, to 30.3 percent of the total.And the proportion of patients put on ventilators reached a pandemic record of 58.1 percent in March, according to the project's data.Brazil registered more than 66,500 Covid-19 deaths in March, more than double the hard-hit country's previous monthly record in July 2020.The disease has claimed a total of 351,000 lives in the country of 212 million people, a death toll second only to that of the United States.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-icus-have-more-young-patients-than-old-101618160093228.html

He was detained in July.Zaki, who was the target of a flurry of accusations on an Instagram account, showed no reaction as the sentence was read out at the criminal court in Cairo, the sources said.He is not known to have addressed the accusations publicly and Reuters was not able to locate a lawyer representing him.Zaki can appeal against the ruling before the court of cassation, Egypt's top civilian court, the sources said.The case attracted widespread attention from media, religious figures and women's groups in a country where rights defenders say sexual harassment or abuse often goes unpunished.Zaki was sentenced to three years in jail by another court in December for harassing two girls online. He has appealed against the ruling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egyptian-court-jails-student-in-case-that-led-to-sex-crimes-debate-101618159128150.html

Merkel, 66, won’t run for another term and her departure after 16 years in office has opened the field for who will lead Europe’s biggest economy.Merkel hasn’t taken sides in the race even though Laschet comes, like Merkel, from the CDU. While Merkel and Soeder clashed during Germany’s 2015-16 refugee crisis, the leader of Bavaria’s regional Christian Social Union party has backed her push for restrictions during the Covid-19 pandemic. Laschet, meanwhile, was criticized by Merkel for a lax response in his home state of North Rhine-Westphalia.“We determined that both of us are suitable and both of us are ready, Soeder told reporters after the meeting. “Whatever the decision turns out to be, we will work very well personally together.”The CDU and the CSU traditionally field a joint candidate for chancellor, but Soeder’s entry into the race signals a gloves-off contest between two sister parties whose alliance has helped ensure Germany’s political stability since the end of World War II. His announcement throws the ball into the court of the CDU, where some members are known to favor him over Laschet.On Sunday, both candidates made signaled support for quick approval of Merkel’s planned changes of Germany’s infectious-diseases law, which would shift some powers to the federal government from the states. Other state leaders have demanded changes to the draft law circulated on Saturday.The next steps in the candidacy face-off could come when the CDU and CSU leaderships meet separately on Monday.Popularity ContestPolls suggest that Soeder, who’s the state premier of Bavaria, is far more popular than Laschet. However, both candidates from socially conservative Bavaria who ran for chancellor in the past were defeated.Laschet said “we have a very special responsibility” to keep Germany stable.“Our goal at this time, with a chancellor who is leaving office, is to foster as much unity between the CDU and CSU as possible,” Laschet said. “There’s a lot at stake. Europe is watching how Germany develops.”Soeder said he’s ready to run if the CDU, the bigger of the two parties, backs him, but that he would hold no grudges if they decided otherwise.Laschet, the state premier of North Rhine-Westphalia, described Soeder as a potential candidate and said the matter would be solved with mutual respect.While Germany’s chancellor is chosen by the lower house of parliament after elections, Soeder would take a winning 39% in a direct matchup with Green party leader Annalena Baerbock and Social Democratic candidate Olaf Scholz, Germany’s finance minister, according to a Forsa poll. By contrast, Laschet’s support is 16%, finishing behind the other two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-s-cdu-splits-as-race-to-succeed-her-as-chancellor-intensifies-101618157034741.html

While Muslim majority countries like Egypt, Iran and Morocco rely on local moon sighters to spot the new crescent, others wait for Saudi Arabia, home to Islam’s holiest sites, to make the call.Saudi Arabia’s supreme court on Thursday called on all Muslims throughout the kingdom to spot the crescent on Sunday evening. The court also announced a second sighting for Monday evening due to “inconsistencies in the Umm al-Qurra calendar" for the Islamic month of Sha'ban. It further asked moon sighters to report to the nearest court and register testimony after spotting the crescent with naked eyes or through binoculars.According to the moon visibility charts of the Crescent Moon Watch, it will not be visible in the United Kingdom until Tuesday. Iqbal Sacranie, the founding secretary-general of the Muslim Council of Britain (MCB), told Middle East Eye that Muslims in Britain do not rely on local moon sightings because the weather in the UK makes it impossible to spot the crescent.This year, however, they started counting the month of Sha’ban a day later than Saudi Arabia. The UK has a body of Ulema that takes a call on the start of Ramadan. Wifaq ul Ulama UK has urged Muslims in Britain to attempt to sight the moon on the evening of Monday, April 12.“Wifaqul Ulama urges Muslims in Britain to attempt to sight the Moon for Ramadhan 1442 on the evening of Monday the 12th of April 2021. This will be the 29th of Shaʿbān 1442”, the body said.Ramadan 2021: Moon sighting in Saudi Arabia, Qatar | All you need to knowWifaq ul Ulama UK also said that the new moon conjunction time is at 02:30am UTC on April 12. The body said it could be possible to sight the moon in North America with the naked eye on Monday evening if the atmospheric conditions are perfect.If the moon sighters spot the crescent on Sunday evening, the 29th day of Sha’ban, Ramadan will start from the next day i.e. Monday. Otherwise, Monday will be declared as the 30th day of Sha’ban and Ramadan will start from the subsequent day i.e. Tuesday, April 13, 2021.Ramadan is considered one of the five pillars of Islam during which Muslims are required to offer charity and abstain from certain activities like eating, drinking and smoking from dawn to dusk. The month of Ramadan traditionally begins with a crescent sighting which marks the start of the ninth month of the lunar calendar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/ramadan-2021-us-uk-muslims-await-moon-sighting-confirmation-101618153614214.html
11-04-2021||World||Biden hails settlement of dispute between South Korean electric battery makers||Two big South Korean electric vehicle battery makers said Sunday they have settled a long-running trade dispute that will allow one company to move ahead with plans to manufacture batteries in Georgia. President Joe Biden called it “a win for American workers and the American auto industry.”The agreement between LG Energy Solution and SK Innovation ended the need for Biden to intervene in a case closely watched for its implications on Biden's clean-energy agenda, which includes a sharp increase the number of electric vehicles as part of his plan to address climate change. Biden had until Sunday night to make a decision, following a ruling in February by a trade commission.The companies said in a joint statement that SK will provide LG Energy with a total of USD 1.8 billion and an undisclosed royalty. They agreed to withdraw all pending trade disputes in the United States and South Korea and not assert new claims for 10 years.“We have decided to settle and to compete in an amicable way, all for the future of the US and South Korean electric vehicle battery industries,” said Jun Kim, CEO and president of SK, and Jong Hyun Kim, CEO and president of LG Energy.The companies pledged to work together to strengthen the EV battery supply chain in the US and support the Biden administration's efforts to advance clean energy policies, including electric vehicles.The US International Trade Commission had decided in February that SK stole 22 trade secrets from LG Energy, and that SK should be barred from importing, making or selling batteries in the United States for 10 years.The decision could have left Ford and Volkswagen scrambling for batteries as they both roll out additional electric vehicle models, a priority for the companies and for the Biden administration. SK has contracts to make batteries for an electric Ford F-150 pickup truck and an electric Volkswagen SUV.The commission said SK could supply batteries to Ford Motor Co. for four years and to Volkswagen AG for two years. The decision had jeopardized a USD 2.6 billion battery factory that SK is building in Commerce, Georgia.Democratic Sen. Jon Ossoff of Georgia, who at Biden's request had jump-started negotiations between two companies, said the settlement “has saved the battery plant in Commerce, Georgia, ensuring thousands of jobs, billions in future investment, and that Georgia will be a leader in electric vehicle battery production for years to come.''US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said the deal “builds confidence" in the reliability and responsibility of the two companies as suppliers to the U.S. auto industry. The agreement puts US.“in a stronger position to drive innovation and ... clean energy technology while also respecting the rights of technology innovators at the heart of trade and manufacturing policy,'' Tai said.Added Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga.: “The best way to protect workers in Commerce — and the jobs Georgians were promised — is for the companies involved to negotiate a settlement in good faith,." He said he raised the battery issue with Biden during the president's March 19 visit to Atlanta.Biden said in a statement that building electric vehicles and the batteries needed for them is an important part of his USD 2.3 trillion infrastructure plan.“We need a strong, diversified and resilient US-based electric vehicle battery supply chain, so we can supply the growing global demand for these vehicles and components — creating good-paying jobs here at home, and laying the groundwork for the jobs of tomorrow. Today's settlement is a positive step in that direction,” Biden said.Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Ga., called the settlement “fantastic news for northeast Georgia and our state's growing electric vehicle industry.''Ford, in a statement, said the deal “allows us to focus on delivering a range of Ford world-class battery electric vehicles for our retail and fleet customers, while also supporting American workers, the economy and our shared goal of protecting the planet.''

While the volcano lies on the island's northern end, in the capital Kingstown on the south end the ash caused a thin haze of dust, the portal said.The thick clouds of dust expelled by La Soufriere have affected neighboring islands as well, traveling over 110 miles (175 kilometers) east to Barbados."Barbadians have been urged to stay indoors as thick plumes of volcanic ash move through the atmosphere," the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency said.The initial blast from La Soufriere, the highest peak in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, sent plumes of hot ash and smoke 20,000 feet (6,000 meters) into the air Friday morning.Smaller eruptions took place Friday afternoon and Saturday, belching out further columns of ash, according to the UWI researchers.Vincentian Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said Saturday that water has been cut off in most areas and the country's air space is closed because of the ash. Around 3,000 people spent the night in shelters."It's a huge operation that is facing us," Gonsalves told NBC News.He said his government has been in contact with other countries that want to provide aid and that Guyana and Venezuela are sending ships with supplies.- Evacuation orders -The 4,052-foot La Soufriere -- French for "sulphur mine" -- had not erupted since 1979, and its largest blow-up happened over a century ago in 1902, killing more than 1,000 people.It had been rumbling for months before it finally blew."We are trying to be ok. It's deathly quiet outside and the mood is pensive," said Vynette Frederick, 44, a lawyer in Kingstown.Northwest of Kingstown on the 18-mile-long island, Zen Punnett said things had calmed down after the initial panic as evacuation orders came out Thursday night."It's gotten hazier. We are staying inside," she said.The emergency management agency posted photos of a Coast Guard ship evacuating residents of an area who had previously refused to leave. Standing on a dock, the air above the evacuees was a chalky gray.Most of the people in the red zone had been moved to safety by Friday, authorities said.Cruise ships were on the way to assist the evacuation effort.The Saint Vincent and Grenadines police on Saturday issued an appeal for troublemakers to stop making prank calls to emergency responders."We are in the middle of a serious evacuation and security exercise, to safeguard and rescue persons who are affected by the eruption," the agency said."These irresponsible calls divert much-needed resources and personnel from the evacuation exercise."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/power-and-water-outages-strike-saint-vincent-after-volcanic-eruption-101618148283180.html

Security Council, for example to impose an arms embargo," EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said in a blog post."Geopolitical competition in Myanmar will make it very difficult to find common ground," said Borrell, who speaks on behalf of the 27 EU member states. "But we have a duty to try."Borrell said security forces have killed more than 550 unarmed protesters, including 46 children, in a bloody crackdown since the military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in a Feb. 1 coup."The world watches in horror, as the army uses violence against its own people," he said.China and Russia both have ties to Myanmar's armed forces, as the first and second largest suppliers of weapons to the country, respectively.The U.N. Security Council last week called for the release of Suu Kyi and others detained by the military but stopped short of condemning the coup.The EU is preparing fresh sanctions on individuals and companies owned by the Myanmar military. The bloc in March agreed a first set of sanctions on 11 individuals linked to the coup, including the commander-in-chief of the military.While EU economic leverage in the country is relatively small, Borrell said the EU could offer to increase its economic ties with Myanmar if democracy is restored. That could include more trade and investments in sustainable development, he said.EU foreign direct investment in Myanmar totalled $700 million in 2019, compared with $19 billion from China.The military says it staged the coup because a November election won by Suu Kyi’s party was rigged. The election commission has dismissed the assertion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-russia-undermine-international-myanmar-response-eu-s-top-diplomat-says-101618142859423.html

But Hamza's absence after he appeared in a video on April 3 saying he had been ordered to stay at home had led to speculation about his whereabouts.In announcing last week that the military had warned Hamza over his actions, the government said that Hamza had liaised with people linked to foreign parties seeking to destabilise Jordan and that he had been under investigation for some time.Hamza had been widely expected to have succeeded Abdullah as Jordan’s next king, until the monarch made Prince Hussein his heir instead in 2004, in line with family tradition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jordans-king-abdullah-prince-hamza-make-first-joint-appearance-since-rift-101618142452056.html

Now demands of charter flights||Britain’s updated travel ban list, also known as the “red list”, came into effect on Friday, after which airports in Pakistan witnessed chaos as thousands of travellers raced home to the UK to avoid mandatory hotel quarantine. British residents who missed Friday’s 4am deadline will have to quarantine in a government-approved hotel for 11 nights for £1,750.The travel ban was announced after the UK government repeatedly warned residents against travelling abroad for leisure amid concerns over coronavirus variants. According to a UK media report, many individuals of British Pakistani nationality were found travelling to Pakistan for attending weddings.BBC’s North West Tonight recently aired a video of an unnamed woman from Manchester, reportedly posted on her social media account, who was seen attending a wedding in Lahore. In the video, the woman said that everyone was stressed out by coronavirus disease (Covid-19) back home so she decided to travel to Pakistan.“Corona[virus] has made everyone in the UK mad... But everyone is enjoying themselves here (Pakistan). So I thought I'll get away from all of that by coming here to enjoy myself too,” said the woman, according to the BBC translator.UK media reports that Pakistan was placed on red list due to people travelling to Lahore for weddings pic.twitter.com/pHYhTymGWNAlso Read | UK added Pakistan to ‘red list’ after people kept travelling for weddings amid Covid-19 surgeAccording to the report, around 32,000 travellers flew from the UK to Pakistan in January alone.

The airline’s top executive, Akbar Al Baker, is a representative for the state of Qatar on Heathrow’s board of directors.Heathrow’s demands to change a complex regulatory framework so it could recoup losses caused by the pandemic have been rejected by the Civil Aviation Authority, the newspaper said. A spokesman for Heathrow said the regulatory adjustment is needed to lower prices for consumers, according to the Telegraph.U.K. Sets Plan for Travel Return With Costly Test RequirementsWhile all airlines and airports have taken a battering in the coronavirus crisis, Heathrow has been hit particularly hard since it relies on long-haul markets that have all but been wiped out. Passenger volumes have fallen to the lowest level since 1966 due to the ban on non-essential travel and quarantine rules. The airport posted a 2-billion-pound pretax loss for 2020.Airports including Heathrow, as well as operators of air traffic control systems, have indicated they are seeking to recover lost revenue with “monopolistic behaviors,” according to Willie Walsh, the director general of the International Air Transport Association and the former CEO of IAG SA.IATA will lobby regulators to step in and prevent fee hikes that airlines can’t afford after a year in crisis, he said earlier this month.Qatar Airways owns a 25% stake in IAG, whose British Airways is the largest operator at Heathrow.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/heathrow-airport-plan-to-raise-3-8-billion-challenged-report-101618138846618.html

11-04-2021||World||UK churches celebrate the 'great life' of Prince Philip||The life of Prince Philip was celebrated at church services across Britain on Sunday, with the Archbishop of Canterbury praying for those who found that the death of Queen Elizabeth's husband had left a "very great gap" in their lives.Marking the third of eight days of national morning, people gathered at royal palaces to leave flowers, while religious and political leaders expressed support for the 94-year-old queen, the world's oldest and longest-reigning monarch.At Canterbury Cathedral, Edward Elgar's stirring Nimrod was played, the piece of music that accompanies many British funerals and memorial services and is played annually at the Cenotaph in London to mark the National Service of Remembrance."We may pray and offer love for all who find that a great life leaves a very great gap," Justin Welby, the leader of the global Anglican Communion, told the congregation at Canterbury Cathedral as he remarked on the prince's inquiring mind.Philip, who was officially known as the Duke of Edinburgh, died at Windsor Castle on Friday. He was 99.Buckingham Palace said on Saturday the funeral would be held on Saturday April 17, with long-established plans redrawn and scaled down because of Covid-19 restrictions.The prince will be given a ceremonial royal funeral rather than a state funeral. There will be no public processions, and it will be held entirely within the grounds of Windsor Castle and limited to 30 mourners.A 'LITTLE SPACE' FOR THE QUEENJohn Major, who was British prime minister from 1990 to 1997, said he hoped the queen would be given the time she needs to grieve after she lost her husband and companion of 73 years."I do hope she's given a little space, and a little time, and a little freedom to grieve in the way anybody else would wish to do so after having lost their spouse," he told the BBC's Andrew Marr."He was the person who was there," he said of Philip. "He was the person to whom she could unburden herself."The royal family was plunged into its greatest crisis in decades last month when Prince Harry, the Duke of Sussex and the couple's grandson, gave an explosive interview to Oprah Winfrey alongside his wife Meghan in the United States.During the interview, Meghan said her pleas for help while she felt suicidal were ignored and that one unnamed member of the family had asked how dark their unborn child's skin might be.Buckingham Palace said Harry will return from the United States where the couple now live to attend the funeral while Meghan, who is pregnant with their second child, will not, on her doctor's advice.The leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, Cardinal Vincent Nichols, said he hoped the private nature of the funeral would allow the family to come together and rebuild ties."Many a family gather and get over tension and broken relationships at the time of a funeral," he told Times Radio. "Something very profound unites them all again. And that would be true of this family, I'm sure."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-churches-celebrate-the-great-life-of-prince-philip-101618138722831.html

From menial tasks, to big data crunching, technology is helping people in every way. But sometimes, too much reliance on technology can prove to be costly as well as embarrassing.A groom-to-be in Indonesia suffered embarrassment when Google Maps, one of the most popular apps used by thousands of commuters across the globe, landed at the wrong house and almost married the wrong woman.The unique goof-up happened on Sunday, local media reported. Coincidently, the location which the groom's family went to was in the same village where they were supposed to get married, according to Tribunnews.The bride, Ulfa, also didn't realise that the wrong man had entered her house as she was busy getting ready for the event, according to local media reports. Her family welcomed the wrong groom and not just that, they also exchanged gifts at the event.But this was an engagement function and the groom's family soon realised their mistake. They apologised to the girl's family who directed the boy and the procession to the correct address. To add to the confusion, Ulfa's would-be groom was also late as his family members stopped along the way looking for a toilet.Google Maps is one of the best navigational platforms available online, but issues keep cropping up in every few months. Last year, a man in a village in Tamil Nadu filed a complaint at the local police station for showing places that he has never been to in its timeline.The timeline feature is based on points of interest and the accuracy of the feature is according to the nearest places visited. This means that the feature may not always depict the exact location that a user might have visited.The issue led to marital troubles as the wife of 49-year-old R Chandrasekhar started questioning him regularly about his whereabouts. This in turn led to emotional troubles and familial problems.Chandrasekhar said that his wife believes Google over anything else. So he filed the complaint seeking justice. The police later called the couple for counselling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-indonesia-man-following-google-maps-almost-marries-wrong-woman-101618135123310.html
11-04-2021||World||China's crackdown on its powerful companies intensifies: Report||China's competition watchdog is adding staff and other resources as it ramps up efforts to crack down on anti-competitive behaviour, especially among the country's powerful companies, people with knowledge of the matter told Reuters.Beijing's plan to bulk up the State Administration for Market Regulation (SAMR) comes as China revamps its competition law with proposed amendments including a sharp increase in fines and expanded criteria for judging a company's control of a market.On Saturday, the watchdog slapped a record $2.75 billion fine on Alibaba after an antimonopoly probe found the e-commerce giant had abused its dominant market position for several years.The fine underscores the challenges ahead for companies, including global firms with operations in China, mainly in a tech sector that thrived during years of relatively laissez-faire market regulation.It also mirrors the increasing activism of US and European antitrust authorities in recent years.The Beijing-headquartered agency plans to expand its antitrust workforce by around 20 to 30 staff, up from about 40 now, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said.The watchdog also plans to delegate case reviewing power to its local bureaux and source additional manpower from other government bodies and agencies to handle cases that require extensive investigation, four other people said.Budgets allocated for antimonopoly investigations, daily operations and research projects will also be increased, said three of the people cited above and one more person with knowledge of the matter.The people declined to be named as they were not authorised to speak to the media.The SAMR did not immediately respond to Reuters request for comment."An increase in staffing as well as in the quality of the bureau's law enforcement capabilities is a must for an antitrust push," said Liu Xu, a researcher at the National Strategy Institute of Tsinghua University."Otherwise regulators won't be able to handle multiple cases at one time, and the public will question how transparent the investigation process would be," said Liu, a long-time advocate for antitrust enforcement.Growing ScrutinyThe SAMR's antitrust bureau was established in early 2018 after two other government departments were merged into it to form a single authority to police monopoli­stic activities.The bureau has also been armed with new and more stringent laws in the past few months.SAMR's enhanced powers come as Chinese President Xi Jinping weighed in last month on the need to "strengthen antitrust powers" to rein in behemoths that play a dominant role in the country's consumer sector."They didn't feel they had the mandate to do it but now they do. And they are happy about that," said a legal source close to SAMR, referring to the need to regulate the internet companies, which, he said, were seen as "a bit above the law."With growing scrutiny, executives of major internet firms are now required to make routine reports to the antitrust bureau for merger deals or of practices that could fall foul of antimonopoly rules, one of the sources said.Reeling from the workload, the SAMR has started to expand its presence in more cities such as Hangzhou and Shenzhen on a trial basis, instead of handling the cases all in Beijing, to delegate case reviewing power to local bureaux, two of the sources said. It has also started outsourcing more research work, covering areas including economic and industry analysis, to scholars and its own consultancy committee to speed up cases in progress, one of the sources said.For now, however, the investor focus is on who among the home-grown technology champions will be the next target of the Chinese antitrust watchdog."Other tech companies would be wise to assume they may be receiving the same level of scrutiny and penalty," said Fred Hu, chairman of private equity firm Primavera Group, referring to the fine imposed on Alibaba."The heavy fine on one of the country's dominant tech leaders also sends a strong message to the broader tech sector that the Chinese regulators, like their European counterparts, are serious about cracking down on Big Tech."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-crackdown-on-its-powerful-companies-intensifies-report-101618136257272.html

See if you can stoop to bind the wounds of others," he said."Let us not remain indifferent. Let us not live a one-way faith, a faith that receives but does not give... Having received mercy, let us now become merciful," Francis added.The pope, who is 84 and was vaccinated for the coronavirus ahead of his trip to Iraq in early March, did not wear a face mask during the service.Those who did readings from the bible were also unmasked, while everybody else in the church, including altar boys and other priests, had their masks on.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pope-celebrates-mass-of-mercy-with-prisoners-refugees-101618134808829.html
11-04-2021||World||Djibouti autonomy at risk due to China's investment strategy: Report||The relationship between Djibouti and China is a case study on how Beijing is using its global infrastructure investment strategy, the Belt and Road Initiative, to aggrandise its economic influence and strengthen its position as the top investor in Africa.The present scenario, however, illustrates the limitations of China's vast investment and loans project as it is drying up, reported France24.In accepting vast inflows of Chinese capital and loans, Djibouti now finds itself in a situation of such economic dependence that it "risks threatening its autonomy", Sonia Le Gouriellec, a Horn of Africa specialist at the Catholic University of Lille, wrote in the Revue de Defense Nationale (National Defence Review).Djibouti, a small African country located in the Horn of Africa, devoid of natural resources, has opened itself to international powers in order to profit from its strategic location at the entrance to the Red Sea.Much of the international discourse about the country focuses on China bringing it into its economic orbit through the Belt and Road Initiative.China might not have played a major role in Djibouti for as long as President Ismail Omar Guelleh, who is running for a fifth term, has held office, but it is expected to maintain its economic grip on the east African state after the election.Beijing already had its sights set on Djibouti in the early 2000s - investing in the construction of schools and stadiums and renovating roads and official buildings, including the foreign ministry.Chinese investment intensified after President Xi Jinping took power in 2012 and inaugurated the Belt and Road Initiative the following year.The three flagship achievements under Xi are the large multipurpose Doraleh port, the railway line between Djibouti and Ethiopia and the gas pipeline between the two countries. Djibouti also hosts the Chinese-built International Free Trade Zone, where businesses can operate without paying income tax, property tax, dividend taxes or VAT. In total, China has spent USD 14 billion (Euro 11.8 billion) on investments and loans for Djibouti between 2012 and 2020, reported France24.The reason Beijing has invested so much in Djibouti is because it "gives China an African component in its large network of so-called 'maritime Silk Roads', in one of the region's few politically stable countries", said a British expert on the Horn of Africa who asked to remain anonymous.Djibouti saw obvious benefits in the influx of Chinese investment and loans. The country had a clear need for funding and "there was no one else to turn to", said Thierry Pairault, an expert on Sino-African relations at Paris's CNRS think tank.But the Sino-Djiboutian relationship has "cooled over recent years; it's like a slowly unravelling marriage", said Gerard Prunier, a historian at the Institut des Mondes Africains (Institute of African Worlds).Debt is a major issue. China holds more than 70 percent of Djibouti's debt, which some observers say threatens the African country's sovereignty. They fear that Djibouti will suffer the same fate as Sri Lanka, which had to cede control of a port to Chinese companies because it could not repay the loans it had signed with China, reported France24.The problem is that the benefits to Djibouti of the Chinese investments and loans are looking doubtful. The port at Doraleh, for example, seems "mainly outward-looking", Pairault said: It has done little for local employment; it is mainly Chinese companies that have profited from it.It looks unlikely that this cooling of the relationship will prompt China to completely disengage from Djibouti. "It remains an important part of the Belt and Road Initiative," said an anonymous British expert.The opening of China's military base in Djibouti in 2017 - the People's Liberation Army's only permanent base outside of China - provides a clear sign of the strong ties between the two countries.It could lead to closer ties between Djibouti and other international players such as France. "No other country could do what China is doing in terms of lending money, but it is plausible that Djibouti will deepen its ties to other countries," Pairault said.

You are in danger and need to act immediately," the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) said in a bulletin.The cyclone, which was upgraded in severity to category 3 on Sunday, was rapidly moving south east but was likely to weaken to category 2 in severity prior to making landfall later in the evening, the Bureau of Meteorology said. Wind gusts of 150 kilometres an hour were expected."Yes I'm worried for the town. There's heritage buildings here in Geraldton and I'm not sure how well they will survive," said Tash Gibson, manager of the Ocean Centre Hotel.Officials were braced for a high degree of damage to towns along the coast, the state emergency services minister said on Saturday, given buildings were not constructed to withstand such strong winds in a region that is typically too far south to fall into the path of cyclones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/evacuation-centres-open-as-cyclone-seroja-intensifies-off-western-australia-101618132772908.html

The Tibetan government-in-exile will elect its head on May 14.In the last phase of the polls to the post of the president of the CTA only two candidates -- Pempa Tsering and Aukatsang Kelsang Dorjee -- are in the fray, Wangdu Tsering said.However, Pempa Tsering, the former chairman of Tibetan parliament, is the front runner.During the first phase of elections, there were eight candidates contesting for the post of Sikyong. Pempa Tsering secured the maximum votes (24,488) followed by Dorjee (14,544).Sikyong is the head of the Kashag or Cabinet, part of the executive branch of the CTA, and the post was created by the Tibetan parliament in 2011 to provide democratic governance to the exiled Tibetan community.Prior to that, Tibetan spiritual leader Dalai Lama used to exercise the powers as temporal head of the Tibetan community in all affairs.Lobsang Sangay, who became the first Sikyong of the CTA, has held the post for two terms, and according to the constitution, he cannot contest for a third term.Pempa Tsering had lost to Sangay in 2016."We are sending a clear message to Beijing that there is no democracy in China and Tibetans don't enjoy freedom but under the great leadership of his holiness the Dalai Lama, we in-exile have been given this gift of democracy and today is a proud day," Sangay told reporters.According to Wangdu Tsering, 83,079 voters are participating in the electoral exercise."We have two kinds of elections -- one is for the presidential election of the CTA and the second is parliamentary. There are two nominees contesting for the post of the president and Tibetans are also voting to choose 45 members of parliament. We will declare the results on May 14," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/around-1-3-lakh-tibetans-living-in-26-countries-cast-votes-for-dharamshala-based-parliamentinexile-101618131623249.html
11-04-2021||World||US defense secretary Lloyd Austin in Israel amid Iran nuclear talks||Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin was in Israel Sunday on the first high-level visit from the new US administration, after talks restarted on reviving the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.Austin's visit comes just days after Washington said it had offered "very serious" ideas on reviving the hobbled agreement that is staunchly opposed by Israel.Austin's first scheduled stop on the two-day trip was a meeting with Israeli Defence Minister Benny Gantz.Israel under hawkish Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has been a fierce critic of the Iran nuclear deal, dating back to when it was being negotiated during Barack Obama's administration.Netanyahu applauded when Trump withdrew from the deal and imposed sanctions on Tehran, which responded by stepping back from several of its commitments under the deal.In the latest breach of its undertakings in the troubled agreement, Tehran announced on Saturday that it had started up advanced uranium enrichment centrifuges.President Hassan Rouhani inaugurated a cascade of 164 IR-6 centrifuges for producing enriched uranium, as well as two test cascades -- of 30 IR-5 and 30 IR-6S devices respectively -- at Iran's Natanz uranium enrichment plant, in a ceremony broadcast by state television.An "accident" took place at Nantaz on Sunday but caused no casualties or damage, the Fars news agency reported.In an address marking the eve of Holocaust Remembrance Day, Netanyahu said on Wednesday that Israel would not be bound to a nuclear deal that would enable the Islamic republic to develop nuclear weapons."An agreement with Iran that would pave the way to nuclear weapons -- weapons that threaten our extinction -- would not compel us in any way," said the veteran right-wing premier.Biden has said he is prepared to return to the agreement, arguing the deal had -- until Washington's withdrawal -- been successful in dramatically scaling back Iran's nuclear activities.But Washington has demanded Iranian movement back towards compliance while Tehran has insisted on an end to all US restrictions, with each side demanding that the other make the first move.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defense-secretary-lloyd-austin-in-israel-amid-iran-nuclear-talks-101618130733280.html
11-04-2021||World||Electrical incident strikes Iran's Natanz nuclear facility||Iran's Natanz nuclear site suffered a problem Sunday involving its electrical distribution grid just hours after starting up new advanced centrifuges that more quickly enrich uranium, state TV reported. It was the latest incident to strike one of Tehran's most secure sites amid negotiations over the tattered atomic accord with world powers.Power had been cut across the facility of above-ground workshops and underground enrichment halls, civilian nuclear program spokesman Behrouz Kamalvandi told Iranian state television.“Here the power has been cut off indeed, and we do not know the reason for the outage,” he said. “The incident is under investigation and we will inform you about the reason as we find out.”The word state television used in its reports attributed to Kamalvandi in Farsi also can be used for “accident."The Vienna-based International Atomic Energy Agency, which monitors Iran's program, said it was “aware of the media reports,” but declined to comment.Malek Shariati Niasar, a lawmaker who serves as spokesman for the Iranian parliament's energy committee, wrote on Twitter that the incident was “very suspicious,” raising concerns about possible “sabotage and infiltration.” He said lawmakers were pursuing details of the incident as well.Natanz, a facility earlier targeted by the Stuxnet computer virus, was largely built underground to withstand enemy airstrikes. It became a flashpoint for Western fears about Iran’s nuclear program in 2002, when satellite photos showed Iran building its underground centrifuges facility at the site, some 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the capital, Tehran.Natanz suffered a mysterious explosion at its advanced centrifuge assembly plant in July that authorities later described as sabotage. Iran now is rebuilding that facility deep inside a nearby mountain.Israel, Iran's regional archenemy, has been suspected of carrying out an attack there, as well as launching other assaults, as world powers now negotiate with Tehran in Vienna over its nuclear deal.Iran also blamed Israel for the killing of a scientist who began the country’s military nuclear program decades earlier. Israel has not claimed any of the attacks, though Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu repeatedly has described Iran as the major threat faced by his country in recent weeks.Israeli officials could not be immediately reached for comment. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin landed in Israel on Sunday for talks with Netanyahu and Israeli Defense Minister Benny Gantz.Natanz today hosts the country’s main uranium enrichment facility. In its long underground halls, centrifuges rapidly spin uranium hexafluoride gas to enrich uranium.On Saturday, Iran announced it had launched a chain of 164 IR-6 centrifuges at the plant. Officials also began testing the IR-9 centrifuge, which they say will enrich uranium 50 times faster than Iran's first-generation centrifuges, the IR-1. The nuclear deal limited Iran to using only IR-1s for enrichment.Since then-President Donald Trump's withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, Tehran has abandoned all the limits of its uranium stockpile. It now enriches up to 20% purity, a technical step away from weapons-grade levels of 90%. Iran maintains its atomic program is for peaceful purposes, but fears about Tehran having the ability to make a bomb saw world powers reach the deal with the Islamic Republic in 2015.The deal lifted economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for it limiting its program and allowing inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency to keep a close watch on its work.On Tuesday, an Iranian cargo ship said to serve as a floating base for Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard forces off the coast of Yemen was struck by an explosion, likely from a limpet mine. Iran has blamed Israel for the blast.

Instead, each of the 27 watches the other heads of state or government with suspicion via a video screen that shows a mosaic of faraway capitals.This is what Covid-19 has wrought.Lofty hopes that the crisis would encourage a new and tighter bloc to face a common challenge have given way to the reality of division: The pandemic has set member nation against member nation, and many capitals against the EU itself, as symbolized by the disjointed, virtual meetings the leaders now hold.Leaders fight over everything from virus passports to push tourism to the conditions for receiving pandemic aid. Perhaps worse, some attack the very structures the EU built to deal with the pandemic. Last month, Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz decried how vaccine-buying in the bloc had become a “bazaar,” alleging poorer countries struck out while the rich thrived."Internal political cohesion and respect for European values continue to be challenged in different corners of the Union," the European Policy Center said in a study one year after the pandemic swept from China and engulfed Europe.In some places, there have been demands for political accountability.In the Czech Republic on Wednesday, Prime Minster Andrej Babis fired his health minister, the third to be sacked during the pandemic in one of Europe’s hardest-hit countries. Last week, Slovakia’s government resigned over a secret deal to buy Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, and in Italy, Premier Giuseppe Conte was forced to resign over his handling of the economic fallout of the pandemic.But overall, political upheaval across the EU has been muted, considering that half a million people have died in the pandemic. At the EU level, there has been no serious call for the ouster of European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, the bloc's chief executive, despite her acknowledgment that serious mistakes were made.It is clear that the EU has not risen to the occasion so far — and it's not clear if it can. The European Policy Center noted that “there is no immediate end in sight to the health crisis, not to mention the inevitable structural economic challenges.”The EU and its countries, of course, fell victim to some events beyond their control, as other nations around the globe did. Good arguments can be made that part of the the bloc's problems are due to delayed deliveries from Anglo-Swedish pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca. But some of the crisis was plainly self-inflicted.The typical complaint is that there is no united EU health structure to tackle the pandemic and that largely health is still a national domain. But for years, the bloc has had a common drug regulator, the European Medicines Agency. And since last summer, the EU decided to pool vaccine purchases and spread them equitably among the 27 nations, big and small, richer and poorer.But while some non-EU nations were speeding ahead with emergency use authorizations, the EMA moved more slowly, at least in part because it followed a process that was largely similar to the standard licensing procedure that would be granted to any new vaccine. The agency's first vaccine greenlight came some three weeks after one was OK'd in the United Kingdom — the first country to authorize a rigorously tested Covid-19 shot.The bloc never caught up. On Friday, the UK, for example, had given 46.85% of their citizens at least one dose, compared to 14.18% in the EU.The EU also made the mistake of overly equating securing vaccines with getting shots in the arms — and underestimating the difficulties involved in mass producing and distributing such a delicate product. While EU negotiators were focusing on liability clauses in a contract, other nations were thinking about logistics and pushing for speed and volume.And while nations like the United States were sealing their borders to vaccine exports, the EU took the high moral ground and kept exports flowing — to the extent that over the first quarter of the year almost as many doses left the bloc for third countries as were delivered to the clamoring EU member states.On top of missteps with the vaccine rollout, the EU will be slow to disburse money from its 750 billion-euro ($890 billion) rescue package, which will share debt and give out grants to poorer members in an unprecedented way. But bickering among leaders over some clauses and intricate rules have made it anything but a speedy process. What's worse, the German constitutional court could still torpedo or further delay the whole initiative.The nature of the crisis may be different from past ones, but familiar obstacles arose: onerous bureaucracy, unnecessary delays as legalistic and technical disputes overshadowed the bigger picture, and bickering politicians putting self-interest before the common good.This past week was a case in point. The EMA reiterated its advice for all member nations to stand together — this time to keep on using the AstraZeneca jabs for all adults despite a possible link to extremely rare cases of blood clotting.Instead, hours after the announcement, Belgium went against that recommendation, barring AstraZeneca for citizens 55 and under, and others issued or kept similar restrictions.“If government leaders don’t trust the science, trust in vaccination is gone. If we don’t rely on (the EMA), ANY common EU approach is doomed,” said leading EU parliamentarian Guy Verhofstadt, normally the staunchest of EU backers.It is noteworthy that the EU nations insisted on delaying their vaccination drives in December specifically because they wanted to wait for the EMA's decision. But many have repeatedly ignored the EMA advice in the months since, setting more restrictions on vaccine use than the agency has called for.This extreme hesitancy by many countries — in addition to often seesawing advice — has become a hallmark of a vaccination rollout gone wrong. It has exacerbated the supply and issues of trust the bloc has faced.With barely half of the doses that the EU had contracted for the first quarter delivered — 105 million instead of 195 million — the video summit last month saw EU nations squabbling over shots and a distribution system that a few thought unfair.Now there are expectations the EU can turn it around. It is hoping for 360 million shots this quarter — that would keep the promise alive to vaccinate 70% of adults by the end of summer in the bloc of 450 million inhabitants.In France, President Emmanuel Macron gave a glimmer of hope to millions when he said that a return to a semblance of normal life could perhaps come by mid-May when people could "reclaim our art de vivre embodied by our restaurants and our cafes that we love so much.”By then, EU leaders might even mingle in person again at summits that go through the night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-and-covid-19-when-a-vaccine-only-adds-to-the-trouble-101618127260769.html
11-04-2021||World||Thousands of employees write to Google, demand better protection against workplace harassment||The employees of tech giant Alphabet have written an open letter addressed to CEO Sundar Pichai demanding a safe environment against harassment in Google. The letter published on an online blogging platform, Medium, cited a recent report published in The New York Times in which its former employee narrated her ordeal of harassment case and how it was handled by the company.The open letter has so far been signed by more than 1,300 people on Medium, which has also published their names.The employees also laid out two demands as they asked the company to stop protecting the accused. The first demand is that Google strip harassers of their status of team leads. "No harasser should manage or lead a team — whether directly or indirectly — including dotted line reports or managing temps, vendors, or contractors," it read.They also asked Alphabet to "mandatorily" change the teams of the harasser in case the claims are verified to ensure employees don't work alongside their tormentors."This is a long pattern where Alphabet protects the harasser instead of protecting the person harmed by the harassment. The person who reports harassment is forced to bear the burden, usually leaving Alphabet while their harasser stays or is rewarded for their behavior," the open letter stated.The letter also cited examples of two more employees who were awarded by the company despite the harassment allegations against them."This is not news to many people at Alphabet. Andy Rubin, the creator of Android mobile software, was awarded a $90 million exit package after a woman accused him of coercing her into performing oral sex. Amit Singhal, a former search executive, was awarded $35 million when he was forced to resign after a sexual assault investigation," the letter read."Alphabet workers deserve the right to work in an environment free from their abusers. Alphabet must prioritize the safety of their workers by prioritizing the concerns of those harmed," it also stated.Google, an entity of Alphabet, is an old subject of criticism for its treatment of cases related to harassment. In 2018, the company said it would change its policies to improve their response to such issues after more than 20,000 employees staged a walkout on the matter.That time, walkout organisers had applauded the progress on sexual harassment in hope that it would come as much-needed relief to complainants.However, in the open letter, the signatories expressed their disappointment to the company and said "it did not meet any of the Google Walkout demands (temps, vendors, contractors, and workers from Alphabet companies other than Google are still forced into arbitration)."Alphabet has not changed... We’ve already raised these issues before. The Google Walkout demands are still waiting to be met!" it also said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thousands-of-employees-write-to-google-demand-better-protection-against-workplace-harassment-101618126372967.html
11-04-2021||World||Canadian party condemns India’s three farm laws||The Canadian New Democratic Party (NDP), led by Jagmeet Singh, has passed a resolution condemning India with regard to the ongoing protests against three farm laws enacted last year.In fact, the ‘Resolution for International Solidarity with Indian Farmers’ was given the top priority in its agenda in the section, Redefining Canada’s Place in the World, a reflection of the party’s foreign policy stances.It took top position in the convention’s prioritisation list, ahead of justice and peace in Israel-Palestine. Even as two Canadians remain jailed in China, and Canada’s House of Commons on February 22 passed a resolution that defined Chinese actions in Xinjiang as meeting the threshold to be termed as “genocide”, that issue only appeared at eighth place in the list, while Hong Kong Freedom of Expression came even lower at number 12.The resolution for ‘International Solidarity with Indian Farmers’ was moved by members of the party from Brampton East. While he contested elections in 2019 to the House of Commons from Burnaby South in British Columbia, the town of Brampton, in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA), is Federal NDP leader Jagmeet Singh’s home base.The resolution calls for “the federal government to condemn India’s actions and take a firm stand in standing up for farmers and the human rights abuses being carried out by the Indian government” and demands “international accountability to protect the rights of farmers to peacefully protest without duress”.The resolution was passed with a vote of 88 for and 12 against, with every featured speaker debating it coming out in support. Jagmeet Singh was denied a visa by the Indian government in December 2013. At that time, he was a Member of the Provincial Parliament or MPP in Ontario, making him, perhaps, the first-ever sitting member of a Western legislature to have been barred from traveling to India. Later, in March 2018, he was forced to disavow all “acts of terrorism” even as he came into the eye of storm over his appearance at a 2015 event in San Francisco, during which he spoke at a platform with the backdrop of a large poster of Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, considered in India the person who birthed the violence of Khalistan movement in the 1980s.Similar resolutions did not figure in the three-day national convention of the ruling Liberal Party which ended on Saturday or that of the principal opposition Conservative Party last month.The three-day NDP convention will conclude on Sunday with a speech from Jagmeet Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-party-condemns-india-s-three-farm-laws-101618124851039.html

She noted that as of Thursday, the country had 24,995 cases linked to different variants, with the vast majority, 23,611 of the B1.1.7 one. That has contributed to record daily increase in cases, which also led to Canada overtaking the United States in terms of numbers reported per million. Canada recorded 1,052,539 cases, an increase of 7,262, just a day after it breached the daily caseload mark of 9,000 for the first time on Friday, with 9,255 new infections.Other variants also continue to concern Canadian health authorities, particularly those originating in Brazil. Tam noted that “there has been a concerning rise in P.1 cases in recent weeks. Early evidence suggests that the P.1 variant may reduce the effectiveness of vaccines, “making it even more important to control its spread”.She said, “This clearly shows that we need stronger control to combat variants of concern that are driving rapid epidemic growth in many areas of the country, even as vaccine supply and programmes continue to accelerate.” Canada has secured nearly 10.5 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines while about 7.5 million have been administered.According to Global News, which sources information from the website Our World In Data, on Friday the seven-day rolling average of new cases per million in Canada was 205.73, higher than the United States, which was at 205.12. In comparison, even with a steep increase in daily cases, the figure for India was at 84.23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-variant-causing-more-covid-19-infections-in-canada-top-health-officer-101618122210718.html

11-04-2021||World||Chinese vaccines' effectiveness low, should consider benefits of mRNA vaccines: Officials||In a rare admission of the weakness of Chinese coronavirus vaccines, the country's top disease control official says their effectiveness is low and the government is considering mixing them to give them a boost.Chinese vaccines “don’t have very high protection rates,” said the director of the China Centers for Disease Control, Gao Fu, at a conference Saturday in the southwestern city of Chengdu.Beijing has distributed hundreds of millions of doses in other countries while also trying to promote doubt about the effectiveness of Western vaccines.“It’s now under formal consideration whether we should use different vaccines from different technical lines for the immunization process,” Gao said.The effectiveness rate of a coronavirus vaccine from Sinovac, a Chinese developer, at preventing symptomatic infections has been found to be as low as 50.4% by researchers in Brazil. By comparison, the vaccine made by Pfizer has been found to be 97% effective.Beijing has yet to approve any foreign vaccines for use in China, where the coronavirus emerged in late 2019.Gao gave no details of possible changes in strategy but mentioned mRNA, a previously experimental technique used by Western vaccine developers while China’s drug makers used traditional technology.“Everyone should consider the benefits mRNA vaccines can bring for humanity,” Gao said. “We must follow it carefully and not ignore it just because we already have several types of vaccines already.”Gao previously raised questions about the safety of mRNA vaccines. He was quoted by the official Xinhua News Agency as saying in December he couldn’t rule out negative side effects because they were being used for the first time on healthy people.Chinese state media and popular health and science blogs also have questioned the safety and effectiveness of the Pfizer vaccine, which uses mRNA.As of April 2, some 34 million people have received both of the two doses required by Chinese vaccines and about 65 million received one, according to Gao.Experts say mixing vaccines, or sequential immunization, might boost effectiveness rates. Trials around the world are looking at mixing of vaccines or giving a booster shot after a longer time period. Researchers in Britain are studying a possible combination of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-vaccines-effectiveness-low-should-consider-benefits-of-mrna-vaccines-officials-101618119895700.html
11-04-2021||World||France extends gap between mRNA vaccine shots to ramp-up rollout||France will lengthen the period between the first and second shots of mRNA anti-Covid vaccines to six weeks from four weeks as of April 14 to accelerate the inoculation campaign, Health Minister Olivier Veran told the JDD newspaper on Sunday.Although France's top health authority advised a six-week period between the two shots in January in order to stretch supplies, the government at the time said there was insufficient data on how well the vaccines performed with a longer interval.France could safely do so now because it was vaccinating a younger age group, Veran said."(It) will allow us to vaccinate more quickly without reducing protection," the minister told the paper.France has approved use of the Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna mRNA vaccines.Veran also said that from Monday the AstraZeneca vaccine would be made available to all over-55s and not just those with serious pre-existing conditions.After a glacial start, France's vaccine rollout is hitting its stride, reaching a target of 10 million first doses a week ahead of a mid-April target. The government aims to deliver another ten million first shots by mid-May.Johnson & Johnson would deliver its first 200,000 doses destined for France on Monday, a week early, Veran said.President Emmanuel Macron, who was forced by a spiralling infection rate and overloaded healthcare system to impose a third nationwide lockdown, is counting on an accelerated vaccine rollout to allow a gradual reopening of the country from the middle of next month.The numbers in intensive care continue to rise and France will almost certainly cross the 100,000 deaths threshold this week. It reported over 43,000 new Covid-19 cases on Saturday and said there were now 5,769 patients receiving critical care.However, Veran said there were signs that a new lockdown was beginning to slow the infection rate."It remains very high," Veran told the JDD. "We can expect that after a period of stabilisation comes the fall. But for that, we must keep going."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-extends-gap-between-mrna-vaccine-shots-to-ramp-up-rollout-101618112329217.html

Bellard told KLFY-TV that Jose Antonio Higareda, 27, was killed when the tornado smashed into the man's home.He said seven injured people were taken to hospitals and at least eight homes were destroyed or heavily damaged, including one lifted off its foundations and plunked down nearly intact beside a road. Five of the homes were mobile homes.“It’s just devastation for probably a quarter mile to a half mile ... There’s nothing left of the houses,” he told The Acadiana Advocate. He didn't elaborate on the extent of injuries but heavy equipment was brought in to helping to clear debris away Saturday as storm victims sought to salvage any important belongings.In Mississippi, a possible tornado downed power lines and trees in Rankin County, but no injuries were reported.In Panama City Beach, Florida, a home and convenience store were leveled by a possible tornado, city officials said in a Facebook post . A resident's photo posted by The Panama City News Herald shows the store's roof and walls ripped away, but its counters, shelves and the merchandise they held appear untouched. There were no immediate reports of injuries.The town is in Bay County, which was heavily damaged by Hurricane Michael in 2018.“Many people were saying, ‘Hey, we know what to do. Sadly, we’ve been through it before’ and they pulled together as a community,” Panama City Mayor Mark Sheldon told the News Herald. “We were seeing neighbors come out and helping other neighbors and that’s what Panama City Beach is all about.”In Pensacola, Florida, the roof of a downtown brewery was ripped off by the storm, local news reports show. The National Weather Service has not confirmed if that was caused by a tornado, but reported winds of up to 60 mph (95 kpm). The Pensacola News Journal reports that about 5 inches (13 centimeters) of rain fell.“We are still learning about what exactly the damage is and what is going on,” Veronique Zayas, co-owner of Emerald Republic Brewing, told the paper. “But we know that the roof is a total loss. There is water damage throughout, and a lot of equipment has been damaged.”She said it was fortunate no one was hurt.“The brewers are normally here at 5 or 6 in the morning to start their brewing,” she said. “Luckily, no one was here.”Images shared by news outlets showed car windshields shattered by hail about as large as baseballs in Orange Beach, Alabama.Storms also brought heavy rain and strong winds to parts of Louisiana and Mississippi.Bellard said search and rescue crews are out in Louisiana in the wake of the storm.“My thoughts and prayers are with the families affected by this storm,” he said. “We're doing everything we can for those families.”Bellard reported that SLEMCO, St. Landry Public Works, Animal Control and the Sheriff’s Department were on the scene and working on debris clearance and restoring power to the area.The National Weather Service has said the tornado that hit the area was ranked an EF3 tornado, with wind speeds between 130 and 140 mph (between 209 and 225 kph).Some flooding was reported. Thousands of customers in the region lost power, according to utility tracking website poweroutage.us.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/severe-storm-damages-buildings-in-florida-panhandle-101618110056977.html
11-04-2021||World||UAE hasn't provided Princess Latifa's 'proof of life': UN||The United Nations (UN) has said that the United Arab Emirates has not submitted any proof that Princess Latifa bint Mohammed Al Maktoum, the missing daughter of Dubai's ruler, is alive.CNN reported that the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) said on Friday it has asked the UAE for "proof of life" for the Princess, but did not receive it."We haven't got any proof of life, and we would like one. One that is clear, compelling evidence that she's alive. And our first concern for us is to be sure of that," spokeswoman Marta Hurtado told a briefing in Geneva, as reported by CNN.The spokesperson added: "We tried to set up a meeting between senior officials, with the new ambassador of the UAE to the UN in Geneva. In principle, the mission has accepted these requests, but we have no fixed date yet."In secret recordings obtained in February this year, Princess Latifa claimed she was being held hostage in a "villa converted into a jail", with no access to medical help. In response, Dubai's royal family said in a statement Latifa was being cared for at home by family and medical professionals.Hurtado told the briefing the OHCHR would "ideally meet her" and "talk to her alone to examine all the aspects of her situation.""That's what we're going to convey in this meeting if it takes place," she added.Hurtado also said her office would "raise the case of Latifa's sister, Sheikha Shamsa, to ask about their whereabouts."In late February, Latifa sent a letter -- shared with CNN -- to the UK police, asking them to investigate the alleged kidnapping of her older sister, Princess Shamsa, from Britain in 2000."We are very concerned about both cases, because we don't know what is happening," Hurtado said."That's why we are not only asking where they are, but we want to meet them. We want to speak with them. We want to understand what is their situation, as the case not only with these two women, but other cases of people that have disappeared, or maybe possibly disappeared across the globe," she added."We follow up on many cases, [on a] daily basis of people that have disappeared or whom we don't know the whereabouts. That is why we are internally, privately but as well publicly here, raising their case and expressing that we are indeed very concerned about the situation," the OHCHR spokeswoman concluded.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uae-hasn-t-provided-princess-latifa-s-proof-of-life-un-101618110201873.html
11-04-2021||World||US ramps up pressure on China, new strategic competition policy to impact tech firms||The US Senate's new policy, the Strategic Competition Act of 2021, lays out a wide-ranging strategy that would have a "profound effect" on Chinese entities as the relationship between the two economic superpowers deteriorate."The legislation will have a profound effect on every Chinese technology firm," said Cameron Johnson, an adjunct faculty instructor at New York University and a partner at Shanghai-based Tidal Wave Solutions told South China Morning Post.Johnson added: "This includes in terms of developing new technologies, global investment strategies, selling into US-allied countries, receiving support from the Chinese government, and how the country's technology market interacts and influences global governance and standards-setting."South China Morning Post reported that the section on science and technology in the 283-page bill, which US lawmakers plan to introduce next week, includes efforts to provide help for American companies to diversify their global supply chain; total or partial acquisition of infrastructure like 5G mobile networks and undersea cables; negotiations for bilateral and plurilateral digital trade agreements; and building up cybersecurity capabilities.The bill stated that China's drive to become a "manufacturing and technological superpower" and to promote "innovation with Chinese characteristics" has come at the expense of human rights and long-standing international rules of economic competition.The bill calls for sanctions against Chinese officials accused of "forced labour, forced sterilisation and other abuses in Xinjiang", where human rights groups cite United Nations reports and witness accounts that as many as 1 million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities are held in "re-education camps". Beijing has repeatedly denied the allegations, insisting that the camps are vocational training facilities.According to SCMP, the legislation would also earmark US$10 million "to promote democracy in Hong Kong" and require the State Department to produce a report on "the extent to which the Government of China uses the status of Hong Kong to circumvent the laws and protections of the United States"." (The bill) Focuses on countering and confronting China's predatory international economic behaviour, and includes measures to track intellectual property violators, Chinese government subsidies, monitor Chinese use of Hong Kong to circumvent US export controls, and track the presence of Chinese companies in US capital markets. Directs the United States to provide technical assistance to countries working to counter foreign corrupt practices, and debt relief to the poorest countries who have requested forbearance due to the Covid-19 pandemic," a statement from the US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations read.The bill also "calls for enhanced coordination and cooperation with allies on arms control in the face of China's military modernization and expansion, and requires reporting on Chinese ballistic, hypersonic glide, and cruise missiles, conventional forces, nuclear, space, cyberspace and other strategic domains."If passed, the bill would void all restrictions on US officials' interaction with Taiwanese counterparts. The legislation calls for additional efforts to strengthen military ties with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific region.The bill would mandate forcing Beijing to honour a 2016 ruling by an international tribunal that artificial islands China had built near the Philippine coastline, including at Mischief Reef, violated Manila's sovereign rights.Asked about the bipartisan legislation, State Department spokesman Ned Price declined to comment specifically on the Menendez-Risch bill, but added: "We have spoken of competition with China as a defining challenge for this administration, that we will enjoy the greatest amount of success when we work hand in hand with Congress, and when our proposals, find support on both sides of the aisle."Under the Trump administration, ties between the two countries had deteriorated over issues such as human rights violations in Xinjiang, encroachment on the special status of Hong Kong, accusations of unfair trade practices by Beijing, lack of transparency concerning the pandemic and China's military aggression in various parts of the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ramps-up-pressure-on-china-new-strategic-competition-policy-to-impact-tech-firms-101618107634070.html

He says only that 'a Republican' will win||Former US President Donald Trump plans to affirm his commitment to the Republican Party — and raise the possibility that someone else will be the GOP's next presidential nominee — in a closed-door speech to donors on Saturday night.Trump's message, outlined in prepared remarks obtained by The Associated Press, comes as GOP officials seek to downplay an intra-party feud over Trump's continued leadership in Republican politics, his commitment to party fundraising and his plans for 2024.While Trump's advisers report he will emphasize party unity, he is famously known to go off script."We are gathered tonight to talk about the future of the Republican Party — and what we must do to set our candidates on a course to victory," Trump says in prepared remarks."I stand before you this evening filled with confidence that in 2022, we are going to take back the House and we are going to reclaim the Senate — and then in 2024, a Republican candidate is going to win the White House."The former president will deliver his remarks behind closed doors at his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, in the final address of the Republican National Committee's weekend donor summit in Palm Beach. Most of the RNC's invitation-only weekend gathering was set at a luxury hotel four miles away, but attendees were bused to Trump's club for his remarks.Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is expected to address donors Saturday night as well.Earlier in the weekend, a slew of candidates already positioning themselves for a 2024 presidential run made appearances. Besides DeSantis, the potential White House contenders included South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem and Arkansas Sen. Tom Cotton.House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and Sens. Rick Scott and Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina also spoke.In his remarks Friday night, Cotton leaned into the GOP's culture wars, attacking the Democrats' positions on transgender youth, voter ID laws and Major League Baseball's decision to move its All-Star Game to protest Republican voting laws — just as Trump does in his prepared remarks.While a significant faction of the Republican Party hopes to move past Trump's divisive leadership, the location of the weekend gathering suggests that the GOP, at least for now, is not ready to replace Trump as its undisputed leader and chief fundraiser.Trump's team reports that his remarks are intended to reinforce his continued leadership role in Republican affairs, a sharp break from past presidents."Saturday's speech will be welcomed words to the Republican donors visiting Mar-a-Lago to hear directly from President Trump," Trump adviser Jason Miller said. "Palm Beach is the new political power center, and President Trump is the Republican Party's best messenger."Despite Saturday's intended message, Trump's commitment to the GOP is far from certain.Earlier in the year, he raised the possibility of creating a new political party. And just a month ago, Trump's political action committee sent letters to the RNC and others asking them to "immediately cease and desist the unauthorized use of President Donald J. Trump's name, image, and/or likeness in all fundraising, persuasion, and/or issue speech."GOP officials have repeatedly tried to downplay the fundraising tensions and see Trump's participation as a sign that he is willing to lend his name to the party. At the same time, Trump continues to aggressively accumulate campaign cash to fuel his own political ambitions.Trump has also regularly attacked his Republican critics in recent weeks, especially Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and number three House Republican Liz Cheney. Neither attended the weekend donor summit.Trump did not attack Cheney or McConnell — or any Republicans — in Saturday's speech, at least according to his scripted remarks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/trump-in-2024-he-says-only-that-a-republican-will-win-101618098659319.html

Around 16,000 people live in areas under evacuation orders.Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said Saturday that water has been cut off in most areas and the country's air space is closed because of the ash. Around 3,000 people spent the night in shelters."It's a huge operation that is facing us," Gonsalves told NBC News.He said his government has been in contact with other countries that want to provide aid. Guyana and Venezuela are sending ships with supplies, Gonsalves said.The initial blast from La Soufriere, the highest peak in Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, sent plumes of hot ash and smoke 6,000 meters (20,000 feet) into the air Friday morning.A second, smaller eruption took place Friday afternoon, belching out a 4,000-meter-high ash cloud, the University of the West Indies Seismic Research Centre said.The 1,235-meter La Soufriere -- the name is French for "sulphur mine" -- had not erupted since 1979, and its largest blow-up happened over a century ago, killing more than 1,000 people in 1902.It had been rumbling for months before it finally blew.- Evacuation orders -"We are trying to be ok. It's deathly quiet outside and the mood is pensive," said Vynette Frederick, 44, a lawyer in Kingstown.Northwest of Kingstown on the 30-kilometer-long (18-mile-long) island, Zen Punnett said things had calmed down after the initial panic as evacuation orders came out Thursday night."It's gotten hazier. We are staying inside," she said.The emergency management agency posted photos of a Coast Guard ship evacuating residents of an area who had previously refused to leave. Standing on a dock, the air above the evacuees was a chalky gray.Most of the people in the red zone had been moved to safety by Friday, authorities said.Cruise ships were on the way to assist the evacuation effort.The Saint Vincent and Grenadines police on Saturday issued an appeal for troublemakers to stop making prank calls to emergency responders."We are in the middle of a serious evacuation and security exercise, to safeguard and rescue persons who are affected by the eruption," the agency said."These irresponsible calls divert much needed resources and personnel from the evacuation exercise."str-acb/jm||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/saint-vincent-covered-in-thick-ash-after-series-of-volcanic-eruptions-101618098742540.html

11-04-2021||World||Myanmar security forces kill 82 in single day in Bago city||At least 82 people were killed in one day in a crackdown by Myanmar security forces on pro-democracy protesters, according to reports Saturday from independent local media and an organization that keeps track of casualties since the military’s February seizure of power.Friday’s death toll in Bago was the biggest one-day total for a single city since March 14, when just over 100 people were killed in Yangon, the country’s biggest city. Bago is about 100 kilometers (60 miles) northeast of Yangon. The Associated Press is unable to independently verify the number of deaths.The death toll of 82 was a preliminary one compiled by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which issues daily counts of casualties and arrests from the crackdown in the aftermath of the Feb. 1 coup that ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi.Their tallies are widely accepted as highly credible because cases are not added to their totals until they have been confirmed, with the details published on their website.In its Saturday report, the group said that it expected the number of dead in Bago to rise as more cases were verified.The online news site Myanmar Now also reported that 82 people had been killed, citing an unnamed source involved with charity rescue work. Myanmar Now and other local media said the bodies had been collected by the military and dumped on the grounds of a Buddhist pagoda.At least 701 protesters and bystanders have been killed by security forces since the army’s takeover, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.The attack on Bago was the third in the past week involving the massive use of force to try to crush the persistent opposition to the ruling junta.Attacks were launched Wednesday on hardcore opponents of military rule who had set up strongholds in the towns of Kalay and Taze in the country’s north. In both places, at least 11 people -- possibly including some bystanders -- were reported killed.The security forces were accused of using heavy weapons in their attacks, including rocket-propelled grenades and mortars, though such allegations could not be independently confirmed by The Associated Press. Photos posted on social media from Bago appeared to show fragments of mortar shells.Most protests in cities and town around the country are carried out by nonviolent demonstrators who consider themselves part of a civil disobedience movement.But as the police and military escalated the use of lethal force, a hardcore faction of protesters armed themselves with homemade weapons such as firebombs in the name of self-defense. In Kalay, activists dubbed themselves a “civil army” and some equipped themselves with rudimentary hunting rifles that are traditional in the remote area.A Saturday report by Myanmar Now said residents of Tamu, a town in the same region as Kalay, used hunting rifles Saturday to ambush a military convoy, and claimed to kill three soldiers.The junta has taken other measures as well to discourage resistance. It recently published a wanted list of 140 people active in the arts and journalism charged with spreading information that undermines the stability of the country and the rule of law. The penalty for the offense is up to three years’ imprisonment. Arrests of those on the list have been highly publicized in state media.State television channel MRTV reported Friday night that a military court had sentenced to death 19 people -- 17 in absentia -- for allegedly killing an army officer in Yangon on March 27. The attack took place in an area of the city that is under martial law, and the court action appeared to be the first time the death sentence has been imposed under the junta’s rule.The UN special envoy for Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener, arrived Friday in the Thai capital Bangkok on a regional mission to resolve the crisis in Myanmar. She intends to sound out several Southeast Asian governments for their ideas but has been denied permission to visit Myanmar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-security-forces-kill-82-in-single-day-in-bago-city-101618088137323.html

11-04-2021||World||United States defends navy ship entering Indian EEZ||The United States on Friday defended the freedom of navigation operation conducted by its 7th Fleet within India’s exclusive economic zone without taking New Delhi’s permission, calling the move an “innocent passage through its territorial sea...” and “consistent with international law”.Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby told reporters that the USS John Paul Jones, a Navy destroyer, “asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Republic of the Maldives by conducting innocent passage through its territorial sea, in normal operations with its exclusive economic zone, without requesting prior permission and that’s consistent with international law”.“Again, we will continue to maintain the right, indeed the responsibility to fly, sail and operate in accordance with international law,” he added.The 7th Fleet is the largest of the US Navy’s forward deployed fleets. Though the US Navy has conducted similar operations in Indian waters in recent years, these were not publicised, as it happened in the case of the latest operation on April 7.In a press release on Wednesday, the 7th Fleet had said that USS John Paul Jones “asserted navigational rights and freedoms” around 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law, as required by India.The Indian government’s stated position on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is that the convention “does not authorise other states to carry out in the Exclusive Economic Zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state”, the statement added.Every coastal country’s EEZ extends to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its shores and the country has exclusive rights to all resources in the water, including oil, natural gas and fish. Any military activity in the EEZ requires India’s permission, navy officials said, asking not to be named.“If you have to do anything in our EEZ, you have to notify us and take permission,” Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said in 2019 after a Chinese vessel was repelled after intruding into Indian waters near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/united-states-defends-navy-ship-entering-indian-eez-101618081616555.html
