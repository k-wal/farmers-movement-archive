06-04-2021||World||Expanded defence cooperation, free trade area figure in India, Russia talks||India and Russia on Tuesday discussed ways to deepen military and strategic cooperation, including manufacturing of Russian military hardware in the country, and begin talks on creating a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union. These matters figured in the meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov. “We talked about the longstanding partnership in nuclear, space and defence sectors... We spoke of connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor,” Jaishankar told a joint news conference after the talks.Lavrov, whose visit to New Delhi focussed on preparations for the annual India-Russia Summit to be held in the country later this year, said the two sides discussed military cooperation, including the expansion of the manufacturing of state-of-the-art Russian weapons in India under the “made in India” and Atmanirbhar Bharat initiatives.“In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for India. We are the only partner that indeed transfers to India cutting edge military technology,” he said.“Deepening of military cooperation serves national interests of both countries. At the same time, we respect the right of our Indian friends to diversify ties in this area,” he said.Jaishankar said India’s “defence sector requirements in the past year were expeditiously addressed” by Russia – an apparent reference to the country’s emergency military needs amid the border standoff with China in Ladakh sector.According to a recent estimate by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), Russia was the most affected supplier as India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20. Though it continues to account for almost 60% of the hardware of the Indian military, Russia is also facing growing competition from the US and France.Responding to a question on reported US pressure on India to prevent military-technical cooperation with Russia, Lavrov said this was an issue for any country that wants to sign agreements with Russia for weapons systems. “We did not discuss these statements from the US, instead we confirmed that we are going to deepen our military cooperation... We also discussed the prospect of additional manufacturing of Russian military equipment in India within the concept of ‘Made in India’,” Lavrov said, adding that there were no “fluctuations or changes” on the part of India.The US has held out the possibility of slapping sanctions on India over the purchase of S-400 missile defence systems from Russia.Lavrov further said that working with India on trade and economic issues is one of the priorities of the Eurasian Economic Union, a bloc that includes Russia, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan. “We hope to launch talks on a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union based on mutual benefit,” he said.The two sides also agreed on the need to “galvanise work on the renewed inter-governmental agreement on mutual security of investments” and on increasing the share of national currencies in trade, he said.Jaishankar also briefed Lavrov on new economic initiatives, such as Atmanirbhar Bharat and the production-linked incentives programmes, to expand manufacturing in 13 sectors which have opened up new opportunities for Russian businesses. Lavrov said the two sides also agreed on joint efforts to tackle a decline in mutual trade due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed cooperation in nuclear energy, space, including manned programmes, building rocket engines and satellite navigation, and transportation infrastructure projects in Russia’s the Far East and the Arctic, he said.Collaboration on Covid-19 vaccines figured in the talks, and Lavrov noted the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has signed contracts with several Indian firms to manufacture about 750 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He didn’t rule out further cooperation to cover manufacturing of Indian vaccines in Russia, while Jaishankar said a decision would be made by regulatory authorities of both sides. “For us, were those vaccines to be made in India, it would be one more affirmation of the importance of ‘Made in India’ and our own vaccine capacities,” Jaishankar said. The Russian minister also conveyed a message from President Vladimir Putin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited Jaishankar to visit Russia. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said there are various difficulties associated with infrastructure development projects in Russia’s Far East and the proposed free trade area with the Eurasian Economic Union. “Besides India’s resource constraints, there’s also the influence of China. It won’t be easy for us to compete with China’s financial resources and economic muscle-flexing. Russia itself has been concerned about increasing Chinese influence in these areas,” he said. “The Russian military hardware is certainly something we should consider, but after the S-400 and the threat of sanctions under Countering America’s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA), nothing is going to be smooth sailing. Being the devil’s advocate, I’m not dismissing this but it isn’t as straightforward as it would appear,” Prakash said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/expanded-defence-cooperation-free-trade-area-figure-in-india-russia-talks-101617730950617.html

06-04-2021||World||Norwegian emergency response team rescues Dutch cargo ship, prevents oil spill||Emergency response teams scrambled on Tuesday to prevent a Dutch cargo ship adrift in the North Sea from sinking and causing an oil spill off Norway's coast after the crew had to be evacuated in stormy weather.Footage released by the Norwegian Rescue Coordination Centre showed some of the 12 crew members jumping into the sea late on Monday from the badly listing Eemslift Hendrika before being rescued by helicopter. Others were hoisted directly from the deck.All were brought to safety, but the ship has continued to drift towards land. It is currently some 74 km (40 miles) off the Norwegian coast.The wind is expected to gradually shift the vessel to a course parallel to the shore, giving the salvage operation more time, Hans Petter Mortensholm of the Norwegian Coastal Administration told Reuters."Our calculations now indicate a window of opportunity to act, lasting until just after midday on Wednesday," he said. "The risk of pollution is our main concern."The Hendrika has around 350 tonnes of heavy oil and 50 tonnes of diesel in its tanks, the Coastal Administration said.Smit Salvage, a subsidiary of the Dutch marine services company Boskalis, told Reuters it had been contracted to try saving the ship and was mobilising a team to send to Norway later on Tuesday.Safety permitting, Smit would seek to get its own crew on board the Hendrika and link the vessel to a so-called anchor handling tug, a powerful ship built to move rigs for the oil industry."Getting her onto a tow line and to a calmer location, that is the goal," Smit Salvage spokesman Martijn Schuttevaer said.A Norwegian coastguard vessel is on standby in the area and could also be used for towing purposes, the Coastal Administration said.Built in 2015 and registered in the Netherlands, the 111.6 metre (366 feet) Eemslift Hendrika is a yacht transport vessel, carrying smaller boats on its deck, according to Monaco-based Starclass Yacht Transport, which markets the ship's services.One of the smaller vessels strapped to the deck fell off in the storm, the Coastal Administration said.

06-04-2021||World||Mastermind of Easter terror attacks identified: Sri Lankan minister||A top Sri Lankan minister said on Tuesday that a radical cleric, who is now under detention, has been identified as the mastermind of the deadly Easter Sunday attacks in 2019 that killed 270 people, including 11 Indians.Nine suicide bombers, belonging to local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaat (NTJ) linked to ISIS, carried out coordinated blasts that tore through three churches and as many luxury hotels in Sri Lanka on the Easter Sunday in 2019."Naufer Moulavi was the mastermind (of the Easter bombings)," Minister of Public Security Sarath Weerasekera told reporters here.Weerasekera said that the cleric was assisted by another person identified as Hajjul Akbar.He said 32 suspects have been charged with murder and conspiracy to murder.Eight dossiers have been handed over to the Attorney General, he said, adding that another 75 suspects are under detention.The total number of suspects in the remand custody is 211, including the 32, who have been charged, he added.The Buddhist-majority nation was about to mark a decade since ending a 37-year-long Tamil separatist war in May 2009 when the suicide bombings in 2019 rocked the country.The attacks caused a political storm as the then government headed by President Maithirpala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was blamed for its inability to prevent the deadly attacks despite the prior intelligence made available on the impending terror strikes.During his tenure, Sirisena formed a presidential panel to probe the attacks.In its report, the panel said that former president Sirisena and a host of other top defence officials, including former defence secretaries, former IGPs and intelligence chiefs, were guilty of ignoring prior intelligence. The panel report recommended criminal action against them.Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith, the head of the local Catholic church, has been demanding action against Sirisena.The Colombo Church has been holding a 'Black Sunday' congregation every week, demanding justice for the victims.Ranjith has vowed to take drastic action if the real culprits were not dealt with by the second anniversary of the attacks on April 21.The findings of the presidential panel which found Sirisena culpable has come under criticism by political parties claiming that the panel had not been able to identify the masterminds and those who provided funds to the bombers.The panel had recommended that findings against Sirisena and the then police top brass be referred to the Attorney General for necessary legal action.Sirisena has publicly denied receiving any prior information on the attacks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mastermind-of-easter-terror-attacks-identified-sri-lankan-minister-101617721929901.html
06-04-2021||World||AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine risk-benefit 'still largely positive': WHO||The risk-benefit balance for the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine is "still largely positive", the World Health Organization said Tuesday after fresh claims about links to blood clots.A top official from the European Medicines Agency -- the EU's drug regulator -- claimed there was a clear connection between the jab and clots, though the EMA itself said it was still reviewing data and no conclusions had yet been reached.The WHO said there was no evidence that the risk-benefit analysis had shifted on the jab, which is one of only three different Covid-19 vaccines so far to have received the green light from the UN health agency."There is no link for the moment between the vaccine and thrombotic events with thrombocytopenia," Rogerio Pinto de Sa Gaspar, the WHO's director for regulation and pre-qualification, told a press conference."The appraisal we have for the moment -- and this is under consideration by the experts -- is that the benefit-risk assessment for the vaccine is still largely positive."For the time being, there is no evidence that the benefit-risk assessment for the vaccine needs to be changed."The AstraZeneca jabs produced in South Korea and India, plus the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine and that of Johnson and Johnson, are the only ones to have received WHO authorisation so far in the Covid-19 pandemic.- Jab crucial to Covax -On March 18, after several countries suspended the use of the AstraZeneca jab, the EMA stressed that the benefits of using it outweighed the risks and it should remain in use.The WHO gave strong backing to the jab the following day, urging countries to maintain the roll-out after reviewing reports of blood clots.WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said there was "no question" over the benefits after the organisation's vaccine safety experts found no increase in clotting conditions linked to an AstraZeneca shot."The question with any pharmaceutical or vaccine is whether the risk of taking it is greater or less than the risk of the disease it is meant to prevent or treat," he said at the time."There is no question: Covid-19 is a deadly disease and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine can prevent it."The AstraZeneca vaccine accounts for almost all of the doses being distributed around the world in the first wave of the Covax global vaccine-sharing facility.Covax has now delivered 36 million doses of coronavirus vaccine to 86 countries and economies, Tedros said Tuesday.The scheme aims to ensure poorer nations get enough doses to vaccinate at least 20 percent of their population by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-risk-benefit-still-largely-positive-who-101617725193448.html

A 39-year-old woman was hospitalized in serious condition after she was shot in the arm and abdomen, police said.Five men were hospitalized in fair condition, while another person was in good condition after walking into a hospital in the Cook County suburb of Harvey with a gunshot wound to the leg, police said.No one was in custody Tuesday morning and detectives were investigating.The shooting comes amid recent violence in the city. The day before, on Easter Sunday, separate shootings across Chicago left seven people dead and at least 10 more with gunshot wounds.Last week, a 13-year-old boy, Adam Toledo, was fatally shot by a Chicago police officer after he ran from officers while carrying a handgun. He died at the scene March 29 and a gun was recovered. Mayor Lori Lightfoot said Monday that she had directed the Chicago Police Department to capture and bring to justice whoever gave the boy the handgun.Just last week, the department reported that by the end of March there were 131 homicides compared with 98 for the same period last year. And the number of shootings had already climbed past the 700 mark — more than 200 more than had been recorded during the first three months of last year.Those totals and the weekend slayings puts the city on a pace to eclipse the 769 homicides in 2020, which was the deadliest year in all but one year in the previous two decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/7-shot-and-wounded-as-gunfight-erupts-chicago-s-englewood-101617721154891.html
06-04-2021||World||‘Any solution in Afghanistan without Taliban runs risk of failure’: Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov||Any process to find a solution to the conflict in Afghanistan that excludes the Taliban runs the risk of failure, Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov said on Tuesday after talks with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar.“The Taliban movement is part of Afghan society, and decisions on the settlement in Afghanistan should foresee the participation of all political, ethnic and religious groups of Afghanistan. Otherwise, it’s not going to be stable,” Lavrov told a joint press conference in response to a question on a possible power-sharing agreement with the Taliban.The latest developments in Afghanistan figured prominently in the meeting between the two ministers, who shared their assessments on the situation in the war-torn country. Lavrov’s delegation included Zamir Kabulov, the Russian presidential envoy to Afghanistan and a key player in Moscow’s reconciliation efforts.Lavrov said he and his Indian counterpart agreed the Russian and Indian representatives on Afghanistan will be in close contact regularly, while Jaishankar pointed out that “what happens in Afghanistan impacts [India’s] security directly”.“This decision has to be based on the balance of political and ethnic and religious interests... Any other way that foresees the exclusion of any group from this process will not lead to agreements that could be implementable and sustainable. All of this would be fraught with the risk of the resumption of the hostilities, which is not anybody’s desire,” he added.Jaishankar said India’s approach hinges on durable peace in Afghanistan, which would “require harmonising interests of all, both within and around that country”. He added, “The peace process must be based on foundational principles to which we all subscribe, and a political solution should mean an independent, sovereign, united and democratic Afghanistan.”Lavrov said he hoped the Biden administration would implement the agreement the Trump administration signed with the Taliban last year as it had “created a window of opportunity to reach an agreement between all the hostile parties”. Russia is ready to arrange further consultations under the “Moscow Format”, which includes India, China and Pakistan, to give impetus to the peace process, he said.People familiar with developments, said on condition of anonymity, that there was a frank exchange of assessments by both sides regarding the situation in Afghanistan, especially after the US administration’s fresh push for peace between the Afghan government and the Taliban. The Indian side highlighted its concerns about any hasty power-sharing agreement undoing the gains of the past two decades, the people said.India has been facing calls in recent years from leaders in the US, Russia and Iran to engage with the Taliban, though the government in New Delhi is yet to take a call on the issue. Questions were raised when Russia didn’t include India in a meeting of the “extended troika” in Moscow last month, especially after Pakistan was invited to the meet that included Taliban representatives. Lavrov headed to Pakistan from India, and his itinerary raised eyebrows in New Delhi as it is virtually unheard of for a Russian leader to travel to Islamabad from New Delhi.Lavrov also didn’t have an interaction with the Indian prime minister, usually a standard feature for a visit to New Delhi by a senior Russian leader. The people cited above sought to play down the matter, saying no such meeting was scheduled as the prime minister was away in West Bengal to address public meetings at Cooch Behar and Howrah as part of the BJP’s campaign for the state elections.There were no indications of differences at the joint press conference with both Lavrov and Jasishankar giving a positive readout on their discussions. While growing political and defence cooperation between Russia and China have sparked speculation about a potential military alliance between the two countries, Lavrov ruled out such a possibility.He said Russia-China summits had concluded that bilateral relations “are at the highest [point] in the history but these relations do not pursue a goal of establishing a military alliance”. Lavrov added, “By the way, we’ve heard speculations about pro-military alliances not only regarding Russia-China relations but also about such alliances allegedly being promoted such as ‘Middle East NATO’ and... ‘Asian NATO’. Today, we exchanged views on this and Indian friends have the same position as us. We believe that this is counter-productive and we are interested in inclusive cooperation that is for something, and not against somebody.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/any-solution-in-afghanistan-without-taliban-runs-risk-of-failure-russian-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-101617719480122.html
06-04-2021||World||Pakistan will take a decade to vaccinate 75% population: Report||Amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in Pakistan, a report published in an American publication has said that Islamabad will take around a decade to vaccinate 75 per cent of its population in contrast with the developed countries which would take a much shorter period.According to a Bloomberg report cited by Arab News, countries like the US, Britain and Israel were likely to reach the 75 percent target within three months while others like Pakistan were expected to immunise the same level of their population in about a decade. As per the same report, India will acquire herd immunity through vaccination in a little over three years.This comes amid the rising number of cases in Pakistan which has lead to increased restrictions, broader lockdowns and stronger standard operating procedures."Increased restrictions, broader lockdowns and stronger sops (Standard operating procedure) enforcement are starting to have effect. Initial signs of positivity slowing. However, due to momentum of last 2 weeks patients on critical care and mortality will stay at high levels for some time. Please follow sops and be safe," Asad Umar, chairman of the National Command and Operation Centre (NCOC) tweeted.The latest report also said that countries like Germany and France were likely to acquire herd immunity through vaccination in about a year.Taking Pakistan's current situation in account, the report also raised concern over the issue due to the "general indifference to medical problems once they stop bothering rich countries."As many as 3953 new cases were reported in the last 24 hours. The total number of COVID-19 cases in the country has reached 696,184.Amid the growing concerns over the spread of COVID-19 ahead of Ramadan, Pakistan last Sunday had reported 3,568 coronavirus patients, who are under critical care. This is the highest number ever since the pandemic started. (ANI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-will-take-a-decade-to-vaccinate-75-population-report-101617713049826.html

It was the island's worst rail accident in seven decades.The truck had slid down a sloping road from a building site onto the tracks just outside a tunnel. Officials suspect the truck's brakes were not properly applied and are investigating the manager of the site.Young Hong-tsu, chairman of Taiwan's Transportation Safety Board, said they had reconstructed how the truck had ended up on the rails, tracking its movements down the dirt road before it slipped off a bank and landed on the railway line, its front end facing the oncoming train.Young showed recovered footage taken from inside the driver's cabin as he desperately tried to slow down before hitting the truck at the entrance to the tunnel, causing the train to de-rail."How much time was there between this truck sliding onto the track and it hitting the Taroko express? Actually it was only a little bit more than one minute," he said, referring to the name of the train.Young said the driver had no time to properly slow the train and avoid the accident as he had only seconds to react, the truck being on a bend and not visible until it was too late.In a screenshot from the footage, the truck is clearly seen straddling the track, with leaves and branches sticking out of its front from when it slid down the wooded bank.The victims included two Americans and one French national.Young said Taiwanese authorities had been in touch with the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board and France's transport safety body to see if they were interested in helping with the investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/truck-landed-on-train-track-minute-before-deadly-taiwan-crash-101617714734458.html
06-04-2021||World||Bill Gates is reaching for the high-hanging fruit on climate||“Do the Hard Stuff Too” is Point #6 in Chapter 10 of Bill Gates’s new book, How to Avoid a Climate Disaster: The Solutions We Have and the Breakthroughs We Need. Gates elaborated on that point on April 1 in a video talk hosted by the Economic Club of New York. “To get to zero [emissions], you can’t leave the hard categories alone,” the co-founder of Microsoft Corp., now a full-time philanthropist, told the online audience. (He appeared with former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson.) “We’ve put all the effort into the easy categories of cars and power generation,” Gates said. “In the hard categories, the work has barely, barely begun. You don’t get success unless you cover them all.”“All” is the key point. Businesspeople are accustomed to picking the low-hanging fruit first—knocking off the projects with the lowest costs and highest payoffs before tackling the harder stuff. But that won’t work for climate change, Gates says. To overwork the fruit metaphor, the climate can’t be saved unless all the fruit is picked, including the stuff on the very highest branches. And the effort has to start now.Example: There’s been a lot of progress on solar panels and wind turbines, which is great. Renewable energy has become what Gates calls an “easy” category. But they produce power intermittently, and there’s been far less progress on technologies for storing the energy they produce—not just for a few hours, but potentially for an entire season.The same goes for transportation. Batteries are wonderful for passenger vehicles, but there will never be battery-powered airliners because the batteries would weigh too much and take up too much room. So for the foreseeable future, the net-zero solution for airlines and some other forms of transportation will be alternative liquid fuels that are made from carbon that was already in the atmosphere. While those don’t add to carbon in the atmosphere they are prohibitively expensive and there hasn’t been enough research on bringing down their cost, Gates writes in How to Avoid a Climate Disaster.Other technologies that require research include zero-carbon steel and cement, meat and dairy made from plants or cells, capture of carbon from the air, safer nuclear power plants, nuclear fusion, and coolants that don’t contain fluorinated greenhouse gases, Gates writes.  It’s tempting to focus on ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. But “making reductions by 2030 the wrong way might actually prevent us from ever getting to zero,” Gates writes. An example of that would be replacing power plants that burn coal with power plants that burn natural gas, which is cleaner but still puts out greenhouse gases. A better strategy, Gates writes, is to focus investments on two priorities: installing as much zero-carbon generation as possible, and electrifying as many processes and products as possible in anticipation of the day when all electricity will be carbon-free.“If we think the only thing that matters is reducing emissions by 2030, then this approach would be a failure, since it might deliver only marginal reductions within a decade,” Gates writes. “But we’d be setting ourselves up for long-term success. With every breakthrough in generating, storing, and delivering clean electricity, we would march closer and closer to zero.”In short: Reach for the high-hanging fruit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bill-gates-is-reaching-for-the-high-hanging-fruit-on-climate-101617713376607.html

It took almost a week to dislodge it and get it under tow.That incident caused a hundreds-long traffic jam of ships. Tuesday’s disruption serves as a reminder that traffic through the waterway is vulnerable to things outside the control of the Egyptian authorities.About 12% of trade passes through the Suez Canal, a waterway shaving thousands of miles off voyages from Asia to Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/suez-canal-traffic-briefly-stopped-after-oil-tanker-loses-power-101617708667646.html

06-04-2021||World||US court moves extradition hearing of 26/11 accused Tahawwur Rana to June 24||A US court has postponed the in-person extradition hearing of Pakistani-origin Canadian businessman Tahawwur Rana, who is sought for his involvement in the 2008 Mumbai terror attack, from April 22 to June 24.US District Court Judge in Los Angeles Jacqueline Chooljian in her order on Monday moved the in-person extradition hearing of 59-year-old Rana to India to June 24.The court's order came after a conference between Rana's lawyers and those representing the US Government. During the conference, the two sides agreed to hold the in-person hearing of Rana on June 24 at 1.30 pm local Los Angeles time.Meanwhile, Rana’s attorneys in additional motion opposed his extradition to India.“The government has not identified a single case since the founding of this country in which a person acquitted by an American jury has been extradited to a foreign country for trial on charges resting on the same conduct,” it said in its 17-page new submission on Monday.The US Government has time till April 12 to submit its response, if any. The US Government so far has supported the extradition of Rana to India.Rana's attorney argued that the US government's position boils down to this: the term "offense" in the India-US Extradition Treaty means whatever the government needs it to mean.In Article 2, the dual criminality provision, where the government needs the term to have a broad meaning, it refers to underlying conduct. In Article 6, it means "conduct" when needed to achieve a plea deal with Headley, and it means "elements" when needed to extradite Rana.“The Court should reject this "heads the government wins, tails Rana loses" approach. Applying ordinary tools of interpretation, it should hold that the term "offense" in Article 6 refers to the underlying conduct, and it should deny extradition,” it argued.Rana, a childhood friend of David Coleman Headley, was re-arrested on June 10 in Los Angeles on an extradition request by India for his involvement in the Mumbai terror attack in which 166 people, including six Americans, were killed. He has been declared a fugitive by India.Pakistani-American Lashkar-e-Taiba (LeT) terrorist Headley was involved in plotting the 2008 Mumbai terror attack. He was made an approver in the case, and is currently serving a 35-year prison term in the US for his role in the attack.As per the India-US Extradition Treaty, the Indian government has requested the formal extradition of Rana, and the United States has initiated this extradition proceeding. The US Government has argued that Rana meets all the criteria warranting certification of his extradition to India.These are: the court has both personal and subject matter jurisdiction, there is an extradition treaty between the United States and India that is in full force and effect, and the crimes for which Rana's extradition is sought are covered by the terms of the treaty.In his previous court submission on February 4, Rana's attorney had argued that Rana's extradition is barred under Article 6 of the United States-India extradition treaty because he had previously been acquitted of the offences for which his extradition is sought, and under Article 9 of the treaty because the government has not established probable cause to believe that Rana committed the alleged offences.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-court-moves-extradition-hearing-of-26-11-accused-tahawwur-rana-to-june-24-101617704771978.html

Korea to not attend Tokyo Olympics, dashes Seoul's hopes of restarting talks||North Korea will not attend this year's Tokyo Olympics because of the coronavirus pandemic, Pyongyang's sports ministry said, dashing Seoul's hopes of using the Games to restart talks with its nuclear-armed neighbour.The isolated North's participation in the last Winter Games, hosted by the South in Pyeongchang, was a catalyst in the diplomatic rapprochement of 2018.Leader Kim Jong Un's sister Kim Yo Jong attended as his envoy in a blaze of publicity, and the South's President Moon Jae-in seized the opportunity to broker talks between Pyongyang and Washington that led to a series of high-profile meetings between Kim and then US president Donald Trump.But Pyongyang's announcement extinguishes the possibility that the postponed Tokyo Games, due to begin in July, could kick off a reset in the now deadlocked talks process.North Korea's Olympic Committee "decided not to participate in the 32nd Olympic Games in order to protect players from the world public health crisis caused by Covid-19", said the Sports in the DPR Korea website, run by the sports ministry in Pyongyang.But analysts said other factors may have been at play.The announcement -- dated Monday -- reported a meeting of the national Olympic committee on March 25.The North's official KCNA news agency had previously carried a dispatch on the committee meeting, without mentioning the Olympic decision.All International Olympic Committee member countries are required to take part in each Games under the Olympic charter.An IOC spokesperson told AFP that it had "not received any official application from the NOC of DPRK to be released from their obligation".The spokesperson added that "despite several requests" the North's Olympic Committee had been unable to hold a conference call to discuss the coronavirus situation.Border lockdownPyongyang is more isolated than ever after imposing a strict border closure more than a year ago to protect itself from the virus that first emerged in neighbouring China.While the North insists it has had no coronavirus cases -- although experts doubt the assertion -- the lockdown has exacerbated the economic pain from multiple international sanctions over its banned weapons programmes.The new US administration of Joe Biden is in the final stages of a review of North Korea policy, with officials widely expected to support a resumption of lower-level talks rather than high-stakes, high-drama summits.On the campaign trail, Biden characterised Kim as a "thug" and has sharply criticised Trump's meetings, saying he legitimised one of the world's most ruthless leaders, but has also said he is open to diplomacy.Biden recently warned North Korea of consequences for violations of UN Security Council resolutions after Pyongyang tested what US officials judged to 'Shameless distortion'Inter-Korean relations are also at a standstill, with the North repeatedly saying it has no interest in talking to Seoul, and last year blowing up a liaison office on its side of the border.Even so, Moon in his Independence Day speech on March 1 said: "This year's Tokyo Olympics could be an opportunity for dialogues between South Korea and Japan, the North and the South, North Korea and Japan, and North Korea and the US."The day commemorates mass protests that took place in 1919 across the Korean peninsula against Tokyo's colonial rule.Seoul's unification ministry said it was "sorry that the Covid situation" had prevented the Games from serving as "an opportunity to advance peace on the Korean peninsula".Japan's chief government spokesman Katsunobu Kato said it was monitoring the reports and authorities were seeking to improve the environment, "including infection countermeasures, so that many countries and regions can participate in the Tokyo Games".Analysts said the virus may not be the only reason behind Pyongyang's decision."Pyongyang seems to be protesting against Japan's policies on North Korea, as sensitive issues such as human rights and sanctions have been raised by Tokyo, along with the US," Yang Moo-jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, told AFP.The North regularly excoriates Olympic host nation Japan over its brutal 20th-century annexation, with KCNA carrying a report Sunday condemning new Japanese history textbooks as "persistent and shameless distortion of history".Tokyo regularly demands resolution of the issue of Japanese citizens kidnapped by the North, although Pyongyang insists it has returned all those it seized who are still alive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/n-korea-to-not-attend-tokyo-olympics-dashes-seoul-s-hopes-of-restarting-talks-101617702886016.html

Export restrictions by India left the vaccine-sharing programme short of supplies of AstraZeneca's vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India.Harris said she had no update on any countries stepping forward, adding: "We are very much looking for more vaccine".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-does-not-back-vaccination-passports-for-now-spokeswoman-101617703830047.html

This will ensure that those who received placebo doses initially receive the actual vaccine now, and vice-versa. All the participants, however, will continue to be "blinded" so they do not know if they received the experimental vaccine or the placebo, the news agency added.A 'placebo' vaccine has no therapeutic value, but can function as a control for vaccine testing, where researchers gauge the efficacy of the actual vaccine dose by observing the "expected" physiological response in patients, who have no idea if they treatment they just received was active or inactive. Placebo-controlled studies are thus most commonly used in "blinded" clinical trials, where such information about vaccine efficacy is consensually withheld from the participants to illicit an expected response.Even when other authorised vaccines are made available, allowing volunteers on placebo to cross over to the active vaccine offers them an incentive to continue with the trials. Novovax plans to put this incentive to good use, planning to cross over participants in its ongoing large, late-stage study in the United States and Mexico, Reuters reported, adding that Novovax will read out initial clinical data during the second quarter."The crossover arms ensure that all participants have access to an active vaccine candidate while allowing Novavax to continue to monitor the safety and efficacy of our vaccine over the long term," Reuters quoted Filip Dubovsky, M.D., Chief Medical Officer at Novavax, as saying. "We are grateful to the volunteers who stepped forward to take part in our clinical trials, without whom we would be unable to develop, study and ultimately deliver what we hope will be a significant tool in the fight against Covid-19," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/novovax-allows-volunteers-on-placebo-to-get-covid-19-vaccine-in-trials-101617691075201.html
06-04-2021||World||China cautions Japan ahead of Biden-Suga meet, asks to be 'objective, rational'||China’s foreign minister cautioned Japan against teaming up with the US to counter Beijing, as Japan speaks up more on human rights in China's Xinjiang region ahead of a US-Japan summit next week.Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his Japanese counterpart in a phone call Monday evening that their two countries should ensure that their relations “do not get involved in the so-called confrontation between major countries,” a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said.It quoted Wang as saying that “China hopes that Japan, as an independent country, will look at China’s development in an objective and rational way, instead of being misled by some countries holding biased view against China.”Japan, a close US ally that hosts major American naval and air force bases, shares US concerns about China's military buildup and claims to territory in the South and East China Seas. However, its major trade and investment interests in China have at times reined in its criticism of its larger neighbor.Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga is to travel to Washington to meet President Joe Biden on April 16 in what will be the US leader’s first in-person summit since taking office in January.Biden, in contrast to his predecessor Donald Trump, has stressed rebuilding ties with European and Asian allies as the US prepares for competition with a rising China.Japanese Foreign Minister Toshimitsu Motegi raised human rights in China's Xinjiang region and Hong Kong, both important issues for Biden. He also reiterated Japan's protest against China's presence in waters around a group of uninhabited, Japan-controlled islands that China claims in the East China Sea.Motegi told reporters Tuesday that he expressed “grave concern and strongly requested China to take concrete actions" for improvement on those issues, including the human rights situation in the Xinjiang region.Some members of a foreign policy team within Suga's conservative ruling party have called for his government to take a tougher stance against China over the Xinjiang situation. They say Japan should adopt a law to impose sanctions against a foreign country over human rights violations.The United States, Canada, Britain and the European Union have adopted such a law, and they say Japan is the only Group of Seven country without it.Japan has taken a softer approach by maintaining dialogue rather than imposing unilateral sanctions. But Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato on Tuesday said Japan is open to the possibility of having such a law."It is necessary to analyze and consider whether Japan should adopt a system that would unilaterally determine human rights violations and impose sanctions, taking into consideration various views including our ongoing human rights and foreign policies and trends in the international community,(asterisk) he said.Kato said it is important for each country to do what it can to improve human rights conditions. “Japan will continue to cooperate with the United States and other related countries,” he said.Wang opposed Japanese interference in China’s internal affairs in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, the Chinese statement said.Taiwan is another potential flashpoint, with Suga saying earlier this week that Japan would cooperate with the US on the issue. China regards the self-governing island as a renegade province that should be under Chinese rule.China, in a signal to the US and its allies, recently sent an aircraft carrier group to waters near Taiwan for training exercises.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-cautions-japan-ahead-of-biden-suga-meet-asks-to-be-objective-rational-101617701678016.html
06-04-2021||World||US, Iran begin indirect talks in Vienna to revive 2015 nuclear deal||Iran and the United States will begin indirect talks in Vienna on Tuesday aimed at bringing both countries back into full compliance with the 2015 nuclear deal that Washington abandoned three years ago.Iran has steadily overstepped the accord's limits on its nuclear programme in response to Washington's withdrawal from the accord in 2018 and its reimposition of sanctions that have crippled the Islamic Republic's economy.While Tehran has repeatedly rebuffed "direct and indirect negotiations" with its old foe, Washington said on Monday it expected the talks to be difficult. Both Tehran and Washington did not foresee any early breakthrough."We are not optimistic nor pessimistic about the outcome of this meeting now, but we are confident that we are on the right track, and if America's will, seriousness and honesty is proven, it could be a good sign for a better future for this agreement and ultimately its full implementation," Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters.US and Iranian officials will begin indirect talks in the Austrian capital, where the pact was originally reached in 2015, later on Tuesday. Officials from Britain, France and Germany, are expected to act as intermediaries. Russia and China, the other parties to the 2015 pact, will also attend.A Western diplomat told Reuters on Friday that a shuttle-diplomacy approach would be adopted. The diplomat said France would be the main interlocutor for both sides.According to diplomats, the remaining parties to the deal will first meet at a Viennese hotel for preparatory talks. The US delegation, headed by special envoy Rob Malley, will be based in a nearby hotel.Adding fresh doubt to chances of a breakthrough, an Iranian official told Reuters: "Our agenda during the meeting will be removal of all U.S. sanctions against Iran ... as our supreme leader has said repeatedly, anything less than that will not be accepted by Tehran."Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final say on all state matters, has opposed any gradual easing of sanctions.An EU official said working groups would be created with the aim of marrying lists of sanctions that the United States could lift and nuclear obligations that Iran should meet.Diplomats said Tuesday's talks could continue for several days to resolve some of the easier issues before resuming next week. The aim is some form of a deal ahead of June's Iranian presidential election, the official said, although Iranian and US officials have said there is no rush.President Joe Biden's administration wants to revive the accord but has said that this requires negotiations. Tehran has dismissed any engagement in talks with Washington about both sides resuming compliance with the deal.Under the 2015 accord, US and other economic sanctions on Tehran were removed in return for curbs on Iran’s nuclear programme to make it harder to develop a nuclear weapon - an ambition Tehran denies.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-iran-begin-indirect-talks-in-vienna-to-revive-2015-nuclear-deal-101617701012344.html
06-04-2021||World||Financial regulator asks G20 countries to prepare Covid-19 relief exit plan||While ending Covid-19 economic relief measures too soon would present more of a threat to financial stability than leaving them in place too long, it was time for G20 countries to decide how it should be done, the Financial Stability Board said on Tuesday.The FSB, which coordinates financial rules for the G20 group of rich nations, said the speedy, sizeable and sweeping measures introduced by governments in the past year have limited economic fallout from the Covid-19 shock, but phasing them out will also present risks given continued uncertainties.Despite the arrival of vaccines, the withdrawal of relief measures is not imminent given the pandemic is worse in some countries than had been anticipated a few months ago, the FSB said.In a report to help G20 countries exit the measures, the FSB recommended a flexible approach that withdraws relief gradually in a sequenced way to avoid a "cliff edge" effect from simultaneous expiries.Withdrawals could be based on narrowing the scope of relief measures, requiring beneficiaries to opt in, making the support progressively less generous, and sequencing the expiry of different relief.A "state-contingent" approach rather than a pre-announced timetable for withdrawal could help to minimize long-term financial stability risks, the FSB said."For many support measures, authorities need to take a decision on whether to extend, amend or unwind them," the FSB said in its report for G20 finance ministers meeting virtually this week."Prematurely withdrawing temporary measures designed to support bank lending could lead to an unintended tightening of bank lending."FSB Chair Randal Quarles, said in a letter to G20 members there were signs of an emerging "inflection point" as vaccines are rolled out, albeit at different paces."While it is sensible to keep measures that support financial system stability and financing of the real economy in place as long as needed, the factors to be considered in deciding whether to extend, amend and, eventually, end support measures are taking shape," said Quarles, who is also vice chair for supervision at the US Federal Reserve.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/financial-regulator-asks-g20-countries-to-prepare-covid-19-relief-exit-plan-101617699049918.html

Most in the queue were young Pakistanis still not eligible for the government's free vaccination, reported TRTWorld.While the private sale of vaccines has begun, the government and importers are still locked in a pricing dispute.Pakistan initially agreed to exempt imported vaccines from price caps, but later rescinded the exemption and said it would set maximum prices.One pharmaceutical company, which had already imported 50,000 doses of Sputnik V, took the government to court, where it won an interim order allowing it to sell it until pricing is decided, reported TRTWorld.The number of patients now in critical care has reached 3,568, the highest since the pandemic started, a cabinet minister, Asad Umar, said on Twitter.Pakistan has thus far reported 687,908 infections and 14,778 deaths, reported TRTWorld.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistanis-rush-to-buy-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccine-as-commercial-sales-begin-101617699488746.html
06-04-2021||World||Myanmar protesters paint Yangon red, defying bloody army crackdown||Opponents of Myanmar's military junta sprayed red paint on roads in the country's biggest city on Tuesday to mark the deaths of hundreds of "martyrs" killed by troops, as the crisis dragged on with no clear diplomatic solution in sight.Some 570 people have been killed during nearly two months of unrest since the military coup on Feb. 1, and security forces have arrested close to 3,500 people, with about four-fifths of them still in detention, advocacy group the Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) said on Tuesday.Demonstrators woke early in Yangon to spray and splash pavements, roads and bus shelters with red paint in protest at a sweeping crackdown by security forces that has caused weeks of international outrage."The blood has not dried," said one message in red.Another daubed across a bus shelter took aim at rank-and-file soldiers who it said were being exploited by kleptocratic generals."Don't kill people just for a small salary as low as the cost of dog food," it said.Anger has swept Myanmar in the past two months over the return of a military government and an abrupt end to a brief era of democratic and economic reform and international integration that was absent under the military's oppressive 1962-2011 rule.Some protesters have called their movement a "spring revolution", characterised by street marches, quirky acts of non-violent rebellion and civil disobedience campaigns aimed at crippling the government apparatus.Internet blackoutsTheir ability to organise may have been hampered in recent days by the military's halt of broadband wireless internet, adding to a weeks-long block of mobile data services which had been the main channel for spreading word of what was happening in the country during the crackdown.Those able to access social media, including some journalists, on Tuesday shared pictures of striking workers marching for a second day in the city of Mandalay, some wearing gas masks and giving the three-finger salute that has become a symbol of resistance to army rule.A day earlier, demonstrators held placards of detained leader Aung San Suu Kyi and signs calling for international intervention.Authorities have issued arrest warrants for dozens of celebrities, models and influencers, and on Tuesday a popular comedian was arrested in Yangon, the Mizzima news site reported.Sithu Aung Myint, a prominent journalist, was on the wanted list. Writing on Facebook, he said he was proud to be considered a threat."When the coup council who have been committing crimes announces you as a lawbreaker together with the whole country, you will be more than happy because you are recognised as a hero in this revolution," he wrote."Your next generation will be proud of you."Protesters and workers have come out daily against the military takeover, which followed several years of awkward power-sharing between generals and Suu Kyi's civilian government under a democratic system created by the army.Suu Kyi's party won an election by landslide in November, and had pledged to change the constitution to reduce the military's political clout.Despite the election commission saying the vote was fair, the military justified its coup by alleging that the ballot was fraudulent, and has promised to hold a new election at an unspecified time.Diplomatic EffortOn Monday, the military's mouthpiece newspaper, the Global New Light of Myanmar, carried a banner quoting the junta's leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing."Democracy is based on the wish of the majority, but such a wish must be authentic with honest politics," it said.Min Aung Hlaing has sought to play down the unrest and dismissed international concern as misplaced, calling it an internal issue that the military was handling with "utmost restraint".Western countries have called for a restoration of Suu Kyi's government, a position echoed by only a handful of Myanmar's regional neighbours.Brunei, the chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) on Monday agreed to a meeting of its leaders over the crisis in Myanmar, though no date was set,ASEAN operates by consensus but the divergent views of its 10 members on how to respond to the army's use of lethal force against civilians and the group's policy of non-interference has limited its ability to act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-protesters-paint-yangon-red-defying-bloody-army-crackdown-101617698885948.html
06-04-2021||World||NASA's Ingenuity helicopter survives first night alone on Mars||NASA's Ingenuity mini-helicopter has survived its first night alone on the frigid surface of Mars, the US space agency said, hailing it as "a major milestone" for the tiny craft as it prepares for its first flight.The ultra-light aircraft was dropped on the surface on Saturday after detaching from the belly of the Perseverance rover, which touched down on the Red Planet on February 18.Detached from the Perseverance, Ingenuity had to rely on its own solar-powered battery to run a vital heater to protect its unshielded electrical components from freezing and cracking during the bitter Martian night, where temperatures can plunge as low as minus 130 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius).Also Read | ‘Touchdown confirmed!’: Nasa’s Mars Ingenuity drops from Perseverance belly. List of milestonesMaking it through the frigid Martian night was "a major milestone for the small rotorcraft," NASA said in a statement Monday."This is the first time that Ingenuity has been on its own on the surface of Mars," said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory."But we now have confirmation that we have the right insulation, the right heaters, and enough energy in its battery to survive the cold night, which is a big win for the team. We're excited to continue to prepare Ingenuity for its first flight test."Over the coming days, Ingenuity will undergo tests of its rotor blades and motors.If all goes well, Ingenuity is expected to make its first flight attempt no earlier than the evening of April 11, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory said.It will be the first aircraft to attempt powered, controlled flight on another planet.Tribute to Wright brothersIngenuity is carrying a small piece of cloth that covered one of the wings of the Wright brothers' first aircraft which achieved the first powered flight on Earth at Kitty Hawk in 1903, to pay tribute to the milestone.Its attempt will also coincide with the 60th anniversary of the first human space flight, by Soviet cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin on April 12, 1961, and 40th anniversary of the April 12, 1981 launch of the first space shuttle, Columbia.Ingenuity will be attempting to fly in an atmosphere that is one percent the density of Earth's, which makes achieving lift harder -- but will be assisted by gravity that is one-third of our planet's.The first flight will involve climbing at a rate of about three feet (one meter) per second to a height of 10 feet (three meters), hovering there for 30 seconds, then descending back to the surface.Ingenuity will be taking high-resolution photography as it flies from its "airfield" in the Jezero Crater.A series of flights are planned over its mission lasting 30 Martian sols (31 Earth days)."Our 30-sol test schedule is frontloaded with exciting milestones," said Teddy Tzanetos, Ingenuity deputy operations lead."Whatever the future holds, we will acquire all the flight data we can within that timeframe."The four-pound (1.8-kilogram) rotorcraft cost NASA around $85 million to develop and is considered a proof of concept that could revolutionize space exploration.Future aircraft could cover ground much quicker than rovers, and explore more rugged terrain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-ingenuity-helicopter-survives-first-night-alone-on-mars-101617699004119.html

I know family, friends and significant parts of our economy will welcome it, as I know I certainly do."Some other neighbouring countries have outlined plans for special travel zones, but the New Zealand-Australia arrangement is among the first that does not involve COVID-19 testing.About 568,000 New Zealand-born people live in Australia, according to 2018 figures, equivalent to 2.3 per cent of the Australian population and Australia's fourth-largest migrant community.Trade between the two countries is worth NZ$25.6 billion, according to New Zealand data, making Australia New Zealand's biggest trading partner.Flights to and from some Australian states could still be suspended if there were local outbreaks, Ardern warned.Australia has recorded about 29,400 COVID-19 cases and 909 deaths since the pandemic began, while New Zealand has had just over 2,100 confirmed cases and 26 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pm-ardern-sets-april-19-for-start-of-australia-new-zealand-travel-bubble-101617686415330.html

Andrew Cuomo expanded eligibility to 30 and over last week and announced that people aged 16 to 29 would be eligible starting April 6.Teens aged 16 and 17 will be limited to receiving the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, since that is the only one that has been authorized for use by people under 18. Parental consent will be required for vaccinations of 16- and 17-year-olds, with certain exceptions including for teens who are married or are parents.None of the available vaccines have yet been approved for people under 16.About one in five New York state residents were fully vaccinated against COVID-19 as of Monday, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A little more than one-third of the state's residents had received at least one vaccine dose.The new vaccination rules add 1.7 million people to the list of eligible New Yorkers, for a total of 15.9 million individuals, state Health Department officials said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-vaccine-eligibility-expands-to-16-and-over-in-new-york-101617686486441.html
06-04-2021||World||US consumer watchdog eyes rules to prevent foreclosures||The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said Monday it is considering new rules aimed at averting a wave of foreclosures later this year when millions of homeowners are no longer allowed to put off making their mortgage payments.Last year, the federal government suspended foreclosures and evictions for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration as the coronavirus pandemic left millions of people unemployed. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac did the same for borrowers in single-family homes with loans backed by the two mortgage buyers. The initiatives offered borrowers relief for up to one year and suspended late charges and penalties.As of February, nearly 3 million U.S. homeowners were behind on their home loans, with about 2.1 million mortgages in forbearance and at least 90 days late, according to the CFPB. If current trends continue, there still may be 1.7 million such loans by September, the CFPB said.One rule proposed by the agency would prohibit mortgage servicers from starting the foreclosure process before Dec. 31. The CFPB is also considering whether to permit servicers to initiate foreclosures before the end of this year, in certain cases, such as if they've made efforts to contact an unresponsive borrower.The CFPB is also weighing a rule that would allow servicers to offer “certain streamlined loan modification options” to borrowers with hardships caused by the pandemic, and changes to ensure servicers are notifying borrowers of their options in a timely basis. The agency is seeking public input on its proposed rule changes through May 11.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-consumer-watchdog-eyes-rules-to-prevent-foreclosures-101617668823688.html

But the AstraZeneca dose delay leaves it struggling to step up the pace of its vaccination drive.The majority of Australia's near 26 million population will be administered the AstraZeneca vaccine, with 50 million doses set to be produced locally from the end of March. About 2.5 million doses have been locally produced so far with thousands of doses already cleared testing and distributed to the vaccination sites.The Pharmacy Guild of Australia, tasked to help with the rollout of the nationwide inoculation programme from May, said on Tuesday that slow domestic vaccine approvals and logistics issues will now push deliveries to June."We have been told that the delay is linked to supply chain delays rather than the ability of the pharmacy network to participate," Pharmacy Guild President Trent Twomey told Reuters.Twomey also blamed the slow rollout on a lack of co-ordination between the Australian national government and states, with the latter complaining about slower-than-expected distribution and a lack of certainty on vaccine supplies.National authorities, however, said vaccination centres would be doubled by the end of the week, as they look to ramp up the vaccination programme that aims to provide at least one dose to every person by the end of October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-short-of-3-million-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-doses-in-blow-to-vaccination-drive-101617683660506.html

06-04-2021||World||India’s ‘double mutant’ Covid-19 variant detected in US||The “double mutant” variant of the coronavirus behind the ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases in India has now been detected in the US. The first confirmed infection was reported on Monday.It was found in a patient tested by Stanford Health Care Clinical Virology Laboratory in California, according to news reports that cited the organisation’s mediaperson. The case was detected in the San Francisco Bay Area, as reported by The Hill.The new variant of the coronavirus is called “double mutant” because it carries two mutations of the pathogen that triggered the pandemic.It has hit the US amid growing concerns about an impending surge fuelled by new and emerging variations and complacency engendered by high rates of vaccination - more than 3 million a day recently, with a record of 4 million last Saturday - being reported from around the country.“This Indian variant contains two mutations in the same virus for the first time, previously seen on separate variants,” Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious diseases expert at University of California San Francisco, told San Francisco Chronicle.The new variant is said to be responsible for the surge in new daily cases seen since over the past few weeks. From around 9,100 on February 15, the number of new infections shot up in a matters of weeks to103,000 on April 4, according to the US-based Johns Hopkins University’s Covid-19 tracker.A response was awaited from the Center of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to a request for confirmation of reports about the new variant from India and for details about the nature of the threat posed by it, and whether it was resistant to the three vaccines being administered in the US now - Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson.The CDC has been tracking new and emerging mutations of the coronavirus and it currently has five of them on its radar, according to an April 2 post on its website.Since December 2020, it has been monitoring B.1.1.7, a Covid-19 variant first detected in the UK. In January, it added B.1.351 to the list, a variant first detected in South Africa. Later that month, the CDC added P.1 to the list, a Brazilian variant first detected in Japan. In March, two more variants were added to the list, namely B.1.427 and B.1.429.The CDC, the key US federal agency that deals with health crises, says the above variants generally seem to “spread more easily and quickly than other variants” and could cause increased cases. That, in turn, could lead to more hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 by straining available resources.The vaccines currently in use in the US are known to be effective against these variants. “So far, studies suggest that antibodies generated through vaccination with currently authorised vaccines recognise these variants,” the CDC said. “This is being closely investigated and more studies are underway”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-double-mutant-covid-19-strain-detected-in-us-101617681677609.html
06-04-2021||World||Explained: Minneapolis chief seeks to reform police department||Minneapolis Police Chief Medaria Arradondo was a star witness for the prosecution Monday at the trial of a former officer charged with killing George Floyd, repeating the criticism he levied after Floyd's death.Arradondo, the city’s first Black chief, fired Derek Chauvin and three other officers the day after Floyd died, and soon afterward labelled it “murder.” He testified Monday that Chauvin's actions were counter to his training and to department values.It's a familiar message. Arradondo has spent the months since Floyd's death trying to transform a police department derided by critics as brutal and resistant to change, while fighting to preserve it from a liberal City Council that wants to replace it with a public safety unit or cut the number of officers.FROM PATROL OFFICER TO POLICE CHIEFArradondo, a fifth-generation Minnesotan, joined the Minneapolis Police Department as a patrol officer, eventually working his way up to precinct inspector and head of the Internal Affairs Unit, which investigates officer misconduct allegations. Along the way, he and four other Black officers successfully sued the department for discrimination in promotions, pay and discipline. His predecessor, Janee Harteau, promoted him to assistant chief in early 2017.He took over months later, after Harteau was forced out over the fatal shooting of Australia native Justine Ruszczyk Damond, who had called 911 to report a possible sexual assault behind her house. The Black officer in that case was convicted of third-degree murder and is serving a 12 1/2-year term. Damond’s death came two years after 24-year-old Jamar Clark, who was Black, was killed in a scuffle with two white police officers, setting off weeks of protests; neither officer was charged.BECOMING POLICE CHIEFWhen Arradondo was tapped to lead the Minneapolis Police Department in 2017, he faced a public newly outraged by Damond's death and still carrying deep mistrust over the killing of Clark.Civil rights advocates say Arradondo inherited a department with a history of misconduct spanning decades.Many hoped he could change the culture of a department that critics said too frequently used excessive force and discriminated against people of color. He spoke of restoring trust during a swearing-in ceremony that became a community celebration featuring song, dance and prayer.Arradondo made some quick changes, including toughening department policy on use of body cameras and requiring all officers to go through training that stresses respectful interaction with the public. But he was criticized following Floyd's death. Council member Steve Fletcher said Arradondo was lenient in his first year as chief as he worked to build department morale, which made it more difficult to get rid of problem officers later.AFTER FLOYD'S DEATHArradondo quickly fired the four officers at the scene of Floyd’s death.Derek Chauvin, the white officer seen on video pressing his knee into Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds, was charged with second-degree murder and other counts. City records show he had 17 complaints against him, only one of which resulted in discipline. He also shot two people during his 19-year career and was never charged.The other three officers face charges of aiding and abetting second-degree murder.Arradondo and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey pushed for sweeping policy changes: Banning police chokeholds and neck restraints; requiring officers to try to stop any other officers they see using improper force; and preventing officers involved in using deadly force from reviewing body camera footage before completing an initial police report.But they also faced efforts from the City Council to disband the police department altogether — a move that was eventually blocked from appearing on November ballots.Minneapolis agreed to pay $27 million to Floyd's family to settle a federal civil rights lawsuit alleging the city allowed a culture of excessive force, racism and impunity to flourish in its police force.___Webber reported from Fenton, Michigan.

06-04-2021||World||New lava stream flows from Iceland volcano||Iceland's spectacular, two-week old volcanic eruption entered a new phase Monday as television pictures showed a fresh fissure had opened up and begun spitting out lava.The 200-metre (yards) long fissure is a kilometre from the first eruption, which sits in the Geldingadalur valley, said an Icelandic Meteorological Office (IMO) statement.It opened up around midday local time (1200 GMT), the IMO added.Live television footage on state broadcaster RUV showed small amounts of smoking orange magma on the ground. The new stream of lava is running down into another valley, called Merardalir.Images released by Iceland's Civil Protection office showed a long, thin stream of magma flowing down through the hills for hundreds of metres from the new fissure, the whole scene shrouded in fumes.Initially the lava was moving at nearly 10 metres per second down the steep slope, "but it has slowed considerably now," vulcanologist Thorvaldur Thordarson told AFP."My feeling is that I don't see any sign of this stopping," Thordarson added. "We're going to see this for a while," said the vulcanologist, without hazarding a guess at the duration.The Meteorological Office said helicopters were making sure people had evacuated the site and that scientists were on their way to evaluate the crack.The authorities have sealed off access to the volcano site as a precaution and begun evacuating sightseers, said the IMO. People have been flocking there to see the spectacle since the eruption began on March 19.Icelandic experts, who initially thought the eruption near Mount Fagradalsfjall would be a short-lived affair, now think it could last several weeks or more. The volcano lies just 40 kilometres (25 miles) from the capital Reykjavik.While Iceland has more active volcanoes than any other country in Europe, the Reykjanes peninsula has not experienced an eruption since the 13th century -- although that one lasted about 30 years, from 1210 to 1240.At the last count by Iceland's tourism board, 36,293 people had by Sunday visited the site, where lava has been pouring from two small craters, covering almost 30 hectares (74 acres).In 2010 an eruption at the Eyjafjallajokull volcano sent huge clouds of smoke and ash into the atmosphere, disrupting air traffic for more than a week and cancelling more than 100,000 flights worldwide, which left some 10 million passengers stranded.str-map/pvh/tgb||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-lava-stream-flows-from-iceland-volcano-101617680382380.html

Congressman Steve Chabot is the other co-chair.As co-chairs of the Indian Caucus, Chabot and “I am dedicated to advancing the US-India defence relationship, particularly in support of maintaining a free and open Indo-Pacific,” Sherman said.The Defence Ministry said that Indian Navy Ships INS Satpura (with an integral helicopter embarked) and INS Kiltan along with P8I Long Range Maritime Patrol Aircraft are participating, for the first time; in multi-lateral maritime exercise La Pérouse, being conducted in the Eastern Indian Ocean Region from April 5 to 7.The Indian Navy ships and aircraft will exercise at sea with ships and aircraft of the French Navy (FN), Royal Australian Navy (RAN), Japan Maritime Self Defence Force (JMSDF) and the United States Navy (USN) during the three-day exercise at sea, it said.The exercise La Pérouse, led by the French Navy, has participation by FN Ships Tonnerre, an amphibious assault ship and frigate Surcouf. United States Navy is represented in the exercise by amphibious transport dock ship Somerset.Her Majesty’s Australian Ships (HMAS) Anzac, a frigate and tanker Sirius have been deployed by RAN for participation in the exercise while Japan Maritime Self Defence Ship (JMSDF) is represented by the destroyer Akebono. In addition to the ships, integral helicopters embarked onboard ships will also participate in the exercise.Exercise La Pérouse will witness complex and advanced naval operations including surface warfare, anti-air warfare and air defence exercises, weapon firing exercises, cross deck flying operations, tactical manoeuvres and seamanship evolutions such as replenishment at sea.The exercise will showcase high levels of synergy, coordination and inter-operability between the friendly navies. Participation by the Indian Navy in the exercise demonstrates the shared values with friendly navies ensuring freedom of seas and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order.The evolving situation in the Indo-Pacific region in the wake of China's increasing military muscle-flexing has become a major talking point among leading global powers. The US has been favouring making Quad a security architecture to check China's growing assertiveness.China is engaged in hotly contested territorial disputes in the South and East China Seas. Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarising its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.Both maritime areas in the South and East China seas are rich in minerals, oil and other natural resources and are also vital to global trade.In November 2017, India, Japan, the US and Australia gave shape to the long-pending proposal of setting up the Quad to develop a new strategy to keep the critical sea routes in the Indo-Pacific free of any influence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-congressman-lauds-quad-plus-france-naval-drill-in-bay-of-bengal-101617672877130.html
06-04-2021||World||US Supreme Court sides with Google in copyright fight with Oracle||Technology companies sighed with relief Monday after the Supreme Court sided with Google in a copyright dispute with Oracle. The high court said Google did nothing wrong in copying code to develop the Android operating system now used on most smartphones.To create Android, which was released in 2007, Google wrote millions of lines of new computer code. It also used about 11,500 lines of code copyrighted as part of Oracle's Java platform. Oracle had sued seeking billions.But the Supreme Court sided 6-2 with Google, describing the copying as “fair use.” The outcome is what most tech companies -- both large and small -- had been rooting for. Both Microsoft and IBM were among the industry heavyweights that had filed briefs backing Google in the case. They and others warned that ruling against the Mountain View, California-based company could have profound consequences, stifling innovation and upending software development.Oracle had won backing from the movie and recording industries as well as publishers, which favor expansive copyright protections to protect their profits from books, articles, movies, TV shows and music. The Trump administration had also backed Oracle.In his opinion for the court's majority, Justice Stephen Breyer wrote that Google "took only what was needed" and that “Google’s copying was transformative," a word the court has used "to describe a copying use that adds something new and important.”Google had said its actions were long-settled, common practice in the industry, a practice that has been good for technical progress. It said there is no copyright protection for the purely functional, noncreative computer code it used, something that couldn’t be written another way. But Austin, Texas-based Oracle argued Google “committed an egregious act of plagiarism."The case has been going on for a decade. Google won the first round when a judge rejected Oracle’s copyright claim, but that ruling was overturned on appeal. A jury then sided with Google, but an appeals court again disagreed.Breyer wrote that in reviewing the lower court's decision, the justices assumed “for argument’s sake, that the material was copyrightable.”"But we hold that the copying here at issue nonetheless constituted a fair use. Hence, Google’s copying did not violate the copyright law,” he wrote.At one point in the decision, Breyer used a recipe-finding robot as part of an analogy to explain how code works. At another point, he invoked a one-sentence short story to acknowledge that copying a small amount could still be significant. Breyer included both the story, originally in Spanish, and its translation: “When he awoke, the dinosaur was still there.”Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a dissent joined by Justice Samuel Alito that he believed "Oracle’s code at issue here is copyrightable, and Google’s use of that copyrighted code was anything but fair.”Only eight justices heard the case because it was argued in October, after the death of Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg but before Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined the court.In a statement, Google's chief legal officer, Kent Walker, called the ruling a “victory for consumers, interoperability, and computer science." “The decision gives legal certainty to the next generation of developers whose new products and services will benefit consumers,” Walker wrote.Oracle's chief legal officer, Dorian Daley, condemned the outcome. “The Google platform just got bigger and market power greater. The barriers to entry higher and the ability to compete lower. They stole Java and spent a decade litigating as only a monopolist can," she wrote in a statement.Oracle’s dogged pursuit of a case had been widely derided by other technology companies as a gross misapplication of copyright law. They argued it threatened to make it more difficult for different computer programs to work together and could stifle innovation among startups that might not be able to pay royalties for a few strands of coding.The founder of Privacy Lab at Yale Law School, Sean O’Brien, said both amateur and professional software developers will now “sleep a little easier without worrying that innovation and collaboration would be handcuffed by new restrictions.”The Computer & Communications Industry Association, a major trade group, was among the technology voices celebrating the Supreme Court’s decision. The court decision will also be welcome news to independent software developers, small startups and others who are tinkering with code, said Tiffany Li, a visiting law professor at Boston University.“This decision probably won’t change how startups and software developers operate. It just kind of confirms how they’ve been operating already,” Li said, adding that if Oracle had won that could have harmed a lot of developers because it would have been contrary to how the community currently functions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-sides-with-google-in-copyright-fight-with-oracle-101617669333739.html

About 400 will be trained in time to start flying again this summer, the company said. Southwest Airlines Co., meanwhile, said 209 pilots will return from voluntary leave on June 1.The pilot recalls show how U.S. airlines are stepping up efforts to prepare for a potentially busy summer as more people receive Covid-19 vaccinations. United Airlines Holdings Inc. said last week it would hire 300 new pilots, underscoring the dramatic reversal for an industry that a year ago was slashing payrolls through buyouts, early retirement and temporary leave programs.More than 1.5 million passengers passed through domestic security checkpoints April 4, compared with just 122,029 a year earlier. United and American Airlines Group Inc. have said their planes are about 80% full.Delta’s reliability will improve this spring and summer “as more of our workforce becomes vaccinated and more pilots return to active flying,” the company said in an emailed statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-airlines-bringing-back-more-pilots-as-travel-demand-rebounds-101617669175556.html
06-04-2021||World||US President Biden likely to name Evercore’s Bianchi as trade deputy||President Joe Biden is likely to name longtime aide and Obama administration veteran Sarah Bianchi as deputy U.S. trade representative, according to people familiar with the matter.Bianchi is a senior managing director at Evercore ISI International and has previously worked for BlackRock Inc. and Airbnb Inc. She is also chair on the advisory board of the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware.A decision isn’t final and Bianchi is still being vetted, the people said. They asked not to be identified because her nomination hasn’t been announced.During the second term of the Obama administration, Bianchi served as deputy assistant to the president for economic policy and director of policy for then-Vice President Biden.Spokespeople for the White House and USTR didn’t respond to requests for comment. Bianchi declined to comment.If confirmed by the Senate, Bianchi would work under Biden’s trade representative, Katherine Tai, who was sworn in last month and has promised that the agency would promote American workers. The trade agency has multiple deputy representatives and it’s not yet clear which portfolio Bianchi will supervise, the people said.Bianchi would help “reset the trade agenda with China and ensure a results-oriented approach,” said Michael Wessel, a commissioner with the U.S.-China Economic & Security Review Commission. “The Chinese and others would know that she speaks with authority, as she has been a long-time member of the president’s inner circle.”Biden’s trade office must tackle a long list of disputes that began under President Donald Trump, ranging from enforcement of a China trade deal to national security tariffs on European steel and aluminum.Biden himself has declined to say whether he will keep in place Trump’s remaining tariffs on more than $300 billion in Chinese imports and if he will build on the phase one trade agreement Trump signed with Beijing.The president’s team is still reviewing policies put in place under Trump and has not yet determined which it will adopt.But the new U.S. administration has made clear it will depart from unilateralism and has already engaged with allies in Europe and Asia to cooperate on confronting challenges like China and climate change.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-president-biden-likely-to-name-evercore-s-bianchi-as-trade-deputy-101617667439546.html
06-04-2021||World||Biden's economic plan gets boost from Senate procedural ruling||The prospects for President Joe Biden’s economic agenda could be enhanced by a ruling from the Senate parliamentarian that opens the door to passing multiple additional bills this year without any Republican support.A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Monday that Parliamentarian Elizabeth MacDonough has ruled Democrats could enact another reconciliation package by revising the budget blueprint the Democratic Congress adopted earlier this year.The ruling “allows Democrats additional tools to improve the lives of Americans if Republican obstruction continues,” said the spokesman, Justin Goodman.Goodman said no decisions have been made on how to move Biden’s agenda, but called the decision nonetheless “an important step forward” and “that this key pathway is available to Democrats if needed.”Senate Finance Chairman Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, praised the rulling. ”The American people want bold action to address our country’s many challenges, and Democrats now have more options to overcome Republican obstruction and get things done,” he said in a statement on Monday evning.Biden’s $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package passed using the budget reconciliation process, which bypasses the 60-vote rule required to pass most legislation in the Senate.The president’s $2.25 trillion package has been dismissed out of hand by Republicans led by Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who has argued it’s too costly and would require huge tax increases.But even with the reconciliation tool available, Biden would still have to keep on board all 50 senators who caucus with Democrats in the 50-50 Senate, with Joe Manchin of West Virginia already insisting on changes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-economic-plan-gets-boost-from-senate-procedural-ruling-101617666255623.html
06-04-2021||World||Putin signs law allowing him 2 more terms as Russia's leader||Russian President Vladimir Putin on Monday signed a law allowing him to potentially hold onto power until 2036, a move that formalizes constitutional changes endorsed in a vote last year.The July 1 constitutional vote included a provision that reset Putin's previous term limits, allowing him to run for president two more times. The change was rubber-stamped by the Kremlin-controlled legislature and the relevant law signed by Putin was posted Monday on an official portal of legal information.The 68-year-old Russian president, who has been in power for more than two decades — longer than any other Kremlin leader since Soviet dictator Josef Stalin — said he would decide later whether to run again in 2024 when his current six-year term ends.He has argued that resetting the term count was necessary to keep his lieutenants focused on their work instead of “darting their eyes in search for possible successors.”The constitutional amendments also emphasized the primacy of Russian law over international norms, outlawed same-sex marriages and mentioned “a belief in God” as a core value. Nearly 78% of voters approved the constitutional amendments during the balloting that lasted for a week and concluded on July 1. Turnout was 68%.Following the vote, Russian lawmakers have methodically modified the national legislation, approving the relevant laws.The opposition criticized the constitutional vote, arguing that it was tarnished by widespread reports of pressure on voters and other irregularities, as well as a lack of transparency and hurdles hindering independent monitoring.In the months since the vote, Russia has imprisoned the country's most prominent opposition figure, Alexei Navalny,The 44-year-old Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. Russian authorities have rejected the accusation.In February, Navalny was sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison for violating the terms of his probation while convalescing in Germany. The sentence stems from a 2014 embezzlement conviction that Navalny has rejected as fabricated — and which the European Сourt of Human Rights has ruled to be unlawful.His team says Navalny had lost a substantial amount of weight even before he started a hunger strike Wednesday to protest authorities’ failure to provide proper treatment for his back and leg pains.Navalny complained about prison officials’ refusal to give him the proper medications and to allow his doctor to visit him. He also protested the hourly checks a guard makes on him at night, saying they amount to sleep deprivation.In an Instagram post Monday, Navalny said that three of 15 people in his room at the penal colony were diagnosed with tuberculosis. He noted that he had a strong cough and a fever of 38.1 Celsius (100.6 Fahrenheit).Later on Monday, the newspaper Izvestia carried a statement from the state penitentiary service saying Navalny was moved to the prison colony's sanitary unit after a checkup found him having “signs of a respiratory illness, including a high fever.”In an acerbic note, Navalny said he and other inmates studied a notice on tuberculosis prevention that underlined the importance of strengthening immunity with a balanced diet — advice that contrasted with a prison ration of “glue-like porridge and frozen potatoes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-signs-law-allowing-him-2-more-terms-as-russia-s-leader-101617665757581.html
06-04-2021||World||Minneapolis police chief testifies Chauvin violated policy in Floyd arrest||Derek Chauvin violated Minneapolis Police Department rules and its ethics code on respecting the "sanctity of life" during the deadly arrest of George Floyd last May, the city's police chief testified at the former officer's murder trial on Monday."It's not part of our training, and it is certainly not part of our ethics and our values," said Chief Medaria Arradondo, referring to how Chauvin, who is white, held his knee on the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, for more than nine minutes. A bystander's video of Floyd's dying moments sparked global protests against police brutality.Over 3-1/2 hours of testimony, Arradondo disputed the defense's claim that Chauvin, who has pleaded not guilty to murder and manslaughter charges, was following the training he had received in his 19 years on the force.According to law experts who track police prosecutions, it is highly unusual for a city's senior police official to testify that one of his former subordinates used excessive force. Chauvin, who along with three other officers was fired by Arradondo a day after the arrest, sat nearby in a suit, taking notes.In opening statements last week, a prosecutor told the jury that it would hear from Arradondo, who would not "mince words." Last year, the chief released a statement castigating Chauvin, saying: "This was murder — it wasn't a lack of training."On Monday, he appeared dressed in a blue uniform, placed his chief's hat on a ledge in front of him with its golden badge visible to the jury, and spoke with his hands clasped in front of him."I vehemently disagree that that was appropriate use of force for that situation on May 25," he said.He said officers are trained to treat people with dignity and are sworn to uphold the "sanctity of life." They are trained in basic first aid and given annual refresher courses, be it in tying a tourniquet to a bleeding gunshot victim or using a naloxone inhaler to reverse an opioid overdose.Chauvin failed to follow his training in several respects, Arradondo said. He could tell from Floyd's grimaces that Chauvin was using more than the maximum "light-to-moderate" pressure an officer is allowed to use on someone's neck.The officer did not relent in using deadly force even as Floyd fell unconscious and he did not provide the mandated first aid to a dying Floyd, Arradondo said."It's contrary to our training to indefinitely place your knee on a prone, handcuffed individual for an indefinite period of time," he said, echoing testimony last week by the department's most senior homicide investigator who called Chauvin's use of force "totally unacceptable."In cross-examination, Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lead lawyer, began with getting Arradondo to say it had been "many years" since he himself had made an arrest."I'm not trying to be dismissive," Nelson said. He also had Arradondo agree with him that a police officer's use of force is often "not attractive."'HAVE YOU SEEN THE VIDEO?'Arradondo was at home on the night of Floyd's death when a deputy chief called him to say a "critical" situation appeared to have unfolded at the intersection outside a food store where Floyd was arrested on suspicion of using a counterfeit $20 bill to buy cigarettes.That Floyd was taken into custody at all was unusual, Arradondo said, given it was a non-violent misdemeanor. He said he called the state agency that investigates any case where police kill someone. He then called Mayor Jacob Frey, who in 2017 appointed Arradondo as the first Black person to lead the city's police, and headed downtown to his office in City Hall.The first video he saw, a long shot taken on a city surveillance camera across the street, did not show him much. But shortly before midnight, he got a call from someone "in the community.""They said almost verbatim: 'Have you seen the video of your officer choking and killing that man at 38th and Chicago?'" Arradondo recalled. "Eventually, within minutes of that, I saw for the first time what is now known as the bystander video."He could see how long Chauvin had kept Floyd pinned facedown, and concluded it was in breach of his department's "principles and values.""We are oftentimes the first face of government our community will see, and we will often meet them at their worst moments," Arradondo told the jury when asked by a prosecutor to describe the meaning of the badge the city's roughly 700 sworn officers wear. "That has to count for something."(Reporting by Jonathan Allen; Additional reporting by Brendan O'Brien in Chicago; Editing by Grant McCool and Peter Cooney)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/minneapolis-police-chief-testifies-chauvin-violated-policy-in-floyd-arrest-101617662875328.html
06-04-2021||World||Jailed Harvey Weinstein appeals sex crimes conviction||Jailed filmmaker Harvey Weinstein filed a long-expected appeal on his rape and sexual assault convictions Monday, kick-starting an attempt to have his 23-year prison sentence quashed.Lawyers for Weinstein, found guilty last year in a landmark verdict for the #MeToo movement, said in a New York court filing that the "Pulp Fiction" producer was denied a fair trial.They argue that several women who had accused Weinstein of sexual assault, but whose allegations were not included in the charges, should not have been allowed to testify as so-called prior bad acts witnesses."The American criminal justice system was designed to convict defendants based on their conduct -- not their general character," the attorneys wrote.Weinstein's lawyers also argue that the impartiality of the jury was compromised by a juror who had written a book about older men preying on younger women.The film producer's defense team had tried unsuccessfully to have her dismissed ahead of the trial."Based on the imminent publication of her book, she had a pecuniary motive to convict the defendant," the attorneys wrote.Weinstein, 69, was found guilty of a criminal sexual act in the first degree and rape in the third degree in February 2020. He was cleared of predatory sexual assault charges.Nearly 90 women, including Angelina Jolie and Salma Hayek, have leveled sexual misconduct allegations against Weinstein, the Oscar-winning producer of numerous hits including "Shakespeare in Love."But the trial focused on charges related to just two. Weinstein was convicted of raping ex-actress Jessica Mann in 2013 and of forcibly performing oral sex on former production assistant Mimi Haleyi in 2006.In the appeal, Weinstein's lawyers also accused Judge James Burke, who they repeatedly clashed with throughout the seven-week trial, of passing an "unduly harsh and excessive" sentence.Weinstein is being held at a maximum security prison in upstate New York.He is also awaiting trial in Los Angeles on rape and sexual assault charges involving five women.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jailed-harvey-weinstein-appeals-sex-crimes-conviction-101617647833403.html
06-04-2021||World||US asks Russia to explain 'provocations' on Ukraine border: State Department||The United States finds reports of Russian military movements on Ukraine's border "credible," has asked Moscow to explain the "provocations" and is ready to engage on the situation, the U.S. State Department said on Monday.The reported Russian troop buildup and movements bordering eastern Ukraine have become the latest point of tension in icy U.S.-Russian relations less than three months after U.S. President Joe Biden took office.State Department spokesman Ned Price told a news briefing that the United States would be concerned by any effort by Moscow to intimidate Ukraine whether it occurred on Russian territory or within Ukraine.He declined to say whether the United States believed Russia was preparing to invade the neighboring former Soviet republic.Later on Monday, a State Department spokesperson told Reuters that the United States is "open to engagement with Moscow" on the situation, describing as "credible" reports of Russian troop movements on Ukraine's border and Crimea, the peninsula seized by Russia in 2014.The movements, the spokesperson said, were preceded by violations of a July 2020 ceasefire that killed four Ukrainian soldiers and wounded four others."We call on Russia to refrain from escalatory actions," the spokesperson said.The comments followed a telephone call on Friday in which Biden reassured his Ukrainian counterpart, Volodymyr Zelinskiy, of "unwavering support" in Ukraine's confrontation with Russia-backed separatists holding parts of the country's eastern Donbas region.Russia on Monday denied that Russian military movements posed a threat to Ukraine and dismissed fears of a buildup even as it warned that it would respond to new Ukrainian sanctions against Russian companies.White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters that "recent escalations of Russian aggression and escalation in eastern Ukraine" is "something we're watching closely."Biden's call with Zelinskiy came after the NATO alliance expressed concern over what is said was a large Russian military buildup on Russia's side of the border with eastern Ukraine."We've asked Russia for an explanation of these provocations," Price said. "But more importantly, what we have signaled with our Ukrainian partners is a message of reassurance."Pressed on whether the United States viewed troop movements on Russia's side of the border as intimidation of Ukraine, Price responded, "Of course, the Russians have for quite some time sought to intimidate and bully their neighbors."Ukraine, Western countries and NATO accuse Russia of sending troops and heavy weapons to prop up proxies who seized a swath of the eastern Donbas region in 2014. Moscow says it provides only humanitarian and political support to the separatists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-asks-russia-to-explain-provocations-on-ukraine-border-state-department-101617645462774.html
06-04-2021||World||Jordan's King Abdullah accepts mediation with Prince Hamzah: Palace||Jordan's Prince Hamza pledged allegiance to King Abdullah on Tuesday after mediation by the royal family, two days after he was placed under house arrest and accused of trying to destabilise the country.Prince Hamza signed a letter in which he placed himself at the monarch's disposal after a meeting on Monday with Prince Hassan, the king's uncle, and other princes, the royal court said."I place myself in the hands of his majesty the king... I will remain committed to the constitution of the dear Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan," Prince Hamza said in the letter released by the palace.An earlier royal palace tweet said the king had entrusted Prince Hassan, also a former crown prince, to take charge of the matter and that Prince Hamza had agreed to family mediation over the affair.On Saturday, the military warned Prince Hamza over actions it said were undermining "security and stability" in Jordan, and he later said he was under house arrest. Several high-profile figures were also detained.Officials said on Sunday Prince Hamza had liaised with people who had contacts with foreign parties in a plot to destabilise Jordan, an important ally of the United States, and that he had been under investigation for some time.The half-brother of King Abdullah and former heir to the throne said in a voice recording released by Jordan's opposition on that he would not comply after being barred from any activity and told to keep quiet.While Prince Hamza is not seen as a direct threat to the king, his actions suggested he wanted to shore up his position with the Jordanian public after being removed from the royal succession."For sure I won't obey when they tell you that you cannot go out or tweet or reach out to people but are only allowed to see the family. I expect this talk is not acceptable in any way," he said in the recording circulated to friends and contacts.The intrigue shook Jordan's image as a haven of stability in the unpredictable Middle East.It is unclear why the kingdom decided to crack down on Prince Hamza now, but he put himself at growing risk by stepping up visits in recent weeks to tribal gatherings where the king and his government have been criticised more openly.Public anger has also increased since nine COVID-19 patients died when oxygen ran out in a newly built state hospital, exposing negligence blamed on official mismanagement and corruption. Protests were broken up with tear gas.The prince went to the homes of those who died to pay condolences, hoping to upstage the monarch who had earlier gone to the hospital to defuse anger, officials say. It was the first such open rift in the royal family in many years.PUBLIC FRUSTRATIONSKing Abdullah removed Prince Hamza from his position as heir to the throne in 2004.In a video passed to the BBC by Prince Hamza's lawyer on Saturday, the prince accused Jordan's leaders of corruption, apparently hoping to tap into the public's frustrations.Prince Hamza is not seen as a threat to the monarchy, which enjoys the support of the army and security services, but has gained sympathy among Jordanians sceptical of the government's accusations about his foreign links, saying it was a campaign to defame him."This is character assassination without evidence," said Ali R. al Tarawneh in a tweet.A supporter identified only as Razan said on Twitter there was "no good in a country that imprisons its prince."Others felt he was driven only by revenge at being sidelined and wanted to win popularity in tribal gatherings by emulating, in tone and language, his late father, who is revered by many Jordanians.Prince Hamza is the oldest son of the late King Hussein and his wife Noor, who had groomed him as a future monarch. He has served in the Jordanian armed forces.He angered the royal palace by trying to endear himself to a poor tribal constituency that has felt the impact of a shrinking economy and the state's inability to keep creating jobs that have long absorbed tribesmen in rural and Bedouin areas.Officials said between 14 and 16 people had been arrested in connection with the alleged plot.The state news agency said those arrested included Bassem Awadallah, a U.S.-educated confidant of the king who became minister of finance and adviser to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, and royal family member Sharif Hassan Ben ZaidJordan's neighbours and allies have expressed solidarity with King Abdullah over the security measures in the kingdom.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jordans-king-abdullah-accepts-mediation-with-prince-hamzah-palace-101617644927671.html
