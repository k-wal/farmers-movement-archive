Any person suspected to be a Covid-19 case should immediately be tested and quarantined if they were found positive, he added.He said if there was a cluster of Covid positive cases, it must immediately be declared a containment zone and all SOPs should be followed there. Such zones must physically be contained (like barricading etc). Tiwari said that test, track, treat, and vaccinate policy will be followed statewide.All these restrictions will be applicable till the next 14 days.
