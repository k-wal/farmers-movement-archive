"I was shooed away by the police," he said, when he tried to meet the CMO.Three days later, Ashish said someone from the government called him offering a bed for his father - a day after Srivastava had passed away at a private clinic.The family's ordeal reflects the worsening Covid-19 crisis in Uttar Pradesh, where people are battling bureaucracy along with the disease.To get a Covid-19 bed in Lucknow, families say they need to show the result of an RT-PCR test, which are already in short supply.Next, patients are required to register with the CMO's office, which then forwards the request to the Integrated Command Control Centre for COVID management that makes the final bed allocation, a government official said.The cumbersome process has come under criticism, including from the state's Human Rights Commission that has asked the government to ditch the referral rule."There are expert doctors in hospitals who can decide if the patient needs to be admitted or not," the commission said on Tuesday. "This referral letter system is not required."Having already become the country currently being hit hardest by the pandemic, India has recorded more than 200,000 new Covid-19 cases daily for the last seven days, marking the world's steepest rise this month, and there is no sign yet that the second wave of infections is going to peak soon.In Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, infections are rising by more than 22,000 cases daily, severely straining its creaky healthcare system.The state government has said it is turning several hospitals into Covid-only facilities and adding more beds. It did not respond to questions from Reuters.BEGGING FOR HELPAt Lucknow's CMO office, adjacent to two large hospitals, dozens of people line up daily, requesting, begging and sometimes crying for a referral letter required for hospital admissions.This week, local TV news channels aired footage of a young man lying on the road to block the CMO's car in his desperation to get a letter for an ailing relative.Patients need to show an RT-PCR test confirming infection before being given a referral letter.But these tests are increasingly hard to access for most patients, with long queues outside hospitals and clinics over-burdened due to the surge in infections."Getting an RT-PCR done in U.P. is next to impossible," said journalist Shreya Jai, whose family members had to wait for a week to get a rapid antigen test.Many Lucknow labs are working with less than half their staff, the rest sickened by the virus, a lab worker said, asking not to be named.The state government has said that nearly 230 private and state-run labs were being used for coronavirus testing.On Monday, the state government led by Yogi Adityanath, who himself is currently down with Covid-19, was pilloried for its handling of the crisis by a regional court."It is a shame that while the government knew of the magnitude of the second wave it never planned things in advance," the state's Allahabad High Court said.In the Srivastava household, in a middle-class neighbourhood in central Lucknow, there is anger and sadness after the cremation of the head of the family."I blame the officers sitting in air conditioned chambers for my father's death," said 39-year-old Ashish, who himself is now COVID-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-man-says-hospital-called-to-offer-bed-for-covid-19-positive-father-day-after-he-died-101618996827234.html
21-04-2021||Lucknow||4 including 3 migrant workers killed in accident while returning home||Three migrant workers returning home from Haryana’s Jind district, died barely two kilometres from their native village in Bulandshahar district, when the van in which they were travelling collided with a truck late Tuesday night. All three died on the spot along with the driver of the van, Danish, said police officials.The workers identified as Jagru, Ganpat and Vijay, were residents of Karanpur Kala village in Bulandshahr district. They had been working in Haryana’s Jind district for some time and decided to return home on Tuesday due to the deteriorating Covid-19 situation, said a police officer placed at the senior superintendent of police (SSP) office, Bulandshahar.Police team from Anoopshahar rushed to the spot and bodies of the deceased were sent for post-mortems, before they were handed over to respective families.The accident was a reminder of unfortunate incidents witnessed last year during the peak of Covid-19-induced lockdown, when several migrants, devoid of regular transport, lost their lives in accidents when returning home from their respective workplaces. The renewal of restrictions in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 has reignited fears among the migrants, who are again on the move from major business centres, albeit in smaller numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/4-including-3-migrant-workers-killed-in-accident-while-returning-home-101618989822840.html
21-04-2021||Lucknow||They laugh and joke at poll rallies as people cry for oxygen: Priyanka criticises Yogi Adityanath, PM Modi||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday criticised the Uttar Pradesh government for failing to increase the number of tests to detect coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and not doing enough to boost medical infrastructure to deal with the increasing cases of the infection, news agency ANI reported.“Their (UP government’s) own sero-survey showed that five crore people came in contact with Covid-19. It was recommended to ramp up testing. The government started 70% antigen testing, which means only 30% of those tests were RT-PCR,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said.“What is more important? People’s lives or your numbers or the image of your government? Were the antigen tests done to lower the numbers. There are reports that private labs are being told to stop the testing,” she further added.Priyanka Gandhi’s reaction comes after Uttar Pradesh recorded more than 20,000 cases over the past few days. The state recorded 29,754 fresh cases on Tuesday pushing the state’s tally beyond nine lakh. Uttar Pradesh’s death toll crossed 10,000-mark after the state reported 162 deaths.She also criticised the Prime Minister for holding rallies in poll-bound states. “They are busy campaigning even today. At rallies they are seen laughing from stages while people are reduced to tears seeking oxygen, beds, medicines and you are holding huge rallies and laughing,” the Congress general secretary said.Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to hold rallies in Murshidabad, South Kolkata, Siuri and Malda on April 23. She also said that Modi needs to sit with people and discuss a solution to the prevailing crisis.The Congress leader also criticised the Union health minister for his response to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s letter to Modi where he suggested strategies to deal with the current Covid-19 situation. The former Prime Minister, who is also recovering from Covid-19, in a letter to his successor had said that more people should be vaccinated against Covid-19 and suggested that absolute numbers should not be taken as a standard to evaluate the success of the vaccination programme.“Everyone knows how dignified a person Manmohan Singh is. If he is suggesting measures at a time when our nation is facing pandemic, then suggestions should be taken up with the same dignity with which they were offered,” Priyanka Gandhi said.India on recorded 295,041 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 2,023 deaths in the last 24 hours, both figures being the highest-ever since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the latest data released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Wednesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/they-joke-at-rallies-while-people-cry-for-oxygen-priyanka-slams-yogi-pm-modi-101618982269089.html
