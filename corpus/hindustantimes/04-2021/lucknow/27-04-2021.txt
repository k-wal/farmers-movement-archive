The enormous risks taken by drivers and technicians deployed on ambulances with advanced life support systems are often overlooked as the spotlight is often on doctors and nurses. They are among several unsung heroes making an enormous personal sacrifice to ensure India doesn’t give up in the fight against the pandemic.Meet Santosh Pandey, he drives an advanced life support system ambulance in Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich district. Pandey says he has not met his wife and three children for the last one-and-a-half months since the resurgence of infections in the second Covid wave.“I don’t know whether I will be able to see my kids and parents again because if I get infected, no one will take my admission [in a hospital]. Even VVIP patients from Bahraich have to wait for admission for hours in the hospitals of Lucknow. I don’t know why patients are kept waiting inside the ambulance for hours,” says Pandey.His wife Archana Pandey (39) said Santosh was a hero for the entire family. “I have seen my husband only on WhatsApp video calls for the last one and a half months and my kids miss him. Santosh may be an ambulance driver for everyone but for my daughter Astha (12), he is a hero who is not even afraid of corona and helping others at a time when people are hiding themselves.”His 14-years old son Anshuman said he misses Santosh, especially during the dinner time. “He used to bring something special for us everyday. I feel like crying whenever I see him on video call.” Santosh’s 12-year-old daughter Astha “wants to become like papa”.Santosh claims to have transported more than 3,000 Covid patients from Bahraich to various hospitals in Barabanki and Lucknow, approximately over three and four hours drive, respectively.“Sometimes, my technician Krishna Kumar and I face hostile behaviour from the attendants of patients and the hospital authorities. A number of times, we have been kept waiting for hours outside hospitals. During this time, attendants lose their temper. But since we know they are under stress, we overlook their misbehaviour,” Pandey adds.Anand Rathore, a technician with a life support ambulance in Lucknow, says, “I have transported over 4,500 Covid-19 patients during the last one-and-a half months. We strive to keep patients motivated so that they can recover.”Anand says at least 12 of his fellow ambulance technicians have died due to Covid in the last one year and over 150 have been infected while transporting patients.“My family comprises my parents, brother and sister-in-law. But I stay back in my office with other colleagues. My brother occasionally visits me, but we meet from a distance as I touch Covid-19 patients daily. So, I don’t want to put my family at risk of Covid-19,” Anand adds, giving a glimpse of the challenges and stress in the daily lives of frontline workers.He is however, very realistic about it. “These are the professional hazards we have to face. We want the attendants to understand that if their patient is at risk, then we are also at risk. Misbehaving with us due to poor management by hospitals is not justified. We face abusive language and even physical threat a number of times for no fault of ours,” Rathore says.Indrajeet Singh, in charge Covid Command Centre ( Ambulances) Lucknow, said sacrifices made by men like Santosh and Anand often go unnoticed. “At a time when the son is not touching his father [due to fear of infection] our drivers and technicians first carry an infected patient in their lap or on a stretcher before they are put into an ambulance. They come into direct contact with Covid patients daily and are unsung heroes of our society; their sacrifices are not praised by anyone. They keep on working wearing personal protection equipment (PPE) kit for hours, despite that they are mistreated both by family members of patients and doctors or staff of hospitals,” Singh said summing up the situation.“Recently one of our ambulances was stopped by some people in old city, where some young men forced our staff to carry a different patient instead of the person who called for them. As a result, the patient who didn’t get the service died. The staff was manhandled, leaving a scar in their minds,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-unsung-heroes-ambulance-staff-keep-the-fight-going-despite-threats-101619492122702.html

Chief medical officer (Lucknow) Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “The issue is dealt by the Balrampur hospital administration who decided utilising the resources.”In the letter, the MP also highlighted what he described as the sorry state of treatment in King George’s Medical University.The MP’s letter also said a couple of heads of department never did duty in the wards, but they were busy highlighting themselves in the media.“A number of beds are lying vacant in these departments so there is a need to do the audit of bed occupancy of the last 20 days,” he said.He also said a number of beds were lying vacant on the fourth floor of the Covid hospital in KGMU, where patients can be admitted after arranging oxygen supply for them.Meanwhile, insiders and family members patients alleged only seven of the 28 ventilators in Balrampur Hospital were operational.A resident of Golaganj, whose mother is admitted in Balrampur Hospital in a serious condition, said, “I am surprised that despite having a number of ventilators, the hospital is operating just seven of them. The patients who require ventilators are left at the mercy of God. It seems human lives have no value.”A hospital insider said, “Yes, as many as 28 ventilators arrived in the hospital last year after the onslaught of corona, but they are lying unused because no one was trained to operate them, and no one wanted to take responsibility for operating these ventilators during such testing times.”People familiar with matter said Lokbandhu Hospital had 18 ventilators but only four of them were operational because the hospital did not have the trained manpower to use these hi-tech ventilators which could save a number of lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ventilators-gathering-dust-mp-writes-to-yogi-adityanath-101619465311283.html
27-04-2021||Lucknow||More offers of oxygen support come in amid Covid challenge in UP||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday called for doubling the health resources to fight Covid-19 while reiterating that oxygen supply to the state was being augmented from various sources even while the number of active cases under treatment crossed the three-lakh mark with the state recording 33,574 new cases and 249 more deaths, which was the highest single-day fatality count in Uttar Pradesh.At the same time, the total recoveries showed an upward trend, going past the eight-lakh mark with 26,719 more patients being discharged in the last 24 hours statewide, according to official data.The state’s total Covid-19 caseload stands at 11,20,176 now.Dwelling on more help on the oxygen front, the chief minister said the Tata and Reliance groups had offered to supply oxygen to UP.The officers concerned should negotiate with them to speed up the process of supply, he said at the Covid review meeting he held virtually with officials.He also asked for increasing the number of oxygen tankers and seeking help from the central government.He also told the officials to keep a close watch on all Covid-19 hospitals in the state and immediately provide them with oxygen as and when they required it.The chief minister once again noted that oxygen supply was being augmented daily with supplies from Roorkee and Kashipur (Uttarakhand), Modinagar (UP), Bokaro (Jharkhand) and the state’s MSME units.He warned the officers concerned that once the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCCC) allotted a hospital to Covid positive patients, it must be ensured that they find admissions in those hospitals, or else the officers will be held responsible and face action.“Considering the intense transmission rate of the virus this time, there is a need to increase the health resources for Covid-19 at least by double. The health department and the medical education department should prepare a work plan for increasing beds. Now, two more CHCs (community health centres) each should be added to the Covid management list in each district,” he said.Since OPDs (outpatient departments) were closed in hospitals, it was necessary to promote online consultation, publicise the lists of doctors for Covid and non-Covid consultation for the convenience of the people, he added.The chief minister asked the state health minister to monitor the supply of Covid medicine kits to home isolation patients across the state. All Covid patients in home isolation must get the kit containing medicines for at least one week, he said.“Through the CM helpline, the administration must keep in touch with the home isolation patients to track their condition,” he said.He also said many Covid recovered patients wanted to extend a helping hand.“So, encourage such people to come forward, make a list of them. There could be doctors, paramedics etc. Rope them in, they could be deployed at hospitals,” he said.He reiterated that there was no shortage of Remdesivir and other such Covid-19 drugs. Since the state was getting their supply every day, they should be provided free of cost to patients in government hospitals and at concessional rates in private hospitals, he said.Talking about vaccination, he said so far 97,83,416 people had got the first dose of the Covid vaccine and more than 20 lakh had been given both doses. Thus, a total of 1,17,83,880 doses had been administered in the state.“Prepare well for the vaccination drive that is scheduled to begin from May 1,” he said to the officers concerned.Apart from publicising the Covid safety protocols, health specialists should be engaged in spreading awareness about foods that boost immunity and techniques to increase the oxygen level in blood, the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tata-reliance-groups-have-offered-oxygen-supply-to-up-yogi-101619459718193.html
