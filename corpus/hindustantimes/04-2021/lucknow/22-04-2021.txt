22-04-2021||Lucknow||Hospitals continue to grapple with oxygen crisis in Lucknow||Oxygen crisis troubled patients for the second consecutive day here on Thursday as two patients allegedly lost their lives to poor supply of the medical gas at a private hospital in the city.An elderly man and a middle-aged woman succumbed to illness during treatment at the private hospital in Indira Nagar. The hospital administration denied that the deaths happened due to lack of oxygen, but admitted they were unable to provide the required level of the medical gas.“No death happened due to lack of oxygen. Both the patients were being given oxygen from the concentrators we have for the patients and were under treatment for the past few days. Yes, we needed more oxygen for increasing the flow of the medical gas and, for that, our 12 jumbo cylinders are awaiting refill at the oxygen plant since yesterday, but the agency is not giving us the gas,” said Richa Mishra of the hospital.Lucknow reported a total 19 deaths and 5,239 fresh Covid-19 cases during the day.The situation in other Covid and non-Covid hospitals wasn’t comfortable either as attendants were regularly called to shift their patients elsewhere while new admissions were stopped at many hospitals for lack of adequate oxygen.“Oxygen crisis has restricted admissions as admitting more patients will require more oxygen. Hence, primarily we are trying to manage patients who are already admitted and getting oxygen from all the sources from where we can,” said Dr Salman Khalid of the Fehmina Hospital, Trauma Centre and Blood Bank.“Arrange beds in another hospital or arrange oxygen for your patient yourself” — such messages from hospitals troubled attendants for the second day on Thursday as private Covid and non-Covid hospitals hardly admitted any patients for want of oxygen.“The hospital called up, saying there is only oxygen back-up for two hours and if it is not refilled, the patient will have to be shifted. You may please arrange bed at other hospital. As soon as I got the call, I rang every friend and all my contacts to get the oxygen cylinders filled so that I could give it to the hospital but nowhere could I find the medical gas,” said an attendant who had a relative admitted to a hospital in Gomti Nagar.Two private Covid hospitals have already put up a notice for attendants, informing them about poor oxygen supply while serious patients in hospitals across the state capital continue to get oxygen at the threshold of the stock.“I have 12 beds for Covid-19 patients but at present I have admitted only four. This is because I am able to manage oxygen only for these many patients. An ambulance with empty oxygen cylinders is standing at filling station since morning,” said Nishant Singh of Make Well Hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/hospitals-continue-to-grapple-with-oxygen-crisis-in-lucknow-101619109350558.html
22-04-2021||Lucknow||'Governance failure in UP': Congress' Priyanka Gandhi slams state government's response to Covid-19 second wave||Alleging a governance failure in Uttar Pradesh in the face of the Covid-19 second wave, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra has said the Yogi Adityanath dispensation long ceased to act as a protector and support system for the people in the state and has increasingly assumed the role of an "aggressor".In an interview with PTI, the Congress general secretary in-charge for Uttar Pradesh also said the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic was simply another reflection of the UP government's "arrogant, autocratic and inhuman attitude" towards the people of the state.Her remarks came amid a steep rise in coronavirus cases in the state. The Uttar Pradesh government on Thursday reported a record single-day spike of 34,379 Covid-19 cases and 195 fatalities. This has pushed Uttar Pradesh's infection tally to 9,76,765 and the death toll to 10,541.Asked about the grim Covid-19 situation in the state, the Congress leader said the fundamental issue is that the government in UP has long ceased to act as a protector, facilitator and support system for the public."It (the state government) has increasingly assumed the role of an aggressor. The handling of the Covid pandemic is simply another reflection of its arrogant, autocratic and inhuman attitude towards the people of UP," she said.The biggest failure has been in governance as there has been no planning, no preparation and no foresight whatsoever, the Congress leader alleged."Countries all over the world faced a second wave -- what did we learn from them? How did we use the gap between the first and second wave to prepare UP for what was inevitably going to come?" she asked.The UP government's own serosurvey results showed 5 crore people were exposed to the virus which was indicative of a second wave coming, she said."The government was advised to exponentially ramp-up testing. What happened? They reduced overall testing, switched to up to 70 per cent antigen testing and ignored their own serosurvey reports," she said, hitting out at the state government.Rather than putting every single resource into saving lives and combatting the pandemic, the UP government is still wasting time and resources on "covering up" the truth, Priyanka Gandhi Vadra alleged."The government has let people down. Their incompetence and lack of clarity is exacting an unprecedented human cost that no one should ever have had to pay," she said.On the alleged lack of preparation to deal with the second wave, she said, "How else can the Chief Minister and his government explain that despite having months of time between one wave and the other, no effort was made to increase UP's capacity for hospital beds, for oxygen or for the availability of Covid medication.""How else can they justify the number of hurdles they have placed before the public as it suffers through the horrors of the pandemic?" she asked.She also asked where else in the world does one need approval from the district medical officer or the district magistrate to get admission to a hospital in the middle of a devastating pandemic."It is unheard of. How can the government justify that only 30 per cent of the testing being done in UP is RT-PCR and 70 per cent is antigen testing? Reports from across the state are coming in that private labs are being verbally instructed not to test. What kind of governance is this?" she said.The UP government has been rejecting criticism by opposition parties on its handling of the Covid-19 situation.The Congress leader had earlier accused the Uttar Pradesh government of hiding coronavirus figures and said had they been cautious from day one, people would not have witnessed such times.Earlier this week, she had slammed the "red-tapism" in Uttar Pradesh, alleging that lives were lost because Covid-19 patients needed permission from the district chief medical officers to get admission in hospitals.In a letter to the Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister, the Congress general secretary had urged the creation of a database of available hospitals and beds so that people can seek admission directly.She had also flagged the issue of oxygen availability, saying she had been told that people need permission from the district magistrate for the hospital admission. She had called for the removal of all such rules causing difficulties for families of patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/governance-failure-in-up-congress-priyanka-gandhi-slams-state-government-s-response-to-covid-19-second-wave-101619098584106.html
