The samples of another 185 servitors have been sent for testing.“In the larger public interest and with a view to contain the further spread of coronavirus, public entry to the Lingaraj Temple is restricted until further orders,” said the order by the BMC. The BMC officials said the Ashokastami car festival scheduled on Tuesday will be held without devotees like last year.In Puri, the officials of the Jagannath Temple administration have already made it mandatory for people coming from outside Odisha to carry a RT-PCR negative test report. Similar measures are being considered for Odisha devotees too.The closure of the temple came as the positivity rate in Bhubaneswar hovered around 20 per cent and the number of active cases crossed 2500. Bhubaneswar reported about 338 cases on Sunday. Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation commissioner PC Chaudhary said of the 775 Covid-19 dedicated beds available in 2 hospitals, around 70 per cent stand occupied.“Most of the active patients are in home isolation. But we plan to add 600 more beds in the next few days as more number of patients are likely to need hospitalisation. If needed, we will reactivate the hospitals that were used last year. However, there is no problem with oxygen supply in Bhubaneswar’s hospitals,” he said.Chief secretary Suresh Chandra Mahapatra had earlier directed the civic body to mobilise at least 50 rapid response teams for regular monitoring of home isolation patients and ensure implementation of Covid-19 protocols.In Odisha, the number of new Covid-19 cases jumped to 3664 in the last 24 hours while positivity rate jumped to over 10% forcing the state government to announce a five-fold increase in the number of beds in dedicated Covid Care Centres and hospitals to accommodate patients.Director of Public Health Niranjan Mishra has said that a five-fold increase will be made in the number of beds in hospitals and all the District Collectors have been instructed to do so.Mishra said the number of beds will be increased 4 to 5 times more than last year. “Four categories of beds are required for Covid-19 infected patients which include- common beds, oxygen support beds, ICU beds, and ICU beds with ventilators. Only critically ill patients will be given ICU beds. Oxygen supply will be increased by 10 times so that our state does not experience a shortage of oxygen,” he said.At present, 25 per cent of general beds and 60 per cent of ICU beds are occupied by patients. Similarly, 14 per cent of the patients are in ventilator beds. Of the 248 beds, 45 patients are on ventilators. There are a total of 541 ICU beds in the state, of which 329 are currently occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-shuts-down-lingaraj-temple-as-covid-19-cases-rise-in-bhubaneswar-101618767447850.html

At least five districts in the state reported more than 1000 new cases. The state has tested the maximum samples in the last 24 hours-- 1,08, 898, clocking a high TPR. The active caseload has also risen to 93,686. Ernakulam topped the list with 2835 cases followed by Kozhikode district with 2560 cases. Many areas in the worst-affected districts were declared containment zones and restrictions tightened by district collectors. The state also recorded 26 fatalities taking the death toll to 4929. The first state to report a virus case in the country in January 2020, Kerala has been witnessing constant peaks and curves in the last one year. A close look at the statistics show after local body elections in December, Covid-19 cases peaked but came down after two months and started peaking again in March. Many health experts blamed the recently-concluded assembly elections for the latest surge but state health minister K K Shailaja did not agree with that view. “In Maharashtra and Delhi there were no elections but cases peaked. We can’t blame only the elections for this,” she said. She said the state which has a high density of population will have to be extra cautious-- only 11 per cent of the total population were exposed to the virus and 10 per cent have got inoculated. Though cases are rising steadily the robust health system in the state is managing the situation well, ground reports show. Out of 11,584 Covid-19 beds in the government sector, 6403 were occupied leaving 5181 unoccupied. In the private sector also enough beds are unoccupied. In Kerala at least 70 per cent of the population depend on the private sector for their medical needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-daily-viral-caseload-hits-all-time-high-with-18-257-new-covid-19-infections-101618759347396.html

Vaidyanathan’s counsel cited her tenures as the environment secretary and the chairperson of the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board for 2.5 years and also her stint as the health secretary for 2.5 years, when she was responsible for management of bio medical waste to argue she met the required criteria.After hearing arguments from both sides, the first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthikumar Ramamoorthy held that she possessed necessary qualifications to be appointed an expert member of the NGT’s southern bench. The bench observed that the former chief secretary had “dealt with environmental matters” as per clause (b) of the NGT Act, 2010. Vaidyanathan was Tamil Nadu chief secretary from December 2016 to June 2019. Her appointment was challenged in a public interest litigation filed by Chennai-based non-governmental organisation (NGO) Poovulagin Nanbargal. G Sundarrajan, who heads the NGO, argued that the NGT Act, 2010 mandates a person to have 15 years of administrative experience including five years of having dealt with matters of environment in the state or central government or in a reputed institution to qualify for the post. The court stayed her appointment on April 9, stating she prima facie didn’t meet the eligibility requirement. The court then also questioned the need to appoint bureaucrats without field experience to tribunals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-hc-clears-former-tn-chief-secretary-s-appointment-as-ngt-expert-101618753107317.html

We will be running Oxygen Express trains using green corridors to supply oxygen in bulk and rapidly to patients,” Union railways minister Piyush Goyal tweeted.Tentatively, a movement plan has been made for dispatching 10 empty tankers on Monday; the railway ministry said adding that the Transport Secretary of Maharashtra has assured to provide the tankers. “On April 17th, a meeting was held between Railway Board officials and State Transport Commissioners and representatives of industry on the subject of issues related to transportation of Liquid Medical Oxygen. It was decided that the tankers would be organized by the Transport Commissioner, Maharashtra. These empty tankers would be moved from Kalamboli/Boisar, Railway stations in and near Mumbai, and sent to Vizag and Jamshedpur/Rourkela/Bokaro, for loading of liquid medical oxygen tankers from there,” the railway ministry said in a statement on Sunday.“Zonal Railways have been informed regarding the demands from state governments. CFTMs and PCOMs are in touch with the Industry and state governments. Railway Board has directed the concerned GMs to be fully prepared and proactively assist the state and Central Government Agencies in movement of oxygen by rail,” it added.With several states reporting a shortage of oxygen, the Centre on Friday directed them to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders and said they must not impose any curbs on production and supply of the essential public health commodity anywhere.The railway ministry on Friday approved transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers under its Roll on-Roll off model as a special case following a request from the Maharashtra government. “A request had been received from the principal secretary in the public health department of Maharashtra government for transport of medical oxygen in cryogenic containers. The matter has been examined. Competent authority has approved the transport of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic containers,” it said.

18-04-2021||India||Manmohan Singh writes to PM Modi, suggests ways to tackle second wave of Covid-19||Former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday, listing five suggestions to tackle the Covid-19 vaccine shortage in India, which is currently fighting the second wave of the deadly virus. The former PM acknowledged the cloud of uncertainty among the people of the country who are “wondering when their lives would go back to normal”.In his letter, Singh asked Modi to make public orders for the coronavirus vaccine placed by the government and reveal how the doses will be distributed among the states based on a transparent system. He also suggested that the Prime Minister offer some kind of flexibility to states in defining categories of frontline workers who can get vaccinated against the virus even if they are below the age of 45 years. He clarified, “For instance, states may want to designate school teachers, bus, three-wheeler and taxi drivers, municipal and panchayat staff, and possibly lawyers who have to attend Courts as frontline workers.”Highlighting the vaccine shortage in the country, the former Prime Minister suggested that any vaccine that has been approved by credible authorities like the European Medical Agency should be allowed to be imported without insisting on domestic bridging trials. He said, “The relaxation could be for a limited period during which the bridging trials could be completed in India. All consumers of such vaccines could be duly cautioned that these vaccines are being allowed for use based on the approval granted by the relevant authority abroad.”Acknowledging the huge potential in the private sector, Singh recommended that the government should actively support domestic vaccine producers to expand their manufacturing facilities by providing them with funds and other concessions. He further added, “I believe this is the time to invoke the compulsory licensing provisions in the law so that a number of companies are able to produce the vaccines under a licence.”On Sunday morning, the Union Ministry of health and family welfare had announced that more than 122 million people in India have been vaccinated against coronavirus in the span of the last 92 days. It further added that in the last 24 hours, over 2.6 million people have been vaccinated in the country, pushing the total number of people inoculated to 122,622,590.Pointing out that the key to the fight against Covid-19 must be ramping up the vaccination effort, he said, “We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manmohan-singh-writes-to-pm-modi-suggests-ways-to-tackle-second-wave-of-covid19-101618750406940.html

Following the trials, the railway ministry said, “empty tankers would be moved from Kalamboli, and Boisar railway stations in and near Mumbai, and sent to Vizag and Jamshedpur, Rourkela, and Bokaro, for loading of liquid medical oxygen tankers.”The announcement comes a day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting in which he directed that the installation of approved medical oxygen plants should be sped up. Officials said that 162 PSA oxygen plants are being installed in 32 states and Union territories from PM CARES and one lakh cylinders are being procured, which will be supplied to states soon.“A supply mapping plan for 12 high burden states till 30th April has also been undertaken. The Prime Minister also said that supply of oxygen required for production of medicines and equipment necessary to handle the pandemic should also be ensured,” PM Modi’s office said in a statement.On Friday too, PM Modi had reviewed the status of oxygen availability to ensure adequate supply and told officials to ensure seamless and free movement of tankers carrying oxygen across the country.“The Government has exempted all interstate movement of oxygen tankers from registration of permits to enable easier movement. PM was informed that States and transporters have been asked to ensure tankers move round the clock with drivers working in shifts to ensure faster turnaround and adequate capacity to meet the surge in demand,” the Prime Minister’s office said, adding that cylinder filling plants will also be permitted to operate 24 hours with necessary safeguards.The Centre has also allowed industrial cylinders to be used for medical oxygen after due purging. “Similarly nitrogen and argon tankers will be automatically allowed to be converted to oxygen tankers to overcome the potential shortage of tankers,” the statement added. Efforts are also being made to import medical grade oxygen, officials told PM Modi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-set-to-run-oxygen-express-amid-shortage-for-covid-19-patients-101618749267208.html

He is the man responsible for the present situation. He did not make any administrative planning for 2021. And look at the situation in Gujarat."The BJP cannot tackle the Covid-19 spike even in Gujarat, and has brought the entire country, including West Bengal, to such a pass," the TMC supremo said.Highlighting that the West Bengal government had asked for 5.4 crore doses of vaccine from the prime minister for vaccinating every citizen of the state free of cost, the chief minister said, we are yet to get any response from him.West Bengal would have borne the entire cost of the Covid-19 vaccines, the chief minister had said."I will send a strong letter to the PM today on this issue. There is shortage of oxygen and anti-viral drug Remdesivir in the entire country. Who is responsible for this? Had they given us the consent, we would have been able to vaccinate every resident of the state," she said."The crisis of life saving materials has also been flagged by the Maharashtra government.But without attending this issue you (Modi) are attending election rallies in Bengal," she said.Accusing Modi of exporting vaccines to 80 countries, she said "we have no problem if you help others in the world, but first give it to Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Bengal, and other states of the country. You failed to do so and was only concerned about your image-building exercise in the global community."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-has-to-resign-since-he-is-responsible-for-covid-19-surge-mamata-banerjee-101618748517593.html
18-04-2021||India||Covid in Bengal: Mamata Banerjee flags 3 issues to PM Modi, seeks ‘intervention'||West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress (TMC) supremo Mamata Banerjee on Sunday wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi where she highlighted three issues which are important with regard to the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in India which is leading to a huge spike in number of cases and fatalities.The issues which Banerjee mentioned in her letter are vaccination, supply of essential medicines such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab and the supply of oxygen in West Bengal. She requested the Centre’s intervention in these areas. “As such, in the present situation, we have to significantly scale up our capacities to tackle the pandemic on war footing,” she added.At the beginning, Banerjee told PM Modi that another letter was addressed to him on February 24 where she asked him to allow West Bengal to purchase vaccine doses directly from state funds and launch a free vaccination campaign to cover the state’s entire population. “However, the state has not received the requisite clearance yet.”Here are the three issues which the Bengal CM asked the Centre to address:1. Vaccination:In the letter, Banerjee said that the density of population in West Bengal and more particularly in the capital city of Kolkata is extremely high, and a focussed and aggressive vaccination against the Covid-19 disease is very important. However, the supply of vaccine doses from the Centre has been ‘scarce and erratic’ which has negatively affected the state’s vaccination programmes, she said, adding that the vaccination programme is suffering due to uncertainties of supply from the Centre.Pointing out that almost 2.7 crore beneficiaries have to be vaccinated and 5.4 crore vaccine doses are needed, the CM requested Modi to urgently intervene and ensure the requirement of doses is fulfilled at the earliest.2. Supply of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab:Banerjee said the supply of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab is extremely scarce in West Bengal and the state needs 6,000 vials of Remdesivir and 1,000 vials of Tocilizumab on a daily basis. Currently, only 1,000 vials of Remdesivir is available in the state per day and there is no fresh supply of Tocilizumab, Banerjee added and urged the Prime Minister to see that all relevant authorities ensure the ramp up their efforts and ensure the steady supply of these medicines as soon as possible.West Bengal CM Mamata Banerjee writes to PM Narendra Modi requesting supply of 5.4 crores more vaccine doses, steady supply of Remdesivir and Tocilizumab medicines & supply of oxygen as soon as possible. pic.twitter.com/mHYnjTn73x3. Supply of oxygen:The final point which the Bengal CM wrote in her letter to PM Modi was of oxygen supply for the infected patients. Amid the massive spike in cases and deaths in India, several states have reported a severe shortage of oxygen and have requested the Centre to address the issue.Banerjee aid the supply of oxygen in West Bengal must be assured and certain. “The Steel Authority of India Limiter (SAIL) is meeting up our need for the moment and we shall be grateful if you kindly instruct them too for ensuring steady supplies,” she added.Also Read| India’s weekly Covid-19 positivity rate leaps from 3.05% to 13.54%West Bengal on Saturday reported the highest single-day spike of 7,713 new Covid cases, taking the caseload to 651,508, according to the state health department’s bulletin. More than 10,500 people have succumbed to the disease so far with 24 fresh deaths on Saturday. Kolkata, the worst hit region in the state, saw a record day jump of 1,998 new cases and 10 deaths on Saturday.The recent surge and deaths in West Bengal can be attributed to the political rallies and road shows being held as a part of the eight-phase state assembly elections where social distancing, wearing of face masks and other Covid protocols are not followed.CM Banerjee also said in her letter that sharp rise in the cases in West Bengal is primarily due to the large number of outsiders coming into the state for poll campaigning and other purposes “at the behest of some political parties”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-in-bengal-mamata-banerjee-flags-3-issues-to-pm-modi-seeks-intervention-101618748412054.html

Symptoms are different this time. Many are complaining of dry mouth, gastrointestinal issues, nausea, loose tools, red eyes, and headache. Everyone doesn't complain of fever,” Dr Gauri Agarwal, founder-director, Genestrings Diagnostic Centre, was quoted as saying by the agency. A lot of young people testing COVID positive as compared to old people. Symptoms are different this time. Many are complaining of dry mouth, gastrointestinal issues, nausea, loose tools, red eyes & headache. Everyone doesn't complain of fever: Genestrings Diagnostic Centre chief https://t.co/3JkPwWC0siDelhi's chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had recently said that 65 per cent of new patients are below the age of 45."We are also seeing children under the ages of 12 and 15 being admitted with symptoms in the second wave. Last year there were practically no children," Khusrav Bajan, a consultant at Mumbai's PD Hinduja National Hospital and a member of Maharashtra's Covid-19 taskforce, was quoted as saying by news agency AFP. Experts, however, say that more data is needed to back up the anecdotal evidence in India, with genome sequencing of samples playing a key role."Sequencing will tell you about the mutant that's emerging," said virologist Shahid Jameel. But it doesn't take away from everything else that you should be doing - that is to wear a mask and avoid crowded places."The remarks come on a day when India logged over two lakh Covid-19 cases for the fourth consecutive day with which the total infection tally went up to 14.78 million. Another doctor cited by news agency ANI, Dr Shyam Agrawal of Delhi's Sir Gangaram Hospital, said that according to a study of the molecular basis, 60% of strain is "double mutant" which is extremely dangerous. While several states have imposed weekend and night curfews, he suggested that only a long period of lockdown can break the chain of transmission of the virus.In line with the Centre’s call for massive testing, Dr Gauri Agarwal told ANI that testing has gone up but the testing labs are facing several challenges including calls for home collection of samples and the timely updating of data. “There's a massive surge in calls for home collection which is difficult to handle. There's no problem with infrastructure/machines. The problem lies with the government-mandated rule to do ICMR entry within 24 hours,” the Genestrings Diagnostic Centre’s chief said.On Saturday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting with top officials in which he stressed that there is no substitute for testing, tracking and treatment. Early testing and proper tracking remain key to reduce mortality, his office said in a statement.As PM Modi discussed the status of medicines, oxygen supply, ventilators and vaccination, he assured, “India had defeated Covid last year and India can do it again, with the same principles but faster speed and coordination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-young-people-testing-covid-positive-different-symptoms-this-time-experts-101618746510073.html

Till date, 'only 46.70 lakh people' have been vaccinated out of which, 40.64 lakh were administered the first dose and 6.05 lakh the second dose, he said.

Singh called for "expanding the nationwide vaccination programme to more beneficiaries" to successfully manage the pandemic."We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated," Singh said in his letter.Noting that India currently has vaccinated only a small fraction of its population, Singh said he is certain that with the right policy design, "we can do much better and very quickly".Also Read | India's daily Covid-19 positivity rate doubles from 8% to 16.69% in 12 daysThe former prime minister also asked the Centre to tell about the Covid vaccine orders placed for the next six months, and how these will be distributed to the states.The Congress leader suggested that the Centre may retain 10 per cent for distribution based on emergency needs "but other than that, states should have a clear signal of likely availability so that they can plan their roll out." He added that the states should be given some flexibility to define categories of frontline workers who can be vaccinated even if they are below 45 years.Currently, people above 45 years of age are eligible for vaccination.In the list of suggestions to the Centre, Singh also appealed to PM Modi to assist vaccine producers "with funds and other concessions" so that they expand their manufacturing facilities quickly.The letter comes a day after the Congress Working Committee (CWC) held a meeting on the Covid-19 situation. Singh is part of the CWC along with other senior Congress leaders.Earlier in the day, the Union ministry of health and family welfare, announced that India vaccinated more than 122 million people against the Covid-19 in a span of just 92 days.

In his letter to PM Modi, Kejriwal appealed regarding urgent supply of oxygen and allocation of more beds for Covid-19 patients in hospitals run by the central government. "The coronavirus situation in Delhi has become very serious. There is a severe shortage of corona beds and oxygen. Almost all the ICU beds are full. All of us are trying our level best but we need your help," Kejriwal wrote in the letter in Hindi."There are about 10,000 beds in central government hospitals in Delhi, out of which only 1800 beds are reserved for corona patients. We request to increase this to 7000 beds in view of the seriousness of the situation," he also said.The Delhi chief minister also thanked PM Modi for instructing the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) to set up 500 Covid-19 beds and asked for the numbers to be increased by 1000. "So far, there has been a lot of support from the central government in this pandemic. I hope that you will definitely help us on the relevant topics as well," Kejriwal said.This comes as Delhi is battling with the fourth wave of the coronavirus pandemic, during which Covid-19 cases have risen multiple folds as the city broke records of daily cases reported in previous waves. On Saturday, Delhi logged 24,375 fresh cases of viral disease in the sharpest spike in a single day so far. It also reported 167 fatalities in the span of 24 hours, which pushed the death toll to nearly 12,000. On April 16, 19,486 Covid-19 cases and 141 related deaths were reported in the city.Earlier in the day, Kejriwal said he has requested Union health minister Harsh Vardhan and home minister Amit Shah to increase the number of Covid-19 beds in hospitals under the central government. He also alerted the Centre that the shortage of beds and oxygen could trigger a major crisis any moment as the situation was deteriorating every passing second. "There are less than 100 ICU beds left in Delhi. We are facing a major shortage of oxygen too. Last night, a private hospital told us that they almost ran into a disaster situation last night with a major shortage of oxygen supply,” he said in a video conference."I have requested him (Shah) to reserve at least 7,000 beds for Covid-19. The situation in Delhi is deteriorating every second. I also requested that oxygen supply be provided to us immediately,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-sends-an-sos-to-pm-modi-asks-for-more-covid-19-beds-oxygen-101618741051046.html

He is not my brother by relation, but by bond of humanity. I think it's an alien concept to some,” the Union minister’s tweet read.

There has to be some other solution."The petitioner has also contended in his plea that even otherwise, revelation of the identity of the rape victim is an offence under the Indian Penal Code, though in the present matter image of a wrong person is in circulation.A 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly raped by four upper-caste men in Hathras on September 14, 2020.

However, people can use the National Electronic Fund Transfer (NEFT) service for any transaction which will continue to remain operational as RTGS won't be available between 12am and 2pm on Sunday."A technical upgrade of RTGS targeted to enhance the resilience and to further improve the Disaster Recovery Time of the RTGS system, is scheduled after the close of business of April 17, 2021," the central bank said on Monday.RBI has asked its member banks to notify their customers regarding the service unavailability so that they can plan their transactions accordingly. "Member banks may inform their customers to plan their payment operations accordingly. RTGS Members will continue to receive event update(s) through system broadcasts,” it said in the statement.Last week, the central bank proposed to expand RTGS and NEFT facilities to non-bank payment system firms in a phased manner. The objective of the move is to encourage the participation of non-banks across payment systems.Under RTGS, there is the continuous and real-time settlement of fund transfers individually on a transaction-by-transaction basis without netting. The medium is a safer and secure system for funds transfer without any upper or maximum ceiling. It was made available 24x7 from December 14 last year.

Hundreds of migrant workers on Sunday were stranded in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur as the government’s Sunday lockdowns affected public transport. The workers said that the buses were put on election duty due to Uttar Pradesh’s gram panchayat polls.“Two buses go to Azamgarh in the morning but they are fully packed. The officials told us that all buses are on election duty,” a migrant worker was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. He was among 500 others who were waiting in Kanpur for a bus headed towards Azamgarh.Kanpur | Migrant workers stranded as public transport takes a hit due to Covid-induced weekend lockdown. "2 buses go to Azamgarh in morning but they were already full. Officials say all the buses are on election duty. There are at least 500 people waiting here," they say pic.twitter.com/cG7TEEqOUwThe Kaushambi Inter-State Bus Terminal over the past few days saw an increased footfall of migrant workers working in Noida, Ghaziabad and Delhi. Some of those men and women said they were travelling back home to cast their votes in the rural body elections and that their return was being spurred by fears of another lockdown. Migrant workers were also seen with their families waiting for buses at Delhi Meerut Expressway, near Indirapuram.Migrant workers in Gurugram last week also started to leave for their homes after the Haryana government imposed a night curfew in the state. The people returning home to their families in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Bihar said that fears of a lockdown has led them to arrive at this decision. “There is no such information that we will announce a lockdown. So, (it is not clear) why they are getting this impression and taking extreme steps,” Yash Garg, Gurugram’s deputy commissioner told HT.Key transit points in Delhi like Anand Vihar ISBT and New Delhi railway station also saw large numbers of migrant labourers headed home as they feared that the rise in cases in the Capital would force the city towards another lockdown. “I am noticing the Covid-19 situation closely as it will help me decide when it is best to leave the city. Night curfew has already been imposed, lockdown could be next,” Kumar, a migrant worker told HT.Lockdown like measures introduced by several state governments meant a loss of livelihood for many migrant workers working in India’s major cities. Migrant workers, who form an essential part of any city’s economy, faced difficulties when the Centre imposed its first lockdown in 2020 following the first wave of Covid-19. Most of them were unable to find transport and had to walk home in desperation and many died due to exertion and lack of food.The recent surge in Covid-19 cases has adversely affected these workers in all major cities like Mumbai and Delhi. Migrant workers in Mumbai after noticing the surge in cases started leaving for their native states starting at the beginning of this month. Maharashtra continues to see migrant workers leave as the state remains worst-hit by Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weekend-curfews-restrictions-across-states-spell-bad-news-for-migrant-workers-101618729366885.html
18-04-2021||India||If required, Govt to respond with fiscal steps: Niti Aayog official on Covid-19||The country needs to prepare for "greater uncertainty" in terms of consumer as well as investor sentiments due to the second wave of coronavirus infections, and the government will respond with fiscal measures as and when required, Niti Aayog Vice Chairman Rajiv Kumar said on Sunday.While acknowledging that the present situation has become far more difficult than it was in the past due to rising coronavirus infections, Kumar remained hopeful that the country's economy will grow 11 per cent in the current fiscal ending March 31, 2022.India is grappling with spiralling number of Covid cases as well as related deaths, forcing many state governments to put in place restrictions on movement of people.According to Kumar, India was on the verge of defeating Covid-19 completely but some new strains from the UK and other countries have made the situation far more difficult this time around."Apart from their direct impact on some sectors like the services sector, the second wave will increase the uncertainty in the economic environment which can have wider indirect effects on economic activities. So, we need to prepare for greater uncertainty, both in consumer and investor sentiments," Kumar told PTI.To a query on whether the government is considering coming up with a fresh stimulus, the Niti Aayog vice chairman said this question has to be answered after the finance ministry analyses both the direct and indirect impact of the second Covid wave."And as you have seen from RBI's response, the expansionary policy stance has been continued and I am sure the government will respond with necessary fiscal measures also as and when it is necessary," Kumar said.Earlier this month, the Reserve Bank left the benchmark interest rate unchanged at 4 per cent but maintained an accommodative stance to boost the economy.In 2020, the Union government had announced the 'Aatmanirbhar Bharat' package to perk up the economy and the overall stimulus was estimated to be worth around ₹27.1 lakh crore, which was more than 13 per cent of the national GDP.Regarding growth in the current financial year, Kumar said that various estimates suggest that it will be around 11 per cent.In its last policy review, the RBI projected a growth of 10.5 per cent for FY'22 while the Economic Survey, tabled in Parliament earlier this year, estimated 11 per cent growth during the year.The country's economy is projected to contract by 8 per cent in 2020-21, as per official estimates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-required-govt-to-respond-with-fiscal-steps-niti-aayog-official-on-covid19-101618727874761.html

The Covid-19 crisis is also going on. Could your Lordships please list this matter after Ramzan? It becomes problematic... I have been waiting the entire day (for the matter to reach)," the council said, according to Live Law.Following this exchange, the bench allowed the petitioner's counsel to take with him a copy of the juvenility report and inspect it, and also permitted him to file an affidavit in response to the report. The bench further directed that this exercise be carried out within three weeks and listed the SLP on May 10, 2021.Responding to this, Justice Chandrachud said, "I am sorry. You should have mentioned this in the morning and we could have adjourned the matter. Please go and relax. I admire the ability to fast for whole days without even a drop of water."During Ramzan, which is celebrated every ninth month of the Islamic calendar, Muslims observe a fast, also known as Roza.

The second time, the patient’s family even prepared for his last rites.Gorelal Kori (58), a resident of Sultania village of Vidisha district, was admitted to the district’s Atal Bihari Medical College Hospital in a critical condition on April 12, after complaining of difficulty in breathing. He was put on a ventilator on April 14.“On the evening of April 15, a nurse informed the family that my father died. We rushed inside the ward and found him alive. The staff nurse said it happened due to some miscommunication. Later, the family was informed that doctors were going to perform a surgery,” said Gorelal’s son Kailash.Also Read | Odisha makes RT-PCR test, 14 days quarantine must for all who attended Kumbh“Later, a nurse again informed us that my father died during surgery and refused to hand over his body, saying that he tested positive for Covid-19 on Thursday night.

18-04-2021||India||Deep Sidhu gets bail, held again hours later||A Delhi court on Friday granted bail to Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu in connection with the violence at Red Fort during the Republic Day farmers’ tractor rally, saying the police’s endeavour to make an example out of him for the entire sequence of events since he is a popular public figure hazards a failure of justice due to “compromised objectivity”. However, the Delhi Police arrested him again hours later, in connection with another case related to the violence during the rally.Sidhu was expected to be released after additional sessions judge Neelofar Abida Parveen granted him bail at a personal bond of ₹30,000, stating that the prosecution is yet to establish the identity of several other members of the unlawful assembly. However, he will remain in jail after his arrest in the second case, which is also being probed by the crime branch. Senior officers said he will be taken into police custody for interrogation and investigation soon.“The protest rally/parade had been authorised subject to restrictions imposed in the interest of law and order, it is the several acts of breach of specific embargoes, the violence perpetrated, the damage caused to public property and national heritage site, nuisance at a restricted site that are the subject matter of the allegations raised in the present FIR. The prosecution seeks to make an example out of the case of the accused-applicant, he being a popular public figure, such an endeavour, however hazards a failure of justice as a result of compromised objectivity,” the court said in its bail order.Also Read | 'India defeated Covid-19 last year, can do it again with faster speed’: PM Modi“The prosecution alleges involvement of thousands of offenders and it would violate and infringe the fundamental right to life and liberty guaranteed to Sidhu if he is denied bail in the present case on such nature of accusations and material only on grounds that the investigating agency is yet to establish the identity of the several other members of the unlawful assembly,” it said.The court, however, said that while in a democracy there is a right to dialogue and dissent, the registration of FIR against Sidhu is not an invasion of this fundamental right.Like the first case, the second was also registered at Kotwali police station, but on a complaint filed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI). The first case was registered on the complaint of the Kotwali station house officer. Sidhu is the first person to be arrested in the second case, the police said.Sidhu’s counsel advocate Abhishek Gupta said, “The need and timing of the arrest is extremely questionable and is a grave affront to an individual’s personal liberty, and runs foul of the rights guaranteed under Article 21.”Since the Red Fort is maintained by ASI, it filed a separate complaint detailing the damage to the monument.The Delhi Police arrested Sidhu on February 9 for his alleged involvement in the January 26 violence. The agency told the court that Sidhu was the “main instigator” and one of the rioters, a charge which Sidhu’s lawyer Abhishek Gupta vehemently denied.He told the court his client just happened to be at the wrong place at the wrong time and got to know about the flag hoisting at Red Fort from media reports.The court said the facts of the matter cannot be lost sight of and the nature of incriminating material cannot be disregarded at any cost. It said Sidhu was neither part of the tractor rally which broke barricades nor has any specific role been attributed to him in the commission of violence at Red Fort and attacking police officials on duty.The judge said the prosecution voiced a strong apprehension that Sidhu could tamper with evidence, as he also deleted data and formatted his phone apprehending arrest.“However, the prosecution’s case rests largely on the contents of video recordings and footage available and accessible to all on social media sites in public domain, and there is therefore a remote possibility of Sidhu being able to interfere with the content on such platform,” the judge said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deep-sidhu-gets-bail-held-again-hours-later-101618684794183.html

This drive was conducted against the backdrop of the standoff in Ladakh and the PLA is expected to raise more border defence regiments comprising Tibetans, the people said.Also Read | Iran offers upbeat assessment of progress in nuclear talksSecurity officials in New Delhi have been keeping a close watch on these developments, which come at a time when the disengagement process along the LAC has stalled after a limited drawdown of troops, armoured formations and artillery on the north and south banks of Pangong Lake in February.The latest meeting of senior Indian and Chinese military commanders held on April 9 ended without any forward movement on disengagement at other friction points such as Depsang, Hot Springs and Gogra, though the two sides agreed to maintain stability on the ground and avoid any new incidents.“These new recruitment drives are being held at a time when there are reports that mainstream Chinese troops from lower altitudes faced problems during their deployment in Tibet. We have intercepts showing their troops suffered from health problems such as severe mountain sickness and high altitude pulmonary oedema,” said an official.“It is also meant to send a message to India and to Tibetans in India,” the official added.According to reports in the PLA Daily, China’s military has been introducing guidelines to prevent troops serving on the Tibetan plateau from getting altitude sickness. “Altitude sickness is a common problem that has been affecting troops stationed on the plateau for a long time,” an unnamed army officer was quoted as saying by PLA Daily.Last August, India deployed the Special Frontier Force (SFF), a secret paramilitary force comprising ethnic Tibetans, for an operation to take over strategic heights on the south bank of Pangong Lake. A Tibetan soldier was killed in a landmine blast during the operation and senior Indian officials attended his funeral – the first acknowledgement of the SFF being used along the LAC and a move seen as a signal to China.The people said the special recruitment drives are meant to induct Tibetans into the PLA and not the Tibetan militia units, which play a role in patrolling, logistics and transporting supplies using mules and horses. These militia units specialise in operating at high altitudes and their training too has been intensified since last year, according to reports in China’s state media.According to China’s official statistics from 2010, there were 2.1 million Han servicemen, compared to 4,300 Tibetans. More recent figures aren’t readily available.India-based Tibet specialist Claude Arpi said altitude sickness or lack of oxygen has been an issue with the PLA. Unlike Indian soldiers, most PLA soldiers aren’t trained enough to acclimatise to high altitude.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-steps-up-drive-to-recruit-tibetans-101618685001861.html

They, however, added that a pan-ministerial proposal was yet to be considered.“As of now, departments and ministries are individually taking a call,” an official familiar with the matter said on condition of anonymity. “Some already have rolled out work from home for undersecretaries as they do not have individual cabins. Deputy secretaries and above, who have individual chambers will continue to come to work regularly.”India recorded 1,496 deaths due to Covid-19 in a single day on Saturday, setting a new record for daily deaths as bodies poured into cremation and burial grounds, with health care infrastructure across the country overwhelmed by the caseload.DoPT has already written to all ministries to ensure that employees over the age of 45 are encouraged to be vaccinated.

18-04-2021||India||Inundated, Covid-19 helplines crumble||On April 12, Waheb Hussaini’s 60-year-old mother tested positive for Covid-19. Since then, the resident of Lucknow’s Vikas Nagar has been calling the central helpline to have his mother admitted in a hospital. Till Saturday evening, he was still waiting for admission.Lucknow’s helpline is different from those in other cities because it is part of a command centre that decides who gets admitted and who doesn’t. But even in cities where hospital admissions haven’t been centralised, helplines, like all other parts of the public health infrastructure, have been overwhelmed.That shouldn’t surprise anyone given the sheer volume of cases. Delhi saw 24,375 cases on Saturday; Mumbai, 8,811, and Bengaluru, 11,404. Everything is in short supply: ambulances, remdesivir, oxygen, and ICU beds. And the calls keep coming.“It is a difficult situation and we are trying our best,” said the official in-charge of call centres in Mumbai.Dr Rajinder Rai, in-charge, of home isolation monitoring through call centre at Haryana’s Ambala, said there is so much distress that “people are crying over phone. We are trying our best, but the distress calls are very high.”The result is also long waiting times. “Phones are ringing continuously and eight to 10 people are on wait all the time,” said a volunteer at Delhi Covid helpline, who did not wished to be named. Anuradha Singh, a call centre volunteer in Lucknow, said every call is being attended and answered. “On an average, every person on duty in the helpline is attending around 300 calls a day,” said a volunteer at Prayagraj call centre, Madhu Singh, adding that 20 volunteers are working around the clock. Singh said most operators are working 13-14 hour shifts. According to Delhi government data, till March-end, the 24x7 control room was receiving a maximum of 500 calls a day, a number that has since doubled.Also Read | Every 4th sample in Delhi Covid +ve, Capital adds 24,375 new cases in 24 hoursData from helplines across Delhi, Mumbai, Lucknow and Chennai, shows that the numbers have increased by almost 400% to 1,000 % in the past week, even though the number of volunteers has stayed the same.Most users also have other issues with the helplines, whose volunteers, they accept, are doing their best.Melvin Natesan, a resident of Bengaluru’s HAL, made several calls to get a bed for his aunt and even after the bed was allocated, 30km away from patient’s home, it was not clear whether it was oxygenated. “What is frustrating is that those taking the calls didn’t even ask what her condition was, from what I understood, they were looking at the portal and allotting the hospital. There was no time or option to seek clarifications,” he said.Khyati Chheda, 32, a resident from Mumbai’s Bandra was one of the lucky few who managed to find a hospital bed through a helpline although it took him 36 hours. “I am sure authorities are doing their best, but it is still not enough ,” he said.Different cities have sought to address challenges differently.In Mumbai, for instance, the administration has decided to dedicate separate call centres for each zone in the city. In Bengaluru, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike decided to create an integrated helpline, by pooling call operators from the Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited (Bescom) to attend to a flurry of calls.Malini Aisola, a public health expert, said, “...The situation is critical at night when many patients face dip in oxygen levels.

A total of 260,813 new cases were reported across the country on Saturday, taking the total number of confirmed infections to 14.78 million.A record 1,496 new fatalities were lodged, taking the national death toll to 177,192, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.In a meeting with the cabinet secretary and secretaries of pharma and home, Modi was given a briefing on increased production capacity of life-saving drugs amid the second wave. “The Prime Minister directed that use of Remdesivir and other medicines must be in accordance with approved medical guidelines, and that their misuse and black marketing must be strictly curbed,” said an official statement.The PM reviewed the availability and supply of ventilators, oxygen and medicines and called for utilising the entire national capacity across private and public sectors to produce vaccines.The officials said that manufacturing of Remdesivir has been ramped up to provide about 7.4 million vials per month in May, while normal production output in January-February was just 2.7-2.9 million vials per month. “Supplies have increased from 67,900 vials on 11th April going up to over 2,06,000 vials on 15th April 2021 which are being particularly focused on states with high caseload and high demand,” said the statement.The statistics surrounding the outbreak are alarming. Daily cases in India crossed 150,000 for the first time last Saturday – this means it took only one week for the country to start reporting an additional 100,000 cases.While the PM spoke about the “need to utilise the full potential of India’s pharmaceutical industry to meet the rising demand of various medicines”, he said that there was no substitute the testing, tracking and treatment. “Early testing and proper tracking Remains key to reduce mortality and local administrations need to be proactive and sensitive to people’s concerns.”The PM also asked for ensuring coordination with states and all necessary measures to ramp up the availability of hospital beds for Covid-19 patients and that the latter can be achieved through additional supply of beds through temporary hospitals and isolation centres.Modi said that installation of approved medical oxygen plants should be sped up.“162 PSA Oxygen plants are being installed in 32 States/UTs from PM CARES. The officers informed that 1 lakh cylinders are being procured & they will be supplied to states soon,” said the statement.Saturday was the sixth day in a row that India set a new record for the most new cases reported in a day.In the last two weeks, there were only two days that the country’s daily case tally did not break an all-time record – April 5 and April 12, both Mondays, which see daily numbers drop due to low testing the day before (Sunday).The daily average of 203,881 cases registered over the last week was also a record, and was more than twice what India reported during the worst of the first wave in the country – the seven-day average of daily cases peaked at 93,617 for the week ending September 16, 2020, during the first wave.With HTC inputs in New Delhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-reviews-covid-situation-as-india-logs-over-260k-cases-101618684581846.html

It is understood that during his France visit, Air Chief Bhadauria will visit a French Rafale squadron, meet his counterpart Philippe Lavigne and visit the newly established Space Command in Paris.The arrival of the six Rafale jets, flagged by IAF chief Rakesh Bhadauria, will raise the number of the Omni-role fighters with the IAF to 20 of the 36 contracted Rafale jets to India. “The six fighters will fly to Ambala airbase, from where the fighters will be repurposed for the formation of a second squadron at Hasimara,” said a senior air force officer.The formation of a second Rafale squadron at Hasimara will add teeth to India’s aerial capability with Hercules C-130 J airlift squadron based in Panagarh in the northern part of West Bengal. Given the location of both the squadrons on the gates of Siliguri corridor, the IAF will have the power to counter any offensive from the north in the eastern sector, particularly in Sikkim and Arunachal Pradesh.According to Dassault Aviation officials, another batch of four Rafale jets will fly to India in May. In addition to these 24, which will be with the IAF in India, the aviation giant has handed over seven more Rafale fighters that are used for training IAF officers in France. By May-end, only five more fighters are to be handed over by Dassault to complete the full package of 36 aircraft.There is a huge potential to strengthen defence cooperation between India and France since Paris does not impose any condition to any military sales or joint development with India. It is also in this context that Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to travel to France after wrapping up the India-European Union Summit in Portugal on May 7.France is the only country with a well-developed military industry that has no defence dealings with Pakistan or China and has bilateral convergence in Indo-Pacific and space cooperation.France’s ties with Pakistan have hit a new low with Islamists groups like Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan seeking retribution for remarks by President Emmanuel Macron they consider “blasphemous”. There have been suggestions that the belligerence of Islamists in Pakistan can force Paris to downgrade ties with Islamabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-rakesh-bhadauria-to-flag-off-6-rafale-fighters-from-france-on-april-21-101618642400474.html

Hence, our Akhada is declaring the conclusion of the Mahakumbh for all of our seers,” Giri said on Saturday afternoon.He also urged pilgrims to come in fewer numbers.Giri said that a large number of seers have already started to leave the Mela : “Traditionally the fourth Shahi Snan is attended mainly by the seers of three Bairagi Akhadas; for the remaining 10 Akhadas including Juna the Mahakumbh ends on the third Sahi Snan of Mesh Sankranti or Baisakhi which was on April 14 this year.”The chief of one of the Bairagi Akhadas expressed “unhappiness over the PM calling the Juna Akhada chief and not” one of the chiefs of the three.Mahant Baba Hatyogi of Digambar Ani Bairagi Akhada who was former national spokesperson of the governing body of all Akhadas, Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parisad,criticised the Niranjani, Atal and Juna Akhadas.Also read: Covid-19 vaccination - 4 suggestions in Odisha CM Patnaik’s letter to PM Modi“Swami Avdeshanand Giri and Mahant Ravindra Puri of the aforementioned Akhadas are not representatives of all the Akhadas especially Baiaragi Akhadas. It would have been better if PM Modi had directly spoken to the Bairagi Akhadas which have the main stake in the last Shahi Snan. For other Akhadas, the Baisakhi Shahi Snan is the main one,” said Baba Hatyogi.However, HT learns that home minister Amit Shah spoke with Mahant Rajendra Das, the head of the Akhil Bharatiya Sri Panch Nirmohi Akhada, one of the three, who said all Covid-19 guidelines will be followed for the Shahi Snan, and numbers kept to a minimum.The Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad also clarified that the Mahakumbh “won’t be curtailed.”“It will be held till the completion of its designated period on April 30 as it has been held traditionally since centuries. However, amid the Covid-19 surge, we seers are committed to adhere to the Covid-19 safety norms,” said Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri.On Saturday, at least 175 people tested positive in the Mela area with the Haridwar district reporting a total of 617 new cases.Earlier in the day, Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat and Kumbh Mela force officers- inspector general Sanjay Gunjyal and SSP Janmejaya Khanduri met Mahamandleshwar Avdheshanand Giri at his ashram during which they “thanked the seers for their cooperation in the two big Shahi Snans on April 12 and 14.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahakumbh-should-now-be-symbolic-says-modi-amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-101618641620129.html
