Principal Secretary, department of health, Prataya Amrit was also present at the meeting to inform him about the latest situation.The Raj Bhawan secretariat will establish contact with the participants.On Friday, after a high-level review meeting with the top brass of the state administration on the Covid-19 situation, chief minister Nitish Kumar had said that the government would soon contact the Governor to request him to call an all-party meeting, as suggest by Prime Minister Narendra Modi during an interaction with chief ministers. The government placed its request before the Governor within a day.Leader of Opposition Tejashwi Prasad Yadav has often been attacking the government for not setting up an all-party committee to monitor the Covid-19 situation in the state despite agreement on it in the Bihar Assembly during the one-day session amidst the pandemic last year. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar had proposed a committee till the end of the tenure of his previous government.According to people familiar with the development in the government, the rapidly rising Covid-19 graph, especially since the return of migrants during Holi and the grim situation in Maharashtra and some other states, requires greater caution and awareness among the masses and the political parties could play a big role in reaching out to the people with the right message, especially regarding the basic guidelines.“Wearing masks is the most important requirement, but people still seem to take it lightly, putting themselves and their near and dear ones at risk and also contributing to the spread of the virus. As doctors also say, prevention is better than cure in case of Covid-19 and that is what everyone should try to follow. With the flood situation also approaching, it could be double whammy for Bihar and therefore, the state needs to be prepared,” they added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-governor-phagu-chouhan-calls-all-party-meet-on-april-17-to-tackle-covid19-101618073908130.html

10-04-2021||India||India tells China disengagement must for de-escalation of conflict||At the latest 11th round of military talks with China in eastern Ladakh to reduce tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the Indian Army told the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) that completion of disengagement at all friction points on the disputed border would set the stage for the two sides to “consider de-escalation of forces, ensure full restoration of peace and tranquility, and enable progress in bilateral relations,” the Indian Army said a day after the talks.The two armies had a detailed exchange of views for the resolution of the remaining issues related to disengagement along the LAC, army spokesperson Colonel Aman Anand said on Saturday.India and China have been locked in a standoff in the Ladakh sector for over 11 months and are currently negotiating a withdrawal of troops and weapons from friction points on the disputed border. The 11th round of talks took place on the Indian side of the Chushul-Moldo meeting point on Friday and went on for 13 hours.The focus of current military talks is on negotiating the next steps of a complex disengagement process that was completed in Pangong Tso in mid-February with the pull back of front-line troops and weapons. The Indian Army is focussing on resolving outstanding problems with the PLA at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang.“The two sides agreed on the need to resolve the outstanding issues in an expeditious manner in accordance with the existing agreements and protocols…The two sides agreed that it was important to take guidance from the consensus of their leaders, continue their communication and dialogue and work towards a mutually acceptable resolution of the remaining issues at the earliest,” Anand said. He added that the two armies also agreed to jointly maintain stability on the ground and avoid any new incidents.It is good that both sides continue to engage each other, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).“The Indian side has clearly linked the de-escalation of forces and full restoration of peace with disengagement in remaining areas. We will have to now see what the Chinese response is. That will give some indication of how things go forward,” Hooda added. There was no official statement from the Chinese side when this report was filed.While disengagement began and ended in the Pangong Lake sector in less than 10 days, it appears to have lost its initial momentum going by the lack of progress at other friction points on the LAC.The PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Gogra and Hot Springs, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The 10th round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies took place on February 20 after the completion of disengagement on strategic heights on both banks of Pangong Tso. Both sides pulled back their frontline troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns under the disengagement agreement.At a marathon 16-hour meeting between senior commanders on February 20, the Indian and Chinese armies agreed to resolve outstanding issues at friction points on the LAC in a “steady and orderly” manner and were unanimous that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided “a good basis” for resolving pending problems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-tells-china-disengagement-must-for-de-escalation-of-conflict-101618065624783.html

If the Centre's direct benefit transfer scheme is implemented, it will destroy farmers," General Secretary of the Majdoor Union, Punjab told ANI.Farmers' markets in the state wore a deserted look as commission agents and farmers staged the protest, despite the state government's announcement of the start of procurement of produce.Punjab Food and Supplies Minister, Bharat Bhushan Ashu, in Ludhiana, meanwhile, said, "Commission agents have called off their strike over direct benefit transfer to farmers. The procurement process will be started now at Rajpura mandi. The farmers will get payments in their accounts."Earlier this week, Punjab Chief Minister Captain Amarinder Singh had flayed the Central government for "encroaching upon the rights of the states in its bid to dominate them," while castigating it a one-sided decision to forcibly impose the farm laws and the Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) on the state's farming community.States never faced such problems earlier, the Chief Minister said, slamming the government for attempting to "destroy the existing relations and systems in the name of so-called reforms, which they were trying to impose without taking the stakeholders into confidence."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/punjab-farmers-protest-against-centre-s-direct-benefit-scheme-101618062255192.html

10-04-2021||India||Customs interrogates Kerala Speaker in dollar smuggling case||Kerala legislative assembly speaker P Sreeramakrishnan was questioned by customs officials on Saturday at his official residence in connection with the dollar smuggling case. Later his private flat in the state capital was also searched. Earlier the customs department had served several notices to him to appear before the agency but he failed citing many reasons. Customs officials later confirmed this and said the questioning went on for five hours. The dollar smuggling case pertains to the alleged smuggling of ₹1.30 crore by a former head of the finance department of the UAE Consulate at the state capital, to Muscat in Oman. The Speaker was questioned on the basis of statements given by the two main accused in the gold smuggling case Swapna Suresh and Sandeep Nair. They reportedly told officials that the speaker was close to many officials of the Consulate. After the gold smuggling case surfaced last July, there were reports allegedly linking the main accused Suresh with the Speaker. He later admitted that he knew Suresh as an employee of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) Consulate and attended some functions on her invitation. But the opposition Congress and BJP alleged that it was more than an ‘official relationship’ and that Sreeramakrishnan had travelled with Suresh several times to West Asian countries and he had invested heavily in an educational group in one of the Middle-Eastern countries. They also alleged the accused smuggled US dollars to the Gulf countries using Sreeramakrishnan’s green channel access. They said that a major portion of the smuggled US dollars was commission obtained from various projects in the state. But the Speaker had denied all these allegations. Sreeramakrishnan also refuted a report circulating on some social media sites that he attempted suicide. “I am not the one who takes respite in death. I am not a coward,” he said in a Facebook post saying some people were busy churning out malicious stories.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/customs-interrogates-kerala-speaker-in-dollar-smuggling-case-101618062264437.html

Here's a list||India is facing two of its worst possible crisis during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic—record spikes in daily cases of Covid-19 and what several states have claimed a shortage of vaccine against the viral disease. Several states have reached out to the Centre for assistance as many claimed that their stocks will only last for a few days. Responding to the requests and concerns, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan has said the country has enough doses and urged state governments to put an end to “fear-mongering.”States like Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand complained that they are facing a shortage of vaccines, while reports emerged from several other states that vaccine centres were shutting early or turning people away due to supplies running out.India's severely-hit state of Maharashtra—which reports the country's highest cases and deaths—was the first to flag the vaccine shortage. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday said the state is facing a Covid-19 vaccine crunch and demanded 40 lakh doses every week from the Centre. The state reported 58,993 new Covid-19 cases, 45,391 recoveries, and 301 deaths on Friday. Maharashtra alone accounts for 51.23 per cent of the total active cases in the country, according to the health ministry.MaharashtraMaharashtra minister Aslam Shaikh on Saturday said that the state received the least number of vaccines and a majority of vaccination centres were facing closure due to a shortage of doses.PunjabPunjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh joined the list of state heads talking about the dwindling vaccine doses on Saturday and said that its stock will only last for three days. "Punjab is left with only five days of supply (5.7 lakh Covid-19 vaccine doses) at the current levels of vaccinating 85000-90000 persons a day. If the state is able to meet its target of 2 lakh vaccines a day, then its current supplies will last only three days," Singh said during the meeting, news agency ANI reported.RajasthanRajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot also said the shortage of vaccines was a reality during a virtual meeting chaired by Congress chief Sonia Gandhi with leaders of states ruled by the party to take a view on their ongoing efforts against the coronavirus pandemic.

Speaking to reporters about the situation of vaccine stock, Panigrahi said, "We have 3.2 lakh doses of Covishield and 1 lakh doses of Covaxin in Odisha. With this stock, we can continue vaccination for two days. We expect to receive more vaccine doses from the Government of India within two days."In Thursday's meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, chief minister Naveen Patnaik had asked the Centre to supply 10 days stock of 25 lakh vaccine doses.Andhra PradeshThe list of states also includes Andhra Pradesh, which sent an SOS to the Centre seeking immediate supply of at least one crore doses of the coronavirus vaccine and said its current stock would last no more than two days. Health officials on Thursday informed chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy that the state currently has just three lakh doses of the vaccine while on average 1.4 lakh people were being inoculated per day.There were over one crore people above 45 years in the state to be inoculated but a shortage of vaccine has become a cause for concern, news agency PTI reported.JharkhandJharkhand is facing a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines and is only left with stock for a couple of days, health minister Banna Gupta had said on Thursday. "We have stock for the next 1-2 days.

Now the second wave has begun, farmers and their unions should follow Covid-19 protocol. They should postpone the protest and have discussions with us,” news agency ANI quoted Tomar as saying.The agriculture minister also assured that the Centre is ready for further rounds of talks to discuss the three laws with the protesting farmers. “Many farmers unions, economists are supporting the agriculture bills but some farmers are protesting against them.

During the eleventh round of talks on January 22, the Centre had proposed to stall the farm laws for a period of 12 to 18 months, but the farmers’ unions maintained their stance and rejected the proposal. Instead, they demanded a complete repeal of the laws and a legal guarantee on the minimum support price (MSP).Tomar also said that the unions are protesting despite the government’s offer to hold talks. “We offered to discuss problematic areas and make changes in them. Farmer unions did not accept and did not give a reason. Agitation continues either when [the] government is not ready to talk or when [the] union doesn't get [a] favourable response. Here unions decided to continue it anyway,” the minister said.Thousands of farmers have been protesting at Delhi’s borders against the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020; the Farmers Empowerment and Protection Agreement on Price Assurance and farm Services Act 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act since November last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-must-follow-covid-19-protocol-defer-protests-narendra-tomar-101618058992694.html

We have already imposed a curfew for 10 hours in a day to restrict the unnecessary movement of people," Rupani said when asked if the government was thinking of clamping a lockdown in view of the rising cases.Rupani was speaking to reporters after flagging off 20 new 'Dhanvantari' vans which will conduct coronavirus tests in public places and also suggest treatment."If any market association imposes a lockdown at a local level or if any village imposes such a measure, it is welcome to do so," the chief minister said.Amid the upswing in cases, many villages, housing societies and market organisations in Gujarat have declared lockdowns in their respective areas.The market organisation of Sola road in Ahmedabad has also decided to impose a lockdown on Saturday and Sunday to break the chain of transmission.A 'janta' curfew for two days is also observed in Palanpur city, but some traders kept their shops open.With the latest addition of 4,541 fresh COVID-19 cases, the tally of cases in Gujarat reached 3,37,015 on Friday, as per the state health department.Meanwhile, the CM denied reports that the state government was hiding the true data on the count of fatalities caused by the COVID-19 infection."As per the guidelines of the ICMR, if a comorbid patient dies then a committee of experts decides the primary and secondary causes of such death. If that committee identifies the main cause of the death as a heart attack then even though the patient was infected, such death is not counted as caused by coronavirus. The same system is followed in the entire country," he said.As per the state health government, Gujarat's overall Covid-19 toll stood at 4,697 as on Friday.Rupani further said the state government has made arrangements for hospital beds, oxygen, Remdesivir injections and other facilities to treat patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-government-not-in-favour-of-lockdown-cm-rupani-101618053893298.html

If that is the reason, Kerala CM has to come clean on reasons why he is unable to take any action against Jaleel," he further said."The nepotism in the appointment of Jaleel's relative in a government post clearly brings out large scale corruption in the government of Kerala", he said adding that in spite of all this the Kerala law minister tried to justify Jaleel's side."This shows the double standard that Chief Minister has been practising. What is the special privilege that Jaleel enjoys which has not been given to the senior ministers of CPI(M)?" he asked.Muraleedharan listed out alleged instances of Pinarayi Vijayan coming to Jaleel's rescue citing, "The Chief Minister has been very eager to justify Jaleel when Enforcement Directorate questioned him for almost 8 hours. He did not care to ask the minister what was the close relationship that he had with the consulate of a foreign country in Thiruvanathapuram.""When issues related to abnormalities in the Adalat he conducted personally at Technical University came to light, When issues related to the land acquisition of Malayalam University and when Christian community has complained that minority benefits are not reaching them, the chief Minister justified Jaleel," he added.The Lokayukta on Friday found KT Jaleel, guilty of 'allegations of abuse of power, favouritism, nepotism and violation of Oath of Office' and ordered that he should 'not continue to hold the post held by him as a Member of the Council of Ministers.'The findings by the Lokayukta Justice Cyriac Joseph and Upa Lokayukta Harul Ul Rashid are based on a complaint against the Minister, which accused him of misusing his office to appoint his relative KT Adeeb as general manager in the Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation Limited.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-v-muraleedharan-questions-kerala-cm-s-silence-on-lokayukta-verdict-against-minister-kt-jaleel-101618052133222.html

The meeting presided over by the Congress president was also attended by the ministers of Congress’s alliance states.While speaking on the resurgence of Covid-19 cases in the country, Sonia Gandhi remarked that it was their responsibility as the principal opposition party to highlight the issues of vaccine unavailability in the country and push the government to desist from PR tactics and act in the interest of the people.Also read | Punjab, Rajasthan join list of states facing vaccine shortageDemanding more transparency to be brought into the Covid statistics, the 74-year old leader said, “Governments must reveal the actual numbers of infections and deaths across states, whether Congress ruled or otherwise.”Reiterating the earlier concern of Rahul Gandhi on the export of vaccines, she stressed that India’s foremost priority should be to vaccinate the Indian nationals first.“We must focus on India’s vaccination drive first and foremost, then only export vaccines and gift them to other countries,” she said while advocating for responsible Covid appropriate behaviour.Resolving to be constructive and cooperative with the Central government, Gandhi also asked the Congress-led states to take strict measures so that the pandemic does not go out of control.She stressed upon the Chief Ministers of the Congress led states and the ministers in alliance led states to ensure testing on a large scale apart from preparation of adequate facilities along with setting up the temporary ones.Holding the BJP government responsible for the mismanagement of the Covid-19 situation by allowing a shortage of vaccines in the country due to exports, she held that Congress has also been irresponsible to some extent by allowing mass gatherings for the elections.“We need to accept this responsibility and keep the interest of the nation above our own,” Gandhi said.Gandhi also added as the restrictions were becoming harder and more stringent, it was everyone’s responsibility to support those who face the brunt of reduced economic activity.Watch | BJP counters Rahul Gandhi over 'vaccine shortage' claim, Congress fires back﻿Wayanad MP Rahul Gandhi who was also a part of the meet had yesterday requested the Union government to lend a direct income support to the vulnerable sections of society in these difficult times due to the pandemic.While assessing the vulnerability of public gatherings for the elections, she also questioned the Chief Ministers on the Covid-19 situations in their respective states.“What are our states doing to ensure availability of oxygen, ventilators and other facilities as the pandemic grows?” she asked while inquiring about the availability of the vaccines, oxygen ventilators and other facilities in the Congress-led states.Seeking the views of the Chief Ministers on the economic fallout, lockdown and the central government’s response to demands of states, Mrs Gandhi said, “Various packages had been announced by the Central government to help MSMEs and stimulate the economy. What impact have these packages had and what more should the Government be doing to deal with the continuing crisis? Do you see economic recovery happening in the manner that is being officially claimed?”On the subject of the farmer agitation that has been going on for over five months, Gandhi asked the Chief Ministers to brief her about the latest situation in their respective states and also asked for their views on state bills passed against the farm laws which have failed to receive the presidential nod.“What more should we do on it, even though the key to the solution lies with the Centre which has created the problem in the first place?” she inquired.Rahul Gandhi who was also a part of the meet expressed his deep concern over the second wave of Covid-19 in the country. He asked for a strenuous approach to be put in to identify new mutations leading to the second wave and called for joining hands instead of being complacent and declaring premature victories over the virus.Also read | ‘Allergic to good suggestion!’: Rahul Gandhi’s another jibe at Centre over Covid-19 vaccineHe also reiterated the demand for basic income support for disadvantaged groups as they were attacked by the virus more harshly.Chief Minister of Punjab Capt Amrinder Singh while pointing out the vaccine shortage in the country said that only a vaccine stock of three days was left with them and there was no assurance from the Centre about the further supply of vaccines yet.Speaking about the rise in Covid-19 cases, Rajasthan CM Ashok Gehlot said that the shortage of vaccines was a reality and the Union government should take states on board as stakeholders and not as their adversaries.Jharkhand minister Rameshwar Oraon who was also attending the meeting enlisted a number of measures that should be undertaken to deal with the Covid-19 crisis, while Maharashtra minister Balasaheb Thorat said that there was an urgent need of almost 1200 ventilators and more Remdesivir injections in that state.Thorat said that their state could vaccinate as many as 5 lakh people daily only if the Central government supplied them with the vaccine. “Our vaccinations centres will otherwise shut down,” he concluded.Inputs by Umar Sofi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-meets-cms-of-congress-led-states-reviews-covid-19-crisis-101618053323763.html

Businesses are also suffering losses there as everything is closing down. We will come back once the situation is better," he said.Surendra Yadav, an auto driver in Mumbai who left for his hometown in Jharkhand, said that last year when the lockdown was imposed, he along with his family rushed back to his hometown, but when the situation got better, he left his family and came back to Mumbai in January."Now again the Covid-19 cases are rapidly increasing in Mumbai. Many people are returning to their homes from Mumbai. I didn't know if I'll ever return," he said.Arjun Yadav, another auto driver from Mumbai who is also going back to Jharkhand, said though traffic movement is not restricted in Mumbai, people rarely leave their homes due to the rise in Covid-19 cases."Everything is being shut down in Mumbai due to the rise in Covid-19 cases. Last year when the lockdown was imposed it was very difficult for us to leave the state. That is why this year most people are leaving before lockdown is announced and we are again stranded there. I'm an auto driver. Though lockdown has not been imposed and traffic movement is allowed, there are no passengers. We were not earning enough to buy food," he said.Arjun added that because there was a lot of rush in trains he had left the state in his auto-rickshaw.Maharashtra reported 58,993 new Covid-19 cases, 45,391 recoveries, and 301 deaths on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-leave-maharashtra-as-fear-of-lockdown-looms-101618032858980.html
10-04-2021||India||Sonia Gandhi writes to Prakash Javadekar, asks him not to implement Ken-Betwa project||Congress president Sonia Gandhi has written to Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar, asking him not to implement the existing Ken-Betwa river linking project, the first of its kind programme in India. In her letter dated April 2, Gandhi argued that over the past decade, the Panna tiger reserve has been revived with great difficulties and now the park is considered an outstanding example of translocation and successful breeding. A reaction to Gandhi’s letter is awaited. “It is now threatened by the river linking project and the state government’s open estimate is that around 40% of the area of the tiger reserve will be irretrievably damaged,” Gandhi wrote, pointing that around 18 lakh trees would be removed from the submergence area and “there would be a serious question over the basic issue of water availability itself for the proposed transfer.”“I request you to ensure that this project in its present shape and form does not get implemented. I gather PILs are pending both in the NGT and the Supreme Court. Many conservationists in Madhya Pradesh and indeed from across the country have called for the abandonment of the project,” she wrote. Last month, Union jal shakti minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat signed a tripartite agreement with the states of Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh on the occasion of World Water Day to start the work on India’s first major river interlinking project that will connect the Ken and the Betwa Rivers. The Memorandum of Agreement (MoA) was signed almost 18 years after the idea of the project was conceived owing to disagreement between the two states over sharing of water. Madhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said the project will help in irrigating at least 1 million hectares of land and people of nine districts of the state will benefit from it.A 73.8-meter-high dam proposed on Ken at Daudhan in Madhya Pradesh’s Chhattarpur district. Both of the rivers are rain-fed and are tributaries of the Yamuna. The project, which is estimated to take eight years to complete, has an estimated cost of ₹35,111.24 crore.The project was conceptualised in the 1980s but the water-sharing agreement could not be reached between the two states. The work on the project was originally slated to begin in 2015 but only got a fresh push last year with the government making a revised deal with the two states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-gandhi-writes-to-prakash-javadekar-asks-him-not-to-implement-ken-betwa-project-101618029802367.html

We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the government of the USA through diplomatic channels," the MEA added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pentagon-defends-us-navy-ship-asserting-navigational-rights-inside-india-s-eez-101618028140454.html

10-04-2021||India||‘Arbitrary, coercive’: Karti Chidambaram challenges constitutional validity of PMLA||Former Union finance minister P Chidambaram’s son and Congress MP Karti Chidambaram has challenged the constitutional validity of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) In his petition, reviewed by HT. Chidambaram said the investigation, interrogation, raids, arrests and trials carried out by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under this law are “arbitrary, unreasonable and coercive”. The central agency didn’t respond to HT’s email query on the matter. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) arrested Karti Chidambaram on February 28, 2018, in the INX Media case while his father and former Union finance minister P Chidambaram’s dramatic arrest took place from his Jor Bagh residence in New Delhi on August 21, 2019. Both the CBI and the ED filed charge sheets in October 2019 and June 2020 respectively alleging irregularities in giving FIPB (foreign investment promotion board) approval to the media house and subsequent laundering crores of rupees. The ED had alleged that ₹3.09 crore were given to companies associated with Karti Chidambaram by INX Media founder Peter Mukherjea. The central agency attached several properties worth ₹54 crore belonging to Karti Chidambaram in India and abroad. Both are currently out on bail. Kapil Sibal and Advocate Arshdeep Singh, appearing for Karti in the Supreme Court on Thursday, sought to declare the entire PMLA, as amended in 2019, as unconstitutional, ultra vires and void saying, “the entire procedure of investigation and trial under PMLA is totally arbitrary, unreasonable, fails to satisfy the principles of due process and hence violative of and unconstitutional under Articles 14, 19, 20 and 21 of the Constitution of India”. “Consequently, the whole of PMLA is liable to be declared unconstitutional and void,” the petition stated. In his petition, reviewed by HT, Karti Chidambaram has stated the PMLA has unregulated and arbitrary procedure because “the ED doesn’t wait for predicate investigating agency to investigate the predicate crime and arrives at prime facie conclusion that an offence (relating to the predicate offence) may have been committed”. The petition accuses the ED of not following provisions of Chapter XII of Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) saying the anti-money laundering probe agency doesn’t send the copy of the ECIR (Enforcement case Information Report) – equivalent to First Information Report (FIR) – to the trial court having jurisdiction over the case; neither is the copy of the ECIR is given to the person named in it. The petition adds the ED and its investigating officers do not maintain a case diary and while examining or arresting a person, it compels him/her to sign the statement irrespective of its accuracy, failing which the person is threatened with a penalty. Asserting how the ED overreaches its authority under the PMLA, the petition claimed the agency doesn’t have jurisdiction to investigate a predicate offence and it can only probe ‘proceeds of crime’. “However, in practice, the authorities under PMLA take upon themselves the jurisdiction to investigate the predicate offence and reach a conclusion whether the predicate offence has been committed or not,” it further added. Karti Chidambaram has further challenged the procedure of attachment, adjudication and possession of properties by the ED, which he argues are done “on the belief of [ED] officer only, even when predicate offence is under investigation and no charges sheet has been filed”. Subsequently, he has argued that the ED doesn’t send any report of search and seizure to the magistrate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/arbitrary-coercive-karti-chidambaram-challenges-constitutional-validity-of-pmla-101618026742164.html

This is the fifth time since the beginning of the pandemic in 2020 that India's 24-hour tally crossed the 1 lakh-mark. On April 5, there were 1,03,558 fresh infections, while on April 7, 1,15,736 infections were reported. On April 8 and 9, the 24-hour tallies were 1,26,789 and 1,31,968, respectively.With Saturday's rise, the active cases in the country crossed the 10 lakh-mark and reached 10,46,631, which is 7.93 per cent of the total cases. Daily fatalities too registered a rise as 794 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours.Covid-19 in India: Active cases hit 1 million first time since SeptemberFor the first time since September, the number of active coronavirus cases crossed the 10 lakh-mark on Saturday. On September 20, 2020, there were more than 10 lakh cases, as the country at that time was reeling under the peak of the first wave of the pandemic.The number of active cases saw a sharp decline in January as more and more people recovered from the infection and with the virus being effectively contained, there were fewer daily cases. On February 12, there were 1,25,926 active Covid-19 cases. The addition of 9 lakh active cases to the cycle in only two months is worrying as it suggests that the infection is spreading rapidly, while the recovery rate is not being able to keep up. The gap between daily infections and daily recoveries too confirms the disparity as against 1,45,384 new infections, India recorded 77,567 discharges in the last 24 hours.Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh are contributing the highest number of daily cases to the tally. On Friday, Chhattisgarh reported 11,447 new infection in its highest ever spike, and Maharashtra reported 58,993 new cases.In the last 24 hours, over 11 lakh samples have been tested, which is lower than Friday's count as over 13 lakh tests were done between Thursday and Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-1-45-lakh-new-covid-19-infections-in-24-hrs-india-breaks-all-past-records-101618026295817.html
10-04-2021||India||Maharashtra weekend restrictions begin today; Rajesh Tope, Vijay Wadettiwar want longer lockdown||As Maharashtra enters the first weekend lockdown of this year on Saturday, amid protests by traders and opposition by a few political parties, state ministers think the present situation of the state needs longer and stricter lockdown. Both health minister Rajesh Tope and relief and rehabilitation minister Vijay Wadettiwar on Friday said more restrictions are needed in the state, though they personally may not favour a lockdown.To lock down or not has remained a contentious issue in Maharashtra since February when the state started seeing a spike in the number of daily cases. Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray said he personally does not favour lockdown as economy suffers, but after a series of consultation with experts and several stakeholders, the government imposed night curfew and weekend lockdown across the state, apart from closing all sea-beaches, shops dealing with non-essential products and services.Maharashtra weekend lockdown: Are liquor shops, dhabas open? Govt answersVijay Wadettiwar on Friday said a three-week long lockdown is required in the state to bring the coronavirus cases under control, news agency PTI reported. "We need to bring curbs on the movement of railways and stop crowding in public places to prevent the community spread and save people's lives," Wadettiwar said.On the same lines, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Friday said a "complete lockdown" of two to three weeks is required in the state to improve the health infrastructure, PTI reported."We would need a complete lockdown for 15 days to three weeks even though I am not in favour of that immediately. If hospitals are overwhelmed, if there is a shortage of medicines and if the government is unable to cope with the growing number of patients then such a step can be taken," Tope said.Maharashtra has been hit hard in the second wave of the pandemic, more than the first wave in last year. The state is seeing a steady rise in the number of daily infections and is now recording over 55,000 new infections daily. On Friday, the state reported 58,993 new infections.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-weekend-restriction-starts-today-ministers-bat-for-longer-lockdown-101618025727352.html

10-04-2021||India||India, China discuss next steps of disengagement||India and China on Friday held yet another round of military dialogue in eastern Ladakh to reduce tensions along the Line of Actual Control (LAC), where both sides have been locked in a standoff for over 11 months and are currently negotiating a withdrawal of troops and weapons from friction points on the disputed border, officials familiar with the developments said.The talks began at 10:30am on the Indian side of the Chushul-Moldo meeting point and were on when this report was filed on Friday night. The focus of current military talks is on negotiating the next steps of a complex disengagement process that was completed in Pangong Tso in mid-February with the pull back of front-line troops and weapons, the officials said. India’s aim to restore the status on LAC to what it was in April 2020.The 11th round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers was expected to focus on outstanding problems with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang, as reported by Hindustan Times on Friday. A joint statement on the talks could be issued in a day or two, said one of the officials cited above.Also Read| Talks with India to resolve LAC tension not delayed: ChinaWhile disengagement began and ended in the Pangong Lake sector in less than 10 days, it appears to have lost its initial momentum going by the lack of progress at other friction points on LAC.“I think we need to put constant pressure on the Chinese to get them to agree to restore status quo ante. It appears that we are satisfied with the Pangong Tso agreement and considering other areas as predating the current standoff. This will only make resolution of Depsang difficult,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd).The PLA’s deployments in Depsang have hindered access of Indian soldiers to routes including the ones leading to Patrolling Points (PP) 10, 11, 11-A, 12 and 13.The Indian Army’s patrolling activity has also been affected in Gogra and Hot Springs, where rival troops are forward deployed and where skeletal disengagement took place last year, but the gains could not be consolidated.The 10th round of talks between corps commander-ranked officers of the two armies took place on February 20 after the completion of disengagement on strategic heights on both banks of Pangong Tso. Both sides pulled back their frontline troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns under the disengagement agreement.Also Read| China capable of launching cyber attacks, disrupting systems: CDS RawatAt a marathon 16-hour meeting between senior commanders on February 20, the Indian and Chinese armies agreed to resolve outstanding issues at friction points on the LAC in a “steady and orderly” manner and were unanimous that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided “a good basis” for resolving pending problems.On March 12, Indian and Chinese diplomats agreed to ensure stability along the LAC in the Ladakh sector and to convene the 11th meeting of senior military commanders soon to take forward disengagement and de-escalation at friction points on the disputed border.Those outcomes were agreed upon during a virtual meeting of the Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs between the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-discuss-next-steps-of-disengagement-101618009975956.html

If this period is narrowed down to the past week, then the country has added more than 55,205 active cases to its tally every single day on average, another all-time record.On Friday, for the fourth day running, India set a new record for new Covid-19 infections as 144,923 new cases were reported, while 773 daily deaths were lodged. India’s overall caseload now has reached 13.2 million – the third-highest after the United States and Brazil – and 168,487 people have lost their lives to the disease so far, according to HT’s dashboard.The national seven-day average of new cases is now at 115,948, currently the highest in any country in the world making India the world’s largest Covid-19 hot spot nation. India’s total number of infections is currently on pace to soon overtake Brazil’s caseload of 13.28 million.The last time the country had more than a million active cases was on September 20 last year, at a time when the first wave was raging at its peak. With the first wave coming under control, this number then steadily dropped for six months, and touched to a low of around 137,000 on February 11. However, with the start of the second wave, this receding has now reversed, and the active caseload is now rising at a level that has never been recorded before in the year of the outbreak in India.Active cases – those Covid patients still under treatment – is a crucial metric representing the country’s battle against the viral disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in a region and shows the number of people who are currently carrying the virus.Maharashtra, the country’s worst-hit region, alone has 536,063 active cases, accounting for 51% of all such cases in the country as on Friday. Chhattisgarh is at the second spot with 76,868 active cases (7% of the national active caseload), followed by Karnataka with 58,084 such infections.At least six states and Union territories – Chandigarh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra and Punjab – have so far surpassed their peaks during the first wave. Meanwhile, cases in several other states such as Delhi, Karnataka, Kerala, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Tamil Nadu, Odisha, Rajasthan and Goa are rising dangerously close to their previous peaks. On Thursday, five states – Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh – set new single-day records for daily infections. For Uttar Pradesh, Friday was the second day in a row that it crossed its previous record of daily cases. On Thursday, the state reported 8,474 new cases, while on Friday it recorded 9,587 cases.The resurgence of cases has pushed several state governments across the country to reintroduce lockdown-like curbs on social movement in an attempt to bring cases in control. Authorities in Maharashtra have imposed a weekend lockdown which came into effect on Friday evening. In Chhattisgarh, the capital district Raipur, is under a 10-day lockdown, while Delhi and its adjoining satellite towns of Noida and Ghaziabad are all under a night curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-in-india-active-cases-hit-1-million-first-time-since-september-101618002453625.html
10-04-2021||India||Kerala minister K T Jaleel not fit to continue in power, says Lokayukta||The Kerala Lokayukta on Friday found Kerala Higher Education Minister K T Jaleel guilty of abuse of power, favouritism and violation of oath of office and ruled that he has no right to continue in the council of ministers. The verdict against the controversial minister, who was also questioned several times in connection with import of dry dates and holy books by central agencies, came on a complaint regarding the appointment of his relative KT Adeeb as the general manager of the Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation Limited in 2018. There was a big uproar when Adeeb was appointed allegedly flouting all norms and later he was forced to resign. Later a lawyer V K Mohammad Shafi had field a compliant with the Lokayukta which on Friday agreed with the contention of the petitioner. “The action of the respondent (Jaleel) was actuated in a discharge of his function as minister by personal interest to favour his second cousin. It amounted to favouritism and nepotism and also lack of integrity in his capacity as the minister,” said the verdict of the Lokayukta presided over by Justices Cyriac Joseph and Harun-al-Rasheed. It also said he diluted qualifications and norms for the post just to favour his kin. The verdict also found that the minister’s earlier assertion that Adeeb was selected after many candidates appeared for the interview was found unsuitable. “In spite of objections raised from many quarters the minister directed to issue an order and in the process other eligible candidates were denied the opportunity,” it said. Muslim League leader PK Firoze was the first to raise the allegation. After his appointment snowballed into a major row Adeeb quit his post and rejoined his parent organisation, South Indian Bank. The opposition Congress and BJP have sought his immediate resignation. “He has no right to continue in power. The CM should drop him,” said opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala. But the minister maintained that the case was rejected by the high court and he will take a decision after consulting with legal experts. “Former Governor Justice Sathasivam and High Court had rejected the petition two years ago. I will take a decision after consulting my lawyers,” he posted on social media. After the gold smuggling case involving the UAE consulate came to light last year Jaleel was questioned by the customs and the Enforcement Directorate on several occasions. Trouble began for him after phone call records of Swapna Suresh, main accused in the gold smuggling case, were leaked to the media. The minister’s phone number figured prominently in the list. Soon after the list came out, the minister said he called Suresh as a consular employee in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate in the state capital.But the minister’s clarification invited more trouble for him as he was not supposed to accept any funds or freebies without the consent of the ministry of external affairs and experts said it was a clear violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). During the gold smuggling investigation, the customs also found that a heavy consignment came in last March in 31 bags, weighing more than 4,000 kg and they were taken to Malappuram. The minister later admitted that he took these packets to his constituency but said they were religious books. During investigation, the customs also found that between 2017 and 2018 about 17,000 kg dry dates was imported by the consular office. Considered close to Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan the party had defended the controversial minister who was the minority mascot of the party on several instances. Hailing from the Muslim -majority Malappuram district, he had earlier created enough headaches for the government in alleged mark donation move to a failed student and other cases but his proximity to the CM saved him from trouble.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-minister-k-t-jaleel-not-fit-to-continue-in-power-says-lokayukta-101618001357595.html

Earlier the government had closed all schools, colleges and coaching institutes from April 5 till April 11, leading to protest in some districts by students. Chief Minister Nitish Kumar made it clear that “it was not a lockdown, but partial restrictions have been imposed following the sudden increase in Covid-19 cases. We will again review the situation in 4-5 days and the government hasn’t thought in terms of night curfew as of now.” Bihar reported 2174 Covid-19 cases on Friday taking the number of active cases to 9557. On April 8, the state had reported 1911 positive cases. Amrit also announced that the government has decided to impose certain restrictions on shops and business establishments. “Till April 30, all shops and business establishments will remain open till 7 pm and they will have to follow all Covid-19 protocols like mask and sanitizers will be mandatory. However, this restriction will not apply to restaurants, dhabas and shops serving food and they will be open beyond 7 pm,” he said. The government, has, however, put a cap on the number of people in the restaurants and this will be not more than 25% of their seating capacity. The home delivery and take away food joints will function normally. The government has decided to close all religious places in the state till April 30 while cinema halls have been allowed to operate with 50% audience capacity. The government has decided not to close down parks but has made masks and Covid appropriate behaviour mandatory. The government also announced restrictions in government and private offices and announced that only 33% employees can attend the office on a given day. However, the industrial units have been put out of the purview of these restrictions and will function normally. With the marriage season scheduled to start soon, the government has allowed presence of 200 people in a marriage or a shradh (last rites) while for cremation and other last rites only 50 people would be allowed. The government, however, has put restrictions on holding of functions at public places. CM Kumar assured that things were well under control and he has suggested to the Governor to convene an all-party meeting to discuss the Covid-19 scenario. “The closure of school, colleges and coaching institutes is only for seven days,” said the CM, while trying to provide confidence to coaching institutes and private school owners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/alarmed-over-surge-in-covid-19-cases-bihar-imposes-curbs-once-again-101618000398671.html
10-04-2021||India||Fearing lockdown, some migrants opt to go home||Some migrant workers from Delhi, Maharashtra and Gujarat have started returning to their villages in Uttar Pradesh, Bihar and other eastern states, fearing a rerun of last year’s nationwide lockdown, as Covid-19 infections zoom across the country and governments impose curbs to arrest the outbreak.Railway authorities say that they have witnessed the usual “summer rush” when workers normally return home for harvest season. But many migrant workers say they boarded trains headed to their home states because they feared rising cases would force the administration to impose a lockdown.Last year, after the nationwide lockdown was imposed on March 25, millions of migrant labourers walked, cycled, took buses and trains to escape the virus. This time around, they are taking trains that are running packed, throwing to the wind any caution about Covid-19 distancing or safety protocols. “The pain and torture we were subjected during lockdown last year is still fresh in my memory. This time I can’t take any chance,” said Hariharan Yadav, 34, a migrant worker from Rampur Rakba village in Gorakhpur.Yadav walked 200km last year to return home from Nagpur, and returned from Nagpur on March 16 after partial restrictions were imposed. In his village alone, at least 200 other people who worked as painters in Maharashtra returned.On Friday, 17 workers from Mumbai tested positive for Covid-19 at Patna railway station. They reached Patna on board the special Kurla-Patna Express, said Dr Vibha Kumari Singh, Patna’s civil surgeon. “After screening and documentation, they were given the option to avail of government isolation facility or isolate themselves at home,” said Dr Singh. Railways is operating 16 special trains to Bihar from Maharashtra.Many workers who returned from Gujarat and Maharashtra are daily wagers who lost work due to a rise in Covid cases there. “I returned as there was no work for me following lockdown. It is better to be at home rather than to stay at Mumbai without work,” said Mohammaed Aftab, a mason from Siwan.Md Shahbuddin, 25, who worked in a hotel in Pune, returned to Jharkhand in Pune-Hatia special train, fearing a lockdown. “I do not want to face last year like lockdown when I did not had money even to buy food,” explained the man, who earns ₹20,000 per month. There were other workers who took special trains back to Jharkhand’s Deoghar, Jamtara, Sahibganj and Dumka districts.In eastern UP, many workers had returned. “Of the total population of around 2000, around 150 villagers work in different cities, including Delhi, Mumbai, Nagpur and even Nepal. So far, around 90 have returned,” said Narsingh Yadav, headman of village Mahua in Siddhartha Nagar. “A large number of villagers here who work in other states have started returning following Covid and lockdown fears,” said Raj Kumar Gupta, a social worker in Varanasi.Pherai Nishad, a resident of Gidhaura village of Siddhartha Nagar district said, “I won’t be going back this time. Instead I will be in touch with the family through video conferencing. I have also stocked ration well just in case a lockdown is announced.”At Delhi’s Anand Vihar Bus Terminal and Railway Station, officials said that migrant workers were going back but didn’t report any alarming rise in numbers. They said the situation was not similar to last year, when thousands gathered outside the terminal in the hope of a bus back home.Mohit Kumar, 28, a bus conductor in a UP state transport bus ferrying passengers between Delhi and Hardoi, said the crowd was nowhere near to what it was during the exodus in March-April last year. “People are mostly going back home for routine affairs,” he said. But some people said they were still apprehensive. Virendra Kumar, a resident of Chitrakoot in UP who worked on a poultry farm in Haryana’s Tolana, said outside the Anand Vihar Railway Station : “During last year’s lockdown, my employer didn’t pay me and only gave food. Around August, my brother and I left on foot and reached our village after a week... This time... I have taken a leave from work to return home,” he said .Northern Railway (NR), North-Eastern Railways (NER) and Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) officials said there was no surge in the inward traffic. “The trains are running packed. But there is no unusual surge in the crowd...” said Mahesh Gupta, public relation officer (PRO), Lucknow Division, NR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fearing-lockdown-some-migrants-opt-to-go-home-101617996081566.html
10-04-2021||India||Telangana CM announces ₹2k, 25kg rice for pvt teachers||Hyderabad The Telangana government has decided to extend financial assistance of ₹2,000 in cash and 25 kg of rice free of cost every month to all teachers and non-teaching staff members of various recognised private schools in the state, who had lost their livelihood during the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-9) pandemic. While the decision was announced by chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao during an official review meeting on Thursday, the modalities of identification of beneficiaries and distribution of cash and rice to them were discussed at a video-conference held by school education minister Sabita Indra Reddy on Friday. An official release from the chief minister’s office said nearly 1.50 lakh teachers and non-teaching staff members of various recognised private schools had lost their livelihood due to closure of the educational institutions during the pandemic. The schools were forced to shut down again from March 24, nearly 50 days after their reopening following 10 months of closure due to the pandemic. The decision to close down the schools again was taken following a steady increase in the number of Covid-19 cases in the last few weeks. The official release said the chief minister has taken a decision to provide some monetary relief and rice to teachers and non-teaching staff of private schools on humanitarian grounds. The assistance will continue till the reopening of all the educational institutions, the CMO release added. The education minister, who, along with state backward classes welfare minister Gangula Kamalakar and principal advisor to the government Dr Rajiv Sharma, held a video conference with all district collectors on Friday, said the beneficiaries will be identified between April 10 and 15. “The details of the beneficiary private school teachers and other staff members will be verified between April 16 and 19; and the money will be credited to their bank accounts between April 20 and 24,” Reddy said. The minister added that the beneficiaries will be supplied with 25 kg of rice each immediately. “The scheme will be in force till all the private schools are reopened after the coronavirus pandemic subsides,” Reddy added. Welcoming the initiative, Telangana Recognised School Managements’ Association thanked the chief minister for announcing cash assistance and free rice supply for the private school staff. “The teachers and other employees of private schools have been going through worst financial crisis in the last one year and many of them are not in a position to buy even groceries. This initiative will help them at least to some extent,” association president Y Shekhar Rao said. He, however, added that there were nearly 2.20 lakh teachers and non-teaching staff members in the private schools in both recognised and unrecognised schools and all of them should be given the assistance. He requested the government to enhance the cash assistance to ₹ 5,000 per month. Meanwhile, All India Congress Committee spokesman Dasoju Sravan described the announcement as election gimmick, aimed at appeasing the teachers ahead of the bypoll to Nagarjunasagar assembly seat. “What was KCR doing for the last one year, when the private teachers were suffering from lack of salaries? At least 10 teachers committed suicide in the recent past owing to financial crisis. Moreover, what about private college lecturers who have also not been getting their salaries for the last one year? What KCR is offering to the teachers is just an eye-wash,” Sravan said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-cm-announces-2k-25kg-rice-for-pvt-teachers-101617995415372.html
10-04-2021||India||City records over 5.5k new cases in its highest single-day spike||Bengaluru Karnataka on Thursday logged 7,955 new Covid-19 cases and 46 related fatalities, taking the total number of infections to 1.4 million and the toll to 12,813, the health department said on Friday. Bengaluru, meanwhile, recorded its highest ever single day spike in Covid- 19 infections with 5,576 persons testing positive and 29 fatalities.Prior to this, the highest single-day spike was 5,121, which the state capital recorded in October 8 last year. The total number of active cases in Bengaluru rose to 42,525 while it went up to 58,084 across Karnataka. The BS Yediyurappa-led state government has imposed a night curfew for 10 days between April 10 to 20 in Bengaluru and six other district centres after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday evening.Bengaluru is among the top 10 most impacted districts in the country and experts predict that the surge could continue for another three months. While the positivity rate remained around 6% across the state, Bengaluru accounted for 70% of all cases reported on Friday (24 hours of Thursday)??. Bengaluru accounts for over 73% of all active cases in the state.However, there appears to be no restrictions on political events as thousands gathered for campaigning in the three constituencies going to the bypolls on April 17, including Basavakalyan in the border district of Bidar, about 676 kms from Bengaluru. Bidar, that shares its borders with Maharashtra, reported 186 new infections that takes its active case count to 1,538, while Kalaburagi, next to Bidar, recorded 211 new infections, according to government data. 119 new infections were reported from Chikkaballapur, 115 in Dakshina Kannada, 153 in Hassan, 104 in Mandya, 283 in Mysuru, 143 in Tumakuru and 127 in Vijayapura. Meanwhile, all public religious services in churches and chapels across Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts of the Archdiocese will be suspended till April 20.“All the public religious services in Churches, Chapels and institutions of Bengaluru Urban and Bengaluru Rural districts of our Archdiocese will be suspended from 7 to 20 April. However, Churches and Chapels may be kept open for private visits and adoration,” said Archbishop of Bengaluru Dr Peter Machado in a statement on Wednesday.“The Priests may celebrate the religious services in private with a few or no participation of the public. In any case, maximum precautions and standard operating procedures have to be strictly followed,” said the Archbishop.He further said that not more than 50 people will be allowed for funeral services and there will be no funeral mass in the Churches, but it may be celebrated in the cemeteries with SOPs in place.In the case of sacramental celebrations (baptism, first holy communion, confirmation, marriages etc) which are pre-arranged in this period, not more than 50 people will be allowed. If possible, they will be held behind closed doors with SOPs in place.“The liturgical services such daily and Sunday Holy Masses in different languages, Eucharistic Adoration and other paraliturgical celebrations will be live-streamed on our Archdiocesan YouTube, Facebook and other links,” he said.The parishes are also allowed to live-stream their liturgical services to their parish community by giving sufficient information and publicity for it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/city-records-over-5-5k-new-cases-in-its-highest-single-day-spike-101617995235300.html
10-04-2021||India||Covid-19: 7.3% of active cases in ICUs or on ventilators, says Centre||Around 7.3% of the approximately 980000 active Covid-19 cases in the country as on Thursday night were in ICUs, on oxygen support, or on ventilators, according to data discussed at the 24th meeting of the group of ministers on Covid-19 , chaired by Union health minister Harsh Vardhan. That’s a little over 70,000 people.Hospitalizations due to Covid-19 are increasing, and India’s recovery rate has seen a sharp drop from 97.07% a month ago to 91.22% on , owing to a surge in cases, although this is purely a mathematical feature -- recoveries always lag cases by a few weeks.At the meeting, Vardhan attributed rising new cases across the country largely to casual behaviour adopted by people such as not wearing a mask or doing so improperly. To be sure, India’s cases have been on a decline since mid-September, people have become more careless, and governments have eased even more restrictions on movement and activities, but the sudden surge seen since mid February is likely caused by mutant strains of the virus, especially in Maharashtra and Punjab, two of the worst affected states in the second wave, although India isn’t sequencing enough viral genomes to establish this.The good news according to the meeting was that there have been no fresh cases in the past seven days in 149 districts, and for the past 28 days in as many as 63 districts.Governments have substantially ramped up the hospital infrastructure for management of the viral disease amidst the surge. There are 2084 dedicated Covid hospitals(Centre:89 and States:1995) that have been set up in the country with 4,68,974 beds. Of these, 2,63,573 are isolation beds, 50,408 are ICU beds and 1,54,993 are oxygen supported beds.In addition, India has 4,043 (Centre:85 and States: 3,958) dedicated Covid health centres , with 3,57,096Covid beds, out of which 2,31,462 areisolation beds, 25,459 are ICU beds and 1,00, 175 are oxygen supported beds.The country also has 12,673 quarantine centres and 9,313 total Covid care centres.Speaking on the vaccine drive at the metting, the health minister said, “For those between age 45 and 59, first dose has been received by over 26.1 million people and second dose has been received by 5,23,268 people. Over 37.5 million people, above 60 years of age, have received their first dose, while over 1.3 million people have received a second dose.”Just about 11 States together contribute to 54% of the total cases and 65% of the total deaths in the country, the minister pointed out.Disproportionately higher deaths in Maharashtra and Punjab have further increased during the last 14 days (64% of the total deaths in the country). According to the discussions at the meeting, a majority of the cases is being reported in the younger population (15-44 years of age) and the majority of the deaths reported among the elderly population (> 60 years). Maharashtra (25%) and Chhattisgarh (14%) have extremely high positivity rates .Amidst worried about a vaccine shortage, the minister reassured everyone that there are enough vaccines and that the government is taking all appropriate measures to ensure production capacity of existing vaccines is scaled up, and potency and timeline of those undergoing clinical trials....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/73-of-active-cases-in-icus-or-on-ventilators-says-ministry-101617995175222.html
10-04-2021||India||Adults free to choose their faith, says Supreme Court||New DelhiThe Supreme Court on Friday termed as “very harmful” a petition that asked for a strict central law to check religious conversion and observed that adults are free to choose heir faith.A bench headed by justice Rohinton F Nariman expressed strong displeasure at the plea by Bharatiya Janata Party leader and lawyer Aswhini Upadhyay, warning him of a monetary penalty if he chose to press the petition.The bench, which also included justices BR Gavai and Hrishikesh Roy, cautioned senior advocate Gopal Sankaranarayan, who represented Upadhyay in the matter, as soon as the hearing commenced.“What kind of a petition is this? This is a very harmful petition. If you are going to argue this, we are going to impose a heavy cost on you,” justice Nariman told Sankanarayanan.The senior lawyer, on his part, sought to rely upon the Supreme Court’s judgement in Sarla Mudgal’s case in 1995 wherein the top court made observations regarding the necessity of having a unified central legislation on religious conversion.“There is a reason why the word ‘propagate’ is there in the Constitution. You have to have some meaning for that word. There is no reason why somebody above 18 cannot choose one’s own religion or somebody else’s religion,” retorted justice Nariman.Sankaranarayanan tried to argue that this petition was not about interfaith marriages after the judge commented that an adult could choose even the religion of somebody else. But justice Nariman replied: “It is exactly about that. You argue this petition at your own risk. We will impose a heavy cost on you.”Justice Nariman also said that, personally, he disagreed with the Supreme Court’s judgment in the Rev Stainislaus case in 1977 whereby it was held that the right to propagate did not include the right to convert someone to one’s own religion. This judgment, therefore, upheld the constitutional validity of the laws enacted by the Madhya Pradesh and Odisha legislatures prohibiting conversion by force, fraud or allurement.At this point, the counsel sought to withdraw this petition with the liberty to file a representation before the law commission of India. The bench, however, refused to give this relaxation and asked Sankaranarayanan to immediately decide on withdrawing it, which the lawyer did.Citing the absence of a central law to stop religious conversion by fraud or allurement, Upadhyay urged the top court to issue appropriate directions to the Centre for considering a unified law in terms of the observation made by it in the Sarla Mudgal case. One of the judges on the division bench in the Sarla Mudgal case asked the Centre to consider the feasibility of appointing a committee to enact a Conversion of Religion Act.Upadhyay said the Centre should be directed to comply with this direction and in the meantime, the Supreme Court may issue certain directives to check fraudulent and forcible religious conversion. The plea claimed religious conversion by “carrot and stick” and “by hook or crook” not only offended constitutional provisions but also went against the principles of secularism.Upadhyay pointed out that although eight states, Odisha (1967), Madhya Pradesh (1968), Arunachal Pradesh (1978), Chhattisgarh (2000), Gujarat (2003), Himachal Pradesh (2006), Jharkhand (2017) and Uttarakhand (2018) have enacted anti-conversion laws, there was an urgent need for the Centre to bring out such a law with a minimum imprisonment of three years along with a hefty fine, applicable across the country.After the hearing, Upadhyay told HT: “I will immediately approach the Union home ministry, law ministry and the law commission of India with my plea on taking appropriate steps towards a central legislation. I will approach the Supreme Court again if no effective steps are taken in the next six months.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harmful-petition-adults-free-to-choose-their-faith-says-sc-101617995056427.html
10-04-2021||India||Rahul Gandhi urges PM Modi to halt exports, vaccinate all||New Delhi: Senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Friday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to halt vaccine exports and demanded that the vaccination drive be opened to “everyone who needs it” amid a rise in the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases across the country.In a letter to the PM, the Congress parliamentarian questioned if the export of Covid-19 vaccines was also an “oversight like many other decisions of this government” or was it an attempt to garner publicity “at the cost of our own citizens”.“While our nation is facing vaccine starvation, more than 6 crore (60 million) vaccines have been imported,” Gandhi said. “The state governments are repeatedly highlighting vaccine shortages only to receive intemperate statements by the Union minister of health and family welfare targeting Opposition-ruled states, undercutting cooperative federalism which you too have stressed as essential,” he added in the letter.To be sure, HT reported on March 25 that the government would focus on its domestic vaccination programme and that supplies to other countries would be made only after meeting the country’s needs, but there is no stated export ban.Several states continued to warn that they would run out of vaccines in the next few days, prompting Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to reiterate on Friday that there was no shortage and the country has more than 43 million doses in stock or in the pipeline. To be sure, the problem seems to be more a result of last-mile allocation of vaccines within states, since, at the aggregate level, all of them have at least as many doses as they administer in a couple of days.On Saturday, data collated by HT showed that this number was a little under 42 million on Saturday.Stating that India’s vaccination programme was moving at a “snail’s pace” despite having a first-mover advantage, the 50-year-old Congress leader, in a veiled reference to PM’s photo on vaccination certificates, said that the drive “has to move beyond an individual’s picture on the vaccine certificate, towards guaranteeing maximum vaccination”.India has, so far, administered 97.87 million vaccine doses till Friday night, according to HT’s vaccine tracker. Of this, 12,295,065 people have received both doses and 73,280,915 have received one dose. On Friday, India added 144,923 new cases in a single day, taking its overall tally to 13,202,777; 773 people died from Covid-10 in the past 24 hours.Gandhi has become the latest to demand the opening up of India’s vaccination programme. The Indian Medical Association (IMA) and several chief ministers have appealed to the central government to open vaccination for all people above the age of 18 of years. Experts have also pointed out that in the case of the coronavirus disease, no one is safe till everyone is safe – and in this case this means everyone over the age of 18 (neither of the vaccines in use in India has yet been approved for those below the age of 18). Other experts pointed that even if vaccines must be administered in a prioritised manner, it would make sense to prioritise urban centres, especially those that are seeing a huge surge in infections.The government, however, has opted to stick to a phased approach to vaccination.“It is a common question that is being asked these days that why are not Covid-19 vaccinations being opened for all; why can’t all adults be given it. To those, I want to say that Covid-19 vaccination drive is essentially meant to serve two purposes: to prevent deaths and the other purpose is to protect your health care system. In the middle of a pandemic, the main aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it,” health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a press conference on Tuesday.In his letter, the Congress leader asked the PM to double the central allocation for vaccine procurement from the existing ₹35,000 crore and give state governments a greater say in vaccine procurement and distribution.“Give state governments a greater say in vaccine procurement and distribution and provide direct income support to the vulnerable sections in the disastrous second [Covid-19] wave,” Gandhi said and added that a large section of the “poor have been excluded [from the drive] due to the initial mandatory online”.His suggestions came a day after Modi, during a meeting with chief ministers, said vaccines will have to be prioritised due to limited supply and lamented that some people were playing politics on the issue. “Those who have the habit of doing politics, let them do so. I have faced much criticism, but we remain committed to serving the people,” he said.In a series of tweets, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad countered Gandhi. “After failing as a part-time politician, has Rahul Gandhi switched to full time lobbying? First he lobbied for fighter plane companies by trying to derail India’s acquisition programme. Now he is lobbying for pharma companies by asking for arbitrary approvals for foreign vaccines.”Prasad said fighting a pandemic was not a one-trick game. “Apart from vaccination, there needs to be adequate focus on testing, tracing & treating. Rahul Gandhi’s problem is that he doesn’t understand all this and his ignorance is compounded by his arrogance,” he tweeted.Hitting back, Congress spokesperson Randeep Singh Surjewala said: “Dear Sh. Prasad, Look around you, the 2nd wave of #COVID19 has hit us. We will lobby for- Direct Income Support to the vulnerable sections as partial lockdowns happen. So stop riling, frothing & steaming up. Start serving India & fellow Indians. Follow ‘Raj Dharma’.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-urges-pm-to-halt-exports-vaccinate-all-101617995055359.html
10-04-2021||India||J&J to seek nod for its one-shot vaccine’s trial||Johnson and Johnson (J&J) is set to seek permission to begin a phase 1/2 clinical trial of its coronavirus vaccine in India, the company said on Friday, announcing that it has begun discussions with authorities for the requisite approvals.J&J’s vaccine can be given as a single-dose inoculation and is being seen as a crucial tool around the world in accelerating immunisations, particularly for a large country like India where only two candidates have been approved till now.“At Johnson & Johnson, we remain fully focused on bringing a safe and effective Covid-19 vaccine to people around the world, if authorised for use by local health authorities. We are in discussions with the Government of India with the objective of starting a bridging clinical study of our Janssen Covid-19 vaccine candidate in India, subject to local regulatory approvals,” the company said in a statement.The dose was developed by J&J’s subsidiary, Belgium-headquartered Janssen pharmaceuticals.The product is also at the centre of an ambitious new vaccine partnership unveiled at the first Quad Summit between US, India, Australia and Japan for the manufacture and distribution of a billion doses to countries in Southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Islands.The US development bank will assist India’s Biological E to produce one billion doses of the J&J vaccine by the end of 2022, while Australia will help overcome last mile and logistical delivery issues.The countries, following their summit on March 12, also agreed on collaborating on the necessary approval processes in different countries and with the World Health Organization.In India, J&J’s application will be filed with the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), which requires products developed and tested outside of India to undergo a smaller bridging trial in the country.The bridging studies are done in smaller numbers compared to full clinical trials, as long as there is adequate data on safety and efficacy for large studies in other countries.Serum Institute of India (SII) performed bridging studies for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (used as Covishield) and has recently begun similar studies for the Novavax vaccine. Dr Reddy’s too is carrying out a bridging trial for the Sputnik V vaccine.The dose, which uses a similar method as the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine (used in India as Covishield), has been approved in the US, the European Union, South Africa, Thailand and several others.EU regulators, however, on Friday said they were reviewing blood-related side effects of J&J’s vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jj-to-seek-nod-for-its-one-shot-vaccine-s-trial-101617995055908.html

State officials said on condition of anonymity that government was considering extending the weekend lockdown beyond Monday. Maharashtra began its weekend lockdown from 8pm on Friday to 7 am on Monday, and it will continue till the end of April.“We would need a complete lockdown for 15 days to three weeks even though I am not in favour of that immediately. If hospitals are overwhelmed, if there is a shortage of medicines and if the government is unable to cope with the growing number of patients then such a step can be taken,” Tope told a television channel.He, however, expressed hope that with curbs in place , the government will be able to tame the surge.

10-04-2021||India||Bombay HC at Goa quashes FIR against musicians for hurting religious sentiments||The Bombay High Court at Goa has asked police to be sensitive in matters concerning complaints of ‘outraging religious freedoms’ especially if freedom of speech and expression was at stake and “shouldn’t rush to register an FIR” or arrest artistes based on a ‘frivolous’ complaint.Upholding the contentions of members of a band of musicians, ‘Dastaan Live’, who were arrested by the Goa Police and charged with Section 295-A (deliberate and malicious intention of outraging the religious feelings) of the Indian Penal Code for a song that they performed at the Serendipity Festival of Arts in Goa in December 2019, the high court bench of justices MS Sonak and MS Jawalkar on Friday quashed the FIR against the band members, stating that the police were not justified in registering the case, much less arresting them.“There was no justification whatsoever for the Police Inspector to hurriedly register such an FIR, possibly without even going into the complaint or for that matter the provisions of Section 295-A of the IPC. The Police authorities are expected to be quite sensitive in such matters, because what is at stake is the freedom of speech and expression. Therefore, unless the complaint discloses the ingredients of the offense under section 295-A of IPC, it is not expected of the Police authorities to rush and register an FIR in such cases,” the court noted.Among the songs performed by the band was their rendition of the “Mantra Kavita”, originally composed in 1969 by Vaidyanath Misra (widely known as Baba Nagarjun), a highly acclaimed poet who has received two Sahitya Akademi Awards from the Government of India.However, a complainant K Venkat Krishna alleged that the song “has hurt the sentiments of crores of Indians.”“To my surprise they began chanting ‘OM’, a symbol of my faith in negative narrative and ultimately abusing people chanting ‘OM’ and following to Hindu stream as ‘Ullu ke patta’. They abuse the practice by words with pictures of different walks of life and what they have said and done was blasphemy of my religion and sentiment of hundred crores of India and few million abroad,” Krishna alleged in his complaint, a copy of which he sent to the Prime Minister and the chief minister of Goa.On the next day of their performance, members of the band -- Anirban Ghosh, Sumant Balkrishnan, Shiva Pathak and Nirmala Ravindran -- were called to Panaji police station and were informed that some person had complained about their band and that they were called to the police station to issue an apology.The four persons, including two women, were then placed under arrest. They were eventually released on bail and those who were yet to be arrested secured anticipatory bail.“There was no justification whatsoever to call some of the petitioners to the police station and require them to apologise or to arrest them, no sooner the FIR was registered,” the high court said.“To simply allege that ‘OM’ which is a symbol of the complainant’s faith ‘in negative narrative’ or ‘abusing people chanting OM and followers to Hindu stream as Ullu ke Patta’ is by no means sufficient to spell out the ingredients of Section 295-A of the IPC. Further, to allege ‘blasphemy of my religion and sentiment of hundred crores of India and few million abroad’ also does not spell out the ingredients of Section 295-A of the IPC,” the high court ruled.“The complainant, when he lodged his complaint, had not even bothered to supply the full extract of that composition to the police authorities. Even the police authorities registered the FIR, literally the minute the same was lodged, perhaps, without even bothering to either read the complaint or the provisions of Section 295-A of the IPC. The FIR records that the same was lodged at 13:17 hours on 18.12.2019 and the same recorded also at 13:17 hours on the same date,” the court noted.“The police authorities cannot call citizens to the police station and demand apologies of this nature. As if that was not sufficient, the Police placed some of them under arrest in the late evening, thereby forcing them to seek bail. We think that there was no justification whatsoever for arresting the petitioners who were the members of this band and who have been making such presentations all over the country, unhindered and unmolested,” the high court said.“The Supreme Court has laid down guidelines, which, according to us, were completely ignored by the police authorities. Based on a frivolous complaint, some of the petitioners, who were only members of a band, were incarcerated or forced to seek anticipatory bail,” the HC bench said.“In the complaint, there are not even any allegations of deliberate or malicious intention to outrage religious feelings of any class of persons. In the absence of such allegations, therefore; there was no justification whatsoever to register the FIR and to proceed against the petitioners. The criminal machinery ought not to have been set into motion based upon such a complaint. This was indeed the abuse of the process, because it is apparent that the police authorities have not even taken cognizance of the legal position,” the High Court ruled.“Without even examining the complaint or for that matter the provisions of section295-A, [the police] hurriedly registered the FIR and then proceeded to even arrest some of the Petitioners, possibly because they refused to apologize at the police station. This is certainly not how the Police machinery should act in a matter of this nature,” the high court ruled.The high court stopped short of imposing costs “in the fond hope that the state of Goa and the Goa Police will not act similarly in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-at-goa-quashes-fir-against-musicians-for-hurting-religious-sentiments-101617994455207.html
10-04-2021||India||4 dead in massive blaze at Nagpur's Covid-19 hospital||At least four patients, including a woman, died after a massive fire broke out at the Well Treat Hospital in Wadi area of West Nagpur late on Friday night. The hospital is treating patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).Four fire tenders were rushed to the spot and it took an hour to bring the fire under control. Names and identities of the deceased are not yet known.According to people familiar with developments, around 27 patients at the hospital have been shifted to the government-run medical college and hospital and Indira Gandhi Medical College in a critical condition.It is believed the fire started on the first floor of the hospital and the smoke further spread to the second floor where 10 patients were inside the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Of these, the hospital staff managed to rescue six while the remaining four patients died of asphyxiation caused due to toxic smoke.“We can’t comment on the health condition of others now as we are busy shifting the patients to other hospitals,” Nagpur Police Commissioner Amitesh Kumar said.Also Read| PM Modi expresses grief over loss of lives in Nagpur Covid hospital fireBharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Samir Meghe, who represents the area, said the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained.

10-04-2021||India||Farm stir: Roads cannot be blocked, causing inconvenience to public, says SC||The Supreme Court on Friday reiterated that protesters cannot block roads and continually inconvenience the public, as it took a grim view of a woman’s complaint that it has been taking her almost two hours, instead of 20 minutes, to travel from Noida to Delhi due to frequent blockades and protests,A bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, lamented that despite several judicial pronouncements on keeping public roads free, the situation did not seem to improve.Hundreds of thousands of farmers have been camped at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh since November last year in protest against three controversial central laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy, and traffic at many points, including at Chilla border at Noida, have been diverted, adding significantly to commuters’ travel times.“Many months have gone but the problem is still there. Roads have to be free. You cannot cause continuing inconvenience to others,” the bench, which also included justice Hemant Gupta, told Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Delhi Police.The bench told the S-G, “We are not concerned with how you resolve this issue, whether politically or administratively or judicially. But we have said this before, roads should not be blocked. This is a single mother before us who has to face many problems because of blocked roads.”Mehta agreed with the court’s view, saying the governments of Uttar Pradesh and Haryana should also be present before the bench for a proper resolution of the issue.At this, the bench issued notices also to the two states in the National Capital Region (NCR), seeking their replies before April 19, when the case will be heard next.“We are not concerned with the larger issues, but public roads should not be blocked and this has been repeatedly emphasised by this court,” recorded the bench in its order.On March 26, the top court issued notices to the Centre and the Delhi Police commissioner on the plea of one Monicca Agarwaal who complained that instead of 20 minutes, she ends up spending two hours to travel from Noida to Delhi because of road blockades and demonstrations of all kinds.Agarwaal, who works in an information technology firm, stated in her petition that she needs to commute between Delhi and Noida for work, but said the travel has become a “nightmare” for her.She rued that various directions passed by the top court in several cases, including the Shaheen Bagh protest matter, to keep public roads clear have not been followed. The plea added that the petitioner being a single mother with medical issues was facing harrowing time on account of failure of the authorities in complying with the Supreme Court’s orders. The court in October 2020 termed “illegal” the anti-citizenship law protests held at Shaheen Bagh, holding that protesters could not occupy public ways and spaces indefinitely.Agreeing to examine her petition, the court on March 26 issued notices to the Centre and Delhi Police “to ensure that the road area is kept clear so that the passage from one place to the other is not affected”.On April 8, the Delhi Police submitted its affidavit in the matter, pointing out that Agarwaal’s grievances arise out of the prolonged protests by the farmers’ groups that have gathered at several entry points to the national capital to demand repeal of the three contentious farm laws enacted in September last year.The police claimed it took stern actions against all violators related to the Republic Day tractors’ rally violence this year and was committed to prevent all unauthorised blockades of road. However, the affidavit added, Agarwaal’s problems are due to blockades in Delhi’s neighbouring areas, falling in the states of UP and Haryana, which were beyond the jurisdiction of the Delhi Police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/roads-cannot-be-blocked-causing-inconvenience-to-publicsc-101617993375522.html

Ram, who travelled from Ayodhya to the South before entering Sri Lanka via Rameshwaram, might have come across Lord Hanuman in Tirumala,” one of the committee members, who did not wish to be identified said.“As per scriptures, Anjana Devi took holy bath in Akasa Ganga, a waterfall in Tirumala hills, and performed tapas (penance) before giving birth to Lord Hanuman,” the committee member added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tirumala-birthplace-of-lord-hanuman-temple-board-101617993014907.html
10-04-2021||India||India objects to US Navy operations near Lakshadweep||India said on Friday it has conveyed its concerns to the US over an American warship transiting through the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) without prior consent in what was described by the US Navy as a “freedom of navigation operation”.Though the US Navy has conducted similar operations in Indian waters in recent years, these were not publicised, as it happened in the case of the latest operation on April 7. The US Navy’s 7th Fleet issued a press release that said the freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) by the guided missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones “upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims”.The strongly worded US Navy release didn’t go down well with the defence ministry or the external affairs ministry, especially at a time when the US and India are working jointly to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific through forums such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, or Quad, people familiar with developments said, asking not to be named.“The USS John Paul Jones was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the government of USA through diplomatic channels,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.The Indian government’s stated position on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is that the convention “does not authorise other states to carry out in the Exclusive Economic Zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state”, the statement added.The US Navy’s release said USS John Paul Jones “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law”.The release noted that India’s position on prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its EEZ or continental shelf was “inconsistent with international law”. It further said the US Navy conducts routine and regular FONOPs and will continue to do so in future, and that such operations “are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements”.The 7th Fleet is the largest of the US Navy’s forward deployed fleets. The US had sent elements of the 7th Fleet to the Bay of Bengal to pressure India during the 1971 war with Pakistan that ended with the liberation of Bangladesh.Every coastal country’s EEZ extends to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its shores and the country has exclusive rights to all resources in the water, including oil, natural gas and fish. Any military activity in the EEZ requires India’s permission, navy officials said, asking not to be named.“If you have to do anything in our EEZ, you have to notify us and take permission,” Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said in 2019 after a Chinese vessel was repelled after intruding into Indian waters near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Former navy chief Admiral (retired) Arun Prakash tweeted: “FoN ops by USN ships (ineffective as they may be) in South China Sea, are meant to convey a message to China that the putative EEZ around the artificial SCS islands is an ‘excessive maritime claim.’ But what is the 7th Fleet message for India?”He added in another tweet, “There is irony here. While India ratified UN Law of the Seas in 1995, the US has failed to do it so far. For the 7th Fleet to carry out FoN missions in Indian EEZ in violation of our domestic law is bad enough. But publicising it? USN please switch on IFF (Identification friend-or-foe)!”The development came at a time when the navies of India and the US have just concluded multilateral drills in the eastern Indian Ocean. France, India, the US, Japan and Australia carried out complex maritime drills in the region to enhance interoperability among their navies during April 5-7.The US defense department’s annual freedom of navigation reports posted online show that US warships conducted “freedom of navigation challenges” in India’s EEZ in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019. These operations were conducted mainly to challenge India’s “excessive maritime claims”, the reports said. However, no press releases were issued at the time to publicise these operations.In a statement issued on March 10 along with the freedom of navigation report for 2020, the US defense department said American forces “operationally challenged 28 different excessive maritime claims made by 19 different claimants throughout the world”. India wasn’t among the countries listed in the 2020 report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-objects-to-us-navy-ops-near-lakshadweep-101617992954884.html
10-04-2021||India||Supreme Court amused by Centre’s zeal in Italian marines case||The Supreme Court on Friday remarked it expects the central government to act with the same speed in other cases too when it noted the government’s zeal to have all proceedings in India closed against the Italian marines who killed two Indian fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012.“We will like it if you act with the same speed in other matters too. Here, (in this case) you are asking for three days. Normally, you ask at least for two weeks or four weeks’ time,” a bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre.The bench, which included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, made the comment after the S-G asked for “an earliest possible date” to decide the Centre’s plea for closure of proceedings against the two marines before the top court and a criminal trial pending before a special court in Delhi.On being informed that the compensation of ₹10 crore as agreed upon by the Italian government was yet to be disbursed to the families of the slain fishermen and the injured boat owner, the top court asked Italy to deposit the money with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA).The bench then added that the MEA will subsequently deposit the compensation in the Supreme Court for releasing it to the victims. While the bench wanted to give the Centre a week to deposit this amount, Mehta asked for a shorter date, saying the MEA will do it within three days of receiving the money and then the matter could be heard immediately after a week or 10 days.The promptness of the government amused the CJI, who told Mehta that he would wish to see the same speed in other cases as well. The S-G responded: “This also depends on the ministry you are dealing with.” The bench then fixed the matter for hearing next on April 19.During the proceedings on Friday, senior advocate Jaideep Gupta, appearing for the Kerala government, informed the bench that the families of the victims have accepted the quantum of compensation. The families of the two deceased fishermen have agreed to a compensation of ₹4 crore each in addition to the ₹2 crore already paid by the Italian government. The injured owner of the boat had also consented to receiving damages of ₹2 crore, said Gupta.Advocates A Karthik and Unni Krishnan appeared for the victims’ families and apprised the bench that they were yet to receive the damages.To this, the bench said: “We are going to ask them to deposit the money in this court. Only then it can be closed. Let the amount come here and then we will disburse it.”During a hearing in August 2020, this bench had said that it will close the proceedings only after the families of the victims are heard and given “adequate” compensation, after it noted that the victims’ families were not parties to the case before the Supreme Court.The court was dealing with an application of the Centre filed in July 2020 wherein it said that all proceedings in India against two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, should be closed since the Union government has accepted the May 2020 decision of the international arbitral tribunal. The tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity and hence only Italy could try them whereas India was entitled to compensation.After the government was asked to make victims’ families parties to the plea, a compliance affidavit was filed by the Centre in January this year, stating that the Italian government has offered to pay a total of ₹10 crore in damages, which was acceptable to the families as well the Kerala government.Subsequently, the S-G on Monday requested for an urgent hearing of the Centre’s plea and the matter was listed on Friday.The main case pending before the Supreme Court is an appeal filed by the marines against a May 2012 judgment of the Kerala high court, which held that Kerala had jurisdiction to try them. The marines and the Italian government moved an appeal before the top court, which shifted the trial to a special court Delhi in 2013 where it went on till the Supreme Court stayed it in 2015 after taking note of proceedings pending before the Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) at the Hague, Netherlands. In the meantime, the marines were allowed to go back home on a personal undertaking by the Italian ambassador that they would come back as and when required.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-amused-by-centre-s-zeal-in-italian-marines-case-101617992774766.html
