This was done o the instructions of Bombay high court, which passed an order in this regard on Monday.Deshmukh resigned on Monday after the order of the high court. In the resignation letter he sent to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, Deshmukh said that he doesn't feel morally right to continue in the post.He was replaced by fellow Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader Dinesh Walse Patil who said that the state government will move Supreme Court against the high court order. Deshmukh too is filing a petition separately in the Supreme Court.The Maharashtra government questioned the procedure adopted by the high court saying that the state was heard on the question of maintainability of the pleas seeking CBI investigation against Deshmukh on the allegation of corruption, and the order too was reserved on that issue, but the court finally ended up directing the probe.Also Read| Deshmukh’s exit: The start of Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi alliance’s troubles?In his appeal, Deshmukh said that the high court order raises issues of seminal importance which “impact not just the federal structure of the country, impact on our polity, but also the manner in which, and the institutions through which investigations are to be conducted”.He said that the court must have been aware of the fact that the Maharashtra government had withdrawn its consent for the CBI to investigate matters in the territory of the state.The high court order came on a petition filed by Param Bir Singh, who was shunted out as Mumbai Police commissioner during the probe into a security threat case involving billionaire Mukesh Ambani. A car was found near Antilia, Ambani's residence in Mumbai, with gelatin sticks after which a probe was launched into the bomb scare.Also Watch| ‘Uddhav has forfeited moral authority to govern’: BJP after Deshmukh resigns﻿﻿The case was later transferred to the National Investigation Agency (NIA), which arrested a Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze. Singh claimed that Deshmukh, as the home minister, asked Vaze to collect ₹100 crore from hotels and bars in Mumbai through extortion.The NCP leader denied all the allegations. His party too supported Deshmukh, but the opposition kept attacking the NCP leader demanding his resignation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-registers-preliminary-enquiry-against-anil-deshmukh-101617730748013.html
06-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Centre says Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh cause of maximum concern||The Centre said on Tuesday that Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh are still the cause of maximum concern because of the high number of COVID-19 cases being reported there daily.At a press conference, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the COVID-19 situation in Maharashtra is concerning because of its share in the total number of cases as well as in total deaths.The situation in Punjab and Chhattisgarh is worrying because of their share in the number of deaths, he said.Chhattisgarh's Durg is among the top 10 districts with high active COVID cases. Seven districts in Maharashtra, one in Karnataka and Delhi, taken as one district, is in list, Bhushan said.The 10 districts with the highest number of new cases are Pune, Mumbai, Thane, Nagpur, Nashik, Bengaluru Urban, Aurangabad, Ahmednagar, Delhi and Durg, he said.The average daily cases in Maharashtra has increased from 3,051 between February 10 and 16 to 44,624 between March 31 and April 6. Maharashtra accounts for 58 per cent of the cases being reported in the country.The average daily deaths have also increased from 32 between February 10 and 16 to 250 between March 31 and April 6. It has contributed to 34 per cent to total deaths.The states have been asked to increase the rate of RT-PCR tests. This number is falling in Maharashtra in the last few weeks, from 71.6 per cent between February 10 and 16 to 60.1 per cent between March 31 and April 6, Bhushan said.The weekly positivity rate in this period rose from 6.21 per cent to 24.41 per cent."We have recently told Maharashtra that mobile testing laboratories can be used in areas with difficult terrain for which ICMR is helping the state government."Chhattisgarh is a matter of concern as though it is a smaller state with less population, it accounts for six per cent of the total COVID cases in the country and three per cent of the deaths," Bhushan said.The condition of Chhattisgarh was not this serious during the first wave. But in second wave, it is not the just infections but even deaths are increasing, he said.The daily cases in Chhattisgarh has increased from 226 between February 10 and 16 to 4976 in March 31 and April 6. The average daily deaths have also increased from five on Febxruary 10 and 16 to 38 between March 31 and April 6The number of RT-PCR tests has been low.  From 35.2 per cent on Feb 10-16, it reduced to 30.6 per cent in March 31-April 6. We have requested the state government to increase the number of tests, he said.The weekly positivity rate during this period rose from 1.20 per cent to 16.71 per cent."If we look at Punjab, three per cent of the total cases are being reported from Punjab now and it accounts for 4.5 per cent of the total fatalities in the country,” he said.The daily cases in Punjab has increased from 240 between February 10 and 16 to 2793 between March 31 and April 6. The average daily deaths during the same periods have also increased from eight to 58.The average RT-PCR test is 76 per cent, which is satisfactory, the Union health secretary said, adding the weekly positivity rate in the period rose from 1.30 per cent to 8.75 per cent and to reduce that the number of tests have to be scaled up.The Centre has constituted 50 high-level multi-disciplinary public health teams and deployed them to districts reporting a surge in cases and mortality in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab, Bhushan said.These teams were being deployed in 30 districts of Maharashtra, 11 of Chhattisgarh and nine of Punjab. They will assist the state health department and local authorities in COVID-19 surveillance, control and containment measures."They will see how we can streamline testing, make effective contact tracing including surveillance and containment, build hospital infrastructure, including ICU, ventilator and oxygen beds and effective enforcement of COVID-appropriate behavior and vaccination," Bhushan added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-centre-says-maharashtra-punjab-chhattisgarh-cause-of-maximum-concern-101617729998801.html

06-04-2021||India||Second wave of bird flu kills hundred birds in Himachal Pradesh||Around 100 migratory birds have been found dead in Pong Dam Lake in the last two weeks after the outbreak of a second wave of bird flu in Himachal Pradesh, wildlife officials said on Tuesday.Bird flu had first been confirmed among migratory water-birds at Pong Dam Lake Wildlife Sanctuary in early January that left around 5,000 birds dead in a month. It was contained in early February but has now resurfaced since late March beginning with the discovery of a dozen bird carcasses in the sanctuary on March 25, they added.Chief Wildlife Warden Archana Sharma said the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Bhopal has confirmed the presence of H5N8 avian influenza among the samples of the dead birds.This strain is different from the previous outbreak, when H5N1 had been detected among the migratory birds, she said adding that both these strains are highly pathogenic.Highly pathogenic subtypes of the avian influenza virus are known as highly contagious among birds and especially deadly for the poultry.Earlier this year, when bird flu outbreaks were reported across India, most of the states including neighbouring Haryana reported the H5N8 subtype of the virus, a strain which has not been known to infect humans.As of Tuesday, 99 birds have been found dead at Pong Dam lake during this resurgence, she added.Like the previous outbreak, most of the victims are bar-headed geese, she said adding that the dead birds also include nine greylag geese.The outbreak has so far been confined to two adjoining forest beats and bird fatalities are higher during days of adverse weather because that is when the geese tend to flock together instead of flying out, leading to more transmission of the virus, she added.An international Ramsar site with an area that extends up to 220 square kilometres during the wet season, the Pong wetland becomes home to flocks of migratory waterfowl each winter when wetlands in Europe, north and central Asia become frozen. A bird census in the sanctuary in February revealed the presence of over one lakh migratory water birds of 51 different species at the lake, including over 40 thousand bar-headed geese.With the onset of summer, the migratory birds are now flying back to their parent wetlands, she added.Many of the birds currently present in the lake are those which have flown from Rajasthan and other parts of the country, stopping here on their northward journey, she added.Some incidents of deaths of other birds have also been reported from other parts of the state, including Theog in Shimla district and Manali in Kullu district, and their samples have been taken for testing by the animal husbandry department.Meanwhile the sanctuary has again been closed for visitors, and the bird flu action plan has been activated, which includes surveillance, testing and scientific disposal of dead birds, she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-wave-of-bird-flu-kills-hundred-birds-in-himachal-pradesh-101617729896609.html
06-04-2021||India||‘World’s two biggest democracies should join hands on confronting climate change’: John Kerry||US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, called on India to join hands with the US to confront the climate crisis through a clean energy transition.“Our two nations, the world’s two biggest democracies have a great deal to gain by joining hands and global leadership to confront climate change now. We must do this,” Kerry said in his address to the South Asia Women in Energy (SAWIE) Leadership Summit.Earlier in the day, Kerry met Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar regarding increasing climate ambition ahead of President Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate to be held on April 22-23.“Had an engaging and fruitful discussion with Mr John Kerry. Special Presidential Envoy for Climate. We discussed a range of issues including climate finance, joint research and collaboration etc,” Javadekar tweeted after the meeting.During his stay till Thursday, Kerry is likely to meet PM Modi, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, petroleum and natural gas minister Dharmendra Pradhan, minister for external affairs S Jaishankar.In his address to the SAWIE summit, Kerry summed up his expectations from India. He also acknowledged the US’ role in historical emissions leading to the climate crisis.“Decisive action by India will determine what this sustainable transformation will mean for generations to come. India has the opportunity to both elevate women’s empowerment and to avoid the mistakes made by other countries like ours. Instead of building a modern and sustainable society that can be the envy of the world, some of us have contributed too much to the problem that we are living through today. We are working to build back better today in the US, to transform our economy in a way that prevents the impending climate crisis by keeping global warming under 1.5 degrees C and also create cutting edge jobs of the future,” he said.Also read: ‘Red hot investment’ - US Envoy John Kerry lauds India’s energy policyBut Kerry also underlined the need for a quicker clean energy transition and phasing out of coal. “India has an advantage that we didn’t have in the US. Not just the benefits of decades of scientific and technical advancement but you also have the US as your friend and partner. We are here to support you on this path. India’s global leadership has been critical on a range of issues including delivering covid vaccines to the world. But I am particularly grateful that India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve, you are indisputably a world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy and your leadership on the International Solar Alliance promises to advance clean energy across India and other dynamic growing economies,” he said.While lauding PM Modi’s announcement of achieving the target of 450 GW renewable energy by 2030, Kerry said it’s cheapest to build solar in India and that he wants to see India as the cleantech hub of Asia. “The International Energy Agency (IEA) special report said you (India) are on pace to become the global market leader on solar and storage by 2040. It’s already cheaper to build solar in India than anywhere else in the world. That kind of urgency is exactly what we need to confront global climate change. We are in the decisive decade for action,” Kerry stated.Kerry said a zero-emissions future holds huge business opportunity. Global investment in new clean power capacity is said to exceed 10 trillion dollars through mid-century, more than 6 times the investment in dirtier options. “Still a net-zero energy transition will require innovation and scaling up. It’s critical that the US, India and other partners build the enhanced clean industries of the future - decarbonised industries… In 2021 we have a rare opportunity to create new technologies and new markets and India is seizing this opportunity,” Kerry said, adding that India could add half a million additional jobs by 2030 if it pursues clean energy transition aggressively.Underling the urgency of the climate crisis, Kerry said to get where we need to go according to the Paris Agreement and as per the scientists to keep global warming under 1.5 degrees C, we need to phase out coal five times faster than we have been, we need to increase tree cover five times faster, ramp up renewable energy six times faster.According to senior environment ministry officials, one of the key objectives of Kerry’s visit is to get India to join the countries that have announced a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. In September 2020, China announced that it will peak its GHG emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality before 2060. The White House announced on January 27 that President Joe Biden will take steps to put the United States (US) on an “irreversible path” to a net-zero economy by 2050. Consequently, Biden has also called for a summit of major emitting nations on April 22 to persuade them to commit to ambitious mitigation targets.“A net-zero target is not a trivial endeavour for any country, especially for a lower-middle-income country like India that has the dual challenge of providing modern energy services to millions while protecting the environment. We will need several technologies to become better and cheaper - energy storage, faster EV charging, fuel cells, hydrogen electrolysers, agricultural technologies, carbon capture, and direct air capture - which will be absolutely crucial to achieving any net-zero target. Public and private partnerships with the US can play a very important role in technological innovation and adaptation to India’s needs. The quest for a net-zero emissions future could bring new jobs and better health for Indians. But much depends on the infusion of international capital and disruptive technologies,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate at World Resources Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/worlds-two-biggest-democracies-should-join-hands-on-confronting-climate-change-john-kerry-101617729381085.html

06-04-2021||India||In latest ordinance, Congress sees ‘terrible breach of trust’||An ordinance to end part of India’s appellate structure has irked Congress with party leaders dashing out letters to protest “a terrible breach of trust”. They also wondered if “anything better” be expected from the NDA government. At the heart of the conflict is The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalisation and Conditions of Service) Ordinance that was promulgated on Sunday. Congress chief whip in Rajya Sabha Jairam Ramesh claimed that NDA’s parliament managers had assured the Opposition during the budget session that the bill would be sent to a standing committee for review. In a letter to the Rajya Sabha chairman, Ramesh said, “I am not writing to you on the merits of the ordinance. All I wish to do is express my disgust at the terrible breach of faith as far as not referring the bill to the standing committee concerned.”The legislation, piloted by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, aims to dissolve at least eight existing appellate tribunals and transfer their responsibilities to other bodies including high courts. Jairam claimed that when the budget session was drawing to a close, government managers informed him that the bill would not be taken up for passage and would be sent to a House panel. Congress leader Manish Tewari shot a similar letter to Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla and argued that chapter 12 of the bill introduces major amendments to section 184 of the finance bill and directly impacts the functioning and composition of 19 key tribunals. He added that the proposed law envisages a “complete control” over the mechanisms of 19 tribunals and said, “the bill must be referred to the standing committee for a thorough review of any inherent vulnerabilities in the proposed amendments. Given the sheer degree of dilution or modification that can be done through the misuse of this power, you will surely agree that the amendments should not be hurried and must be examined.”The NDA’s ordinance route and passing bills without review of parliamentary panels have been a matter of concern for the Opposition. PRS Legislative Research said in its report, “In the 17th Lok Sabha, so far, 11% of the introduced Bills have been referred to a committee; much lower than the 14th (60%), 15th (71%), and 16th (27%) Lok Sabhas.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-latest-ordinance-congress-sees-terrible-breach-of-trust-101617728000756.html

06-04-2021||India||As Mukhtar Ansari heads to Banda jail, his brother raises concern||Afzal Ansari, brother of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari, raised questions about the intention of Uttar Pradesh government. Speaking about shifting of Mukhtar from Punjab's Rupnagar jail to UP's Banda, Afzal said he has full faith in the judiciary.Mukhtar is being shifted after an order of the Supreme Court to be tried for various criminal cases in Uttar Pradesh."Their intention is not right. In the same Banda jail, he (Mukhtar) was given poison in tea... we have full faith in the judiciary. We have moved a plea to provide medical facilities to him," Afzal Ansari was quoted as saying by news agency ANI."I am hopeful that Supreme Court will ensure that those in power don't kill someone. In a public rally, BJP state president announces 'gaadi UP ke kis border pe paltegi, ye nahi bataunga (I won't disclose on which border the car carrying Mukhtar will overturn)'. A minister says 'gaadi to palat ke rahegi (the car will definitely overturn)'," he added.The remarks were in reference to the killing of gangster Vikas Dubey in July last year. Dubey was gunned down by the police in an encounter after he “attempted to flee” while being brought to Kanpur from Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain where he was arrested."If they do something arbitrarily, then the time for end of such dictators is nearing. Sacrifice is needed to end dictatorship. If such a thing happens, I will consider that Mukhtar has been sacrificed for the end of the dictatorial government," said Afzal Ansari.The Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday took custody of Mukhtar Ansari, leaving with him from Punjab’s Rupnagar jail in a convoy headed 900 km away for a prison in Banda where security has been tightened to hold the gangster-turned-politician.The transfer happened after a bitter legal battle in the Supreme Court in which the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in Uttar Pradesh accused the Congress government in Punjab of “shielding” Ansari for several months by not letting the state take custody.Ansari has been lodged in Rupnagar jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.According to the UP police, Mukhtar Ansari faces 52 cases in the state - including murder, attempt to murder, cheating and conspiracy - and 15 of them are at the trial stage.Punjab's home department had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take Ansari’s custody by April 8, following the March 26 Supreme Court order that had set a two-week deadline.Ansari will be kept in barrack number 15 of the Banda district jail when he reaches there on Wednesday morning, an official said. He added that access to the barrack has been denied to other jail inmates.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mukhtar-ansari-was-given-poison-in-banda-jail-says-his-brother-101617723627106.html
06-04-2021||India||India could resume vaccine exports by June, says SII CEO Adar Poonawalla||The world's largest vaccine maker, based in India, will be able to restart exports of AstraZeneca doses by June if new coronavirus infections subside in the country, its chief executive said Tuesday.But a continued surge could result in more delays because the Serum Institute of India would have to meet domestic needs, Adar Poonawalla warned in an interview with The Associated Press.The company is a key supplier for the UN-backed COVAX program that aims to distribute vaccines equitably in the world. On March 25, COVAX announced a major setback in its vaccine rollout because a surge in infections in India caused the Serum Institute of India to cater to domestic demand, resulting in a delay in global shipments of up to 90 million doses.Since then, daily new infections in India have almost doubled, with the biggest single-day spike of over 100,000 new cases on Monday. Infections are being reported faster in India than anywhere else in the world, prompting tougher virus restrictions in New Delhi and its financial capital, Mumbai.India initially immunized the most vulnerable, but broadened that to anyone over 45 on April 1 because of the surge in cases. The resulting increased demand forced the halt in exports. Since then, several top state officials have urged the federal government to further expand vaccinations.Poonawalla said the company has “chosen to prioritize India temporarily for two months” and hopes to then restart exports.If India's surge in infections doesn't subside, "I am scared of what ... we will have to do, and what will happen,” he said. “We are going to have to keep supplying to India, and not anywhere else. Because we have to protect our nation.”He acknowledged that has put a “strain on our contractual obligations” to provide vaccines to other countries, and that he has been fielding phone calls from various heads of state.“I've had to politely explain to everybody the situation,” he said, adding that most world leaders understood because they were facing the same issues — the needs of domestic politics and questions raised by opposition parties and the public.“Nationalism is happening ... to a certain extent, everywhere,” Poonawalla said, pointing to vaccine export controls imposed by Europe, and the use in the United States of the Defense Production Act to prevent exports of critical raw materials needed to scale up vaccine manufacturing.He said the unavailability of these raw materials, such as the specific medium needed to grow microorganisms, could affect the Serum Institute's production of another vaccine, Novavax, which is still being tested in India. It has signed a deal to supply Novavax to COVAX, but pivoting to different suppliers of the raw materials would result in a delay of five to six months, he said.“The crunch ... for supplies is today," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-could-resume-vaccine-exports-by-june-says-sii-ceo-adar-poonawalla-101617722144658.html

As much as 60 per cent of the cases (in Gujarat) are from four major cities, including Surat."And, it seems that cases will increase further. But, people should not panic. People should take necessary precautions to stay safe," Rupani told reporters after the meet."People are complaining about a shortage of Remdesivir. My government has placed an order to procure 3 lakh Remdesivir injections from a Gujarat-based pharma company, which has already started supplying around 20,000 injections every day. There will not be any shortage now," he assured.The chief minister said his government has stepped up the vaccination drive as well as testing to curb the spread of the coronavirus infection.Around 1.2 lakh persons are now being tested for coronavirus across the state daily, while an average 4 lakh beneficiaries are being covered under the vaccination drive per day, said Rupani.He said Surat will get 300 ventilators, 50 new 'Sanjeevani Rath' (medical) vans and 800 additional beds at Kidney Hospital for coronavirus patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-gujarat-government-orders-3-lakh-remdesivir-injections-101617719658646.html
06-04-2021||India||'Red hot investment': US Envoy John Kerry lauds India's energy policy||US Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry lauded India's efforts to emerge as a global leader in renewable energy with some of the biggest companies signing a declaration on climate change and pledging to go carbon neutral.Kerry is on a four-day visit to India, from April 5 to April 8, during which he will meet representatives from the Union government, the private sector and NGOs."India is getting the job done on climate, pushing the curve. You (India) are indisputably a world leader already in the deployment of renewable energy," Kerry said. Kerry was speaking in Delhi, where he held talks with government leaders as part of a diplomatic effort to get countries to commit themselves to net zero carbon emissions and slow down global warming."India, in particular, is a red hot investment opportunity because of its clean energy transition. Indian industry is already stepping up and demonstrating leadership," US envoy was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Kerry pointed out how a recent International Energy Agency's special report on India noted that that the country is on pace to become global market leader in solar and storage by 2040. "Thanks to your rapid scale-up, it is already cheaper to build solar energy in India than anywhere else in the world," Kerry said.Kerry was accompanied by a seven-member US delegation in the talks, an environment ministry official said.Praising Prime Minister Narendr Modi's policy goals on renewable energy by 2030, Kerry said that the announcement of a target of 450 GW of renewables by 2030 sets a very strong example of power how to power a growing economy with clean energy.Decisive action by India, Kerry said, in partnership with the rest of the world will determine what this transformation will mean for generations to come.Striking a comparision between US and India, Kerry said that India has an advantage that US did not have during the developing stage. "Not just benefits of decades of scientific and technical advancement, you also have US as your friend and partner. We're here to support you through this path of sustainable future," Kerry said.Backing India's efforts across the spectrum globally, Kerry said that the country's global leadership has been critical across a range of issues including delivering Covid-19 vaccines to world.This is also Kerry's first visit to India as the US Special Envoy for Climate Change. In January, the Biden administration had re-joined the Paris Agreement.The visit aims at consultations on increasing climate ambition ahead of Biden's Leaders' Summit on Climate scheduled for April 22-23 and the COP26 meet to be held later this year.US President Biden has invited 40 world leaders, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to a US-hosted virtual summit on climate to underscore the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action.This will be the second time PM Modi and US President Biden will be together at a virtual summit after last month's Quad meeting.According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), India is the third-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide, after China and the US, despite extremely low per capita CO2 emissions.It has set a target of achieving 175GW (gigawatt) of renewable energy capacity by 2022 and 450GW by 2030.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/red-hot-investment-us-envoy-john-kerry-lauds-india-s-energy-policy-101617717156550.html

Harsh Vardhan told the health ministers that if people adhere to Covid-19 preventative measures then the recent surge of the infection can be contained.Watch Now!Union Minister Dr Harsh Vardhan holds a VC with Health Ministers of 11 states to review the #COVID19 situation & actions being taken to address rising cases in the country.@PMOIndia @MoHFW_INDIA https://t.co/vKe6m14EnxHealth ministers of Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan attended the virtual meeting on Tuesday.Harsh Vardhan said, “We are still in control of the situation. The strategy that led to decline of cases earlier in February this year, when the nation reported 8,635 cases, if we revisit the strategy then we may be able to contain this current spike in the number of Covid-19 cases. We need to motivate society to follow Covid-19 appropriate behaviour.”The Union health minister pointed out that the steep rise that was reported since February came from these 11 states and UTs. Vardhan also said that Chattisgarh remains one of the worst-affected states. He said that Durg and Raipur in Chhattisgarh are badly affected as the positivity rate in these two districts have gone up to 20%. The minister also talked about Haryana’s small towns which he said are badly affected by the latest surge. Harsh Vardhan said that the UK variant contributed to a surge in Covid-19 cases across Punjab, along with events like marriages and local body polls.He also said that the Centre has sent 50 teams to Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab - the three states where Covid-19 is wreaking havoc. He said that 30 teams will be stationed in Maharashtra, while districts in Punjab and Chhattisgarh which are reporting a surge in cases will be under the supervision of 9 and 11 teams respectively. The teams will focus on implementing the testing, tracking, treating, vaccination and strategies to ensure strict adherence to Covid-19 protocol among people. The teams will report to the state and Centre with their recommendations on a daily basis.“Following gradual reopening of services, people took a casual approach towards following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour which has led to a surge in the number of cases. There were elections held previously, elections are also being held currently, there are Kumbh festivities going on, offices have reopened in several cities and social functions like marriages and other events have been taking place in higher frequency where people have not followed Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” the health minister said.The health minister also pointed out that he has personally also seen people not wearing masks while they were outside. He said that there are several ‘social vaccines’ like proper usage of masks and hand sanitisers which are available along with the real vaccines "so taking care of the surge should not pose a major challenge if people can be forced to follow these rules".India witnessed the highest surge in daily cases on Monday when the daily caseload crossed 100,000-mark. India currently has 788,233 active cases and the death toll has reached 165,547 with 446 fresh fatalities reported on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-says-current-surge-can-be-contained-if-people-follow-rules-101617718613565.html
06-04-2021||India||India won't open Covid-19 vaccination for all. Official explains why||Caught in a highly infectious wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), India launched a nationwide vaccination in January this year. As pointed out by experts, vaccination is India's artillery against the viral contagion which has infected more than 12.5 million in the country.The strategy has been relied upon by chief ministers of all states who have also asked for increasing the ambit of the vaccinating programme. However, the Centre differs and has firmly stated that these drives will not be opened for all.Explaining it further, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said at a weekly press briefing on Tuesday, "Many people ask why shouldn't we open vaccination for all. There are two aims of such vaccination drives - to prevent deaths and protect the healthcare system."The aim, Bhushan said, is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it. He later clarified his remark, saying the government was following a dynamic supply-demand mapping model.“The primary aim of vaccination is to reduce mortality among the most vulnerable class of people. Why did we prioritise some groups over others? Because in this phase of vaccination (till around July), vaccines will be in limited supply. Hence we have to prioritise it to the most vulnerable sections of society and this is an established practice across the world,” Bhushan told news agency ANI.Bhushan said that this prioritisation strategy of those more vulnerable is also backed by the WHO. "Along with the prioritisation, we are following a dynamic supply-demand mapping model to take decisions of when to open up vaccinations to other age groups," the Union health secretary said.Also read: BMC announces fresh Covid-19 restrictions for Mumbai, in addition to Maharashtra govt curbsIndia, currently in its third phase of Covid-19 vaccination, has started vaccinating people above the age of 45. In the first phase, which started on January 16, India inoculated healthcare workers with two vaccines - Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). The drive was further opened up to 20 million frontline workers from February 1 onwards.In the next phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, authorities aimed to inoculate people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities against the coronavirus from March 1.The vaccine drive was meant to first immunise 300 million people who belong to three categories: healthcare workers, frontline workers, and those at greater risk from Covid-19 due to their age or existing medical conditions.The clarification from officials came a day after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi urging relaxation in the age bar and opening of new vaccination centres.In his letter, Kejriwal suggested a two-pronged approach. "First, there is an urgent need to increase the number of vaccination centers. For this, the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centers need to be relaxed," he said."Second, it should be made available to everyone by removing the age limit to immunization. Except for those who cannot get vaccinated medically, we should start vaccinating everyone. This will remove the hesitation among people and increase the number of people getting vaccinated. The more people get vaccinated, the more we will be able to reduce the spread of the disease," he added.Also read | Covid-19 pandemic in India has worsened, warnings were given: GovtThackeray in his letter reasoned that the move will benefit Maharashtra - the worst-affected state - and those vaccinated by reducing the severity among the young and working population falling in that age bracket."I request you to lower it to 25, as the states facing the surge are having to place curbs to safeguard the lives of the population. However, if a larger number of our young and working population is vaccinated, the intensity of the cases would be much lower than the treatment that they need today," Thackeray said in his letter. A copy of the letter was shared by the chief minister's official Twitter account.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-won-t-open-covid-19-vaccination-for-all-officials-explain-why-101617711524277.html

The former Trump administration had denied India a waiver from a 2017 U.S. law aimed at deterring nations from buying Russian military hardware, a stance that is expected to continue under President Joe Biden.“We reiterated our commitment to military-technical cooperation,” Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov said after discussions with his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar. “We have an intergovernmental commission on military-technical cooperation. It has its plans, and this includes discussion of additional manufacturing of Russian military equipment on Indian territory.”Jaishankar said the S-400s would be discussed at a meeting of defense ministers later in the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-give-no-hint-on-s-400-delivery-after-delhi-talks-101617712802660.html
06-04-2021||India||'Need for a lockdown': Gujarat HC tells state govt amid rising Covid-19 cases||After the High Court of Gujarat on Tuesday asked the state government to consider imposing a curfew for a few days as the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) situation was getting 'out of control', the government decided to impose night curfew and a few other measures effective from Wednesday. The night curfew will be from 8pm to 6am in 20 cities up to April 30. Only 100 people will be permitted in weddings and all political and social functions with more than 50 people have been banned till April 30. Additionally, all government offices will remain shut on Saturdays, the government notice said. Gujarat on Monday recorded over 3,000 fresh cases of the virus.During an online hearing, a bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice Bhargav Karia said a lockdown or curfew for 3 to 4 days is needed to curb the spread of the virus. "Urgent and serious steps need to be taken to check this. Otherwise, the Covid-19 situation will go out of hand. May be three-four days of curfew or lockdown can be imposed to check the situation at the moment," Chief Justice Nath said, according to news agency PTI. All kinds of gatherings, including political functions, should be stopped, he added.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe night curfew imposed from between 9pm and 6am in four major cities of Gujarat was not proving to be effective, according to Chief Justice Nath. On March 31, night curfew in Ahmedabad, Surat, Vadodara and Rajkot was extended till April 15. This was the seventh extension of the night curfew, which first came into force in November 2020, after a spike in Covid-19 cases in these cities after Diwali. "You can always open it after three-four days of curfew. But, this curfew will help, I think. Like, initially in March 2020, there was a curfew for two days, three days," Chief Justice Nath said.Justice Karia said steps needed to be taken to reduce the number of people going to office in order to break the chain of infection. To make sure "less number of people come in contact" with each other, he suggested that the government should limit the number of employees coming to offices or commercial establishments.To these suggestions, Advocate General Kamal Trivedi said he will take instructions from the state government and revert, according to PTI. "Day before yesterday, the government was seriously thinking about imposing a lockdown. But, there were views that a lockdown is likely to cause misery to the poor people," the advocate general said, adding that the government is in a 'Catch-22' situation. (with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-for-a-lockdown-gujarat-hc-tells-state-govt-amid-rising-covid-19-cases-101617711985275.html
06-04-2021||India||Bombay HC says ByteDance should deposit $11 million in tax evasion case||An Indian court on Tuesday said China's ByteDance must deposit around $11 million that federal authorities believe the company owes in an alleged case of tax evasion, a setback for the firm which wanted to unblock its bank accounts to pay salaries.An Indian tax intelligence agency in mid-March ordered HSBC and Citibank in Mumbai to freeze accounts of ByteDance India as it probed some of the firm's financial dealings. ByteDance challenged the move in court saying the freeze amounted to harassment and was done illegally.ByteDance has said in court it does not owe the tax government is demanding and does not agree with the tax authority's decision to freeze its accounts.After a government counsel said ByteDance owed the authorities about 790 million rupees ($11 million), the High Court in Mumbai said the company will need to keep that amount blocked in a state-run bank.That amount will be frozen, the two-judge bench said.However, the four blocked bank accounts of ByteDance had just $10 million in funds, according to the company's court filing seen by Reuters.A counsel for the federal tax authority, Jitendra Mishra, said ByteDance can utilize the $10 million for making the court mandated deposit, but cannot use it for any other activity. Effectively, Mishra said, the accounts still remain frozen until the amount is moved to the state-run bank.ByteDance did not immediately respond to a request for comment.ByteDance in January reduced its Indian workforce after New Delhi maintained a ban on its popular video app TikTok, imposed last year after a border clash between India and China. Beijing has repeatedly criticised India over that ban and those of other Chinese apps.Still, the company has told the court it has a workforce of 1,335, including outsourced personnel, which includes 800 people working in its "trust and safety" team that supports activities like content moderation overseas.In the tax probe, which started in July 2020, India's tax authority told ByteDance it had reasons to believe the company suppressed certain transactions and claimed excessive tax credits, Reuters has previously reported.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bombay-hc-says-bytedance-should-deposit-11-million-in-tax-evasion-case-101617711270253.html
06-04-2021||India||Post Quad summit, India-China military talks on LAC friction possible on April 9||The 11th round of India-China military dialogue may take place on April 9 to resolve the friction at Gogra-Hot Springs and restoring the pre-April 2020 status quo ante along the 1,597-kilometre Line of Actual Control(LAC) in East Ladakh, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday. The Indian army also wants to resolve long-standing patrolling issues at Depsang Bulge due to friction in the area during the 2013 stand-off with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA).“The dialogue will most probably take place on Friday (April 9) but a confirmation is still awaited from the PLA side,” said a senior official. He, however, insisted that there is no delay from the Chinese side.While the situation on both banks of Pangong Tso is stable with the PLA and Indian Army going back to pre-April 2020 positions, a score of Chinese soldiers is still to restore status quo ante in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, or patrolling points 15 and 17 as per the Indian military lexicon.Also Read: ‘Build on Pangong Lake drawdown, disengage at other points’: India tells ChinaThe last round of military talks to resolve border tensions that began last May was held on February 20. This meeting stretched for 16 hours and ended with two sides agreeing that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided them with a “good basis” to resolve the outstanding issues at friction points in “a steady and orderly” manner.Indian Army commanders believe that the differences between the two sides at the Gogra-Hot Springs area was relatively a minor issue as compared to the diversion of views on the strategic heights on both banks Pangong Tso. But there is recognition that the talks could go either way though the army has approached the dialogue with an open mind.The 11th round of military talks comes at a time there is growing concern in China about the Quad security dialogue and the attempts to raise pressure on Beijing to loosen its hold over Taiwan and the South China Sea.Leaders of the four-member Quad grouping - the United States, India, Japan and Australia - held their first summit on March 12 to address concerns about Beijing’s growing economic and military heft. A meeting of US-China officials at Anchorage on March 18 also ended acrimoniously, making it clear that there was no possibility of a revival in US-China bilateral ties in a hurry despite the change in the White House.To add to China’s concern is the concerted effort by powers such as France and the United Kingdom to expand their footprint in the Indo-Pacific and India playing a pivotal role in the region, particularly in the Indian Ocean. Navies of France-plus Quad countries are already in the middle of exercises in the Bay of Bengal. with French carrier strike force led by aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier will participate in the trilateral naval exercise along with the Indian and the United Arab Emirates navies in the strategically important Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman later this month.Officials suggest it is not clear these developments would impact the military talks. With both the US and China accusing each other of grand-standing at the Anchorage meeting last month, the PLA may either harden its stance or soften its attitude towards the resolution of Gogra-Hot Springs. The Indian Army, which has been long prepared for a long haul at the friction points, is also keeping a close watch on the entire 3488 km LAC as most stand-offs with PLA take place in April and May during exercises in Tibet and Xinjiang by the Western Theatre Command based in Chengdu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/post-quad-summit-india-china-military-talks-possible-on-april-9-on-lac-friction-101617710119541.html
06-04-2021||India||Covid-19 pandemic in India has worsened, warnings were given: Govt||The Union health ministry on Tuesday asked states badly hit by the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to amp up their RT-PCR testing to at least 70% of the total samples tested. The suggestion comes a day after India recorded more than a lakh cases in a day - highest since the start of the pandemic.The health officials also confirmed that the second wave in India is worse than the first as the Covid-19 cases are increasing at a higher rate."The impact of the pandemic has increased in the country. Warnings were given that the situation should not be taken for granted," Dr VK Paul, NITI Aayog member said at a press conference.Dr Paul confirmed that the situation has worsened and the speed of increasing Covid-19 cases is higher than last time."We have suggested state governments increase the percentage of RT-PCR tests, which is reducing in Maharashtra in the last few weeks. Only 60% of total tests were done through RT-PCR method in Maharashtra last week. We suggest states take it to 70% or above," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a weekly press briefing.According to the officials, the deteriorating situation in Chhattisgarh has sent the alarm bells ringing as the state has become an area of "concern"."Chhattisgarh is a cause of concern for us. Despite being a small state, it reports 6% of total Covid-19 cases and 3% of total deaths in the country. The condition of Chhattisgarh has deteriorated in the second wave of infections," Bhushan said in the press briefing."Death numbers being reported in Punjab and Chhattisgarh are cause of extreme concern," he added.Maharashtra - India's worst affected state - accounts for 58% of the active cases and 34% of the total deaths, officials said. They added that around 4.5% of deaths due to the virus are being reported in Punjab."Compared to Punjab, active cases and death toll are very low in Delhi and Haryana. It is satisfactory that the share of RT-PCR tests in average daily tests has increased to 76% in Punjab," Bhushan said.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan is scheduled to hold a meeting with health ministers of 11 states and union territories (UTs) to take stock of the situation. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will also hold a meeting with chief ministers on Thursday to review the Covid-19 situation in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-pandemic-in-india-has-worsened-warnings-were-given-govt-101617706833277.html

Despite the threat of Covid-19, they are denying our demand. This is injustice. If a student gets infected during the examination and dies, will the university take responsibility?,” asked a student, who didn’t wish to be named.Following the protest, the district administration called a meeting of Assam University officials, principals of colleges and representatives of students. The colleges unanimously supported the decision to conduct offline examinations. “Assam University is not the competent authority to assess the Covid situation. It is the district administration or the state government’s job to issue an advisory, which guides our decision. When the Dibrugarh University is conducting offline examination, the election commission is conducting elections, a Mela is happening in Silchar, when everything is open, how can Assam University take a decision not to conduct offline examination? We are following the Standard Operating Procedure (SOPs) issued by the ministry of home affairs, which instructs universities to open in a phase-wise manner,” said Pradosh Kiran Nath, Assam University registrar.Additional deputy commissioner Dipak Jidung said, “We cannot influence the university’s decision unless it hampers the law and order situation in our district. The university authority asked us to give an advisory whether it is unsafe to conduct offline examination at this moment due to Covid. Though the number of Covid cases are increasing in the country, we don’t have any instructions from the state government to stop offline examinations.”Presently, there are 16 active cases of Covid in Cachar district and the last death due the disease in the district was reported two weeks back.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/assam-university-students-demand-for-online-examination-rejected-101617699738653.html

He also lashed out at regional parties and said the mask of “fake secularism” that they wear is now coming off. Taking a swipe at opponents who dub the BJP an election-winning machine, he said when other parties win elections, the party and the leaders are feted but in the case of the BJP, electoral wins are “perceived with double standards”. “Those who say we are an election-winning machine cannot understand the maturity of the Indian democracy and the intelligence of the voters; they cannot understand the hopes and aspirations of the Indian voters. The BJP is not an election-winning machine, but is on a continuous, relentless campaign to win hearts,” the PM said. Also Watch | ‘BJP means freedom from dynastic politics’: PM Modi on party’s foundation dayAddressing party workers, the PM said the BJP has ensured last-mile delivery of its people-centric policies and has taken into account the aspirations of the marginalised sections that were not at the centre of programmes initiated by previous governments. For the first time the yardstick has changed and the governments are evaluated on the basis of policies (neeti), intent (neeyat) and last-mile delivery, he said. “We serve the people faithfully whether in the government or not; we are connected with the people. We do not take pride that our party won; we take pride that the people of this country made us win,” he said. Taking another dig at regional satraps that have become “dynastic parties”, he said the parties that emerged as representatives of regional aspirations have now become “family-controlled” parties. “In this (BJP) party, workers toil hard and thousands of workers have made sacrifices...In Kerala and in West Bengal our workers are threatened, attacked and their families are also not spared… but they are steadfast in their resolve to live and die for the country, this is the uniqueness of the BJP workers. On the other hand, you have seen what happens to family and dynasty-oriented politics. The parties that talked about regional aspirations have eventually become a family-owned parties and the results are here for all to see. These parties wore a fake mask of secularism which is now being taken off,” he said. While the BJP’s opponents have accused it of not protecting the rights of the minorities and indulging in communal polarisation, the PM said secularism had been transformed to mean policies according to the vote bank and favours only for a few. “Those who makes policies and programmes for everyone and speak about the rights of all are called communal; but Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas has begun to change these definitions,” he said. Reiterating that the country is above all, he said the BJP has never compromised on its values and on issues of national security. “We saw how the Atal Bihari Vajpayee government accepted loss of power by one vote but did not compromise. Our workers suffered during the emergency,” he said. Cautioning workers against “narratives” that seek to create political instability in the country, he cited the examples of the protests against the Citizenship Amendment Act, the farm and labour laws. The PM was referring to the protests that erupted when Parliament passed the bill to fast track citizenship for persecuted minorities from the neighbouring countries and the bill to bring changes in the farm laws. “I want to take your attention towards a very grave challenge; you would have seen the system of creating narratives has started. [Whether it is] with regard to CAA or the farm laws or the labour laws, every worker should understand that there is politics behind this and a big conspiracy. This means there is an attempt to create political instability in the country, therefore all rumours are being spread, fears are being stoked and lies are being told. Imaginary fears are being created; sometimes it is said that the Constitution will be changed, sometimes that reservation will be withdrawn; sometimes they say citizenship will be withdrawn and sometimes they say farmers’ lands will be taken… all of these are lies but some people and organisations spread them with speed . You need to be alert and with complete information keep going back to the people and create awareness among the people,” the PM said. He said the work of creating fear and wrong narratives is the handiwork of those “who cannot accept their defeat and do this for their own political benefit”. The PM also urged the party members to be humble as the party grows in number and political heft. “We are moving ahead, taking along every region and community, we are everywhere. We are a party of national interest as well as regional aspirations. We do not believe in political untouchability,” he said. He cited how the BJP government paid tributes to Sardar Patel and BR Amedkar and did not refrain from awarding civil awards even to political opponents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-is-not-an-election-winning-machine-pm-modi-on-party-s-foundation-day-101617693078290.html

The Prime Minister began the address by paying tribute to the leaders of the party such as Syama Prasad Mukherjee, Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Kushabhau Thackeray, Rajmata Scindia and Atal Bihari Vajpayee.The program began with the party president JP Nadda’s address, who celebrated the expansion of the BJP to 303 seats in the Parliament and forming a government in 12 states under the leadership of Prime Minister Modi.“The BJP has always worked on the mantra of 'the party is bigger than the individual' and the 'nation is bigger than the party'. This tradition has continued since Syama Prasad Mukherjee and runs to date,” PM Modi said during the address.Watch | ‘BJP means freedom from dynastic politics’: PM Modi on party’s foundation dayThe Prime Minister celebrated the BJP-led government’s achievements. From abrogation of Article 370 and giving constitutional rights to Jammu and Kashmir to fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, he spoke about how the party workers unitedly worked for the development of the nation.PM Modi slammed the opposition, on the foundation day that coincided with the polling day of four states and one Union territory, for calling the BJP an election-winning machine. He said if the BJP wins it is considered an election-winning machine but if others win then that is credited to their hard work. “The BJP is not the election-winning machine, those who say this could never understand the democracy of this country and hopes, dreams, expectations of the people of this country,” the Prime Minister said.The Prime Minister said the BJP works for the development of the nation but the opposition has used the game of secularism and communalism against the party. Incorrect narratives are constructed against the government, Modi said citing examples of the farm laws, Citizenship (Amendment) Act or CAA and labour laws.The Prime Minister urged the party workers to be aware and spread awareness among the people against this large conspiracy that the opposition is playing against the BJP to create political instability in the nation, through spreading lies and rumour-mongering. “Parties that began with help from local aspirations, became a family-based party later. These parties, who were wearing a mask of secularism, are finally being unmasked,” he said.“The BJP means defeating dynasty-based politics. It means an opportunity to able leadership. It means transparency and good governance. It means 'Sabka Saath, Sabka Vikaas, Sabka Vishwas',” the Prime Minister added. Also Read | Assembly Election 2021: Polling picks up as voting underway in 4 states, 1 UTModi during his address to the party workers also spoke about party workers who were threatened in West Bengal and Kerala. “Hundreds of activists have sacrificed for the party.

06-04-2021||India||In wake of increased attacks, govt trains 4,000 officials in cybersecurity||The ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY) has virtually trained over 4,000 government officials in cyber safety in the last three months, in the wake of an increase in such attacks, officials familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times. The course, which started in December last, offers two variants — a one-day basic training to avoid cases of cyber breaches and digital sanitisation, and a five-day deep dive into the technical aspects of the same. Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (CDAC), Hyderabad is the implementing agency for both the training programmes. “More government officials are increasingly applying for the course,” an official said on the condition of anonymity. “We aim to try and train all government employees in the course of six months.” HT, last month, reported several instances in which government domain email addresses were used to launch cyber attacks.The discovery of critical vulnerabilities in several government servers, which could have given attackers access to sensitive networks, underscores the need for the country’s digital infrastructure to be made more secure.The training includes information security at the organisational level, cyber ethics and details of cyber offences, data, passwords and email security, mobile security, mobile app security and social engineering attacks. The initial six to eight hours, which constitute the basic training, also cover social networking security and secured financial transactions. A 1,000 participants can be trained during the webinar, according to the course document accessed by HT. Also Read | Centre plans tougher security measures for 300k govt officialsThe advanced session, officials said, had fewer takers. Over 500 people signed up and completed the programme that addresses cyber security basics for IT/ICT environment, information security policies, procedures and guidelines and system and network security concepts. The programme includes information security audit and assessments including various cyber security threats and incident response. This session is more focused and has 10 participants during one course. The country has seen a sharp spike in the number of cyber incidents across different sectors. As per the information reported to and tracked by Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), 17,560, 24,768 and 26,121 Indian websites were hacked during the year 2018, 2019 and 2020, respectively, the ministry told the Rajya Sabha on March 18 in response to an unstarred question. “According to the logs analysed and made available to CERT-In, the Internet Protocol (IP) addresses of the computers from where the attacks appear to be originated belong to various countries including Algeria, Brazil, China, France, Indonesia,Netherlands, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, Serbia, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey,USA, Vietnam, etc,” the ministry had said. Union minister of state for MeitY Sanjay Dhotre also told the Parliament that in the last six months, during the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been a rise in scanning and malware infections across sectors.A total of 110, 54, and 59 websites of Central ministries, departments, and state governments were hacked in 2018, 2019, and 2020, respectively, the minister said in a written reply to the Rajya Sabha.HT, on March 5 reported that cyber operations by state actors and the abuse of social media for “narrative warfare” are some of the particular threats likely to be recognised by the government in the National Cyber Security Strategy, 2021 (NCSS 2021), a policy paper that could also make it mandatory for any business or government department with a significant IT interface to set up a cyber safety cell.This will be part of a long-awaited overhaul in how India sees and approaches dangers in the digital domain. India’s current posture stems from the National Cyber Security Policy of 2013, which officials and experts say has become outdated in the face of a threat landscape that affects national security, governance and critical infrastructure, communications, and business more deeply than ever.Over the last couple of years, India has also faced several high-profile cyber attacks, including those purportedly originating in North Korea that targeted the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) in 2019. Earlier this week, security consultants reported finding a China-backed operation to target India’s electricity grid.Subimal Bhattacharjee, an independent consultant on defence and cyber issues, said that the online cyber security training for government employees is desirable and should be pursued with more vigour. “This is a good step by the government to sensitise basics to all employees and also have a special course of technical staff of every ministry/department,” he said. “At the same time, the employees also should be trained about they should keep their official and government online platforms separately and have well defined access control to official networks. More number of employees should be motivated to undertake these courses and keep on updating themselves after the courses periodically.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-wake-of-increased-attacks-govt-trains-4-000-officials-in-cybersecurity-101617683297609.html

Later it was merged with several parties in 1977 to form the Janata Party.In 1980, the national executive council of the Janata Party banned its members from being 'dual members' of the party and the RSS. Consequently, the former Jana Sangh members left the party and floated a new political party. Thus, the BJP came into existence on April 6, 1980.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjps-41st-foundation-day-pm-modi-to-address-party-workers-today-101617677882333.html
06-04-2021||India||Goa considers own lab to test Covid-19 strain due to long wait at Pune||The Goa government is planning to set up its own genome sequencing lab since the National Institute of Virology in Pune is taking a long time to identify variants responsible for the new Covid-19 surge, said health minister. Vishwajit Rane pointed out that results of samples sent to the NIV several weeks ago had not been returned, leaving the state clueless about the strains prevalent in the state.“We know that a lot of tourists and other people are coming into the state of Goa. There was a suggestion to track people since people even come from Brazil to Portugal and (then) indirectly into Goa. Tracking where they came from also needs to be done,” Rane said.“Many times the media asks us what strain it is. Of the 15 or so tests that we sent to the NIV, we have not got any results till today. So I was discussing that we should explore the possibility to see how we can set up genome testing facilities in Goa or if we can tie up with somebody,” Rane said.He said the dean of Goa Medical College has been asked to explore the feasibility and accordingly send a proposal to the state government for setting up such a facility in the state.“If it’s feasible and if Rupees 1.5 crore is spent to get genome testing (facility) here so that we know what type of strain we are dealing with, (then) there is no harm in exploring the possibility and workability of (establishing) such a lab in Goa. It is not just (about) purchasing the equipment, it’s also to see whether we are able to run it,” he said.“Instead of hot-mixing (resurfacing) one road, I might as well buy one machine worth ₹1.5 crore and do the genome sequencing to see what variant is spreading in the state of Goa instead of waiting 15 days (to get a result) from the NIV,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-considers-own-lab-to-test-covid-19-strain-due-to-long-wait-at-pune-lab-101617677777133.html
06-04-2021||India||Sikkim earthquake sends tremors past Bengal, Bihar, Assam; no risk of aftershocks||An earthquake measuring 5.4 magnitude hit the Sikkim-Nepal border on Monday night, the National Center for Seismology (NCS) said. Tremors were felt across eastern India, in the states of West Bengal, Assam and Bihar. Officials informed news agency PTI that there is no possibility of aftershocks--usually known to accompany earthquakes of much higher magnitudes. "Generally, aftershocks do not occur following any quake below the magnitude of six. So, in this case, there is no possibility of aftershocks," PTI quoted an NCS official as saying, when asked about the possibility of aftershocks following the earthquake.Also Read: 5.4 earthquake in Sikkim-Nepal border, tremors felt in Assam, BengalThe earthquake occurred at 8:49pm at a depth of 10km near the India-Bhutan border, PTI reported, adding that the effects were immediately felt in Sikkim's capital Gangtok and other parts of the Himalayan state. Tremors were also reported as far away as in West Bengal's Darjeeling, Jalpaiguri, Siliguri, Coochbehar, and Raiganj, as well as in Purnia and several other parts of Bihar, and Assam. The earthquake's epicentre was 25 km east-southeast (ESE) of Gangtok and it struck at a depth of 10km from the surface near the India-Bhutan border.The earthquake triggered frightened people to rush out of their residences. No loss of life or property has however been reported so far, a Sikkim government official was cited as saying. After the earthquake, Prime Minister Narendra Modi took stock and spoke to the chief ministers of Bihar, Assam and Sikkim about the situation in their respective states, people familiar with the development told HT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sikkim-earthquake-sends-tremors-past-bengal-bihar-assam-no-risk-of-aftershock-101617673667444.html
06-04-2021||India||Bengal polls: 205 candidates will fight it out at 31 seats in third phase||In more than 20 of the 31 assembly seats that go to the polls in the third phase in West Bengal on Tuesday, the contest between the Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) will be close because of the demographics of these constituencies and strong presence of the ruling party. The polls will be held in Hooghly, South 24 Parganas and Howrah districts. Out of the 205 candidates in the race, only 13 are women. The Election Commission of India (ECI) has deployed more than 62,000 central armed police personnel for the third phase. Like the second phase, prohibitory orders under Section 144 of Code of Criminal Procedure (Cr.PC) will be enforced around the 10,871 polling booths in the three districts on Tuesday to stop assembly of more than four people. The number of electors in the third phase is 78,52,425 of whom a little less than half are women while 243 belong to the third gender. In Hooghly district, where eight seats go to the polls, the BJP made sizeable inroads in the 2019 Lok Sabha polls. Actor-turned-politician Locket Chatterjee managed to wrest the Hooghly Lok Sabha seat while the BJP lost the Arambagh seat by about a thousand votes only. Chatterjee, who is one of the four BJP Lok Sabha members contesting in the eight-phase elections, has been fielded from the Chinsurah assembly seat which is part of her Lok Sabha segment. Having promised to enforce the new citizenship law in Bengal if it comes to power, the BJP has set its eyes on the scheduled caste population, for whom the Dhaniakhali, Goghat and Arambagh seats are reserved. Arambagh is likely to witness the most fierce contest, all parties say. The TMC has fielded Sujata Mondal Khan, the estranged wife of Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha (BJYM) state president and Lok Sabha member Saumitra Khan from this seat. Sujata Mondal Khan joined the TMC in December after her husband sent a legal notice for divorce following a marital dispute. He announced his decision during a press conference, making the incident a first of its kind in Bengal politics. Swapan Dasgupta, the BJP’s Rajya Sabha member who resigned from the Parliament to contest the local elections, is contesting against the TMC’s Ramendu Singha at the Tarakeshwar seat in Hooghly district. “I tried to meet as many people as possible,” Dasgupta told the local media during a door-to-door campaign on Saturday. Debjit Sarkar, the former state president of the BJYM, is contesting for the Jangipara seat. “I contested the local Lok Sabha seat but the situation is quite different now. I have felt the tension in some areas,” Sarkar, who could not win in 2019, told HT on Monday night. In Hooghly district, the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), is contesting only the Arambagh and Tarakeshwar seats. In South 24 Parganas district, where as many as 16 assembly segments are going to the polls, several are part of the Diamond Harbour Lok Sabha constituency held by chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee. The TMC’s youth wing president held five rallies and roadshows as campaigning came to a close at 5 pm on Sunday. The district, with 31 assembly constituencies, is a TMC stronghold. In the 2016 state polls, the ruling party won 29 seats. In 2019, when the BJP won 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats and even made a dent in the adjacent North 24 Parganas district, voters in South 24 Parganas remained loyal to the TMC. Abhishek Banerjee won from Diamond Harbour for the second time by a margin of 3,00,000 votes. Muslims comprise a sizeable section of the population in many assembly segments such as Canning East, Baruipur East, Baruipur West and Diamond Harbour. While this may make the contest easier for the TMC, since Muslims have backed the party consistently, allegations of corruption during distribution of relief for victims of cyclone Amphan has been made the main election issue by the BJP and the Indian Secular Front founded by cleric Abbasuddin Siddiqui. Magrahat East, Bishnupur, Mandirbazar, Joynagar, Basanti, Kultali and Canning West are reserved for scheduled caste candidates. In these seats, the Left parties had a strong presence till 2016 and the Marxists are desperate to make a comeback. At Raidighi, CPI(M) stalwart and former minister Kanti Ganguly, is contesting the seat again. The CPI(M) is contesting nine seats in South 24 Parganas, including Kultali which witnessed violence in almost all elections in the past. On Monday evening, BJP and TMC workers exchanged allegations of violence at Kultali. In Howrah, where the TMC has a strong presence, only seven seats are going to the polls. Out of these, the BJP intends to put up a tough fight at Udaynarayanpur, Jagatballavpur, Uluberia North and Uluberia South although the size of the Muslim population in these zones can make things difficult for the saffron camp. Actress Tanushree Chakraborty, who joined the BJP in March, has been fielded from Shyampur. The ECI has organised the International Virtual Election Visitors Programme (IEVP) 2021 for foreign election management bodies during the elections in four states and Puducherry on Tuesday. “The ongoing elections in Assam, Kerala, Puducherry, Tamil Nadu and West Bengal have an electorate of over 187.2 million, one of the largest in the world to vote so far amid the Covid-19 pandemic. It is a good opportunity to share our best practices and experience of conduct of our poll process as well as steps taken to mitigate the effect of pandemic,” the ECI said in a statement.

How about responsibility of the CM? Uddhav Thackeray has forfeited the moral responsibility to govern,” Prasad said addressing a press conference.In the resignation letter Deshmukh posted on Twitter, he said that he doesn’t find it morally correct to continue as the home minister after the high court order against him.In March, Singh, in a letter to Thackeray alleged that Deshmukh had asked suspended cop Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore per month from hotels and bars. Singh sent the letter to Thackeray after being transferred to Home Guards, a “low-key” post after mishandling of the case related to explosives being found near Mukesh Ambani’s house in Mumbai in February-end. Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency in the same case and is also being probed in connection with the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran whose car was found near Ambani’s residence.Prasad questioned CM’s silence on the entire issue. “When will CM Udhhav Thackeray speak? The consistent, conspicuous silence of Uddhav Thackeray is itself raising a lot of questions...,” he said.State BJP leader, Devendra Fadnavis too attacked Thackeray. “Why is the chief minister mum? His silence is unsettling.” After the HC order, Fadnavis said, “Truth will come out in the preliminary inquiry. It is improper for Deshmukh to continue as minister after the HC order...”After the HC order, Deshmukh met NCP president Sharad Pawar and expressed his desire to step down as he felt it was inappropriate to continue in office, NCP leader and state minister Nawab Malik said. “Deshmukh went to hand over the letter to Thackeray after Pawar gave his “green signal” to quit,” said Malik. Singh’s allegations are baseless but the party respects the court and hence the minister has quit, Malik said.NCP leader Dilip Walse Patil has been given the charge of the home department.With PTI inputs||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-looks-to-corner-mva-after-bombay-hc-order-on-deshmukh-101617670282666.html
06-04-2021||India||‘It’s pvt property’: SC not keen on staying INS Viraat dismantling||The Supreme Court on Monday indicated that it was not in favour of continuing the stay on the dismantling of India’s first warship, INS Viraat, and asked the petitioner seeking to convert it into a museum to respond within a week to a report submitted by a ship-breaking firm that bought it in an auction last year.The matter will be next heard on April 12.The top court stayed the dismantling of the decommissioned warship on February 10 on a plea made by a private firm, Envitech Marine Consultants, that it intended to convert the warship into a maritime museum.At an auction last July, the central government sold the warship to one Shree Ram Group of Industries, a ship-breaking firm based in Alang, Gujarat, for converting it into scrap at a price of ₹38.54 crore. The ship is currently anchored at Alang port. Subsequent to the stay order passed by the apex court, Shree Ram Group, represented by senior advocate Rajiv Dhavan, submitted on Monday that 35%-40% of the dismantling work has been completed.A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde said on Monday: “We have same sentiments as you (Envitech Marine Consultants) have about our warships. But now it has become a private property. It cannot have the character of a warship anymore.”An inspection of the ship by Marine and Technical Surveyors on February 12 found the vessel to be a “dead structure” not capable of being in seaworthy condition or navigational position. A copy of the report supplied by Shree Ram Industries’ counsel Somanath Padhan said: “Vessel has got severe hull damage in many areas... all kinds of machineries, operational manuals removed from the vessel.”After going through the report, the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, said, “It has been broken after a valid purchase. It is very iniquitous to continue the stay.”Envitech’s managing director, Rupali Sharma, informed the court that they were willing to call experts from abroad to conduct an inspection of the ship.The court gave a week’s time for the petitioner to go through the report presented by the ship-breaking firm and submit a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/its-pvt-property-sc-not-keen-on-staying-ins-viraat-dismantling-101617667358651.html

Consequently, the test positivity rate inched above 5%, the threshold that the World Health Organization identifies as ideal for an outbreak to be considered as under control.“The night curfew is being considered in wake of the resurgence of cases. The government is yet to decide on the exact time during which it will be in force and the date when it will take effect,” said a Delhi government official, asking not to be named.Across the nation, the figures reported from weekend testing was lower than that of Saturday’s, but the country has surpassed the peak seen in the first wave in September.The Union government has now decided to dispatch 50 high-level, multi-disciplinary public health teams to districts across Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh and Punjab, where the situation is particularly worrying.“The teams are being rushed to 30 districts of Maharashtra, 11 districts of Chhattisgarh and 9 districts of Punjab to assist the state health departments and local authorities in Covid-19 surveillance, control and containment measures,” the Union health ministry said in a statement on Monday.This is the biggest contingent of central experts rushed at once since the pandemic began in the country.Ahead of Modi’s meeting with CMs, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan will take a detailed review meeting on Tuesday evening (around 6pm) with of representatives of 11 states where the outbreak is particularly high, the government said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-mulls-night-curfew-pm-modi-to-meet-cms-as-wave-surges-101617666799258.html
06-04-2021||India||Decisive turn in fight against Maoists: Amit Shah||Union home minister Amit Shah on Monday said the sacrifice of 22 security personnel killed in a Maoist ambush over the weekend will be remembered for taking the battle against the extremists to a “decisive turn”, and said that the counter-insurgency battle will be intensified to take it to a “logical end”.The jawans were killed in a gunfight with Maoists in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region as the ultras ambushed the forces after possibly luring them to an area near the Bijapur-Sukma border. The team was attacked when it was out on a combing operation in a forest area.Shah, who visited Chhattisgarh on Monday to review the situation and to pay tributes to those killed in the encounter, chaired a high-level meet at Jagdalpur, the headquarters of Bastar district. Chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and senior officials of the state police and the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were present at the meeting.The home minister said that he wanted to assure people that the fight against Maoists will end in a victory. “Their (the jawans’) supreme sacrifices will not go in vain, and the country will always remember their sacrifice for taking this battle to a decisive turn. In the last few years, the fight against the Maoists has reached a decisive turn and this unfortunate incident has taken the fight two steps ahead,” Shah said.“I want to assure the country that this fight [against Maoists] will not stop... it will continue with more intensity. In this fight, our victory is definite in the end,” Shah said. The Union minister said he paid tributes to the martyred personnel on behalf of the country, the government and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.In Jagdalpur, Shah paid his last respects at the Police Lines, where the mortal remains of 14 jawans were kept in coffins draped with the national flag. Other than Shah, Baghel and senior officials also laid wreaths on the coffins.The latest Maoist attack took place between Jonaguda and Tekalguda villages along the border of Sukma and Bijapur districts in the Bastar region. Out of the 22 fatalities, CRPF lost eight men, including seven commandos of the CoBRA (CRPF’s elite unit) and one jawan of the Bastariya battalion; eight of the other deceased were from the District Reserve Guard (DRG), and six from the Special Task Force (STF).Shah also visited the Basaguda camp of CRPF in Bijapur and later met injured jawans at Raipur hospitals. Thirty-one security personnel were injured in the ambush.The home minister said that, in the review meeting, officials suggested that the intensity of the fight against Maoists should not be hampered, which reflected that the morale of the forces was intact and high.“In the last five-six years, we have achieved success in setting up camps of security forces in the interior areas. Both the central and state governments have been jointly making inroads (into Maoist strongholds). Therefore, such incidents came to the fore out of their (Maoists’) frustration,” Shah said.“On the development front, too, several works have been done. Although due to Covid-19, the pace slowed down a little, but I believe that action is being taken on all suggestions received from tribal public representatives, the Chief Minister and MPs from the state,” he added.He said the central and state governments have been working on both fronts – to expedite the development work in tribal areas and intensified action against the ultras.Prime Minister Modi has already fixed the priority to take this fight to a logical end, he said. Chief minister Baghel said more steps will follow in the future to counter Maoism in the state. “In the last few years, we have managed to establish camps in their core area and more camps will be opened soon. The development works will also be accelerated in the area,” Baghel said.After paying tribute to the security personnel, the CM said the government was with the families of the martyred jawans.Intelligence inputs showed that between 12 and 20 Maoists may have been killed in the encounter.One jawan was still missing after the attack, an official said on condition of anonymity. The security agencies were working to ascertain a claim made by Maoists that they abducted a CoBRA commando after the Saturday ambush, an official told PTI. An official said they have “reasons to believe” that this claim, made over phone on Sunday evening to a journalist based in Bijapur by a purported Maoist group, could be true, the news agency reported.He said multiple units of the security forces were still out in the jungles to look for the commando who hails from Jammu, and also to intercept the movement of the Maoists.With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/decisive-turn-in-fight-against-maoists-amit-shah-101617666422223.html

In 2020, we managed to successfully organise several events in face-to-face and online formats. Summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) and Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (Brics) – a new type of multilateral associations where our countries cooperate fruitfully – are among them.This year, New Delhi holds Brics chairmanship – we wish our Indian friends every success and are willing to contribute in every possible way in this regard. India has also joined the activities of the UN Security Council as its non-permanent member. We intend to continue close interaction within the mentioned forums as well as other international platforms.We hope that the epidemiological situation would allow us to organise a bilateral summit in 2021. The dates of next sessions of the Inter-Governmental Commission on Trade, Economic, Scientific, Technical and Cultural Cooperation, Inter-Governmental Commission on Military and Military and Technical Cooperation and Inter-Parliamentary Commission are under consideration.Given the need to overcome negative consequences of the pandemic for the world and national economies, our definite priorities include intensification of the Russian-Indian practical cooperation in areas such as trade, energy, agriculture, transport, finance and banking, science and technology, humanitarian ties.I am convinced that the negotiations with my colleague Dr Subramaniam Jaishankar during my visit to New Delhi will promote further strengthening of the Special and Privileged Strategic Partnership that unites us.During your recent visit to China, did you come away with any fresh insights from your interactions with the Chinese leadership regarding India-China relations? How does Russia currently see its relations with India and China, especially in view of Moscow’s efforts to help reduce tensions related to the border standoff in Ladakh?We are closely watching the process of normalisation at the Line of Actual Control (LAC), functioning as the India-China border. We welcome the agreements reached after the telephone conversation between the foreign ministers of India and China on February 25, 2021, aimed at resolution of the situation.We highly appreciate the constructive approach demonstrated by both sides. We pay due respect to the intentions of New Delhi and Beijing to act independently and within the frameworks of established multilayer bilateral dialogue mechanisms, without interference from outside. We expect both states as responsible members of the international community to find mutually acceptable political and diplomatic ways to remove existing differences at the earliest.Russia has acknowledged India’s interests in Afghanistan and in efforts to find a solution to the situation in Afghanistan. However, India was not part of the recent “extended Troika” meeting in Moscow, and some even speculated this was done at the behest of Pakistan. What role does Russia see for India in efforts to find a settlement in Afghanistan?India is an important player in the settlement in Afghanistan and undoubtedly should be engaged in international efforts supporting the Afghan national reconciliation.New Delhi is not a participant of the extended “Troika” on Afghanistan, in the framework of which Moscow hosted intra-Afghan consultations on March 18 aimed at facilitation of the launch of peace process in the country. At the same time India is part of the Moscow format uniting the neighbouring states of Afghanistan, key regional countries and the USA. Such a composition allows to coordinate the assistance to national reconciliation process based on broad regional consensus. As the Afghan peace process moves forward, we are planning to resume the work of this mechanism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/russia-closely-watching-lac-developments-foreign-minister-sergey-lavrov-101617658788073.html

Naik, a sweeper working with the hospital for last 30 years, was the first recipient of Covid vaccine in the state, and expectedly, the media and the government made a fuss around him.Beyond the glare of TV cameras, an early milestone in the drive was when renowned doctor and medicine specialist, Chinmay Bijay Kumar Mohanty, 65, who is now serving as Odisha’s director of medical education and training, walked into the vaccination room at the hospital, and said he wanted to volunteer as an early recipient.He lifted the left arm of his half-sleeved shirt, and a nurse administered the Covaxin shot.“There was no pain whatsoever, much lesser than what one would experience after getting a shot of Tetanus toxoid. When there is no particular medicine available for Covid, vaccination is necessary,” said Mohanty.Click here for complete coverage on Covid-19“When I took the shot, an additional director who accompanied me looked scared. But he took the shot soon after my turn, perhaps thinking if a 65-year-old man can take it, anyone can. Almost all my friends have taken the shot after my prodding -- not even a single close friend is left so far. They know that, being a doctor, I have not been carried away by the publicity surrounding the vaccine. If we compared the side effects of vaccines for Measles, Diptheria, Rabies, Mumps, Tetanus and Influenza with Covid, it is much safer,” he said.Several other doctors, including the director of Capital Hospital, Dr Laxmidhar Sahu, neurosurgeon Dr Ashok Mohapatra, and director of AIIMS-Bhubaneswar, Dr Gitanajali Batmanbane, also took the shot on the first day. A little over 16,000 health care workers in the state were vaccinated on January 16.Mohanty said he never had any doubts about the need to get the shot, even though he had already been infected with Covid-19. “In my 40-year-old medical career, I was never hospitalised. But in October last year, I got Covid, and spent 10 days in ICU. Being a doctor, I know the benefits of a vaccine. I am have mild diabetes and cholesterol. So I was waiting for it; I consider myself lucky that I was among the first doctors to take it on Day 1. I had no reaction whatsoever,” he said.Also Read | What science tells us about Covid-19 vaccinesMohanty’s sister-in-law, nephew and younger brother, too, were infected with Covid-19, and have now been vaccinated.After taking the vaccine, Mohanty started inspiring others to take the jab as soon as they became eligible, without delay.“People are always scared of a new thing. But people should trust doctors. We are living in a world where there will always be microorganisms. We have to survive among them, and fight with the harmful ones. A vaccine is our best hope of fighting such pathogens and we should fight with a positive hope,” he said.A common question people ask, Mohanty says, is which shot is better, Covaxin or Covishield. Mohanty’s standard reply is that both the vaccines work well, and one should take either shot without any hesitancy — regardless of whether one was infected with Covid-19 in the past or not.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-is-our-best-hope-doc-leads-the-way-in-battle-against-hesitancy-101617657011304.html

According to the ED, the attached assets include land, factory premises, machinery and other properties belonging to two companies -- M/s Ispat Damodar Private Limited and M/s Sonic Thermal Private Limited. “Investigation revealed that Majee had transferred funds worth ₹67.80 crore to these companies under the guise of share purchase of these companies required to acquire assets of these companies. The manufacturing plants of both these companies are situated in West Bengal’s Purulia and Bankura. Majee later transferred funds worth ₹98.06 crore to both these companies,” read the ED statement. “The investigation also found that the transfer of funds to these companies were generated through illegal coal mining and the transactions were layered through a maze of shell companies,” it added. The Enforcement Directorate took up the investigation based on an FIR registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation last year. The agency recently arrested Vikas Mishra, the brother of Trinamool Congress leader Vinay Mishra, and Bankura inspector Ashok Mishra in connection with the same case. Several people associated with the Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders, including party MP Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Banerjee and his in-laws, are under the scanner of central agencies with connection to the coal scam. Anup Majee could not be reached for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-attaches-165-cr-assets-of-anup-majee-in-coal-mining-case-101617649034947.html

The Bahujan Samaj Party legislator from Mau will be lodged in Banda jail where the CCTVs were being installed and repaired.“Mukhtar Ansari is currently lodged in Ropar jail in Punjab. The Uttar Pradesh government approached the Supreme Court, which ordered the transfer of Ansari from Punjab to UP. In line with Supreme Court’s order, Ansari will be brought to his home state in tight security and will be lodged in a jail here,” said Prashant Kumar, additional director general of police (ADG) law and order, Uttar Pradesh.Ansari faces trial in several cases in the state, officials said.IG Chitrakoot range K Satyanarayana, who sent the team on Monday morning, said the shifting will take place amid tight security arrangements.ADG Kumar said, “Recently in Barabanki, he has been named in a case. Ansari committed heinous crimes in Purvanchal in the past, including the killing of police personnel.”Punjab’s home department in a letter had asked the Uttar Pradesh government to take custody of Ansari from the Ropar jail on or before April 8.It had written to the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (home) following a March 26 Supreme Court order that directed the Punjab government to transfer Ansari to UP’s Banda jail in two weeks from the Ropar prison, where he has been since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.Acting superintendent of the Banda district jail Pramod Tiwari said all arrangements have been made in Barrack Number-15 to lodge Ansari. “No other prisoner can reach this barrack,” said Tiwari.“Three prison guards will be deployed inside the barrack,” he added.In the letter, the Punjab home department had asked the Uttar Pradesh additional chief secretary (Home) for suitable arrangements to be made for Ansari’s transfer.It also said that Ansari suffered from certain medical conditions and the same may be kept in mind while making arrangements for his transfer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/100-armed-cops-leave-for-punjab-to-bring-ansari-back-to-up-jail-101617648976391.html
06-04-2021||India||SC raps CBI over delay in filing appeal in graft case||The Supreme Court on Monday questioned the Central Bureau of Investigation’s “competence” as a “premier investigating agency” while reproaching it over delay in filing an appeal against acquittal of a government employee in a corruption case.“Why is CBI so incompetent when it considers itself to be the premier investigating agency?” a bench headed by Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul asked additional solicitor general RS Suri, who appeared for the central agency.The bench, which also included Justice Hemant Gupta, observed that it was amusing to come across the delay of almost a year in filing the appeal in a case that was now being pitched as a “very important” matter.Suri said that the problems were being addressed in the agency and some “reshaping” was also being done.The bench, however, replied: “This so-called reshaping has been happening for quite some time but to us, it does not seem to be happening at all.”Justice Kaul asked the ASG whether any action has been taken against the officers responsible for causing delay of 314 days in filing the appeal against the order of acquittal by the Delhi high court in May, 2019. “And if you have done nothing about the delay, why should we not dismiss it? We cannot let you walk in whenever you want,” the judge added.Suri responded by saying that dismissal of the appeal on the ground of delay would result in letting two criminals go scot free even though they stood convicted by the trial court. He added that the agency was willing to abide by any order of the court in this regard.“If that be the position, first it is the CBI which has to show some seriousness in the matter of fixing responsibility on the persons responsible for the inordinate delay of 314 days in filing the special leave petition,” stated the court in its order.The bench told the ASG that it would consider admitting the CBI’s appeal only after they conduct an inquiry and fasten accountability on those responsible for the delay.It noted in its order: “There is delay of 314 days for which no satisfactory explanation has been forthcoming. We are dealing with a premier investigating agency, the CBI!…We thus direct the CBI to hold an enquiry; fix the responsibility and place that before us, before requesting us to issue notice.”The court gave CBI two months to complete its inquiry and place a report before it.The case relates to an alleged complicity between CB Singh, who was posted as junior engineer in the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD) between 2000 and 2001, and co-accused Rajvir Singh, a private builder who constructed flats without any approved sanctioned plan.The investigation was entrusted to the CBI by an order of the Delhi high court in 2006, following which the duo was booked and charge sheeted. A trial court in Delhi held them guilty of corruption and criminal conspiracy and sentenced them to three years each in jail in March 2016. But the Delhi high court reversed this decision in 2019 and set them free, prompting the CBI to file an appeal in the top court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-raps-cbi-over-delay-in-filing-appeal-in-graft-case-101617648975070.html

The Congress can confront the divisive forces who are damaging and destroying all that India has stood for and represented for twenty centuries and more,” Gandhi said in a statement. Kerala goes to the polls on April 6.Gandhi has not participated in the Congress’s campaign for the ongoing elections due to the prevailing Covid-19 situation.In her appeal to the voters, Gandhi also said a vote for the UDF is “a vote for the future of Kerala” and for “preserving its democratic traditions and its secular values”, adding that the Congress-led alliance will bring Kerala back on the path of development and ensure a “decent, guaranteed monthly income to all families but particularly to the poor and the disadvantaged, to the scheduled castes and scheduled tribes, to fishermen and women, to widows and the aged”.The Kerala election is crucial for the Congress as a victory could consolidate Rahul Gandhi’s grip over the party that has suffered frictions between the old guard and the young leaders over the functioning of the party.The Congress chief also spoke about the NYAY scheme — the assured income scheme that was pegged as the main plank of the party in its 2019 campaign — saying: “The Congress will make the “NYAY SCHEME” the edifice of the next UDF government. This will ensure a guaranteed monthly income for each family in the state, particularly for families belonging to the poor and disadvantaged sections.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sonia-appeals-to-kerala-voters-to-bring-udf-govt-strengthen-the-cong-nationally-101617648857567.html

The exercise comes at a time when China is making concerted efforts to strengthen its presence in IOR. Two Indian warships and a long-range maritime patrol aircraft are taking part in the French Navy-led exercise called La Pérouse for the first time.“Participation by the Indian Navy in the exercise demonstrates the shared values with friendly navies ensuring freedom of seas and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order,” Commander Vivek Madhwal said.India, the US, Japan and Australia constitute the Quadrilateral security dialogue or Quad. China has been wary of the Quad that was revived in late 2017. And Beijing’s suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019.Indian warships INS Satpura (with an embarked helicopter) and INS Kiltan, and a Boeing P-8I submarine hunter aircraft are taking part in the three-day exercise being held from April 5 to April 7.France is represented at the multi-lateral exercise by amphibious assault ship Tonnerre and frigate Surcouf; the US Navy has sent its amphibious transport dock USS Somerset for the drills; Australia has deployed its frigate HMAS Anzac and tanker Sirius; and Japan has sent Akebono, a destroyer, for the drills.“Exercise La Pérouse will witness complex and advanced naval operations including surface warfare, anti-air warfare and air defence exercises, weapons-firing exercises, cross-deck flying operations, tactical manoeuvres and seamanship evolutions such as replenishment at sea,” Madhwal added.Last November, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said a “great power competition” was playing out vigorously in IOR, where the navy has stepped up surveillance to check China’s ambitions.“IOR is one of the most militarised regions… Also, there are differing interpretations of international laws and there is this fear that ‘Global Commons’ can change to ‘Contested Seas’, threatening free flow of commerce and trade,” the navy chief then said.Former navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retd) described the French Navy-led drills, involving the participation of the Quad navies, as a positive development, and a message to China.He said, “So far, naval cooperation in IOR has been limited to the Quad. The presence of France is an expression of intent of other European powers to be there in IOR and send a message to China. Other countries like the United Kingdom are also deploying to the region for drills.”From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in IOR, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-navies-join-france-led-drills-in-indian-ocean-region-101617648856955.html
06-04-2021||India||Rafale deal: Cong, BJP trade barbs as report says €1 mn paid to ‘middleman’||A report in Mediapart, a French online journal, late on Sunday claimed that Dassault Aviation, which manufactures the Rafale jet, paid €1 million to a Sushen Gupta, described as a “middleman”, in connection with the ₹59,000 crore deal for 36 jets for the Indian Air Force.The Congress demanded an independent investigation into the matter even as law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed the report “baseless”. Gupta, whose name figures in the Agusta Westland charge sheet, did not respond to queries seeking comment.Mediapart claimed that the money was paid for the manufacture of 50 large replica models of Rafale jets, even though Dassault provided inspectors of French anti-corruption agency Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA) with no proof that these models were made. The reporter who wrote the article, Yann Philippin said he found it very “suspicious” that the discovery was “covered up by AFA, which did not report it to French prosecutors”.A spokesperson for Dassault Aviation did not respond to a HT query on the Mediapart report.The report is the latest controversy to dog the deal, and Philippin said it was the first of three parts with the second part focusing on the way the French justice system dealt with initial “suspicions” that rose in 2018, and the third , “on the deal itself and what happened behind the scenes”.India ordered the jets in September 2016 as an emergency purchase through a government-to-government deal.The Mediapart report said AFA inspectors were surprised when they came across a “suspect payment” of €508,925 listed against the head “gifts to clients”.“Mediapart understands that during a scheduled audit of the group, the agency’s inspectors found that Dassault had agreed to pay €1 million to a middleman just after the 2016 signing of the Rafale fighter jet deal. That middleman is now accused of money laundering in India in another defence deal,” the report said.According to Mediapart, AFA decided not to refer the matter to French prosecutors even though a subsequent confidential report of the agency found that the amount of €508,925 “seemed disproportionate in relation to all the other entries” under the same heading.“The sum is indeed huge for a gift. Though French law does not set out precise limits, legal precedents suggest that giving a watch or an expensive meal costing several hundred euros can be enough to constitute corruption,” the Mediapart report said.It said to justify the “gift”, Dassault supplied the AFA with a “proforma invoice” of March 30, 2017, which was given by an Indian company called Defsys Solutions. “This invoice, which related to 50% of the total order (€1,017,850), was for the manufacture of 50 models of the Rafale C, with a price per unit of €20,357,” Mediapart said, quoting the AFA report.According to the French report, AFA questioned Dassault, but the jet-makers have not been able to answer the queries.The Mediapart report claimed that Defsys belongs to the Gupta family, whose members have acted as middlemen in the aeronautical and defence industries for three generations. It said two Indian media reports from January 2019 revealed that one family member, Sushen Gupta, who operated as an agent for Dassault, worked on the Rafale contract and allegedly obtained confidential documents from India’s Ministry of Defence. Gupta was investigated by Indian agencies over his role in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam.ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are probing allegations of money laundering in the 2007 contract for the purchase of 12 luxury VIP helicopters for use by top political leaders, including the President, the Prime Minister, and former PMs. The deal was cancelled in early 2014 over allegations of wrongdoing. Among the people named in the charge sheets filed by ED is Ratul Puri, the nephew of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and senior Congress leader Kamal Nath.Referring to the Mediapart article, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said: “Was the payment of €1.1 million shown by Dassault as ‘gifts to clients’ in reality a commission paid to middleman for the Rafale Deal? How can ‘middleman’ and ‘payment of commission’ be permitted in a ‘government to government defence contract’ or in any defence procurement in India in violation of the mandatory defence procurement procedure?”Arguing that the latest media report vitiated the Rafale deal, Surjewala said the revelation entailed imposition of heavy financial penalties on Dassault, banning of the company, registration of an FIR and other penal consequences.“Does it now not require a full and independent investigation into India’s biggest defence deal to find out as to how much bribery and commission in reality, if any, was paid and to whom in the Indian government?” the Congress said, asking if Prime Minister Narendra Modi would answer to the nation on this.After the report was released, Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad called it baseless and said, “It’s completely baseless. The Supreme Court, CAG found nothing wrong [in the deal].”This is not Mediapart’s first article on the deal.In October 2018, it raised questions about the offset contract that was part of the Rafale deal. It said a senior official in Dassault Aviation saw the partnership with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group as “imperative and mandatory” to getting the “export contract” with India for the Rafale aircraft.After the latest article, the Congress has demanded that the standard procedure—lodging an FIR, independent investigation and related moves—must follow and reminded the government that during the UPA rule, then defence minister AK Antony had followed the stipulated procedure in the case of AgustaWestland.The Opposition party said that defence procurement has an “integrity clause” that says there can be no middleman or payment of commission or bribe.Union minister Prasad said, “Is Congress again talking about Rafale? It lost case in Supreme Court. The CAG has also rejected the charges. In 2019 polls they displayed Rafale models everywhere and said so much against the PM. Yet, the lost the polls.”“I had once said that Rahul Gandhi doesn’t do his homework. It now looks like the Congress spokespersons also don’t do it. As you all know corporate rivalry goes on in France. But the most interesting thing is that the article mentions Sushen Gupta. Who is Gupta? He was arrested over Agusta Westland in 2019 by our government. And the name of (Gandhi) family members came up in Agusta Westland case. And (former foreign minister) Salman Khurshid has publicly acknowledged that he knows Gupta’s family. So, I want to tell the Congress to do proper homework before you speak,” said Prasad.The National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).The deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL.The Supreme Court heard a publc interest case on the deal and in November 2019, said it saw nothing wrong in it. In a February 2019 report, the government’s auditor, the Comptroller and Auditor General of India audited the deal and said India had not overpaid for the jets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rafale-deal-cong-bjp-trade-barbs-as-report-says-1-mn-paid-to-middleman-101617648734959.html

06-04-2021||India||India records third warmest March in 121 yrs: IMD||The month of March this year was the third warmest in 121 years, after 2004 and 2010, with an average maximum temperature of 32.6 degree C, 1.4 degree C above normal, the India Meteorological Department said on Monday.The monthly average maximum, minimum and mean temperature in March this year was 32.65 degree C, 19.95 degree C and 26.30 degree C respectively, against the normal of 31.24 degree C, 18.87 degree C and 25.06 degree C based on the climatology for 1981 to 2010 period, the IMD said. The temperatures were above normal in all subdivisions of northwest, central, eastern and north-eastern India but in parts of peninsular India they were below normal, the weather department added. In 2004, the average maximum temperature for March was 32.82 degree C and in 2010 it was 33.09 degree C.Heat wave conditions were recorded in many parts of the country in March with severe heat wave at isolated places occurred over West Rajasthan during March 29 to 31. Heat wave conditions were recorded over east Rajasthan during March 30 to 31, over Odisha and adjoining parts of Gangetic west Bengal, Coastal Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu on March 31. The highest maximum temperature of 44.6 degree C was recorded at Baripada, Odisha on March 30.The months of January and February were also the third warmest since 1901 when mean temperatures are considered and the second warmest in the past 120 years when minimum or early morning temperatures are considered, the IMD said in its earlier report. Through January, February and March, La Nina, a global meteorological phenomenon was prevailing which is associated with colder winters and generally milder temperatures. But this year’s warming trend has possibly overshadowed the cooling effect of La Nina.“One of the main reasons for record high temperatures being recorded since January is scanty rains. When there is less rain air is dry and warm,” said M Mohapatra, director general, IMD.“It’s difficult to say why temperatures are so high despite La Nina conditions being moderate. La Nina has started weakening now. It is (the impact of) climate change signature on temperature patterns. You can see that temperatures in the south peninsula didn’t rise as much because of clouding and rain,” OP Sreejith, scientist, climate monitoring and prediction group had said in March about warmer than usual winter.For April, IMD has forecast high probability of above normal maximum temperatures over most subdivisions of northwest, north along the plains of Himalayas, east, west and central India and below normal maximum temperatures over most subdivisions of south Peninsular India, northeast India and few subdivisions of extreme north India.Western disturbance (WD) activity in March was higher than normal as a total of 7 WDs moved across Western Himalayan Region against the normal of four WDs. Out of 7 WDs, 3 WDs were very active and had moved as a cyclonic circulation but rainfall over the country as a whole for March was 16.7 mm, which is 45% less than its Long Period Average (LPA) of 30.4 mm. Week by week rainfall data in March 2021 shows that consecutively past four weeks in the season, India recorded deficient rainfall over the entire country.All three active WDs, however, caused scattered to fairly widespread rainfall and thunderstorm activity over Western Himalayan region during the period and movement of these systems to eastward and formation of its induced cyclonic circulation over northwest Rajasthan in association with these WDs, caused isolated to scattered rainfall/thunderstorm activity over adjoining plains of northwest India during the same period. Dust raising strong surface winds prevailed during March 30 to 31 over parts of Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh.In March, moderate La Niña conditions were prevailing over equatorial Pacific and Sea Surface Temperatures (SSTs) were below normal over central & eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. El Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns such as heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Nino is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Nina is associated with strong monsoon and above average rains and colder winters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-records-3rd-warmest-march-in-121-yrs-imd-101617648676287.html

One CoBRA jawan has remained missing since the attack.Inspector general of police, Bastar Range, Sunderaj P said the state police were committed to bringing the commando back if the reports of him being abducted were confirmed. “After the Jonaguda-Tekalgurem operations on Saturday, whereabouts of one CoBRA jawan couldn’t be ascertained. Efforts are on to trace his location and bring him back safely. We have taken cognisance of the information that the missing CoBRA jawan has been abducted by Maoists. We are committed to bring back the jawan safely. Security forces are equally committed for peace and development of Bastar region,” he said.A top officer in the security establishment told PTI that they have “reasons to believe” the abduction claim made over phone on Sunday evening to a journalist based in Bijapur by a purported Maoist group was true. “However, we do not have concrete evidence to substantiate the claim made by some Maoist elements that he [the jawan] has been taken away by them,” the officer added.Meanwhile, the family members of the jawan, who belongs to Lower Barnai region of the Jammu district, have appealed to his abductors to release him.“I spoke to my husband on Friday at around 9.30pm and he told me that he is packing his bag and food for an operation and will talk to me the next day. Following the attack [on Saturday], a local reporter from Chhattisgarh called me and asked whether I want to say something to the Maoists because he informed me that he will take our appeal to them. I told him that I want to request them [Maoists] to release him,” said the jawan’s wife.She said that she has not been provided any information from the officials. “The CRPF Group Centre at Bantalab has not informed us anything about his whereabouts. All of us are very worried,” she said.The CoBRA jawan joined the CRPF in March 2011. He was transferred to Chhattisgarh three months ago. He was earlier posted in Assam.CRPF’s Jammu sector spokesperson and deputy commandant Shivnandan Singh said: “The jawan remains missing. We are getting reports from the media that he is probably with Maoists. The search operations are on to trace him.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-attack-search-on-for-missing-jawan-cops-do-not-rule-out-abduction-101617648675573.html
06-04-2021||India||PM Modi to hold meet with CMs as infections rise||Prime Minister Narendra Modi will hold an emergency meeting with chief ministers of all states on Thursday in the wake of the surge in coronavirus cases in most parts of the country.The upcoming virtual meeting comes just three weeks after his interaction – of the shortest interval – with the chief ministers on March 17 to discuss the progress in vaccination and measures to tackle the second wave in some parts of the country.While the country registered 35,871 fresh cases on March 17, it breached the one-lakh mark for the first time with 103,558 cases on Sunday. The overall tally stood at 12,589,067 on Monday, according to the Union health ministry.In the upcoming meeting, the Prime Minister is expected to emphasise the strict enforcement of Covid-19 protocols and check the fatigue that has set in after a year’s tackling of the pandemic, an official who is familiar with the development said, preferring anonymity. A presentation is likely to be made on the rapid surge in cases and the trend of the latest outbreak, the official added.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageFollowing the March 17 meeting, the vaccination programme was widened to cover citizens above the age of 45. The inoculation of this latest priority group began on April 1.Modi and the chief ministers are also likely to discuss how to hasten the vaccination drive, on Thursday, the official cited above said.On Sunday, the Prime Minister held an internal review on the Covid situation.A meeting between cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba and officials of 11 “states of grave concern” were also held last Friday. During this interaction, the states were given a 19-point action plan that included increased Covid testing to bring down the positivity rate to 5 per cent or less, conducting 70 per cent of the tests using RT-PCR method and creation of more containment zones.In the same meeting, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla had expressed anguish over the situation and observed that even amid the spike in cases, none of the states and Union territories had shown “commensurate increase in enforcement of containment activities. Dr V K Paul, member of NITI Aayog, emphasised that states follow a protocol for sharing clinical and epidemiological data for a detailed of the mutant strains of the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-to-hold-meet-with-cms-as-infections-rise-101617648674987.html
06-04-2021||India||C’garh Maoist attack a retaliation to increased presence of forces: Officials||The actions of the security forces who have opened 24 new ‘permanent camps’ in the Naxal hotbed of Bastar-Sukma region in the last four years, bringing approximately 600 square kilometres of area inside the deep forest under control, is what perhaps ‘irked’ the Maoist and Saturday’s attack was a sign of their desperation, people familiar with the development said.Twenty-two police and paramilitary personnel were killed and at least two dozen others injured in a gunfight with Maoists in Bastar region as the extremists ambushed the forces after possibly luring them to an area near the Bijapur-Sukma border on Saturday. One jawan was missing after the attack.The 1,200 square km long Bastar-Sukma belt in Chhattisgarh is considered to be the stronghold of the current Maoist movement in the country.Also Read | Chhattisgarh Maoist attack: How a Sikh jawan, hit with bullets, took off his turban to bandage colleague’s woundsWhile four camps of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) were opened in Bijapur and Sukma in February 2021 alone, six others were set up in 2017, nine in 2018, one in 2019 and four in 2020. The areas where these new camps were operationalised include Galgam, Elarmagdu, Minapa, Mukram Nala, Bhadrimau, Punjer Nala, Pushpal, Vishrampuri, Netanar, Koleng Nala, Mugapadar, Palodi, Pamed and Tarrem among others, and are now under the control of the forces in Chhattisgarh.Having a permanent base inside the forest – each camp has a strength of a company of around 100 personnel – allowed the CRPF, Chhattisgarh Police and specialized units to reduce travel time after operations and area domination exercises, one of the officers cited above said, preferring anonymity.Besides the Bastar-Sukma belt, dozens of new “permanent camps” were set up in other Maoist hotbeds, including the 2,000 sq km AOB (Andhra-Odisha border) area, 4,500 sq km Abujmaad forest area and Jharkhand in the last four years, due to which the Maoists are ‘irked’, another officer said on the condition of anonymity.“Having a permanent camp not only gives an edge as Maoists cannot ambush these easily because they are fully equipped and back-up is always (available) nearby, but they are key to civic authorities taking development work to the remote villages so that the government’s benefits can reach the last person. Maoists do not want development work to take place and let people live in isolation,” K Durga Prasad, former director general of CRPF, said.Also Read | Drone shows tractor trolleys used to carry up to 20 dead Maoists: OfficialsExperts on anti-Naxal operations believe the camps are not the sole reasons why the ‘red ultras’ are peeved but due to several factors, including a string of coordinated operations in the last four to five years, better intelligence sharing between agencies, disruption of their logistics chains like weapons, money and food items, a leadership crisis as well as massive crackdown on alleged ‘urban naxals’ that have played a role in waning their influence.The number of districts from where Maoists’ violence is reported now range from 50 to 54 only, as compared to over 100 districts until a few years back. An internal study by CRPF ‘Countering Maoism – Way Ahead’, reviewed by HT, said that the ‘surrender of many senior Maoist leaders such as Tech Ramanna and Pahad Singh has affected the morale of the Maoists negatively’.It added that the shrinking of the security vacuum areas is being witnessed, particularly in south Sukma where the forces have achieved a deeper penetration with longer stay in the zone without any contact with Maoists.According to government data, there has been a 70 per cent decline in Maoist-related violence in the country – from 2,258 incidents in 2009 to 665 in 2020.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during the annual Director Generals/Inspector Generals (DGs/IGs) conference of Intelligence Bureau 2019, had asked agencies to monitor the internet-related activities of urban naxals as well as collect data of their trips abroad.Last year, the National Investigation Agency chargesheeted several Left-leaning activists and academicians, including Shoma Sen, Surendra Gadling, Sudhir Dhawale, Rona Wilson, Arun Ferreira, Vernon Gonsalves, Sudha Bhardwaj and Varavara Rao for their alleged links with Maoists.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cgarh-maoist-attack-a-retaliation-to-increased-presence-of-forces-officials-101617648615741.html
06-04-2021||India||Sputnik maker ties up with Indian firm to produce 100 mn doses||The makers of Russian Covid-19 vaccine, Sputnik V, have tied up with another Indian vaccine manufacturer, Panacea Biotec, to produce 100 million doses of their Covid-19 vaccine. The vaccine has shown an efficacy of 91.6%.“Vaccine partnerships are the only way to overcome the pandemic. The world continues its fight against coronavirus and we see a growing interest in Sputnik V vaccine as it is one of the best vaccines available. Cooperation with Panacea Biotec is an important step to produce the vaccine in India and to supply our international partners around the world,” said Kirill Dmitriev, chief executive officer, RDIF.Production of Sputnik V at Panacea Biotec sites will help facilitate global supply of Sputnik V to international partners of Russian Development Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, RDIF said in a statement.Till date, Sputnik V has been registered in 59 countries. In India, RDIF has already tied up with fivelocal companies-- Dr Reddy’s, Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma and Virchow Biotech-- for Sputnik V.“We are pleased to collaborate with RDIF to produce Sputnik V for global markets. Panacea Biotec brings decades of vaccine manufacturing and distribution know-how to scale-up Sputnik V supplies. Panacea Biotec will produce Sputnik V in its internationally accredited facilities complying to strict GMP standards and prequalified by WHO,” said Rajesh Jain, managing director, Panacea Biotec.Sputnik V developed by the Gamaleya National Research Institute of Epidemiology and Microbiology was registered by the Ministry of Health of Russia and became the world’s first registered vaccine against Covid-19 based on the established human adenoviral vector platform.In September 2020, Dr Reddy’s and RDIF entered a partnership to conduct the clinical trials of the Sputnik V vaccine and the rights for distribution in India. In February this year, Dr Reddy’s applied to India’s drugs regulator for emergency use authorization of Sputnik V in the country. The application is still pending with the drugs controller, as the subject expert committee has sought more data from the clinical trials.Once approved, Sputnik V will be the third vaccine that will be used in India’s Covid-19 immunisation programme that was launched on January 16, this year.Meanwhile, Zydus Cadila on Monday also announced that it has sought national drugs controller’s approval for use of its viral hepatitis drug in treating Covid-19 patients as its phase 3 clinical trials with the drug showed promising results.According to the company, 91.15% of patients treated with Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b, PegiHepTM were reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) negative by day 7 as compared to 78.90% on the standard of care arm in its phase 3 trials. Also, the drug reduced the duration for supplemental oxygen to 56 hours from 84 hours in moderate Covid-19 patients.“…the interim results indicate that PegIFN, when administered early on, could help patients recover faster avoiding much of the complications seen in the advanced stages of the disease. PegIFN in COVID19 has several add-on advantages compared to other anti-viral agents. The treatment regimen would be less cumbersome and more affordable for patients as Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b, is a single dose regimen. It would also ensure better compliance,” said the company in a statement.The drug— PegIFN— has well-established safety with multiple doses in chronic hepatitis B and C patients over the years.Aging reduces the body’s ability to produce Interferon Alpha in response to viral infections and may be associated with higher mortality in elderly patients. If given early during infection, the drug can replace this deficiency and aid a faster recovery process.Patients on Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b during the trial also showed lesser need for supplemental oxygen, indicating that it was able to control respiratory distress and failure that has been one of the major challenges in treating Covid-19.“The findings are in line with recently reported importance of early IFN treatment given in combination with steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 (Lu et al, Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy (2021) 6:107, a Nature publication. With these positive results, the Company has applied for an approval for additional indication with the DCGI for the use of PegIFN in the treatment of COVID 19,” said the company.The Phase 3 trials were conducted on 250 patients across 20-25 centres in India, and the company is in the process of publishing detailed results of the trials in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.“We are encouraged by the results of Phase 3 study of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2b which has confirmed the potential to reduce virus titres when given earlier in the disease. With Indian Innovation at the forefront helping the country fight the pandemic with diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, this marks an important milestone. At Zydus, we stand committed to our endeavour of supporting patients and caregivers with access to treatment options that are affordable and can help in better disease management of COVID 19 at different stages,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-maker-ties-up-with-indian-firm-to-produce-100-mn-doses-101617648615123.html
06-04-2021||India||Consider meet on CBI chief before May 2: SC||The Supreme Court on Monday expressed its concern at one of India’s top federal investigating agencies, the Central Bureau of Investigation, continuing to work under an interim chief, and asked it why a new one could not be appointed this month itself.“In-charge arrangement for the CBI director cannot go on...why can’t you do it earlier? You must consider doing it before May 2,” the bench told attorney general KK Venugopal, who represented the Centre in the top court, which was hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) by NGO Common Cause on the appointment of a a full-time CBI director.Not finding favour with the government’s submission that it would continue with an ad-hoc arrangement till the ongoing assembly elections end in the first week of May (results are to be announced on May 2), the bench of justices L Nageswara Rao and Vineet Saran wanted to know why a meeting of the selection committee to pick the new director can’t be held in the current month itself.The selection committee comprises the prime minister, the chief justice of India (CJI) and the leader of the single largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha. The tenure of former CBI director Rishi Kumar Shukla ended on February 3. A day later, Gujarat cadre IPS officer and additional director Praveen Sinha was appointed as the interim chief of the agency.On Monday, Venugopal submitted that the meeting of the selection committee was scheduled for May 2 and that after Shukla’s retirement, the senior most person in the agency was made in-charge.“The acting chief is there is because of the convenience of all the members of the selection committee, including the CJI,” said Venugopal.But Venugopal’s statements did not go down well with advocate Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for the petitioner.Also Read | CBI team to reach Mumbai on Tuesday to probe Anil Deshmukh“First, they have violated the Supreme Court’s order which was clear that there cannot be an acting chief of CBI. Second, why has the meeting been fixed on May 2? Is it to supersede the present CJI and wait for the next chief to sit over the meeting? There has to be a reason why they want the present CJI not to oversee this appointment,” Bhushan contended. CJI SA Bobde is set to retire on April 23. Justice NV Ramana will take over on April 24.Bhushan’s arguments triggered an intervention from solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who also appeared for the government and the department of personnel and training (DoPT).“I strongly object to such insinuations . This is an abuse of the process of law. What kind of public interest is being advanced by abusing all institutions ? Such submissions challenge the majesty of this court. What is his locus? ,” submitted Mehta.Mehta added that the meeting of the selection committee was deferred since there were elections going on in various states and the appointment might have some repercussions.However, the court remained unimpressed with the law officers’ explanation. “Why can’t you do it early?. You must do it before May. Consider this...There is a point in what Bhushan says that there is no concept of having an acting chief,” retorted the bench.Asking the government to put on record its formal reply , the bench posted the matter on April 16 and said that it would pass the final order on the next date of hearing.The PIL has sought a direction to the Centre “to appoint a regular director of CBI forthwith by following the procedure laid down in Section 4A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946, as amended by the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, 2013.”Under the amended law, the CBI director’s appointment has to be made on the recommendation of the PM, leader of the single largest Opposition party and the CJI (or a Supreme Court judge nominated by the CJI).The NGO has also urged the apex court to direct the Centre to, in the future, initiate and complete the process of selection of the CBI director well in advance -- at least one to two months before the date on which the vacancy occurs .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/consider-meet-on-cbi-chief-before-may-2-sc-101617648495026.html

Due to the sudden spike, private hospitals are fast running out of hospital beds while the occupancy in government ones has seen a sharp rise, the daily health bulletin revealed.Data available with the state health department showed that while only 216 new cases were reported from across the state on February 26, the daily count rose to 1,957 on April 4. The number of active cases stood at 4,608 on March 27 but increased to 10,153 on April 4.While polling for the first two phases for 60 seats are over, six more phases are yet to be conducted. The third phase, covering 31 constituencies across three districts, will be held on Tuesday.“With elections underway, political parties are organising public rallies and road shows everyday where thousands of people are gathering. Precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks have taken a back seat. Under such circumstances, there has been a staggering rise in Covid cases,” Sukumar Mukherjee, member of an expert committee set up in 2020 to advise chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Covid-related matters, said.On February 26, Bengal reported three deaths while on April 4, it registered four.Only 198 out of 6,736 beds (around 3 per cent) were occupied in government hospitals on February 26. However, the occupancy rate rose to nearly 12 per cent with 665 out of 5,604 beds booked on April 3.The situation appeared to be worse in private hospitals. On February 26, only around 25 per cent of the 1,007 hospital beds were occupied. In the wake of the spike, hospitals gradually began to increase the number of beds and 659 out of 1,077 beds (around 61 per cent) were booked on April 3. At least 11 hospitals in and around Kolkata have run out of beds.As witnessed in the past, maximum cases were reported from Kolkata and North 24 Parganas. Of the 1,957 infections on April 4, around 56 per cent were reported from these two districts. While the daily Covid count stood at 634 in Kolkata, it was 462 in North Parganas.The state government has ramped up testing from around 20,000 in February-end to over 26,000 now.“While on one hand, we need to increase our testing, we also need to go for contact tracing of the infected persons. Isolation of the infected person and a proper surveillance is very important. All these have taken a back seat along with maintaining safety protocols as a result of which, the cases are rising,” Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cases-spike-in-bengal-amid-election-season-officials-say-norms-flouted-101617648314976.html
06-04-2021||India||Only 11% people say compliance to social distancing norms, masks is good: Survey||Only one in three respondents to a survey on compliance with Covid appropriate behaviour believe that people are adhering to social distancing norms and wearing masks in their districts. The survey by community social media platform, LocalCircles, suggested that compliance to social distancing norms and wearing masks was better at vaccination centres but still falls below the standards needed to stop the disease from spreading.The survey findings based on responses from people living in metros, towns and rural areas coincides with an alarming surge in cases of coronavirus disease being reported from several parts of the country, prompting calls for aggressive enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviours in public such as masking and social distancing to help slow down its spread.The LocalCircles survey report said only 11% of respondents felt there was “good compliance” to both social distancing and wearing a mask in their city or district. Another 23% said there was “limited compliance to both; wearing a mask and social distancing”.The proportion of people who felt that there was effective compliance to wearing masks at vaccination centres was higher. Nearly 74% of respondents said there was effective compliance to wearing masks at vaccination centres but only 44% felt that said compliance to social distancing norms was effective.“The findings of the poll indicated that 44% of citizens feel that there is effective compliance to wearing a mask when travelling at airports, railway stations, or bus stands. Only 15% said compliance to social distancing norms is effective,” a statement by LocalCircles said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-11-people-say-compliance-to-social-distancing-norms-masks-is-good-survey-101617639491447.html
06-04-2021||India||Night curfews in force, schools closed as states increase curbs||A large part of India is now under restrictions not seen since the lockdown was eased last year, with night curfews, restrictions on certain businesses, closing of schools and colleges, and tight curbs on the number of people allowed to gather being imposed in at least six states where Covid-19 infections have grown.The strictest of the measures are in Maharashtra, where authorities imposed a night and weekend curfew, ordered non-essentials businesses shut, and asked most offices to switch to remote working.Night curfews are one of the most common non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPI) used in other states as well. These include districts in Punjab, Rajasthan and Gujarat.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageAlmost all non-election states have limited the number of people that can attend public events.On Monday, there were 95,461 new cases of Covid-19 across the country. This number was lower than the 103,769 recorded a day before, but this could largely be due to a fall in testing that is typical of weekends. India is now recording the highest number of cases in a day in the world and has surpassed the first wave peak in September when the number stayed under 100,000.Maharashtra has accounted for well over 50% of new Covid cases in the country every day over the past week, with Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Punjab and West Bengal also reporting a spurt in cases.Unlike April of 2020, there are only few places where complete lockdowns have been announced: Durg in Chhattisgarh has imposed a nine-day lockdown that begins April 6. Earlier, a 60-hour lockdown was imposed in Maharashtra’s Wardha district, which ended on April 1. In MP’s Indore, Jabalpur and Bhopal, a 36-hour lockdown ended on March 30.Among states that have opted for night curfews are Punjab, where 10 of 23 districts have such curbs, Rajasthan, where it applies to 10 towns including the capital Jaipur, and in three cities of Gujarat. In Chhattisgarh, 16 of 27 districts including the state capital Raipur have a night lockdown.The curbs come at a time when officials and experts worry hospital capacity may buckle under the weight of cases. The Covid-19 resources dashboard in Pune showed there were no hospital beds available on Monday.Dr Giridhara R Babu, an expert with the Public Health Foundation of India, said Bengaluru is on track to record 6,500 daily cases by April 20. “Even if 10 per cent of them require hospitalisation, the health system will run out of capacity in a few days. We need action now, not tomorrow. Stay home people, wear masks if going out and get a vaccine when eligible,” the epidemiologist said in a tweet.In Delhi, where the government has ordered hospitals to keep more beds for Covid-19 patients, hospitals said the situation is concerning. “The cases are rising exponentially. The pace at which the number of cases went up this time around did not give us time to ramp up the capacity. The situation is heading towards what it was during November,” said Dr Rommel Tickoo, director of internal medicine, at Max Healthcare.The current wave of infections has also led almost all states to close down all education institutions, including coaching centers. On Monday, students protested in Bihar’s Sasaram district against the government’s order to close down all coaching institutes.Maharashtra, Delhi, Gujarat and Tamil Nadu have said schools will be shut indefinitely, while Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Punjab have suspended classes for a brief period.Restrictions have also been placed on public events as most states capped the maximum number of people at weddings to 100 people and at funerals to 50. Maharashtra and Gujarat have banned all public events, while Maharashtra has also shut down restaurants and eateries for dine-in.Unlike the previous lockdown, no state has imposed any restriction on industries or marketplaces, fearing further dent to the economy, although experts have said such steps may be unavoidable.On almost no restrictions in Delhi, the state health minister Satyendar Jain said: “We should not see Delhi in isolation. The whole country is witnessing a massive surge in cases. Delhi has seen worse surges before.”Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases in the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said that states, including Delhi, need to accelerate vaccination drive and scale up tests, contact tracing and containment efforts.(With inputs from state bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfews-in-force-schools-closed-as-states-increase-curbs-101617648255006.html

However, the number came down to 1,097 by Sunday night.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“There has been a decline in the number of Covid-19 cases in Telangana since the second week of January when the first wave of vaccination process began. The number was hovering around 100 cases. But from the second week of March, there has been an increase in the number of cases,” a health department official said.The official state health bulletins indicated that there has been a steady rise in the number of positive cases in the last month, with periodical fluctuations. Even the number of fatalities due to Covid-19, which were around one or two, has now gone up to around six deaths per day.“But the situation is not very alarming. Despite rising infections across the country, the number of Covid-19 cases has continued to remain under control in Telangana,” health minister Eatala Rajender told reporters after a video conference with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday.Rajender said the infection spread is mostly confined to urban areas like Hyderabad, Medchal-Malkajgiri and the surrounding areas. Unlike last year, so far hospitalisations due to Covid-19 infections have remained under control, he said.Rajender urged the Centre to provide more Covid-19 vaccine stock so that the vaccination process could be expedited across Telangana.The minister said all the government hospitals across Telangana had adequate staff, stock of medicine and liquid oxygen for Covid-19 positive patients. “There is an adequate number of beds available at private and government hospitals and there is no need to panic. We are confident that Telangana should be able to contain any further spread of infections,” Rajender said.At present, the total number of positive cases in the state stood at 3,13,237 while the cumulative number of deaths was at 1,723. As of Sunday, there were 8,746 active Covid-19 cases in the State.In Andhra Pradesh, too, there has been a sudden spurt in the number of Covid-19 positive cases. On March 1, the number of positive cases was just 58 which went up to 1,326 on Monday. The state reported the highest number of cases (1,730) on Sunday, the highest this year. The number of deaths, which were zero on the first of March, has now gone up to five.“Vaccination is the only solution to tackle the Covid-19 infections. We have intensified the vaccination programme and have targeted to vaccinate 90 lakh people,” health commissioner Katamaneni Bhaskar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-andhra-report-spike-in-covid-19-infections-positive-cases-cross-1000-101617647364907.html

Four other students allegedly involved in the crime have also been isolated, said the institute.Facing criticism for the way it handled of the incident, the premier institute has also assured enhanced security measures to prevent such incidents in future.“[The accused] has been suspended from the institute with immediate effect from April 4 as recommended by the students disciplinary committee,” said a statement issued by IITG on Monday, 8 days after the alleged rape.The student, who hails from Mumbai, was arrested by Amingaon police in Kamrup district on Saturday. Though IITG authorities haven’t yet mentioned the nature of the sexual assault, police have registered a case of rape under section 376 of IPC.“Four other students have been isolated from each other on campus and will be retained on campus for further police investigations as well as internal investigations,” the IITG statement read.Police questioned the four on Saturday on suspicion of them being involved in the crime, helping the arrested accused or trying to hide evidence after the assault.Also Read | Bombay HC seeks stronger laws as man freed in daughter’s rape case “Our investigations are underway. We will arrest others if there is any evidence of their involvement in the crime,” Kamrup superintendent of police Hitesh Chandra Roy said.Terming the incident as a “serious violation of disciplinary rules of the institute”, IITG said it compromised the safety, security of students, hostel boarders and residents of the campus. “The institute condemns such heinous acts in the strongest possible terms. The institute is also putting in place enhanced safety and security measures to prevent such incidents from occurring in the future,” it read.The authorities of IITG are facing flak for reporting the matter to the police five days after the alleged rape, on April 2, and also for allegedly taking the survivor from Guwahati Medical College Hospital (GMCH), where she was taken after the incident, against doctor’s advice.“The institute would like to clarify that the medical report is awaited only after which the nature of the assault can be confirmed. Also, all due procedures were followed as per the hospital guidance for discharge of the girl student,” the statement read.Doctors at GMCH said the student was brought to the hospital at 12.50am on March 29 and taken from there by IITG authorities around 4.30am the same day, saying she will be treated at the institute’s hospital within the campus.“The student was unconscious when she arrived. When she regained consciousness, she said she was sexually assaulted. We conducted a gynecological test and a forensic exam as per the protocol. Despite our advice, IITG authorities took her away on their own responsibility,” said a senior doctor on condition of anonymity.The woman’s medical report is awaited. On Saturday, a statement by IITG said she was “safe and recovering well”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/education/competitive-exams/iitguwahati-suspends-student-accused-of-raping-batch-mate-puts-4-in-isolation-101617601873840.html
