Farmers can sacrifice their lives but they will not leave protesting against the laws, he said, adding that farmers of the country are united in the fight.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three border points of Delhi -- Singhu, Tikri (along Haryana), and Ghazipur -- demanding a repeal of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-end-protest-against-farm-laws-bku-leader-naresh-tikait-101618681531720.html

17-04-2021||India||8 Indian states highly vulnerable to climate change: Report||Eight Indian states -- Jharkhand, Mizoram, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and West Bengal -- are highly vulnerable to climate change, according to a national climate vulnerability assessment report.These states, mostly in the eastern part of the country, require prioritisation of adaptation interventions, the report pointed out.Among all states, Assam, Bihar and Jharkhand have over 60 per cent districts in the category of highly vulnerable districts.Lack of forest area per 100 rural population was found to be one of the major drivers of vulnerability for Assam despite the fact that the state has a forest cover of 42 per cent, followed by low road density, the report said.In case of Bihar, the report cited poor health infrastructure to be the key vulnerability driver in 36 districts, followed by a high percentage of marginal and small operational holders in 24 districts.The lack of implementation of the rural employment scheme MGNREGA, causing a lack of alternative livelihood opportunities, appeared as a key driver in 14 districts of Bihar, followed by a lack of women's participation in the workforce in 11 districts.Lack of crop insurance and rainfed agriculture were key drivers of vulnerability for Jharkhand.The report, titled 'Climate Vulnerability Assessment for Adaptation Planning in India Using a Common Framework', which identifies the most vulnerable states and districts in India with respect to current climate risk and key drivers of vulnerability, was released by Department of Science and Technology (DST) Secretary Ashutosh Sharma.Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Sikkim and Punjab have been categorised as lower-middle vulnerable states. Uttarakhand, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Nagaland, Goa and Maharashtra have been categorised as states with low vulnerability.“We have seen how extreme events are on rise both in terms of their number and severity. Mapping the parts of India that are vulnerable to such changes will help initiating climate actions at the ground level.“The report should be made easily accessible to all stakeholders so that it can benefit climate-vulnerable communities across India through development of better-designed climate change adaptation projects,” said Sharma.He also suggested that the maps should be made available to people who need it.“Assessing vulnerability was the first step towards assessing climate risk. There are two other components like hazard and exposure that need to be also assessed to arrive at overall climate risk.“DST would take up these assessments in the next phase along with sectoral vulnerability assessments and assessments at sub-district levels,” said Akhilesh Gupta, Head, Climate Change Programme (CCP), DST.Prof N H Ravindranath, retired climate change expert from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), explained that the report has helped identify the most vulnerable states, districts and panchayats and will aid in prioritising adaptation investment, developing and implementing adaptation programmes.Director of IIT Mandi Professor Ajit Kumar Chaturvedi and Director of IIT Guwahati T G Sitharaman hoped that the report will be taken up by the states for initiating climate action.A total of 94 representatives from 24 states and two Union Territories participated in the nationwide exercise jointly supported by the DST and the Swiss Agency for Development & Cooperation (SDC).Corinne Demenge, Head, Swiss Cooperation Office, Embassy of Switzerland in India, hoped that the assessments will contribute to the development of more targeted climate change projects and that they will support the implementation and the potential revisions of the State Action Plans on Climate Change.“The assessments can further be used for India's reporting on the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. And finally, these assessments will support India's National Action Plan on Climate Change,” she added.The assessment will help policy-makers in initiating appropriate climate actions. It will also benefit climate-vulnerable communities across India through development of better-designed climate change adaptation projects.In a developing country such as India, vulnerability assessment is considered as an important exercise to develop suitable adaptation projects and programmes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-indian-states-highly-vulnerable-to-climate-change-report-101618678564084.html

17-04-2021||India||AIIMS director says must go back to earlier strategies to bring down Covid cases||Noting that the country was seeing a "huge strain" on the health care system due to a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases, AIIMS Delhi Director Dr Randeep Guleria has said that there is a need to go back to all the strategies that were being followed six-seven months back to bring about a reduction in the number of cases.In an interview with ANI, Dr Guleria said causes for the fast spread of the virus are "multi-factorial".Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here "But two main causes are that when in January and February vaccination started and cases went down, people stopped following COVID appropriate behaviour and at this time the virus mutated and it spread more rapidly," he said.The vaccination drive was launched on January 16 in the country.Dr Guleria said if 15 per cent of Covid-19 cases require hospital care and one person is admitted on average for five to seven days, hospital beds get occupied and with more patients coming, the hospitals may run out of beds."At present, we are not only seeing record-breaking numbers but we are also seeing a huge strain on the health care system. Because no health system will be able to manage so many patients. And we will have a crisis in terms of patient management. Doctors are already over-burdened. They have been working for more than a year and that also includes other healthcare workers," he added.He said there is a need to keep increasing hospital beds and resources for the increasing number of cases."We also have to urgently bring down the number of Covid-19 cases," he said.Dr Guleria called for a "multipronged attack" to contain the virus."There is a need to go back to all the strategies that we were following six-seven months ago to decrease the number of cases," he said.He noted that there has been a huge increase in the number of cases in a very few days "rather than weeks or months that we had seen last time".Asked about some people testing positive for COVID-19 even after taking the vaccine, he said vaccine prevents a person from getting the more severe disease but it does not prevent you from the infection totally."We have to remember that no vaccine is 100 per cent efficient. You may get the infection but the antibodies in our body will not allow the virus to multiply and you'll not have severe disease," he said.Answering a query, he said this a time when a lot of religious activities happen in the country and polls are also underway."We must understand lives are also important. We can do this in a restricted manner so that religious sentiment is not hurt and COVID appropriate behaviour can be followed," he said.Dr Guleria said there was no specific answer to how long the second wave of Covid-19 will continue in India and it depends on how quickly and efficiently the spread of virus is contained.Asked about the situation in Delhi, he said the city has a larger spike compared to the situation six-seven months ago."A lot of containment zones were made, almost like a mini-lockdown in those areas. We need to start looking at the same strategies," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-director-says-must-go-back-to-earlier-strategies-to-bring-down-covid-cases-101618675611078.html

There should have been proper planning. OK if it was not done, there is still time and now a solid strategy should be adopted and concrete steps be taken," the Congress leader said.Priyanka Gandhi also appealed that financial support should be provided to the people who need it the most.There should be a package for small and medium businesses who are again on the verge of closing down, she said."I want to request the UP government that your administration should be sensitive rather than aggressive right now," Priyanka Gandhi said.The Congress has political differences with the Uttar Pradesh government and those will remain but "now we must stand together united in this fight", she asserted.The party will stand shoulder to shoulder with the people to combat this pandemic, Priyanka Gandhi said.In her video message, she also appealed to people to follow Covid-appropriate behaviour such as wearing masks, not venturing out unnecessarily and washing hands regularly.Later, Priyanka Gandhi also tagged a social media post in which an appeal was made to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to intervene to deal with the alleged lack of oxygen supply for people affected with Covid-19 in Varanasi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-must-take-concrete-steps-on-covid-situation-priyanka-101618671476389.html

Religion and customs-traditions are vital but nothing is more important than life. It’s important to pay heed to the PM’s suggestion.”Giri also informed that a large number of seers have already started leaving the Mela because, “Traditionally the fourth Shahi Snan is attended mainly by the seers of the three Bairagi Akhadas, and for all the rest 10 Akhadas the Baishakhi Shahi Snan is the important one after which they start leaving.”“Juna Akhada will be taking part in the April 27 Chaitra Poornima Shahi Snan symbolically and I urge other Akhadas to follow suit,” he said.The governing body ---- the Akhil Bhartiya Akhada Parishad made it clear that the Mahakumbh “won’t be curtailed”.“It will be held till the completion of its designated period on April 30 as it has been held traditionally since centuries. However, amid the Covid-19 surge, we are committed to adhere to the Covid-19 safety norms,” said Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri.Earlier, in another development at the Mahakumbh, Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat and Kumbh Mela force officers- inspector general Sanjay Gunjyal and senior superintendent of Police Janmejaya Khanduri met Mahamandleshwar Avdheshanand Giri at his ashram during which they “thanked the seers for their cooperation in the two big Shahi Snans on April 12 and 14.”Amid the Covid-19 outbreak in Uttarakhand, at least 70 seers at the Mahakumbh had tested positive for the disease while two top seers including a Mahamandleshwar died of the infection recently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/seers-agree-to-symbolic-participation-in-last-shahi-snan-after-pm-modi-s-appeal-101618667181443.html

The cases are rising. Every state has a threshold of medical facilities. Delhi too has its limit and we have reports of shortage of beds, oxygen, Remdesivir in the city," Kejriwal said. Terming the situation serious and concerning, Kejriwal said, "In the last 24 hours, there have been around 24,000 cases. A day before, there were around 19,000 cases. So the tally spiked only in a matter of 24 hours."‘Covid-19 situation very grim, will enforce restrictions strictly’: Delhi PoliceSo far, there has been no shortage of bed in the Capital, Kejriwal said, adding that the government is focussing on creating more oxygen beds as serious patients need oxygen."In a few days, we will be able to add around 6,000 oxygen beds. Around 1,300 beds are being arranged at Yamuna Sports Complex and Commonwealth Games, Rada Soami facility will get 2,500 beds now and 2,500 later. Around 2,100 oxygen beds have been pooled as hotels and banquets are being linked with hospitals," Kejriwal said.But this may not be enough as the infection is spreading at an unprecedented rapidity. "No one knows when the peak will come. So now we don't have time to rest. We have to work on war footing to be a step ahead of corona," Kejriwal said.Urging the Centre to increase beds, Kejriwal said the Centre, in November, had granted 4,100 beds for Covid, but now when the situation is more precarious, only 1,800 beds in central government hospitals have been allotted for Covid-19 treatment.The AAP government has also instructed officials to raid markets to check whether there has been any hoarding of Remdesivir and other medicines that have become scarce now. On the testing situation in the Capital, Kejriwal said action will be taken against laboratories that are conducting more tests than their capacity and thus delaying the results.Kejriwal reviewed the Covid-19 situation of the Capital as it is observing the first day of the weekend lockdown on Saturday. The response has been positive, and the weekend lockdown decision will be reviewed, Kejriwal said. In a crucial decision, the government has already decided to take stringent action against hospitals turning away Covid-19 patients or not disclosing full information about the availability of beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-now-facing-shortage-of-oxygen-supply-remdesivir-says-kejriwal-101618658419508.html

Between January 30 last year, when the first Covid-19 case was detected and January 16 this year, when the first vaccine was rolled, “there is a saga of tragedy, incompetence and colossal mismanagement,” the Congress said in a statement after a meeting of its working committee.The opposition party also accused the Centre of not releasing sufficient funds to the state governments to fight the pandemic. According to the Congress Working Committee (CWC) statement, despite warnings by experts, the government “failed miserably and paved the way for the havoc that is being caused by the second wave of the pandemic.”The CWC prepared a 14-point list of charges against the government over its “colossal mismanagement” of the war against the pandemic.

We have to keep increasing our hospital beds and resources for the increasing number of cases," Dr Guleria said, reported ANI."We also have to urgently bring down the number of Covid-19 cases," urged the AIIMS chief.Explaining that the cause for the recent surge in Covid-19 cases is multifactorial, Dr Guleria said, "The two main causes are-when in January, Feb vaccination started and cases went down people stopped following Covid-19 appropriate behaviour and at this time the virus mutated and it spread more rapidly."Stating that the political rallies and religious activities need to be restricted, Dr Guleria said, "This a time when a lot of religious activities happen in our country and polls are also underway. We can do this in a restricted manner so that religious sentiment is not hurt and Covid-19 appropriate behaviour can be followed."India's second wave of coronavirus disease has been aggravated by a lack of adherence to Covid-appropriate safety protocols and the circulation of highly infectious strains of SARS-CoV-2, Dr Guleria had said earlier this week.Guleria pointed out that the infection rate has surged and the disease outbreak is compounded by the presence of highly infectious strains. "Earlier, if one sick person was able to infect around 30 per cent of their contacts. This time those getting the disease are infecting a larger number of people,” Guleria told PTI.People are taking the disease lightly now, the chief of India's premier hospital said. "If you go out, you see that marketplaces, restaurants and shopping malls are crowded and full of people and these all are super-spreader events," Guleria said. "Around February, when cases started to decrease, people became lax towards following Covid-appropriate behaviour as they thought the virus had become ineffective… So, the rate of spread of the infection is fast possibly due to the highly infectious and transmissible strains circulating,” he had said.The coronavirus crisis, torpedoing economies and burdening medical infrastructure, worsened at the end of February in India and the country has since been reporting record Covid-19 cases every day.India on Saturday shattered its previous daily spikes in Covid-19 cases recorded since the pandemic hit the country and saw the biggest single-day jump of 2,34,692 fresh Covid-19 infections, pushing the cumulative tally to 1,45,26,609, according to Union health ministry data.The country has more than 16 lakh active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-crisis-huge-strain-on-india-s-healthcare-system-says-aiims-chief-101618654106310.html

Of this, the highest number of cases come from the capital city Chennai, 2636, and adjoining districts of Chengalpattu (795), Thiruvallur (453) and Kancheepuram (303). Amongst the 37 districts, Coimbatore reported the third-highest number of cases with 583 fresh cases.On Friday, Tamil Nadu’s chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan held a meeting with health officials to discuss control measures. “The numbers seem higher than what we saw during a peak last year. Cases are increasing in Chennai in the past three days in the second wave where we have had more than 2,000 new cases every day,” said Greater Chennai Corporation commissioner G Prakash. “Last June we were touched testing 10,000 samples in a day. Now we are testing close to 20,000 samples in a day. We are aiming to increase it to 25,000 samples,” he said. The state is also conducting a high number of RT-PCR tests. On Friday, 95,561 people were tested and their samples were sent to 263 labs across the state. The average positivity rate across the state has been 4.56%. As many as 33 people succumbed to the infection on Friday taking the total toll to 13,032. A total of 4,920 people were discharged. Last year, during the first wave, Tamil Nadu for weeks reported the second-highest caseload in the country. The state managed to bring it down significantly and also reduced its mortality rate. By March 24, 1,636 cases were reported this year in the state. The infections began to rise as Tamil Nadu was at the peak of political activity ahead of the assembly elections which was held on April 6. On polling day, 3,645 fresh cases were reported. At political rallies across the state, though top leaders were masked or in their campaign vehicles, thousands gathered on the ground without wearing masks and with no social distancing. “We don’t know what percentage of cases are attributed to specific sources,” said Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, National Institute of Epidemiology. “We need to do epidemiological investigation on the source of infections and clusters to better understand how the disease has spread. We assume that any kind of gathering is a superspreader in general from what we know of the virus so far but it isn’t substantiated by data,” he added.Also read: Those returning from Kumbh will spread Covid-19 like ‘prasad’ - Mumbai mayorAfter elections were over, the state came out with a slew of restrictions to prevent people from gathering in large numbers in public places.

In a series of tweets, Malik claimed the Centre is denying permission to companies willing to sell Remdesivir in the country. "There are 16 export oriented units in our country that have 20 Lakh vials of Remdesivir, since exports are now banned by the government, these units are seeking permission to sell this medicine in our country but the central government is denying the same," he wrote on Twitter."The government says it should be sold only through 7 companies that are producing it. These 7 companies are refusing to take responsibility. This is a decision-making crisis," Malik, who is also the Nationalist Congress Party’s national spokesperson, also said.Malik further highlighted that a quick decision over the issue is the "need of the hour." "While there is a requirement of this medicine and availability too, a quick decision is the need of the hour. This problem must be solved and the vials must be supplied to government hospitals in all states immediately," he added in another tweet.With the unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases, demand for Remdesivir has also shot up leading to the long queues outside pharmacies. Black marketing of medicine is also on the rise as the government is working to crack down on the illegal selling of the drug. According to medical practitioners, the anti-viral injection that costs between ₹1000 and ₹5,500, depending on the brand, is being sold for ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in the black market.Maharashtra's food and drug administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingane said on Friday said that the state will face a shortage of 12,000 to 15,000 Remdesivir injections.Shingane also said pharmaceutical companies manufacturing Remdesivir have stepped up production but it will take time for the new stock to reach the market.Further blaming companies for the delay in supply of the much sought-after Covid-19 drug, the FDA minister said, “The heads of Remdesivir-making companies had 15 days back assured me to supply around 55,000 vials of the injection. However, till April 15 these companies could provide only 37,000 to 39,000 vials to the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-minister-nawab-malik-targets-centre-over-remdesivir-shortage-says-it-asked-companies-to-not-supply-key-drug-101618654001949.html
17-04-2021||India||Past Covid infection does not fully protect people against re-infection: Study||Results of a new study led by researchers of The Mount Sinai School of Medicine suggest vaccination against Covid-19 remains crucial even in young adults who were previously infected.Although antibodies induced by SARS-CoV-2 infection are largely protective, they do not completely protect against reinfection in young people, as evidenced through a longitudinal, prospective study of more than 3,000 young, healthy members of the US Marines Corps conducted by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the Naval Medical Research Center.The findings were published in the journal The Lancet Respiratory Medicine."Our findings indicate that reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 in healthy young adults is common," says Stuart Sealfon, MD, the Sara B. and Seth M. Glickenhaus Professor of Neurology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and senior author of the paper."Despite a prior Covid-19 infection, young people can catch the virus again and may still transmit it to others. This is an important point to know and remember as vaccine rollouts continue. Young people should get the vaccine whenever possible since vaccination is necessary to boost immune responses, prevent reinfection, and reduce transmission."The study, conducted between May and November 2020, revealed that around 10 per cent (19 out of 189) of participants who were previously infected with SARS-CoV-s (seropositive) became reinfected, compared with new infections in 50 per cent (1.079 out of 2,247) of participants who had not been previously infected (seronegative).While seronegative study participants had a five times greater risk of infection than seropositive participants, the study showed that seropositive people are still at risk of reinfection.The study population consisted of 3,249 predominantly male, 18-20-year-old Marine recruits who, upon arrival at a Marine-supervised two-week quarantine prior to entering basic training, were assessed for baseline SARS-CoV-2 IgG seropositivity (defined as a 1:150 dilution or greater on receptor binding domain and full-length spike protein enzyme-linked immunosorbent [ELISA] assays.).The presence of SARS-CoV-2 was assessed by PCR at initiation, middle and end of quarantine. After appropriate exclusions, including participants with a positive PCR during quarantine, the study team performed three bi-weekly PCR tests in both seronegative and seropositive groups once recruits left quarantine and entered basic training.Recruits who tested positive for a new second Covid-19 infection during the study were isolated and the study team followed up with additional testing. Levels of neutralising antibodies were also taken from subsequently infected seropositive and selected seropositive participants who were not reinfected during the study period.Of the 2,346 Marines followed long enough for this analysis of reinfection rate, 189 were seropositive and 2,247 were seronegative at the start of the study. Across both groups of recruits, there were 1,098 (45 per cent new infections during the study. Among the seropositive participants, 19 (10 per cent tested positive for a second infection during the study. Of the recruits who were seronegative, 1,079 (48 per cent) became infected during the study.To understand why these reinfections occurred, the authors studied the reinfected and not infected participants' antibody responses. They found that, among the seropositive group, participants who became reinfected had lower antibody levels against the SARS-CoV-2 virus than those who did not become reinfected.In addition, in the seropositive group, neutralising antibodies were less common (neutralising antibodies were detected in 45 (83 per cent) of 54 uninfected, and in six (32 per cent) of 19 reinfected participants during the six weeks of observation).Comparing new infections between seropositive and seronegative participants, the authors found that viral load (the amount of measurable SARS-CoV-2 virus) in reinfected seropositive recruits was on average only 10 times lower than in infected seronegative participants, which could mean that some reinfected individuals could still have a capacity to transmit infection. The authors note that this will need further investigation.In the study, most new Covid-19 cases were asymptomatic -- 84 per cent (16 out of 19 participants) in the seropositive group vs 68 per cent (732 out of 1,079 participants) in the seronegative group -- or had mild symptoms and none were hospitalised.The authors note some limitations to their study, including that it likely underestimates the risk of reinfection in previously infected individuals because it does not account for people with very low antibody levels following their past infection.They strongly suggest that even young people with previous SARS-CoV-2 infection be a target of vaccination since efforts must be made to prevent transmission and prevent infection amongst this group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/past-covid-infection-does-not-fully-protect-people-against-re-infection-study-101618652207183.html
17-04-2021||India||Railways allow transport of liquid medical oxygen after request from Maharashtra||The Indian Railways on Saturday moved to allow transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers after the Maharashtra government’s request to meet the shortage of the gas used for Covid-19 patients in the state. The move comes days after Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking the Centre's support in addressing the shortage of oxygen in the state.Drafting the policy for transport of liquid medical oxygen, the railways' ministry has approved the transportation under Roll-on-Roll off scheme and allowed the movement of oxygen to various destinations across states. It said in a circular the staff accompanying liquid oxygen trucks to be loaded on the Ro-Ro service will be charged a second class ticket for the journey and only two people will be allowed to accompany the truck. "The matter has been examined. The competent authority has approved the transport of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic containers," the circular said, detailing the charges to be levied for the service.The empty flow direction of the containers will also be charged by the railways. Additionally, free time of five hours will be given to the trucks at the time of loading and unloading.Maharashtra, crippled by the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, is facing a crisis with the medical and health infrastructure collapsing under the weight of rising cases and deaths.With several states reporting a shortage of oxygen, the government on Friday directed them to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders and said they must not impose any curb on production and supply of the essential public health commodity anywhere.In a bid to save medical oxygen, Maharashtra's Covid-19 task force chairperson Dr Sanjay Oak has suggested that non-essential surgeries be postponed. He said the decision on this, however, would have to be taken at a local level as factors such as the patient's condition and medical urgency are paramount. Amid a spike in Covid-19 cases, there is a reported shortage of medical oxygen in some parts of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/railways-allow-transport-of-liquid-medical-oxygen-after-request-from-maharashtra-101618646570653.html

Assuring the states of adequate and unhindered supply of vaccines, the minister said a change in the containment strategy may yield results."We can now focus on bigger containment zones which can be called community quarantine to change the strategy," the minister said as he addressed the state health ministers through a video conference.Broaching the vaccine situation of the country, as Odisha, Andhra Pradesh have flagged the issue of vaccine scarcity in recent times, the health minister said till now, the Centre has supplied 14.15 crore doses to all states and UTs, out of which about 12.57 crore doses have been consumed. Another batch of 1.58 crore doses will be reaching the states in one week, the health minister said. "I am quoting these numbers so that there is no misconception about vaccine availability. I am giving you all the numbers," Vardhan said.Clarifying how the Centre supplies vaccines to the states, the minister said that large states get 4 days' supply together while for smaller states, it is seven day's supply. "So either on every 4th day or every 7th day, vaccines are being supplied."The meeting comes as the Covid-19 situation in the country is worsening amid reports of shortage of vaccines, medical oxygen, hospital beds. On Saturday, the BKC jumbo Covid-19 vaccination centre was shut temporarily owing to the shortage of vaccines.At present, there are over 18 lakh Covid-19 beds in the country, the minister said and urged the states to strengthen the health workforce immediately."We have been doing genome sequencing before this UK variant came to the world's notice. We have been doing everything required to bring the situation under control. This year, we have vaccine to bolster our fight," the health minister said urging states to send more samples for genome sequencing.The unprecedented surge in the number of daily infections has forced many states to bring back restrictions, while Prime Minister Narendra Modi too emphasised on the need of micro-containment zones, without imposing lockdown in a larger scale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-supply-on-4th-or-7th-day-health-minister-harsh-vardhan-on-reports-of-covid-19-jab-shortage-101618651706536.html

"As the economy has barely begun to turn around from the impact of the earlier lockdowns, we should avoid introducing another lockdown or even a partial lockdown in the states," he said in the letter."Resorting to such a drastic measure at this stage may not be conducive to the overall situation and will push the economy into downward spiral."This letter is written to chief ministers of Delhi, West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Rajasthan, Tripura, Meghalaya, Jharkhand, Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Goa, Puducherry, Arunachal Pradesh, Haryana, J&K, Odisha, Sikkim, Kerala, Manipur, Bihar, Nagaland, Mizoram, Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Assam and Tamil Nadu.Instead of lockdown or partial lockdown, the letters further suggests that states take steps like ramping up to covid testing, awareness drive and enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour like wearing masks, physical distancing and personal hygiene.Support may be taken by involving volunteers from the schools, colleges and the NGOs. Strict compliance to Covid protocol may be ensured with suitable penalties for violations.FICCI has represented to the Union Government to open up the vaccination for all the people above 18 years of age to give a massive push to the vaccination drive as there is no shortage of vaccines and the inoculation capacity can be increased with the participation of the private sector."The state government will have to play a major role to encourage people to come forward for vaccination and build capacities with the help of private sector for the expected jump in inoculation," wrote Shanker in the letter."Vaccination camps in the colonies and societies with the help of resident welfare associations (RWAs) will also help push the vaccination drive," the letter added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ficci-writes-to-25-cms-appeals-against-further-covid-19-lockdowns-101618648326550.html

Trying to help as many people as possible, I’m in the hospital myself handling Twitter requests too so kindly tag and DM me both so I don’t miss out on any request. We are all in this together and will come out stronger.” Siddique, who is the general secretary of the Mumbai Youth Congress, tweeted.Using the hashtag #SOSIYC, president Indian Youth Congress, BV Srinivas, also appealed to the people to tag or send him a direct message regarding the medical requirements and the address of the concerned patient.Within no time hundreds of people from across India started tagging the IYC handle and its members asking for help and soon photos of Congress workers reaching out to people with medicines went viral.Speaking to Hindustan Times, BV Srinivas said that former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi had instructed that in case of a shortage, the Youth Congress leaders in Delhi should coordinate with the state and district leaders to ensure that no one faces any difficulty in acquiring a hospital bed or medicines.Calling it a ‘ritual to help people in a calamity’, Srinivas added that till now the IYC has reached out to as many as 2,000 people across the country and provided them with medicines and arranged hospital beds for them.“There is a force of almost 1,000 youth Congress workers who are working on it right now. We have created teams who first segregate the complaints on the basis of the states they come from. Later, the complaints are forwarded to the local district president who makes the necessary arrangement,” Srinivas said.While praising the Congress workers for managing the funds for these medicines, Srinivas added that there were places where the workers couldn’t procure the medicines locally.‘In the cases where we can’t procure the medicines locally, we are arranging them in Delhi and later sending them to the places where it is not available.” Srinivas said.“Just want to say, thank YOU @zeeshan_iyc. For your very many acts of service through this pandemic. Your team has gone above and beyond serving distress calls and providing free medication to anyone who has reached out. Thank you for being the kind of leader our country needs,” activist Trisha Shetty tweeted while thanking the IYC for the help.Another Twitter user Nazia Naseem thanked the IYC leaders for their help and wrote, “When messiahs rise to save your soul in the wee hours of the night! @srinivasiyc @Devendra_1925, a million thanks for being the saviour and arranging medical help for my father in law in Bhilai. Allah bless you always.”“My brother got access to two vials at no cost due to prompt response and help by @zeeshan_iyc. Thank you so much for immediate assistance in our time of need. Shall always be grateful to you for your generosity,” tweeted another user.“Helped me procure Remdesivir for my ailing parents at a time when the drug is more valuable and scarcer than gold dust. Keep up the great work and may God bless you both. Thank you!” Vedala, another beneficiary, posted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-youth-wing-reaches-out-to-needy-covid-19-patients-with-medicines-101618650980707.html
17-04-2021||India||'Despite a year to prep for Covid, we were caught off guard again': Sonia Gandhi||Accusing the Modi government of "gross unpreparedness" and "adhocism" in dealing with the Covid-19 crisis, Congress president Sonia Gandhi on Saturday made a slew of suggestions to the Centre to deal with the pandemic such as reducing the immunization age to 25 years and providing income support to people.In her opening remarks, while chairing the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC), Gandhi also accused the Centre of giving preferential treatment to some states while maintaining "thundering silence" on requests of states ruled by the Congress and opposition parties.The Congress has always believed that fighting the Covid-19 pandemic is a national challenge that should be kept above party politics, she asserted."We have extended our hands of cooperation right from February-March, 2020. We cannot, however, lose sight of the fact that the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic has hit the country with fury. Despite a year to prepare, we have, regrettably, been caught off guard again," Gandhi said.Instead of listening to the constructive suggestions of the opposition, Union ministers are pressed into service to attack leaders of opposition for giving those suggestions, she said."This convoluted 'me versus you' debate is childish and totally unnecessary," Gandhi asserted.Making a host of suggestions to the government, she said the Centre must also reconsider its priority for vaccine candidates by reducing the immunization age to 25 years and above as also all younger persons with at-risk health disorders like asthma, angina, diabetes, kidney and liver diseases and other similar ailments."In the course of my talks with our chief ministers, the question of GST (Goods and Services Tax) came up. They felt that as a preliminary measure, all equipment, instruments, medicines and support required to prevent and treat COVID-19 should be made free from GST," Gandhi said.It is a matter of grave concern that life saving drugs like Remdesivir and medical oxygen as also other basic supplements are subjected to 12 per cent GST, the Congress chief said."As the central and state governments move ahead to control the situation by resorting to partial curfews, travel restrictions, closure and lock downs; we will again be restricting economic activity that will hit the already beleaguered people, especially the poor and the daily wagers," she said.It is, therefore, imperative to provide monthly income support and transfer an amount of ₹6,000 in every eligible citizen’s account, Gandhi said.Taking on these challenging times as Indians rather than as political opponents will be true 'Rajadharma', she stressed.The CWC meet was also attended by former party chief Rahul Gandhi, general secretaries, other permanent invitees and state in-charges of the party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/despite-a-year-to-prep-for-covid-we-were-caught-off-guard-again-sonia-gandhi-101618649906753.html
17-04-2021||India||Haryana deputy CM writes to PM Modi; urges him to resume talks with farmers||Haryana deputy chief minister Dushyant Chautala on Saturday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and urged him to resume talks with farmers' unions assembled at Delhi borders."Our 'Annadattas' are on roads at Delhi border agitating in respect of newly enacted three farm laws of the Central Government. It is a matter of concern that such agitation is going on for more than hundred days. I truly believe that every problem has a solution by way of mutual discussion," Chautala said in a letter.He asked PM Modi to constitute a committee of three to four cabinet members to hold talks with the agitating farmers."The earlier discussion between the Central Government and farmers' union brought few solutions to the concerns raised by Sayunkt Morcha. In this regard, a team consisting of three to four senior cabinet ministers may lead the delegation for resuming talk with farmers so as to bring an amicable conclusion in this issue," he added.Chautala said that Haryana is the only state in the country where a total of six crops including wheat, mustard, pulses, gram, sunflower and barley are purchased at Minimum Support Price (MSP). "I am sure that with the support of the Central Government, procurement of crops from farmers at MSP in Haryana would continue with the same pace in future also," he added.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three Delhi border points -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur for over four months, demanding a repeal of the three agricultural reform laws enacted by the Centre last September.The government says that the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops. The farmers, however, say the laws would pave the way for eliminating the MSP and do away with the ''mandi'' (wholesale market) system, leaving them at the mercy of corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/haryana-deputy-cm-writes-to-pm-modi-urges-him-to-resume-talks-with-farmers-101618649229669.html

He remained in a critical condition and was on cardiac and respiratory support at the hospital’s Intensive Care Unit. Vivek underwent an emergency coronary angiogram and angioplasty after he was found to have a 100% blockage in his left coronary artery.“This is an acute coronary syndrome with cardiogenic shock,” said a statement from the hospital. “This is a separate cardiac event and may not be due to Covid vaccination.”On Friday also, Tamil Nadu health secretary J Radhakrishnan clarified that Vivek’s cardiac condition is not linked to his Covid vaccination on Thursday.Vivek received his first dose of Covaxin at a government health facility in Chennai.Radhakrishnan said 860 people got the vaccine on the same day. “There is no direct link between his 100% blockage and this. We conducted a test on him today [Friday] and it is [Covid-19] negative. Even his CT scan did not show any symptoms of COVID-19,” Radhakrishnan said. “The vaccine reaction normally comes within 30 minutes; it is called an anaphylactic shock. This [Vivek’s] case is not that...” After getting the vaccine, Vivek also urged the public to get vaccinated.He had been involved in awareness campaigns including those related to dengue.Vivek is survived by his widow and two daughters.Tributes poured in for Vivek as the news of his death broke. In a tweet, Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s said: “The untimely demise of noted actor Vivek has left many saddened. His comic timing and intelligent dialogues entertained people. Both in his films and his life, his concern for the environment and society shone through. Condolences to his family, friends and admirers. Om Shanti.”Vivek made his mark as a comedian and was known to infuse social themes and messages in his comic roles.

It has no proper vaccination strategy and no oxygen strategy,” a Congress functionary quoted Gandhi as saying in his brief speech at a meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC). The meeting of the Congress’ top executive body was going on when this report was filed.There was no immediate response to Gandhi’s comments.At least two leaders, Digvijaya Singh and Pramod Tiwari, seconded Gandhi. Tiwari, who was the fifth speaker at the meeting, maintained Gandhi had predicted all these Covid-related developments last year. Also read: ‘Me vs you debate childish, focus on battling Covid-19’ - Sonia takes on CentreSingh, the former chief minister of Madhya Pradesh, echoed him. “Every word that Rahul Gandhi has said since February last has proved to be true.” Earlier, Congress president Sonia Gandhi made her opening remarks.

In the virtual meeting, leaders including former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, former Union ministers AK Antony, Ghulam Nabi Azad, P Chidambaram, Anand Sharma, and Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot have spoken so far. According to party functionaries, there have not been any disruptions or chaos so far. This is the first time the CWC has called a meeting exclusively to discuss the situation arising out of the pandemic. The second wave of Covid-19 has affected 14.3 million people in India, roughly accounting for 10% of the global cases. According to a senior leader, the CWC might officially ask for vaccination for everyone and a faster pace of inoculation in India. The previous CWC was held in January and the meeting grabbed headlines as senior leaders sparred over the demand for elections to CWC and Central Election Committee.

17-04-2021||India||India is fighting double mutant virus variant. Should we worry?||As India’s daily tally of Covid-19 infections surge by a record 200,000-plus cases for three consecutive days, public health experts worry that a new -- possibly more virulent -- coronavirus variant could be racing through the crowded nation of more than 1.3 billion people.The new variant, which has a so-called double mutation, is thought to be fueling India’s deadlier new wave of infections that has made it the world’s second worst-hit country, surpassing Brazil, and has already begun to overwhelm its hospitals and crematoriums. The Asian nation has reported more than 14.5 million Covid cases so far and more than 175,600 fatalities.“This is a variant of interest we are following,” Maria Van Kerkhove, the World Health Organization’s technical lead officer on Covid, told reporters Friday. “Having two of these mutations, which have been seen in other variants around the world, are concerning,” she said, adding that there was a similarity with mutations that increase transmission as well as reduce neutralization, possibly stunting the ability of vaccines to curb them.The new strain underscores the insidious nature of viruses and threatens to thwart containment efforts in India, despite stringent measures such as the world’s largest lockdown last year. An exploding outbreak in India risks undoing a hard-won victory over the pathogen for others too, especially as this strain has now jumped to at least 10 other countries.Here’s what we know so far:How did the “double mutation” variant emerge?The new variant, called B.1.617, was initially detected in India with two mutations -- the E484Q and L452R. It was first reported late last year by a scientist in India and more details were presented before the WHO on Monday, according to Van Kerkhove.Viruses mutate all the time, as part of evolutionary biology. Some mutations weaken the virus while others may make it stronger, enabling it to proliferate faster or cause more infections.India’s health ministry first acknowledged the presence of such a “double mutant” at the end of March, but has downplayed it since. While it’s a variant of interest, it “has not been stamped as a ‘variant of concern’ so as to say that it is more lethal or more infectious,” Aparna Mukherjee, a scientist at the Indian Council of Medical Research, which works under the nation’s health ministry, told Bloomberg TV on Friday.The double mutation has been found in several countries like Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, the UK and the US, according to an April 16 statement from the Indian government. “Higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet,” it said.Is it causing the record surge in infections in India?Genome sequencing indicates the variant as a possible culprit although the Indian government hasn’t confirmed it.The average prevalence of the variant surged to as high as 52% of samples sequenced in April from almost nothing in January, according to website tracker outbreak.info, which uses data from global repository GISAID.In some districts in Maharashtra state -- home to the nation’s financial hub Mumbai and epicenter of the current wave that’s currently under lockdown-like rules -- the prevalence of this variant was more than 60%, according to Anurag Agrawal, director of the state-run Council of Scientific and Industrial Research’s genomics institute that’s conducting sequencing. The B.1.617 was present in samples from about 10 Indian states and while the percentage may vary, it was expected to rise as “it has two critical mutations that make it more likely to transmit and escape prior immunity,” Agrawal said.Both mutations are known to decrease -- although not completely eliminate -- the binding of the antibodies created by infection and vaccination, according to Jesse Bloom, an associate professor for genome sciences and microbiology at the University of Washington.“Mutations at sites E484 and L452 have been observed separately, but this is the first major viral lineage that combines the two,” said Bloom. “I do think that this new viral variant is important to monitor.”“We did the math -- we do believe that a lot of the increase in the reproduction number can be explained by these mutations,” Nithya Balasubramanian, the head of health care research at Bernstein India, told Bloomberg TV this week. “So, yes, the mutations are a big cause for worry.”After being complacent in mapping virus genomes in recent months -- India did sequencing for less than 1% positive samples as of last month -- the country is now scrambling to cover lost ground. “We are attempting to do at least 5% of whatever samples are there,” said ICMR’s Mukherjee.“It looks like that it is spreading faster than pre-existing variants,” said Rakesh Mishra, the Hyderabad-based director of the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology -- another Indian lab doing genome sequencing of Covid samples. “Sooner or later, it will become prevalent in the whole country, given the way it is spreading.”Has it been found outside India?This variant has been detected in at least 10 other countries, including the US, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, according to the situation report on outbreak.info.As of April 16, 408 sequences in the B.1.617 lineage have been detected of which 265 were found in India, the report shows. A surveillance report by the UK government said it has found 77 cases in England and Scotland so far, designating it as a “Variant Under Investigation.”New Zealand has temporarily suspended arrivals of its citizens and residents from India due to the spike in the number returning with Covid. Brazil was also shunned as a Covid superspreader by its neighbors who were nervous about the virus strain next door.India’s second wave -- given its size and rapid pace -- will worry other nations that have just about managed their own outbreaks after weeks of economy-devastating lockdowns.Is it deadlier than other variants out there?Researchers are still trying to figure that out. The features of the double mutant variant are under investigation, but the L452R mutation is well characterized in US studies, according to Agrawal. It increases viral transmission by around 20% and reduces antibody efficacy by more than 50%, he said.Globally, three worrisome variants that have so far emerged in the UK, South Africa and Brazil have caused particular concern. Studies suggest they are more contagious, and some evidence points to one of them being more deadly while another drives reinfections.This double mutant strain, first found in India, has begun troubling virologists everywhere.“The B.1.617 variant has all the hallmarks of a very dangerous virus,” William A. Haseltine, a former professor at Harvard Medical School wrote in Forbes on April 12. “We must do all that is possible to identify its spread and to contain it.”Do vaccines work against it?It’s hard to know for sure without adequate data and research. India is testing whether the new variants, including the B.1.617, are capable of “immune escape or not,” according to ICMR’s Mukherjee.Immune escape refers to a pathogen’s ability to evade human bodies’ immunity response. This means antibodies created after vaccination or prior infection may not protect a person from getting infected. If the new India variant shows “immune escape” behavior, this would have deep ramifications for India’s vaccination program, which has picked up after a sluggish start and administered almost 120 million doses so far.India has currently authorized three vaccines. Two of them are already in use while the third, Russia’s Sputnik V, was approved this week. India also fast-tracked approval for foreign vaccines this week. All of these efforts risk being jeopardized if the shots turn out to be less effective against this double mutation variant.“It is one of the ones that’s on our radar, and in doing so, it means it’s on the radar of people around the world,” said Van Kerkhove.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-is-fighting-double-mutant-virus-variant-should-we-worry-101618642364632.html

Sonia Gandhi was speaking during the meeting of the Congress Working Committee (CWC) meeting, which was attended by former party chief Rahul Gandhi, general secretaries and state in-charges of the party.As the opposition party exclusively discussed the current Covid-19 situation in the country and steps that need to be taken urgently to check the further spread of the virus, Sonia Gandhi spoke about her letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi after her meeting with chief ministers of Congress-ruled states to take a jibe at the Centre.Also read | Sonia Gandhi reviews efforts to tackle Covid-19 in Congress-ruled states“I have written to the Prime Minister after meeting with them. Our Chief Ministers have spoken to the Prime Minister and written to the concerned minister from time to time pleading for relief. Some of them were left with only a few days of vaccine, no oxygen or ventilators. But there has been thundering silence on the part of the Government. On the contrary some other states have received preferential treatment/relief,” she said. “Instead of listening to the constructive suggestions of the opposition, Union Ministers are pressed into service to attack leaders of opposition for giving those suggestions. This convoluted “me versus you” debate is childish and totally unnecessary,” she added.The Congress president reiterated her point about lowering the immunisation age to 25 years and above “as also all younger persons with at-risk health disorders like asthma, angina, diabetes, kidney & liver diseases and other similar ailments.” She also said Goods and Services Tax (GST) on all equipment, instruments, medicines and support required to prevent and treat Covid-19 should be made free. “It is a matter of grave concern that life saving drugs like Remdesivir etc. and medical oxygen as also other basic supplements are subjected to GST @ 12%. Even basic equipments like Oxymeters and life saving critical equipment like ventilators are subjected to 20% GST. In the current state of affairs, this is inhuman and untenable,” she added.Also read | Govt exported Covid-19 vaccine and allowed shortage in India: Sonia GandhiThe government must provide financial support for the poor in the form of monthly income support and transfer ₹6,000 in the account of every eligible citizen, who have been hit by the partial curfews, travel restrictions, closure and lockdowns put in place by authorities. “Similarly, with reverse migration of labour already having started, it will be critical to immediately address their need of safe transportation as indeed their suitable rehabilitation in host as well as home States,” Sonia Gandhi said.“Let us ensure that the suggestions our party puts forward are considered by the Government of India in the spirit of true democratic traditions. Taking on these challenging times as Indians rather than as political opponents will be true Rajadharma,” she added.Both Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi have written to Prime Minister Modi asking him to expand the country's vaccination drive against Covid-19. The CWC meeting comes amid a steep rise in coronavirus disease cases in the country with over 200,000 infections being recorded daily in the last three days. India’s tally of the coronavirus disease now stands at nearly 14.5 million, second only to the United States, and deaths in the country has risen by 1,341 to 175,649.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-me-vs-you-debate-childish-focus-on-battling-covid-19-sonia-takes-on-centre-101618644436255.html

Naveen Patnaik said he was of the view that states and the Centre needed to align their forces and work together as a team to face the crisis and brought the issue of 'intermittent supply' of Covid-19 vaccine to PM Modi’s notice, reported news agency ANI.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe state has administered around 4.7 million vaccines against the coronavirus disease to date, Patnaik said, adding that it has the capacity to administer more than 300,000 doses on a daily basis. "We are getting huge responses from people to get vaccinated. However, intermittent supply is creating a challenge in meeting the demand," he said in the letter, according to ANI.  Bring vaccine in open marketThe Odisha CM demanded that the Covid-19 vaccines be made available outside the government supply chain in the open market so that citizens who can afford them can buy the shots on their own. This would reduce the burden of the government and allow it to focus on the vulnerable sections of society, he said.Approve more vaccinesThe vaccines, which have got approval internationally by credible agencies, should be cleared by the Indian government for use, he said. Russia's Covid-19 vaccine Sputnik V was recently approved by India and the first batch of it will be delivered to the country in April.Ramp up vaccine productionVaccine production units should be ramped up with the help of the Centre and state governments and India's potential in manufacturing vaccines should be utilised to the maximum, he said, adding that the government should "run the extra mile" in extraordinary situations.Big cities with large caseloads should be prioritisedIn his last suggestion, the CM said metropolitan cities that contribute the most to the Covid-19 tally should be prioritised in the country’s vaccination drive and there should be flexibility in the age criteria in these regions. These cities are the "economic nerve centres" of the country, CM Patnaik said, and imposing lockdown here would impact the whole country in terms of "labour movement".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccination-4-suggestions-in-odisha-cm-patnaik-s-letter-to-pm-modi-101618637622591.html

The public prosecutor representing the Delhi Police claimed that Sidhu participated in the protest with the intention to create violence and disregard the national flag and that he was the main instigator of unlawful assembly.Sidhu's counsel told the court that his mere presence did not make him part of unlawful assembly and that he was an honest citizen who was part of a protest.Also read: ‘Was in wrong place at wrong time,’ says Deep Sidhu on R-Day violenceSidhu told the court last week that he did not incite the crowd at Red Fort, where religious flags were hoisted and that he was merely exercising his “fundamental right” to protest.“Right to protest is a fundamental right, that’s why I was there. Neither I indulged in violence, nor did I urge anyone to indulge in the violence,” Sidhu said in his submission to the court.The public prosecutor for Delhi Police countered the claim and said that fundamental rights do not mean that one can harm police officials.Sidhu was arrested on February 9 in connection with the Red Fort violence on January 26 during the farmers' tractor parade against the Centre's three farm laws.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deep-sidhu-accused-in-january-26-violence-granted-bail-by-delhi-court-101618638128786.html

The reports have said advertisements have been spotted on OLX, an international classified website, selling Remdesivir vials for as high as ₹6,000. The users are mostly reported to be from Maharashtra and Gujarat and the ads are listed under the "health and beauty category".

With the massive spike in Covid-19 cases across the country, demand for Remdesivir has also surged leading to the shortage of medicine at pharmacies and people standing in long queues to get even one vial of the drug.On Friday, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan assured of strict action against those who are involved in black marketing of the anti-viral drug. "Companies manufacturing coronavirus drug Remdesivir have been asked to ramp up production. I assure you that strict action will be taken against those who are involved in black marketing of the drug and other malpractices," news agency PTI quoted him as saying.Police arrested a doctor and three hospital ward boys on Friday evening for allegedly stealing Remdesivir injections from dead Covid-19 patients in order to sell them in the black market, news agency PTI reported citing Nagpur’s deputy commissioner of police V Neelotpal.The Pune Police also arrested five men and recovered four vials of the Remdesivir injection on Thursday. The recovery was done through raids carried out by officials of Unit 4 of the Pune Police’s crime branch on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-remdesivir-shortage-antiviral-drugs-sells-for-rs-6000-on-olx-101618637935029.html

But unfortunately, despite the fact that we had a woman President and a woman Prime Minister, we have never had a woman Chief Justice of India,” lamented the judge as he addressed the 26th Justice Sunanda Bhandare Memorial Lecture at the national capital.Justice Nariman also expressed hope that the Supreme Court will soon change this fact: “I hope that given the present dispensation, the time for the first woman CJI will not be very far off.”Justice Nariman’s comments echo the views expressed by current CJI SA Bobde a day ago. CJI Bobde, during a hearing in the top court on Thursday, said that the time has come for the country to have its first woman CJI.The apex court currently has five vacancies out of the sanctioned strength of 34 judges. Out of 29 judges, there is only one woman judge.As reported by HT on February 21, a timely elevation of justice BV Nagarathna from the Karnataka high court, could give India its first woman CJI in 2027.On Friday, justice Nariman, while delivering his address, also recalled that justice Bhandare, a former Delhi high court judge who passed away at the age of 52 in 1994, as probably the candidate who could become the first woman CJI. “Unfortunately, life was cruel to her and cut her remarkable career short,” regretted the judge.Justice Nariman spoke on the topic “Great women of history” and named five of them -- Cleopatra, Pope Joan, Razia Sultana, Elizabeth I of England, and Catherine, The Great of Russia. He termed all of them “remarkable” while pointing out that each one of them had to fight with their backs to the wall.“Each one of them was brilliant but none succeeded. It is the only two recent ones who succeeded,” said justice Nariman as he elucidated the historical facts about how Cleopatra, Pope Joan and Razia Sultana were killed because they were women and were not supposed to rule over or preside over the men.“We have had this misogynistic tradition for ages...Women in the history have all started out by being perceived by the other sex as something below the men,” rued the judge, adding it was not before the 16th century when people started accepting that to rule was not the exclusive preserve of men.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unfortunate-we-ve-never-had-a-woman-cji-justice-nariman-101618623824635.html

All those who have come in contact with me in the last 2-3 days may please get themselves tested,” he tweeted.Earlier in the day, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa also tweeted that he has tested positive for the viral disease.“Upon having mild fever, today I got tested for Covid-19 and my report has come out positive. Although I am doing fine, I am being hospitalised based on the advise of doctors,” the Bharatiya Janata Party leader tweeted. The 78-year-old was earlier hospitalised in August last year after he tested positive for Covid-19.Senior Congress leader Randeep Singh Surjewala and Shiromani Akali Dal leader Harsimrat Kaur Badal has tested positive.In a tweet, the Congress general secretary said, “I have tested +ve for #COVID19 today morning.” “Anyone who has come in contact with me in the last 5 days, please self isolate & take necessary precautions,” 53-year-old Surjewala, who is a former Haryana minister, said.Badal, a former Union minister, said she had mild symptoms. “I have quarantined myself at home and am taking all the necessary precautions. I would request all those who came in contact with me to isolate and get themselves tested at the earliest,” the 54-year-old SAD MP from Punjab’s Bathinda said.Former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and Congress leader Digvijaya Singh also confirmed that he has turned Covid positive. “My Covid test report is positive. I am currently in quarantine at my Delhi residence...,” said Singh in a tweet in Hindi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/javadekar-among-many-leaders-to-test-covid-19-positive-101618620700934.html
17-04-2021||India||Strong proof Covid-19 mainly spreads through air: Study||Researchers have concluded that there is “consistent” and “strong evidence” to prove the Sars-CoV-2 virus – which causes the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) – is primarily transmitted through air and that this reasoning should alter countries’ mitigation response to the pandemic that has ravaged the world.Studies have previously indicated that the coronavirus can spread through air, but this is the first such analysis that says the “airborne route is likely to be dominant”.In the early days of the pandemic, it was believed that the virus is largely transmitted when large droplets, which are exhaled by those infected, settle on surfaces and contaminate them. Months after the first outbreak was reported in China’s Wuhan, around 200 scientists from 32 nations last July wrote to the World Health Organization, saying there is evidence that the coronavirus is airborne.“The evidence supporting airborne transmission is overwhelming, and evidence supporting large droplet transmission is almost non-existent,” said Jose-Luis Jimenez from the University of Colorado Boulder.“It is urgent that the World Health Organization and other public health agencies adapt their description of transmission to the scientific evidence so that the focus of mitigation is put on reducing airborne transmission,” Jimenez, one of the authors of the study, told PTI.The researchers from the UK, the US and Canada reviewed published scientific studies and cited ten reasons as evidence.Among them is the occurrence of super-spreader events in indoor areas such as choir concerts, cruise ships and care homes, they said. These instances show patterns that are not explained by droplets or fomites [contaminated objects], suggesting the “dominance of aerosol transmission”, said the analysis published in journal Lancet on Thursday.Super-spreader events, cases where one person diagnosed with Covid-19 goes to infect several others, are believed to be among the key reasons why Sars-CoV-2 has infected 138 million people the world over.The cluster of Covid-19 cases aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship in February last year was one of the first examples of a super-spreader event. At least 700 people on the ship were infected during the voyage and its subsequent quarantine off the Yokohama coast in Japan.The Lancet study noted the transmission rate of Sars-CoV-2 is higher indoors than outdoors, and that transmission is greatly reduced by indoor ventilation, suggesting that viral particles survive in the air.According to a study cited in the analysis, silent -- asymptomatic or presymptomatic -- transmission of Sars-CoV-2 from people who are not coughing or sneezing accounts for at least 40%. This, too, indicates that the virus is airborne.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strong-proof-covid-19-mainly-spreads-through-air-study-101618620446557.html

17-04-2021||India||Variants not leading to false negative test results, says Centre||The Union health ministry said on Friday that coronavirus variants detected in India are no more likely to lead to false negative tests, following a series of reports from several parts of the country of people with Covid-19, often with severe outcomes, testing negative through RT-PCR tests.The government said the kits used for RT-PCR tests check for more than two genes, which makes them less likely to miss a sample if it contains a variant with mutations that change the signature of genes.“The RT-PCR tests being used in India do not miss these mutations as the RT-PCR tests being used in India target more than two genes. Sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR tests remains the same as earlier,” the ministry said.The concerns stem from mutations that have in the past seen to cause tests kits to not detect specific genes. The B.1.1.7 variant, first found the in the UK, caused the kits in the country to not detect the S gene due to the deletion of amino acids at locations 69-70 on the virus’s spike protein.Laboratory owners in Delhi say that RT-PCR test kits are updated from time to time and none use the S gene, where clinically significant mutations are seen.“The sensitivity (ability to detect true positive) of even the gold standard RT-PCR test is 70%. Add to that the sheer volume of tests being conducted currently; there could be error in collecting or handling the samples that could lead to a false negative report. It could also be that people get the test soon after exposure or several days after the infection when viral load is low,” said Dr Rajesh Chawla, senior consultant of pulmonology at Indraprastha Apollo hospital.Chawla added it is important that people not mix with others if they have Covid-like symptoms and have tested negative.Doctors from hospitals such as Lok Nayak and All India Institute of Medical Sciences who also handle a bulk of patients agreed. “There are a few cases from across the country where the RT-PCR might be negative but the CT shows presence of Covid-19 symptoms,” said Dr Karan Madan, associate professor at AIIMS.“The RT-PCR test has a sensitivity of 70%, so yes sometimes the infection might be picked up by chest CT even if the RT PCR is negative. The negative result could also be because people get tested a day after coming in contact with a positive person; they should ideally wait for four to five days before getting the test,” said Dr Navin Dang, founder of Dr Dang’s Laboratory.He added, “We use the E gene, N gene, RdRP gene, and ORF gene for our tests. And, as far as I know, most labs use kits that test for two to three genes, reducing the possibility of missing out even the emerging mutations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/variants-not-leading-to-false-negative-test-results-says-centre-101618610884979.html
17-04-2021||India||Jaishankar, Afghan NSA slam Pak’s ‘negative role’||Pakistan’s role in backing the Taliban and meddling in Afghanistan was criticised on Friday by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Afghan national security adviser Hamdullah Mohib, who said democratic and constitutional structures created in the war-torn country must be preserved.Without naming Pakistan, both Jaishankar and Mohib referred to the negative role of a “neighbour” of Afghanistan, while participating in a virtual discussion at the Raisina Dialogue. However, their remarks left no one in doubt as to which country they were talking about.Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, who also participated in the discussion, was more circumspect but urged the Taliban to join negotiations aimed at ensuring a peaceful and stable Afghanistan.Jaishankar noted that thousands of foreign fighters are still in Afghanistan, and said all stakeholders should buy into a fair and broad-based process aimed at ensuring lasting peace. The resolution in Afghanistan must be supported by all its neighbours and cannot be based solely on “the wishes of the most forceful set of people in that society”, he said.“The neighbours of Afghanistan unfortunately have very often played a very negative role...The neighbours also need to lay off Afghanistan and let the Afghan people do what is in their best interest,” Jaishankar said.Mohib endorsed Jaishankar’s comments about the presence of foreign fighters and said: “It’s not just the withdrawal of foreign troops from Afghanistan, it’s also the withdrawal of foreign fighters from Afghanistan, [whom] the Taliban are working closely with and who are involved in destructive activities in our country and...will remain a threat to the region.”He said everything alleged about the Taliban’s links with a neighbouring country had “become a clear reality” over the past 18 months following the visit of Taliban leaders to their injured fighters and their public discussions.“Any further push would mean that there is direct involvement in Afghanistan by a neighbour, which could be very dangerous. The nationalistic forces in Afghanistan are very upset and angry over this and if this limit is passed, I think there would be huge problems for the said neighbour, in their country by all Afghans who are there and from within Afghanistan,” Mohib said. “There could be a huge blowback effect that I think could be destructive for these neighbours,” he added.The discussion was held against the backdrop of US President Joe Biden’s announcement about the withdrawal of all American forces from Afghanistan by September.Jaishankar dismissed Pakistan’s narrative about being encircled by India and any India-friendly government in Kabul, saying New Delhi’s actions were only aimed at creating power infrastructure, dams, health clinics, and roads. “This is actually an absolute fantasy that somewhere our very presence and our activities there are aimed at Pakistan,” he said.Mohib pointed to the coordination between the Indian and Afghan governments, saying he had spoken to NSA Ajit Doval on Friday morning to assess the situation and to prepare for the dialogue with the Taliban.The Taliban have said they won’t attend a meeting in Turkey this month to decide on Afghanistan’s future until all foreign forces leave the country. Taliban leaders have also spoken of their plans to restore the Islamic emirate they had created in the 1990s.Jaishankar, Mohib and Zarif ruled out the possibility of taking Afghanistan back to the era of the Taliban’s emirate. All three leaders acknowledged that the existing system in Afghanistan wasn’t perfect but said it was preferable to the Taliban’s plans to impose an Islamic system.“The Taliban have no reason to continue their violence in Afghanistan anymore...It’s time for them to make real peace with the Afghan government and become part of the mainstream political society,” Mohib said. “We cannot create a vacuum, Taliban should not be asking for a vacuum. Taliban should start negotiating now with the government and people of Afghanistan, with various groups in Afghanistan,” Zarif said, adding a vacuum would draw in “fighting, violence and a civil war”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-afghan-nsa-slam-pak-s-negative-role-101618610480774.html
17-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Is a small brown pill the answer to India’s sudden surge of coronavirus disease (Covid-19, although it seems strange to call it that in 2021) cases?For at least two decades now, a drug called Tamiflu has been used to treat, and in some cases even prevent Avian Influenza or bid flu and H1N1 flu or swine flu. Originally extracted from the Chinese star anise plant, the small molecule oseltamivir has been synthesised since 2006, and is sold under the brand name Tamiflu by Roche (which licensed it from the drug’s discoverer Gilead Sciences). There are generic versions of the drug available in India — including Cipla’s Antiflu — which isn’t surprising. India’s pharmaceutical industry thrives on generic versions of small molecule drugs; the country’s vaccine makers have received a lot of attention over the past year, but India has even more expertise in small molecule drugs than it does in vaccines.Watch: How Covid variants & mass gatherings led to surge of cases in India I HT InsightScientists and pharma companies did try to find a small molecule cure or preventive for Covid-19, an antiviral which can, preferably, be taken orally — but they did not have much luck. With the discovery of a handful of vaccines that work well, interest in such drugs waned even more. But, as a surging second wave threatens to overwhelm the health infrastructure in most large Indian cities — most, reports suggest, have already been overwhelmed — it’s difficult not to think of what might have been if a small molecule therapeutic prophylactic drug for Covid-19 was available. Sure, there’s remdesivir, made affordable by India’s generics companies, and expensive by a thriving black market, but most research studies have shown the drug to be largely ineffective in the treatment of the viral disease. There are also Regeneron’s cocktail of monoclonal antibodies that works well, but the drug is far too expensive, and has also not been approved for sale in India.But there’s the brown pill.This is molnupiravir, an antiviral drug discovered by Ridgeback Therapeutics and developed by it in partnership with Merck. The drug is currently entering Phase 3 trials for people who have early or mild infections. An April 15 update from Merck said that the drug was linked to a lower rate of hospitalisation and death in such patients — but did not really have any effect on those with infections severe enough to require hospitalisation. Molnupiravir works by messing with the genetic code of the virus, causing a slight alteration in its RNA as it replicates, a process that eventually leaves the virus powerless or ineffective. For those with severe enough infections to require hospitalisation, preventing replication does nothing; by then, there’s a very high probability of other complications. The Phase 3 trials will show the degree of protection from hospitalisation and death that the drug provides to those with mild and (or) early infections. The company also plans to launch, later this year, another clinical trial evaluating molnupiravir’s prophylactic abilities. Together, both trials can answer a simple (but important) question: can it be to Covid-19 what oseltamivir is to Influenza A and B?But how does this help India?In late March, in a conversation with Cipla chairman Yusuf Hamied, I brought up the issue of how patents, and the unwillingness of most western nations, including the US, to back a move by India at the WTO to free up Covid-19 vaccines from patents, were probably hurting the world.Hamied’s response — the man is also a scientist, so I listened — was that vaccines “are a different ballgame”. “You can pick up a patent of a vaccine manufacturer, and you still won’t be able to produce it. It’s like biotech. Humira, the world’s top-selling biotech drug (used to treat various kinds of arthritis), is surrounded by 247 patents. I free the patents, but what are you going to do with that?”Instead, he added, there was an opportunity in small molecules (also Cipla’s speciality).According to Hamied, “[Merck has] come to India and given all of us (generics companies) an open licence to produce the drug, which we are planning to do. We have already made 30 kilos in the lab, and we will try to get approval in India. It’s that easy to do.”Even as India enhances supply of and access to vaccines, and even as several states impose lockdown-like restrictions (without calling them that), the health ministry should work with Merck and Cipla, and also with any other company which has a Covid small molecule in late-stage trials to facilitate local trials, and, if they are successful, accelerate a local launch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618609810490.html
17-04-2021||India||After 2 years of rain aplenty, IMD predicts normal monsoon this year||The monsoon for this year is likely to bring the normal amount of rainfall at 98% of the long period average (LPA), the India Meteorological Department said in its forecast on Friday, while adding that there could be a variation of 5% over or under the prediction.India recorded above-average monsoon rains for two consecutive years, and a normal season this year will significantly help the agriculture sector in particular, and the economy in general, following a year when the pandemic has stressed earnings.The summer rains – which typically set in from June 1 — are critical because nearly 60% of India’s net arable land lacks irrigation and nearly half the population depends on a farm-based livelihood. The rains also replenish 89 “nationally important reservoirs” critical for drinking and power generation.The LPA is the average monsoon rainfall — 88 cm — recorded from 1961 to 2010. IMD considers rainfall between 96% to 104% of LPA to be in the “normal” range.In 2020 and 2019, the monsoon was above normal at 110% and 109% of LPA. In 1996, 1997, and 1998, the monsoon was normal at 103.4%, 102.2%, and 104%.There is a 40% probability of normal, 25% of a below-normal, 16% of above-normal, 14% of deficient, and 5% of excess monsoon rains, according to IMD’s forecast. Unlike private weather forecasting agency Skymet Weather’s assessment on Tuesday that monsoon is likely to be a “healthy normal” at 103% of the LPA, IMD’s forecast predicts the monsoon to be at the lower end of its normal LPA range.IMD said a large part of east and northeast India including Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar, and the north-eastern states are likely to record below normal rains this year. A part of northwest India, including Delhi, Haryana, parts of Punjab, are also likely to record below normal rains.Over the past few years, there has been a huge divergence in monsoon rains across regions, and, even in regions receiving plentiful rain, long dry spells interspersed with intense wet ones.“We have good news to share. After two years of above-average rain, we are likely to receive normal monsoon rain this year,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, the ministry of earth sciences.He added La Niña conditions, which are associated in India with strong monsoon and above-average rains, and colder winters, have started weakening after starting in 2020.“La Niña conditions are likely to prevail only till May so we will transition to ENSO [El Niño and Southern Oscillation] neutral conditions during monsoon. There is very little chance of El Niño conditions developing during monsoon months. There is a very small probability of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) negative conditions developing during monsoon. So, these conditions are likely to lead to a normal monsoon this year,” Rajeevan said.“The agri sector has been quite resilient. The onus of the government now is to maintain supplies of inputs such as fertilisers and seeds,” said economist R Mani of the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University.The farm sector, which contributes 39% to the rural economy, was able to shake off the impacts of the pandemic last year because of normal rains and ample supplies of subsidised inputs, such as fertilisers.With inputs from Zia Haq||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-2-years-of-rain-aplenty-imd-predicts-normal-monsoon-this-year-101618609303394.html
17-04-2021||India||Govt seeks details of parameters to improve India’s ranking on global Democracy Index||The Union law ministry’s legislative department wrote to several ministries and departments on April 1 seeking details on the parameters used in the rankings of the Economist Intelligence Unit’s Democracy Index, as part of a larger exercise under the aegis of Niti Aayog to monitor parameters used in key global indices including Ease of Doing Business, World Press Freedom, Human Development, Global Innovation, and Global Climate Risk.This, senior officials familiar with the matter said, was with the view of improving India’s rankings on global barometers, including the Democracy Index. In the latest 2020 Democracy Index global ranking released on February 3, India slipped two places to 53rd (out of 167 countries), its overall score fell from 6.9 the previous year to 6.6, and classified India as a “flawed democracy” along with countries including the US, France, Belgium and Brazil.The government’s move to monitor indices, and work on improving rankings, however, precedes the release of index.“…a CoS (committee of secretaries) meeting was held on 30 January, 2020, under the Chairmanship of Cabinet Secretary to discuss India’s ranking in the Global Competitive Indices decided to measure and monitor India’s performance on various important parameters through 32 internationally recognised indices to improve performance on these indices… Accordingly, the Legislative Department had been assigned to monitor India’s performance on the Democracy Index published by the Economic Intelligence Unit of United Kingdom,” the letter written by the law ministry’s legislative department on April 1 said.HT has reviewed a copy of the letter.EIU’s index is based on 60 indicators grouped in five different categories measuring pluralism, civil liberties and political culture. In addition to a numeric score and a ranking, the index categorises each country into one of four regime types: full democracies, flawed democracies, hybrid regimes and authoritarian regimes. The five fields that the government is monitoring for the Democracy Index are electoral process and pluralism, functioning of the government, political participation, democratic political culture, and civil liberties, officials aware of the matter said on condition of anonymity.To be sure, the government’s policy think-tank Niti Aayog is also collecting information on other indices. For instance, in December 2020, it sought inputs from the home ministry on the Global Peace Index. “As part of the exercise to engage proactively for the various indicators in the said Global Peace Index to enable higher ranking for the country it would be necessary to check the correctness of the data in the report,” an internal MHA memorandum issued in December 2020 noted. HT has seen the memo.HT could not immediately ascertain the status of work on monitoring the parameters involved. A detailed questionnaire sent to Niti Aayog remained unanswered.Officials aware of the matter and government documents indicated that after the January 2020 CoS meeting chaired by the cabinet secretary – cited in the April 1 letter -- Niti Aayog’s Development Monitoring & Evaluation Office (DMEO) was tasked with monitoring all the indices, and facilitating the measurement and monitoring of India’s performance on these indices through a single dashboard.Under this, the monitoring of the Democracy Index was assigned to the law ministry’s legislative department. Niti Aayog also assigned indices to other ministries — such as the Safe Cities Index, Global Terrorism Index, Global Peace Index, and Global Climate risk Index to the home ministry; and the Global Gender Gap Index, Global Inequality Index and Global Hunger Index to the ministry of women & child development.The move to monitor global indices goes back to last year.In July 2020, Niti Aayog organised a virtual workshop with 47 central ministries and departments, chaired by Cabinet Secretary Rajiv Gauba in line with a decision by the Centre to monitor India’s performance in select global indices. “The 29 global indices, published by 19 international agencies, are assigned to 18 nodal ministries and departments of the Government of India,” Niti Aayog said in a statement at the time.“It has long been felt that there is a need to measure and monitor India’s performance on various important social, economic and other parameters through internationally recognised Indices. The goal of the exercise is to use these Indices as tools for self-improvement, and bring about reforms in policies, while improving last-mile implementation of government schemes. Simultaneously, it is equally important to present an accurate image of India to the world,” the body added in the statement.It is unclear which three indices were subsequently added to the list, to take the list from 29 to 32.On February 26, Gauba wrote to legislative department secretary DG Narayana Raju seeking inputs for the indicators for the Democracy Index that will be monitored by DMEO. HT has reviewed the letter. Gauba also said a review meeting would be held soon.“As you are aware, DMEO, NITI Aayog has been designated as the knowledge partner for this exercise, and is in process of developing a dashboard through NIC for monitoring activities related to these GIs. I understand that DMEO is yet to receive complete information in the templates shared, including on engagement with Publishing Agencies, MosPI ( Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation) and States/UT. I therefore request you to share the information sought for configuration of the dashboard at the earliest. I have reviewed the progress for some Gls in December 2020, and intend to review the progress in respect of all GIs,” he wrote.On March 1, the law ministry’s legislative department issued a memo to several departments with the subject: “Monitoring Performance on Global Indices Democracy Index” as a reminder to provide inputs for the dashboard. HT has reviewed the memo, which, in light of the Cabinet Secretary’s letter, called for “information as sought for to configure the dashboard immediately without any further delay”. The memo was sent to ministries and departments including the labour ministry, department of legal affairs, DoPT, the I&B ministry, external affairs ministry, and the home ministry.Gauba declined to comment.“Some of these global indices have been there for a long time and they have gone through various levels of scrutiny. For example,V-DEM was established because many academics felt that Freedom House and Polity IV indices were not comprehensive. There is a section within the Indian government that believes in an inherent bias against India in the indices. While this may be true, as these are expert-based indices, but these institutes follow very rigorous protocols and their data is transparent. They provide a detailed breakdown of democracy scores of each country, and we know in the Indian case our rankings are now lower because decline in India’s score largely in the areas of civil liberty. While there is no harm in closely monitoring the indices, I’m not sure if it needs a large Niti Aayog level exercise to monitor these indicators,” said Rahul Verma, fellow at the Centre for Policy Research (CPR), New Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-seeks-details-of-parameters-to-improve-india-s-ranking-on-global-democracy-index-101618608140311.html

Darshan of the Lords by the public/devotee will be allowed only from Bahara Katha of the temple. Devotees have to sanitize their hands before entering the temple and there would be strict enforcement for ensuring Covid-appropriate behaviour,” he said after the meeting that was attended by Puri district collector, SP and officials of Shree Jagannath Temple Administration and senior servitors of the temple.All devotees will be required to bring their photo ID card, namely, Aadhaar/Voter 1D or any other photo ID card for identification. Chewing of Tobacco/ Paan and spitting inside the temple premises have been prohibited. A fine of ₹500 will be levied for each violation.On Thursday, 10 members of the servitor families, five temple employees and 10 staff of the Sri Jagannath Temple shoe stand were found infected with Covid-19.Temple officials said the servitors who had visited Kumbh Mela in Haridwar will have to undergo Covid-19 tests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/visitors-to-puri-s-jagannath-temple-need-to-show-covid-19-negative-report-to-enter-101618608258750.html

A patrol team at the Baramaniramjote border post area spotted them. “They have been identified as Ding Shou Sheng (36) and Chen Ji Fa (30),” said Girish Chandra Pandey, company commander of SSB’s 8th battalion. “They were trying to cross the border without any valid document,” he added. An Indian national has also been apprehended in this connection. He was identified as Mohammed Ibrahim, a resident of Dohaguri in Darjeeling district. The Indo-Nepal border area comes under the jurisdiction of the Naxalbari police station. The border has been sealed because of the assembly polls to be held in Darjeeling and Jalpaiguri districts on Saturday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-chinese-nationals-held-at-indo-nepal-border-in-darjeeling-101618606637491.html
17-04-2021||India||57% of India under curbs as deaths soar on Black Friday||India recorded 1,340 deaths due to Covid-19 in a single day on Friday, setting a new record for daily deaths as the devastating statistics of recent days came into stark focus with a steady stream of bodies pouring into cremation and burial grounds, and people seen lining up in a desperate wait for beds outside hospitals.The country added 233,869 cases on Friday -- the most it ever has in a single day.The crisis has forced much of the country to retreat into some form of curbs, which will restrict more than half of India’s population (57%) to their homes as curbs in 15 states and Union territories come into force in the form of for night or weekend curfews.Prior to Friday, the last time India recorded the most number of deaths in a day was on September 15 when 1,284 people succumbed to the disease. To be sure, on June 16, more than 2,000 deaths were recorded but that was due to Delhi and Maharashtra reconciling pending fatality data in a single day.According to an analysis by HT, over the next two days, more than 700 million people across the country will be under either a curfew for a limited time period or one that extends 24x7 with largely only essential services allowed.Such wide-ranging curfews have been necessitated as India’s second wave of Covid-19 is expanding throughout the country at a never-before-seen pace. For the week ending April 16, India has reported 188,400 new cases every day – this is double of what was seen during the peak of the first wave (93,617 average daily cases for the week ending September 16, 2020).Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, and Madhya Pradesh have imposed curfews that extend all day long, and on all days of the week. In Maharashtra, the curfew will be imposed in all districts for 15 days. In Chhattisgarh, the restrictions are limited to 20 districts, and in Madhya Pradesh to 15 districts. Weekend curfews will be enforced in Delhi, Chandigarh, Rajasthan, and urban areas of 10 districts in Odisha. Uttar Pradesh has imposed a statewide curfew on Sunday. Night curfews, meanwhile, will be in place in hundreds of districts across the country with six states and UTs – Punjab, Haryana, Delhi, Uttarakhand, Bihar, and Chandigarh – completely shut at night. In Karnataka, Rajasthan, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir and Odisha, night curfews are limited to urban areas or districts reporting large number of cases.Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, and Chhattisgarh are the three worst-affected states in terms of the degree to which their second wave has so far exceeded the first wave peak. The fourth such state is Gujarat, but it has only imposed a night curfew so far. Current weekly average of cases in Chhattisgarh is 410% of the peak of the state’s first wave, this number is 290% for Madhya Pradesh, 265% for Maharashtra.To be sure, most states have only imposed different versions of night curfews. Around 35% of the country’s population is currently under a night curfew. The regions that have only imposed night curfews are Karnataka, Haryana, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Gujarat, Jammu & Kashmir, and Bihar. On April 15, the weekly average of Covid-19 cases in these states was 99%, 157%, 128%, 110%, 398%, 67%, and 103% for their first wave peaks, respectively.Delhi and Chandigarh have also imposed variations of a weekend lockdown in all their administrative regions along with a night curfew. Here the average of cases in the week ending April 15 was 168% and 127% of their biggest peak before the second wave. In Rajasthan and Odisha, the night restrictions extends to urban areas only and in Uttar Pradesh to only 47 districts, but weekend restrictions are statewide. Rajasthan’s weekly average of Covid-19 infections is 168% of its past peak and Uttar Pradesh’s average is 243% of its past peak. Odisha’s current weekly average is only 43% of its last peak. Weekend restrictions of these states make up to almost a quarter (23.8%) of India’s population.In Chhattisgarh, 81% of the population, 34% of Madhya Pradesh’s population, and all of Maharashtra – which totals to 13% of India’s population – is also under restrictions that extend to all days of the week. Additionally, 3% of the population in Chhattisgarh and 28% of population in Madhya Pradesh is also under a night curfew.Experts say such limitations on movement of people will slow down the transmission but the impact of such curfews is not likely to be visible for at least a week, if not several days later still, and that too, only if the progress made due to the curbs is more than whatever transmission of the disease occurs during the hours that mobility is unrestricted.“The weekend curfews will slow down transmission at least during the 48-hour period. Transmission happens from person to person and if mobility is restricted, the transmission will go down. But, it will have a minor impact on the total incidence,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences. He said any impact on the number of cases will be visible only seven to ten days after the measure is implemented.“If infections reduce by 10% in these two days, but between Monday and next Monday they again increase by 10%, then you will not be able to see the difference the lockdown of this weekend will make. If the infection rate stays down during the week too, then only we will see an impact. If the infection increases in between now and then, then the lockdown will just mask the extent of increase during the week,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/57-of-india-under-curbs-as-deaths-soar-on-black-friday-101618605689947.html
17-04-2021||India||Vaze’s colleague sent to judicial custody in antilia case||The special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court on Friday remanded suspended Mumbai Police officer Riyazuddin Kazi, an associate of suspended cop Sachin Vaze, in judicial custody till April 23 in connection with the case of an explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence and the death of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran.Kazi was produced before the court as the period of his NIA custody ended on Friday.Advocate Hasnain Kazi, who represented Kazi, moved an application alleging threat to the life of his client in jail and urged that his security may be appropriately bolstered by the jail authorities. The court directed the jail authorities to take proper care of his security.Kazi was subsequently moved to Taloja prison.According to the NIA, Kazi was working as an assistant police inspector in the crime intelligence unit (CIU) and was aware about Vaze’s alleged plans to create a security scare in the vicinity of Ambani’s residence. The agency has claimed that Kazi was aware of the design and the things that transpired later.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vazes-colleague-sent-to-judicial-custody-in-antilia-case-101618601356256.html
17-04-2021||India||Court frames charges against Hooda in AJL case||A special court on Friday framed charges against former Haryana chief minister Bhupinder Singh Hooda over the alleged illegal allotment of a plot in Panchkula to Associated Journals Limited (AJL), publisher of the National Herald newspaper.The trial court acted on a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) charge sheet filed in December 2018. CBI special judge Sushil Kumar Garg has ordered the framing of charges under Section 120-B (criminal conspiracy) and 420 (cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and provisions of the Prevention of Corruption Act against Hooda.Hooda was present in court when the charges were framed. Details of the order were awaited at the time of going to press.Congress leader Motilal Vora, who died in December 2020, was also an accused in the case. Another accused arrayed was the firm AJL.At the time of registration of the FIR in 2016, Vora was chairman of AJL and Congress leaders Sonia Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi were among the shareholders.The newspaper was launched in 1938 by Jawaharlal Nehru, the first prime minister of the country.The CBI probe said Hooda misused his position to favour AJL. An institutional plot spread over 3,360 square metres in Sector 6, Panchkula, was allotted by the Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to AJL in 1982. As construction was not carried out in 10 years, it was taken back in 1992.In 1995 and in 1996, an appeal and revisions were filed by AJL against resumption of the plot, but these were dismissed by the HUDA administrator and Haryana’s financial commissioner, Town and Country Planning. When Hooda became chief minister of Haryana in 2005, he allowed re-allotment of the plot to AJL, according to the CBI.The CBI said Hooda, who was also the HUDA chairman, “blatantly misused his official position and dishonestly allotted the plot afresh in the guise of reallotment to AJL at original rates plus interest in violation of the HUDA policy vide an order on August 28, 2005. Thus, he caused wrongful loss to HUDA and wrongful gain to AJL.”In December 2018, the CBI filed a charge sheet against Hooda, Vora and AJL. An Enforcement Directorate probe is also underway in the case.On May 5, 2016, an FIR was registered by the Haryana vigilance bureau regarding allegations of cheating and corruption against Hooda and others. In December 2016, the Haryana government recommended a CBI probe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-frames-charges-against-hooda-in-ajl-case-101618601296278.html
17-04-2021||India||Extradition to India cleared, Nirav to appeal||UK home secretary Priti Patel has approved the extradition of fugitive businessman Nirav Modi almost two months after a court found him guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank scam case, people familiar with the development said on Friday.The decision came as a shot in the arm for the Indian government, which has been trying to bring fugitive economic offenders back to the country, but Nirav Modi reserves the right to appeal his extradition in the high court, which his lawyer said would be the next course of action.“We will now go to the high court challenging the order of the Westminster magistrate court,” Zulfiquar Memon, who represents Nirav Modi, told HT.A UK home office spokesperson said: “On February 25, the district judge gave a judgment in the extradition case of Nirav Modi. The extradition order was signed on April 15.”Nirav Modi now has 14 days to make an application for leave to appeal to the high court. He may seek leave to appeal against both the decisions of the district judge and of the home secretary, the people cited above said.While ordering his extradition on February 25, Westminster district judge Sam Goozee stated that Modi has a case to answer in India as he, along with his brother Nehal Modi and others, had defrauded the public sector bank, laundered the money taken from it and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses.The judge observed that the circulation of pearls, diamonds and gold between Nirav Modi firms and Dubai- and Hong Kong-based dummy companies was not genuine business and the companies were being used for transferring funds generated in the guise of sale-purchase/export-import of goods colloquially referred to as round-tripping transactions.Nirav Modi’s contention that he won’t get a fair trial in India and that he was being targeted due to political reasons was junked by the court.A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) official following the case said, “The UK government signing the extradition order is a positive development. Even if he goes to a higher court, he doesn’t stand a chance as there is very strong evidence against him.”Nirav Modi has been lodged in Wandsworth prison on the outskirts of London since March 19, 2019, when he was arrested on the basis of India’s extradition request.Nirav Modi is the second high-profile economic offender after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya whose extradition has been cleared by a trial court in the UK. Mallya lost his appeal against extradition in April 2020 as well as any opportunity to approach the UK Supreme Court the next month but the British government has claimed that his extradition is held up due to a “confidential legal issue”.Officials familiar with the Mallya case say that he has applied for asylum in the UK and it is not known how much time British authorities will take to decide.CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigators are confident that the UK high court will reject Nirav Modi’s plea just as it did Mallya’s, as there is irrefutable evidence of fraud and money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-approves-nirav-modi-s-extradition-101618601176345.html

In case they choose the latter, the board will develop a fair and unbiased criterion while preparing the results of such candidates,” said Gerry Arathoon, chief executive and secretary of the board, in the release.Parents welcomed the decision and said it would help students who have already decided their future options escape the uncertainty of exams. “Many students wish to take admission in small science colleges run by coaching classes where they are already studying. There are also quite a few who wish to continue in their respective schools. For such students, internal assessments will be the best possible solution. Students who wish to take the exams can still do so,” said a parent from Andheri.Over 23,000 students from Maharashtra took the ICSE exam in 2020 while 3,150 wrote their ISC exams last year. This year, ICSE exams were earlier scheduled between May 5 and June 7 and ISC exams were to be held between May 5 and June 16.Meanwhile, parents of students from the Cambridge (IGCSE) board are anxious about the board’s decision regarding exams. While the board is going to clear its stand on the exams by Monday, parents are worried as students are scheduled to appear for their ICT paper on Tuesday. “The board should come up with a decision in this regard immediately. Our children are still studying rigorously because they don’t know if the examination is happening or not. Their peers have been able to relax as their exams have been postponed or cancelled. Nothing is going to change over the weekend and the board should take a quick decision,” said a parent of IGCSE.Alka Sharma, a parent from Santacruz said, “I do not want my daughter to wait in anxiety until a day before exams. I really hope the board comes up with a decision to cancel the exam soon.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/icse-postpones-board-exams-for-class-10-12-amid-covid-19-surge-101618601116225.html
17-04-2021||India||Strong rooms lack security: Stalin to EC||The fight over electronic voting machines (EVM) security has started with opposition leader and DMK president M K Stalin on Friday alleging that there was total failure of security protocol of strong rooms, where the EVMs are kept and urged the election commission to take quick remedial measures.In a letter to the election commission, Stalin said a covered vehicle was brought into three different premises during night hours -- GCT College in Coimbatore on April 13, Sri Ram Engineering College in Tiruvallur on April 14 and Loyola College in Chennai on April 15.The strong room in Loyola stores EVMs from the city’s Kolathur constituency from where Stalin contested. Stalin said in all three instances when his party and alliance candidates questioned authorities they were told that these were mobile toilets brought in for women police.“Every strong room is located only in reputed colleges, where adequate lavatory facilities are available. While so, it is not known as to why the so-called mobile toilets are brought inside the strong room, in utter violation of the instructions issued by the Election Commission,” Stalin wrote to chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra. “These incidents have created high suspicion over the security/protocol provided in the strong room premises and thereby the safety of the polled EVMs is in question.”“Though the election commission constantly claims that EVMs cannot at all be hacked or tampered; the above attempts of making way to such hacking or tampering will make us disbelieve your statement. If such hacking or tampering of EVMs takes place, it will certainly demolish the structure of democracy...,” he said.Chief electoral officer Satyabrata Sahoo did not respond to calls and messages. Additional CEO V Rajaraman acknowledged that they have received a complaint.Tamil Nadu went to polls on April 6 and counting will be held on May 2. EVMs have been stored across 75 strong rooms in the state.AIADMK spokesperson C Vaigaichelvan said: “The election commission has strengthened strong rooms with a three tier-security so it is impossible for any malpractice.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/strong-rooms-lack-security-stalin-to-ec-101618600998537.html

The test positivity rate has also gone up to 14.8 per cent, according to the data released by the state health ministry. The state also reported 21 deaths taking the toll to 4,877. The active caseload has also risen to 69,868 and 32 health workers are among those infected. The maximum number of cases were reported from Kozhikode district—1,560 followed by Ernakulum with 1,391 cases. In the last 24 hours, 76,775 samples were tested in the state. With Covid-19 cases rising steadily after the assembly elections in the state, the government had announced two sets of restrictions this week and decided to hike tests considerably to contain the surge. It had devised a three-pronged strategy--more tests, effective enforcement of norms and beefing up of the vaccination drive. Though Kerala has planned 2.50 lakh tests in the next two days, health officials admitted that it was difficult to meet the target in the prevailing situation. Despite mounting cases the government made it clear that there won’t be a complete lockdown in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/keralas-covid-19-woes-continue-as-state-clocks-10-031-new-cases-after-6-months-101618600996842.html
17-04-2021||India||DMK slams govt over changing road names||Chennai Blaming the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) for changing names of three important arterial roads in Tamil Nadu, the opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) on Thursday sought the chief secretary’s intervention for restoring the old names. The roads pointed out by the DMK were previously named after Dravidian icons of the state like EV Ramasamy, CN Annadurai and K Kamaraj, but now bear English names. On Thursday, a three-member delegation of the DMK led by organising secretary and MP RS Bharathi submitted a representation to chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan, urging him to intervene to roll back names of the roads. “It is common knowledge that some of the major roads and highways in Chennai are named after the greatest leaders of Tamil Nadu. This was a policy decision taken by the then government,” stated the DMK delegation’s letter to the chief secretary, which was also shared with the press. “The move to change the names of the roads will insult Tamil personalities belonging to various political parties and create a tense and unrest situation in the state and may lead to further struggles and unrest,” the letter added. In the past, both DMK and AIADMK have indulged in changing the names of roads after Tamil scholars and personalities to evoke a linguistic pride. Chennai’s Poonamallee High Road was renamed in 1979 by AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran (MGR) into EVR Periyar High Road after EV Ramasamy, the father of the Dravidian movement. Similarly, Mount Road was renamed as Anna Salai and Beach Road as Kamarajar Salai. The DMK in its letter said that names of these roads have now been changed to Grand Western Trunk Road, Grand Southern Trunk Road and Grand Northern Trunk Road, respectively. The DMK has sought for the old names to be restored. “This action of changing the names of the roads, and the sheer disrespect to Tamil icons cutting across all parties has brought uneasiness and unrest in the state and may even lead to agitations,” Bharathi said in his letter. “It is quite apparent that the name change is done to please the ideologies of the AIADMK’s masters from the north, whose dislike of the Dravidian movement and its icon Thanthai Periyar is well known. Their aim is to ‘saffronise’ everything,” the letter added. The AIADMK, however, said that no names have been changed. “It seems the highways department used names from old records and during a routine job of erecting name boards, they have done this,” AIADMK spokesperson C Vaigaichelvan said, adding, “We don’t have the power to do anything now. After we form the government again, we will take necessary steps.” He dismissed DMK’s charges that this was done to appease their ally, the Bharatiya Janata Party. “BJP doesn’t tell us to change any name and we won’t do such things. We are also for Periyar. What do we have against these road names?”Meanwhile, former Union minister and senior Congress leader P Chidambaram on Friday night tweeted that a smart government would immediately let leaders know that names of the highways have not been changed. “The controversy should end tonight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dmkslams-govt-over-changing-road-names-101618600936935.html
17-04-2021||India||Concerns over Remdesivir shortage grow||BengaluruReports of a shortage of remdesivir injections increased in Karnataka as the number of cases of the coronavirus disease in the state continued a relentless surge.According to medical practitioners, the anti-viral injection that costs between ₹1000 and ₹5,500, depending on the brand, is being sold for ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in the black market.The managing director of Harsha Hospital in Bengaluru, S Shivakumar, said they have been unable to replenish the stocks at the hospital’s medical store. “We have been enquiring for the injection from the past 10 days to which, they (companies and wholesale dealers) have been replying with no stock,” Shivakumar told HT.According to the national treatment protocol, Remdesivir is one of the investigational drugs approved for use in treating hospitalized Covid-19 patients. With the rising cases, the demand for the drug has also shot up. To be sure, most studies have shown the drug has no real effect and it has been removed from the treatment protocol in many countries.Families of people undergoing treatment for the viral disease were forced to pay double the price for the injections.“My uncle who is Covid positive needed the injection. We got the first shot from the hospital. But the second, third and fourth doses were not available at the hospital. We were told to contact some private parties who would provide us the vial and they charged ₹40,000 for the first injection and ₹30,000 for the second and the third. Even in the black market we were unable to get two more injections, so we shifted him to Hyderabad,” said a relative of a patient in Bidar. The maximum retail price per vial for various brands of Remdesivir varies. One vial of Hetero costs is ₹5,400, Mylan ₹4,700, Jubliant ₹4,700, Reddy’s ₹5,400, Cipla ₹4,000 and Zydus ₹899. Mohammed Fahad, coordinator of the National Students Union of India, said, “I was trying to procure the injection for a friends’ mother. I went to multiple hospitals, but the injection was out of stock. One medical store owner gave me a number who could provide the medicine, when I called him, the perspn asked for ₹7,500 per dose which is close to double the price. We were able to find the medicine at MRP after searching further.” He, however, questioned how middlemen were able to procure the drug if hospitals were running out of stocks.Medical practitioners in the state have sought government action against the black-market trading of the drug.Shivakumar said he has written to chief minister BS Yediyurappa seeking a police investigation.“I was made aware of the fact that certain people are selling the injection in the black market illegally. The Hetero Remdesivir 100mg injection of 20 ml, which is to be sold for ₹1,500 to 2,000 is being sold for ₹15,000 to 25,000. Hence, kindly enquire and verify about other batches of the injections as well,” he wrote in the letter to the CM. On Thursday, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai warned of action against those spreading rumors about the shortage.  “The Karnataka Health Minister has already said there is no scarcity of Remdesivir injection in the state, but a false scarcity is been created in the state. The government has taken the matter seriously and will initiate stringent action against those who are making a fast buck by creating false scarcity and black marketing this important drug. We will monitor at every level of supply, storage and distribution of Remdesivir. We will keep track right from pharmaceuticals to the hospitals and initiate action under the Epidemic Act,” he said in a statement.A senior official of the Bengaluru police said that teams have been formed to crack down on the black-market sales of the injections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/concerns-over-remdesivir-shortage-grow-101618600816251.html
17-04-2021||India||Police launches helpline to curb online fraud||Bengaluru: After the success of a pilot project, the Bengaluru police have launched a helpline, the Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR) system, to address online fraud complaints. Bengaluru Police commissioner Kamal Pant explained that as per the new initiative, launched in the first week of April, any victim of online financial fraud can lodge a complaint by calling a police helpline number. “Based on the information provided by complainants, the police will work with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and freeze the account to which the money has been transferred,” he said. According to National Crime Records Bureau data, in 2019, Bengaluru recorded the highest number of cybercrimes among all metro cities in India with 10,668 cases. The city closest to Bengaluru was Mumbai, which reported 1,482 cybercrimes that year. Among the cybercrimes in the city, phishing, smishing and vishing have been a big concern for both citizens and the police. According to experts, phishing is a type of financial fraud where criminals defraud, dupe or mislead people through email. The number of phishing emails have risen in the past few years and have got a lot more sophisticated, experts said. ‘Vishing’ is over-the-phone phishing, where scammers try to persuade people to share information by posing as bank staff or other financial service employees. ‘Smishing’ is SMS phishing where text messages are sent trying to encourage people to pay money out or click on suspicious links. In the current system, if a person loses their money in an online fraud or phishing, they have to approach a police station or one of the dedicated cybercrime police stations in the city. This is a time-consuming process and any delay in such cases could make the recovery of the money difficult, experts added. A pilot project was launched in the last week of December 2020, which was deemed success by the Bengaluru police, which received around 20 calls per day. “Our aim is to make the process of lodging a complaint people friendly. Such system is being introduced for the time in the country,” said the police commissioner. Explaining how the new system works, deputy commissioner of police, command centre, Isha Pant said a victim of online financial fraud has to call 112 and raise a complaint, giving available details. “This is registered as a Cybercrime Incident Report (CIR). This is not a First Information Report (FIR) but a CIR. The details are then given to cybercrime investigators, a team dedicated to this process, operating out of the police command centre. They network with banks and RBI and freeze accounts following an investigation,” she said. She added that the cybercrime investigators have received training in handling such cases and they would make use of the mobile number from which the victim got a call or the details of the bank to which to money was transferred. “RBI already has a Standard Operating Procedure for such frauds or the project. As per that, it is very important that the complaint is lodged within 2 hours of the fraud. RBI calls this the golden hour because it is the time available before this money is transferred or withdrawn,” the officer added. A CIR is not an official complaint. In case the money is retrieved by the police, in order to get it back, the victim should lodge an FIR. “The FIR is an official complaint. CIR is part of the process to fast track the investigation. Once the money is retrieved, it can be given to the victim through a court order,” Pant added. So far, Bengaluru Police have five dedicated lines for cybercrimes and 20 cybercrime investigators working in three shifts, which is expected to be expanded over the coming months, said an officer. In 2019, Bengaluru recorded the maximum 10,668 cybercrime cases, followed by Mumbai with 1,482, Lucknow (962), Hyderabad (428) and Jaipur (415). In Bengaluru, the number of cases showed a 91.51% increase in a year from 2,743 in 2017 to 5,253 in 2018, as per NCRB data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/police-launches-helpline-to-curb-online-fraud-101618600636261.html
17-04-2021||India||Amid sharp surge in Covid-19 cases, Yediyurappa tests positive||Bengaluru Around eight months after he recovered from Covid-19 in August last year, Karnataka chief minister BS Yediyurappa once again tested positive for the infection on Friday.The infection was first detected through a Rapid Antigen Test (RAT), few hours after the CM held an emergency meeting with senior ministers and officials to discuss the strategy to contain the surge of the pandemic in the state. It was later confirmed by an RT-PCR test.The development comes two days after the CM campaigned in Belagavi for bypolls, raising concerns about the number of people he might have come in contact with during his rallies.Video clips of the rallies seen by Hindustan Times showed Yediyurappa surrounded by hundreds of people in Belagavi, one of the three constituencies that go to bypolls on Saturday.“Upon having mild fever, today I got tested for Covid-19 and my report has come out positive. Although I am doing fine, I am being hospitalised based on the advice of doctors. I request all those who have come in my contact recently to be observant and exercise self-quarantine,” Yediyurappa posted from his personal Twitter handle.The CM has been admitted to Manipal Hospital, a private medical facility in Bengaluru, which treated him the last time he contracted the disease as well.Meanwhile, the active case count in Karnataka breached the six-figure mark on Friday and stood at 107315 after the state reported 14,859 new infections, according to the daily health bulletin.The state also reported 78 fatalities while the case positivity rate was recorded at 11.11%, according to government data.Yediyurappa, 78, had earlier got tested on April 13 after experiencing symptoms but was ruled Covid negative following which he left for the border district of Belagavi for campaigning for two days, according to the chief minister’s office.However, on both days (April 13 and 14) Yediyurappa called off his campaign mid-way and returned to his hotel room after feeling uneasy, people in the know of the matter said. He returned to Bengaluru on Thursday and after taking a day’s rest called for an emergency meeting on Friday morning. At around 11am, he addressed the media as well. A couple of hours later, he was declared Covid-19 positive. “A medical board of clinical experts has been instituted and currently he is being evaluated and treated for respiratory symptoms. He is cheerful and clinically in a stable condition,” according to a statement by Manipal Hospital.“Primary contacts such as important leaders who have come in contact with the CM during campaigning will be tested for Covid-19,” Dr CN Manjunath, member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee on Covid-19, said, adding that those who attended Yediyurappa’s rallies but kept their distance from him were “not at risk”.“Contact tracing becomes very difficult when you cannot identify or locate people who have come in contact (with a patient). This happens in the case of crowds. However, all those who could be identified should be subjected to an RT-PCR test,” said a senior government official, requesting not to be named.Karnataka is witnessing a sharp surge in cases lately leading to overburdening of the health infrastructure. Capital Bengaluru, the worst hit in the state, reported 9,917 new cases and 57 fatalities on Friday. The figure is much higher than the last record high of 5,121 cases reported on October 8, 2020. Experts said the jump was an indication of the rapid transmissibility of the virus in the second wave of infections.The situation in other parts of the state too continued to deteriorate, data showed.There were 279 new infections in Ballari, 120 in Belagavi, 358 in Bengaluru Rural, 326 in Bidar, 180 in Chikballapur, 256 in Dakshina Kannada, 176 in Dharwad, 244 in Hassan, 488 in Kalaburagi, 158 in Koppal, 137 in Mandya, 432 in Tumakuru and 207 in Vijayapura on Friday.The government has imposed a night curfew in about seven district of the state, including Bengaluru.Yediyurappa on Friday said the state government will take a fresh decision on further curbs before April 20 after meeting with members of the opposition and consulting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.He, though, indicated that the night curfew was likely to be extended and imposed on a few other districts as well.K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health and family welfare, and medical education minister, said the number of people allowed to participate in gatherings in open and enclosed spaces will be drastically cut down. While only 200 people will now be allowed to attend events in the open (as opposed to 500 earlier), only 100 people will be permitted to gather in enclosed spaces, he said. For funerals, only 25 to 50 people will be allowed at a cremation ground while no more than 25 people will be allowed at cemeteries for burials, according to the government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-sharp-surge-in-covid-19-cases-yediyurappa-tests-positive-101618600576274.html
17-04-2021||India||Amid Covid-19, EC bars campaigns at night||The Election Commission of India on Friday banned campaigning from 7pm to 10am and extended the silence period for the upcoming three phases of the West Bengal election to 72 hours, warning candidates and political parties of strict action for violations as Covid-19 cases spike across the country.The commission directed political parties and candidates to provide masks and sanitisers to participants at public rallies and meetings, threatening strict action, including penal provisions, over non-compliance.“Candidates and parties shall ensure absolute, repeat absolute, adherence to Covid guidelines in letter and spirit. Violations , if any shall be sternly dealt with and action, including criminal action, taken as per extant legal framework,” EC said in a letter to all political parties.“In view of unprecedented public health situation and the imperative of ongoing elections, the commission today extended the silence period up to 72 hours (instead of 48 hours) and restricted the period of campaign up to 7pm (instead of 10pm). These orders have come into effect immediately,” the commission said in a separate order.The fifth phase of the West Bengal assembly election will be held on April 17. Political parties such as the Trinamool Congress had demanded that the remaining three phases of the poll be clubbed into one, but EC officials familiar with the matter said the suggestion was not tenable and the elections would continue as scheduled. The commission also conducted an all-party meeting on Friday to address concerns of political outfits.“TMC wanted one phase,” said an EC official familiar with the matter. “BJP wanted to go as per schedule, while other parties said they would follow whatever is decided by the chief electoral officer and EC.”The official added that clubbing all three phases was procedurally and logistically not possible as the dates of issuance of notification and withdrawal were different.“The seventh and eight phases could have been clubbed together, but logistically it will be difficult to manage. Postponing the election is not a solution at all. In any case, from 26 to 29, the commission has banned campaigning.”The official said there have been no problems at the booth level, and a majority of election officials have already been vaccinated. “The officials are using sanitisers, shields and masks. The area of concern is rallies and roadshows. The local officials have been authorised to cancel any such even found in violation.”Ground reports by Hindustan Times have shown that most political parties were in violation of Covid-19 guidelines, with the candidates often following the protocol but rally participants not adhering to the norms.The EC order warned political parties of strict action in case of any violation of Covid-19 guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-bans-campaigning-at-night-increases-silence-period-101618599858026.html
17-04-2021||India||Centre asks U.P., Chhattisgarh to increase beds, ramp up testing||The Centre on Friday advised Uttar Pradesh and Chhattisgarh to increase the number of beds for Covid-19 patients in the states as the two states continued to report a high number of cases.At a review meeting, chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, Indian Council of Medical Research director Dr Balram Bhargava recommended ramping of testing facilities in the districts with a positivity rate of over 5%.“The reported shortage of hospital infrastructure...were discussed in comprehensive detail, requiring an urgent ramping up of hospital infrastructure. The states were advised to increase the number of isolation beds, oxygen beds, ventilators/ICU beds, ambulance fleet as per requirement; plan for adequate oxygen supply; and focus on mortality reduction by early identification of positive cases and adherence to national treatment protocol,” an official statement said.After Maharashtra, which has 638,034 active cases, Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh have reported over 100,000 active cases each. On Friday, Chhattisgarh reported 14,912 fresh infections, and UP 27,360 new infections.“Health ministry is informing states every day in the morning of the day’s supply of Covid-19 vaccines, to enable better planning for optimum utilisation of the vaccines. An augmented health workforce would be needed in the coming days for contact tracing and house-to-house survey for the symptomatic patients,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-asks-u-p-chhattisgarh-to-increase-beds-ramp-up-testing-101618598836056.html
17-04-2021||India||Institute that helped fight the 1896 plague will now produce Covid-19 jab||The institute where a vaccine was developed to inoculate Bombay’s residents against the Bubonic plague of 1896 will produce Covaxin, starting next year. A day after receiving the Centre’s nod for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech, which developed and manufactures Covaxin, to Maharashtra government-owned Haffkine Bio Pharmaceuticals Corporation Limited, the parent organisation, Haffkine Institute for Training, Research and Testing, said it will develop a Bio-Safety Level 3 laboratory to begin production.The laboratory will come up at an estimated cost of ₹154 crore, and will be equipped to produce 228 million doses annually of Covaxin, Dr Sandeep Rathod, managing director, Haffkine Institute said.“The manufacturing of the vaccine will be done in two phases — first, we will manufacture the raw material which we call the drug substance, and second, fill and finish of the product. We will manufacture the drug substance at our BSL -3 laboratory (which will be set up), and as part of the next step, the vaccine will be filled in bottles and the product will be finished. We are looking to start production in a year,” he said.A BSL-3 laboratory usually takes years to set up, but Rathod said the institute will aim to set one up within a year. The work undertaken in such a laboratory involves high-risk microbes that can cause potentially lethal diseases through respiratory transmission, and thus follows stringent containment protocols.For instance, the exhaust air from the laboratory cannot be recirculated, and the premises must have sustained directional airflow by drawing air from clean areas towards potentially contaminated areas.On Thursday, Renu Swarup, secretary, department of biotechnology of ministry of science and technology issued permission for Haffkine Institute to produce Covaxin. In January, the institute had sought permission from Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) for transfer of technology from Bharat Biotech. ICMR and Bharat Biotech co-developed the vaccine.In March, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow Haffkine Institute to manufacture the vaccine. The institute’s proposal to ICMR sought funds from the state and Centre.Dr Waldemar Mordecai Haffkine was deputed to then-Bombay to help authorities tackle the Bubonic plague outbreak in 1896. Haffkine started the Plague Research Laboratory and developed a vaccine that he first tested on himself and his assistant in January 1897. The vaccine was then rolled out to inmates of a Byculla prison – all of whom survived the epidemic and did not contract the plague.The vaccine was then rolled out among the Parsis, one of the first communities that agreed to be vaccinated en masse. The microbiologist is also credited for having developed an anti-cholera vaccine. The laboratory, which was shifted to the Governor’s official residence in Parel in 1899 – a site it has occupied since then – was renamed Haffkine Institute in 1925.The multidisciplinary institute is engaged in training, research and testing of various aspects of infectious diseases. It is credited with developing a number of prophylactics in the recent past too, including the anti-rabies serum, anti-venom serum, and oral polio vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/institute-that-helped-fight-the-1896-plague-will-now-produce-covid-jab-101618598776716.html
17-04-2021||India||Top akhadas call for Mahakumbh to end||For the first time in the history of the Mahakumbh, akhadas, the all-powerful spiritual sects to which seers belong, have given a call for ending Mahakumbh midway after several seers tested positive for Covid-19 and two chief seers, or Mahamandaleshwar, died from the viral disease. Mahakumbh, which started on April 1, is scheduled to end on April 30.On Friday, Haridwar reported 539 of 2402 fresh cases in Uttarakhand, and 28 seers from three akhadas tested positive for Covid-19, according to officials. Of the 28, 22 are from Niranjani Akhada, four from Maha Nirvani Akhada and two from Juna Akhada, said Kumbh Mela health officer Dr AS Sengar, adding that testing at akhada camps has been increased.Around 75 seers have tested positive over the last two months, said chief medical officer, Haridwar, Dr SK Jha.Seers fear they might get infected with the virus in the Kumbh area, which witnessed a rush of over 1.3 million on the Shahi Snan (holy dip in the Ganga) on Wednesday. Still, the call of some akhadas for an early end to the Mahakumbh has not been backed by the apex Akhada Parishad.The call was given by Shri Panchayati Niranjani Akhada, and been supported by Shri Panchayati Atal Akhada, and Shri Anand Akhada, whose seers have actually started leaving the Kumbh area. The largest Akhada, Shri Panch Dashnam Juna Akhada, has also expressed serious concern over the spike in Covid cases and its impact on the rest of the Kumbh, although it has not sought a shortening. Across akhada camps, though, fear-stricken seers are lining up to be tested.On Friday, Mahamandleshwar Jagatguru Swami Shyamdev Devacharya Maharaj, who held the seat of mahant at Jabalpur’s Narsinmgh Temple Gita Dham, died due to Covid-19.Earlier, on April 13, Mahamandaleshwar of Shri Panch Nirmani Ani Akhada, Kapil Dev Das, died of the infection. Many from his akhada have since returned to their base in Madhya Pradesh’s Chitrakoot.With just one Shahi Snan left on April 27, the secretary of the second largest akhada, Shri Panchayati Niranjani Akhada, Shri Mahant Ravindra Puri Maharaj, who tested positive on Thursday, has urged seers to leave the Kumbh area. “Some akhadas taking part in the Chaitra Poornima Shahi Snan on April 27 should take a symbolic dip and not resort to a grand public religious procession.”Shri Anand Akhada’s Mahamandaleshwar Swami Balkanand Giri has also announced that his akhada will leave the area, although, three of its seers will stay back for the Shahi Snan.The three Bairagi Akhadas, who are followers of Vaishnavism, however, have made it clear that they will go ahead with the April 27 Shahi Snan. They criticised the Niranjani-Atal Akhada and the Anand Akhada for their call and sought an apology from them for “giving a wrong and negative message of ending Mahakumbh midway”.Shri Mahant Dharam Das of Shri Nirvani Ani Akhada said, “It is only the Uttarakhand government that has the right to end the Kumbh fair.”Shri Panchayati Bada Udasin Akhada has made it clear that its seers will take part in the Shahi Snan irrespective of the call by some akhadas. “But we are not averse to restricting the number of seers in the Shahi Snan,” said its Mahamandaleshwar, Hari Chetnanand Maharaj .The Akhil Bharatiya Akhada Parishad, the apex body of all the 13 akhadas, clarified that Mahakumbh has not come to an end and Shahi Snan on April 27 will go ahead as per the tradition.“Those akhadas who have announced Mahakumbh ending are those who don’t take part in the last Shahi Snan. It is a welcome step as they have asked their akhada seers to leave the Kumbh camp...,” said Akhada Parishad general secretary Mahant Hari Giri Maharaj.Writer Mahesh Parikh, who has been tracking akhadas for years, pointed that as per tradition, the last Shahi Snan of Chaitra Poornima is attended only by three Bairagi Akhadas. Most others do leave sometime after their own holy dips are over, although this time, the fear of Covid has expedited the process, he added.As Bairagi Akhadas worship Lord Ram, its seers will also be taking part in the holy bath on Ram Navami on April 21.Kumbh Mela officer in charge Deepak Rawat said Mela administration has not received any directive regarding curtailing or ending the Mahakumbh before April 30.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/top-akhadas-call-for-mahakumbh-to-end-101618598776131.html
17-04-2021||India||Infra overrun: Scramble for ventilators, oxygen, ICU beds||A record daily spike in coronavirus infections pushed health infrastructure to the brink in several states on Friday as patients scrambled to secure hospital beds, governments struggled to provide oxygen needed to stabilise serious patients, and crematoriums in major cities reported huge rush and long delays.The worst crisis was reported from major urban centres with high caseloads, bringing true fears, expressed by experts when the pandemic first hit India in March last year, of infections inundating hospitals, overwhelming civic infrastructure and taking medical staff to the breaking point.In Delhi, which reported its highest daily case number of 19,486 on Friday, 88% of 3,976 intensive care unit beds were occupied, according to the government’s Delhi Corona app. Patients also reported acute difficulties in securing a bed.In Bengaluru, which logged 9,917 cases, 99% beds in government hospitals were occupied, an increase of more than 20 percentage points in the past three days. In Mumbai, which saw 8,839 cases, the bed occupancy rate was close to 80%. The availability of beds in ICUs or with oxygen support was even harder to come by. What made matters worse for critical patients in several big cities was that the distribution of vacant beds was uneven and poorly publicised, and getting care in hospitals in the vicinity was difficult.“We do not have beds, what can we do. We have to refuse patients. We do not even know where to refer them to; it is not like there are hospitals in the city that have beds available,” said a doctor from a top private hospital in Delhi. The situation was no better in smaller cities.In Chhattisgarh’s Raipur, the occupancy rate of beds increased to 90% on Friday even as the state announced new Covid care centres for mild or asymptomatic patients. In Patna, all Covid beds in premier institutes such as All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Patna, and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences were full, while those at Patna Medical College and Nalanda Medical College were up to 90% occupied, according to health department.All major hospitals in Ranchi such as Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) and Sadar hospital showed full occupancy of oxygen-supported and ICU beds, showed the city Covid dashboard on Friday evening.In West Bengal, which is in the middle of eight-phase assembly elections, hospital occupancy rate zoomed from 25% on February 26, when the polls were announced, to 86% on April 16, according to the state health department. During the same period, daily infections rose from 190 to 5,334, in a spike of over 2700%. Out of the 56 private hospitals in and around state capital Kolkata, 21 had no beds vacant and 22 had less than 10 beds left, showed health department data on Friday evening.“The occupancy rate in the government hospitals in Kolkata is much higher as the city and its adjoining district of North 24 Parganas have nearly 50% of the total cases,” said a top state health department official on condition of anonymity.Several states such as Maharashtra, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and New Delhi, have set up Covid care centres for mildly symptomatic patients, and officials hoped these would help tide over the crisis. “We have designated 50% of all hospital beds for Covid patients,” said Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singhdeo, after videos appeared of patients on stretchers waiting outside emergency wards of hospital for admission. Some states have also placed orders for additional ICU beds.An associated problem was that of oxygen supply crunch. In many states, patients said hospitals and care centres reported a shortage of oxygen that is crucial to stabilise Covid patients whose blood oxygen levels can plunge suddenly and therefore need to be consistently monitored. States such as Jammu & Kashmir, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh issued orders mandating 50% of oxygen produced by factories be provided for medical purposes. In Maharashtra’s Aurangabad, the district collector took over a local steel plant to ensure oxygen supply to hospitals in the district. On Friday, the Union home ministry directed all the states and Union territories to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders, and said they must not impose any curb on production and supply of the commodity anywhere. Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla said availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen is an important prerequisite for managing moderate and severe cases of Covid-19.In Maharashtra, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said the state government arranged for transportation of oxygen from neighbouring states but feared a disruption due to lockdowns in many states.Increasing Covid deaths in many of these states have also led to long delays at crematoriums. In Lucknow, workers at the city’s three biggest crematoriums said they were working round-the-clock, leading to a shortage of wood. In Ahmedabad, crematoriums reported a waiting time of anywhere between five to 12 hours.In Raipur, the district administration created 14 makeshift cremation grounds while in Surat, the authorities reopened a crematorium after 15 years and created another makeshift one.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-surge-pushes-health-civic-infra-to-breaking-point-101618598716178.html
17-04-2021||India||1,189 samples have tested positive for SARS COV-2 variants: Health ministry||A total of 1,189 samples have so far tested positive for variants of concern of SARS COV-2 in India, the health ministry said on Friday as the country is witnessing a steep surge in Covid-19 cases.These include 1,109 samples testing positive for the UK variants, 79 for the South Africa variant and one sample for the Brazil variant, the ministry said.Till April 15, 13,614 samples have been processed at the 10 designated INSACOG laboratories for whole genome sequencing (WGS), it added."Of these, 1,189 samples have tested positive for variants of concern for SARS COV-2 in India. This includes 1,109 samples with the UK variants; 79 samples with the South Africa variant and one sample with the Brazil variant," the ministry said.The coronavirus has been mutating and various mutations have been found in several countries, including the UK (17 mutations), Brazil (17 mutations) and South Africa (12 mutations)."These variants have a higher transmissibility. The UK variant has been found extensively in the UK, all across Europe and has spread to Asia and America."The double mutation (two mutations) is another variant and has been found in several countries like Australia, Belgium, Germany, Ireland, Namibia, New Zealand, Singapore, the United Kingdom, the USA. Higher transmissibility of this variant is not established as yet," the ministry said in a statement.It said the RT-PCR tests being conducted in India do not miss these mutations as these tests target more than two genes. The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR tests remain the same as earlier, it said."The detection of these mutations does not change the strategy of management which remains to test, track, trace and treat. The use of masks remains as the most important shield to prevent the spread of COVID-19," the ministry stressed.It said the INSACOG guidelines were shared with the states again and they were advised to send samples for genome sequencing by also providing the clinical data of positive persons.This will enable a great epidemiological insight into the link of the surge at various places to the variants as well as enable the INSACOG to discover other variants of concern, if present in the community.Many states, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kerala, are yet to share the data with the National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), though Punjab and Delhi have shared the information, the ministry highlighted.The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is a network of 10 laboratories established in December 2020 for continuously monitoring the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in the country through WGS.The SOPs for epidemiological surveillance and response in the context of a new variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus detected in the UK were disseminated to all the states as well as placed on the ministry's website on December 22, 2020.According to the INSACOG guidelines, positive samples are sourced for WGS from international travellers who are positive by RT-PCR, community samples are coordinated by the state surveillance officers, who facilitate the transfer of samples from the districts or laboratories to the designated INSACOG laboratories. All states have been mapped to specific INSACOG laboratories.The 10 identified INSACOG laboratories report their sequencing results to the Central Surveillance Unit (CSU) of the NCDC, from where it is shared with the state surveillance units (SSUs) of the IDSP through email as well as regular meetings by the NCDC with the state surveillance officers, who, in turn, take up the operational response with the health secretaries.Hence, the states are continuously informed of the virus variants found in other states, the ministry said.In a few instances, the INSACOG laboratories have also communicated the results directly to the states.The NCDC has also communicated state-specific results formally to the states concerned from time to time. The results of Himachal Pradesh were communicated on April 8, those of Punjab were communicated on March 26, those of Rajasthan on April 10 and those of Maharashtra were shared with the state on nine different occasions from March 12 to April 16.Written communications on the need for more stringent measures were sent at regular intervals not just to the high-burden states, but all the states by the secretary (health), assistant secretary (health), NCDC director and IDSP to the chief secretaries, ACS health, SSOs, DHSs etc.The states and Union territories were repeatedly asked to keep a strict vigil and take up stringent public health measures in view of the unlock provisions and new strains being reported from various countries.Press briefings conducted by the health ministry provide specific updates on the current status of the variants of concern and the new mutants, and also stress on increased and stringent public health interventions.At a press briefing on March 24, the NCDC director made a detailed presentation on various variants of the coronavirus detected in the country, the ministry said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/1189-samples-have-tested-positive-for-sars-cov-2-variants-health-ministry-101618597656073.html
17-04-2021||India||India reiterates call for immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan||India on Friday called for an immediate ceasefire in Afghanistan to end a wave of violence and targeted killings, and said it is closely following the intra-Afghan peace process in the wake of the US decision to withdraw all its troops from the war-torn country. Following US President Joe Biden’s announcement about withdrawing all American forces by the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in September, secretary of state Antony Blinken visited Kabul on Thursday to discuss the transition with the Afghan leadership. Blinken also conveyed the US commitment to a continuing partnership with Afghanistan. Reacting to these developments, external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said: “We have noted the decision of the US to withdraw its troops from Afghanistan and to end its military operations there. We are closely following the ongoing intra-Afghan peace process.” Bagchi added, “We are deeply concerned about the increase in violence and targeted killings in Afghanistan. India has called for an immediate and comprehensive ceasefire.” The Afghan people, he said, have seen more than four decades of war and unrest and deserve long-lasting peace and development. “India is of the view that an Afghan peace process should be Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled. Any political settlement must be inclusive and should preserve the socio-economic and political gains of the past 19 years,” he said. India backs a united, democratic and sovereign Afghanistan and has participated in several key meetings aimed at helping chart a way forward in Afghanistan, including the Doha Conference, the Geneva Conference and the Heart of Asia Conference in Dushanbe. “India remains engaged with the Afghan stakeholders and also our regional and international partners regarding next steps,” Bagchi said. After his talks in Kabul, Blinken told reporters that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan, and the only way toward a durable and lasting end to the war is through negotiations and a political agreement based on compromise. “And I hope the Taliban understands that as well. If as our forces are withdrawing, the Taliban were to attack them, it would be met with a very forceful response. And of course, as I said, we’re going to continue to support the Afghan National Security Forces, but importantly we are doing everything we can now to advance diplomacy, to bring in regional and international partners so that everyone is using their influence and their leverage to advance a peaceful end to the conflict,” he said. “It’s very important that the Taliban recognise that it will never be legitimate and it will never be durable if it rejects a political process and tries to take the country by force,” Blinken said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-reiterates-call-for-immediate-ceasefire-in-afghanistan-101618597936728.html
17-04-2021||India||Kerala HC quashes 2 police cases on ED||The Kerala high court on Friday quashed two cases filed in March by the state police against officials of the Enforcement Directorate for allegedly forcing the two main accused in the gold smuggling case to implicate chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and some of his Cabinet colleagues.Also Read | Kerala CM violated Covid protocols, allege Cong, BJP, seek actionThe first information reports (FIRs) against ED were filed on the basis of the reported claims of the main accused in the smuggling case, Swapna Suresh, and her accomplice, Sandeep Nair, that they were being pressured to take certain, names including that of Vijayan.The smuggling case surfaced last year after 30kg gold was seized from diplomatic baggage meant for Thiruvananthapuram’s UAE consulate. Later, Vijayan’s principal secretary, M Sivasankar, was among those arrested for helping the accused. Investigators alleged that Suresh was the mastermind.ED moved the court saying the FIRs were filed with “ulterior motives to derail statutory investigation under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act related to the smuggling of large quantities of the gold...”The court quashed the FIRs, saying the police should have approached the special PMLA court. A single-judge bench of justice VG Arun also directed the crime branch to submit all information in the matter to the PMLA court in a sealed cover.Congress leader Ramesh Chennitahala lauded the verdict. BJP leader and Union minister V Muraleedharan said Vijayan cannot get away by sacrificing some of his officials. “He cannot intimidate central agencies.” The ruling CPI (Marxist) said the government will take a decision after examining the verdict.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gold-smuggling-case-kerala-hc-quashes-police-firs-against-ed-officials-101618560974590.html

His two-year term as the CBI head from 2012 to 2014 was marred by the controversy over entries in the visitors’ diary at his official residence. The entries showed he had allegedly met suspects in the alleged 2G spectrum allocation and coal scams.The Supreme Court asked Sinha to recuse himself after details of the diary came to light. It appointed then additional director RK Dutta as in charge of the probe into the case until Sinha retired in 2014. A Delhi court in 2017 acquitted all the accused in the 2G spectrum case.The Supreme Court called the CBI a “caged parrot” during Sinha’s tenure as it came down heavily on “political masters” for interfering with the coal scam probe. In April 2017, CBI filed a case against him under the Prevention of Corruption Act for allegedly scuttling and influencing the probe in the case. There has been no development in the case since then and no charge sheet was filed.Also Read | CBI files second case against ex-TMC MP in a weekSinha was decorated with the Police Medal for Meritorious Service in 1991 and the President’s Police Medal for Distinguished Service in 1997.Serving and retired CBI officers remember Sinha as an officer who did not believe much in the hierarchy and as a very approachable person expecting colleagues to speak their mind.Anil Sinha, who worked with Ranjit Sinha and later succeeded him as CBI chief in December 2014, called the former a very affable person. “It is a sad end... Even when the whole world was going against him, he never lost his cool. He would say ‘why am I being targeted?’”Javeed Ahmad, who was CBI’s joint director (policy) between 2012 and 2014, remembers Ranjit Sinha as a strong-headed person. “He did not shoot from others’ shoulders. He would not ask anyone to do anything for him. He would go ahead and do it himself.”Ranjit Sinha is survived by his wife, a son, and a daughter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-cbi-director-ranjit-sinha-passes-away-in-delhi-101618550893977.html

The variant was first detected on October 5 and was relatively obscure till it began popping up on increasing number of samples January onwards, the India situation report on outbreak.info showed. On April 1, it accounted for 80% of all analysed genome sequences of mutant variants sent by India to the global repository GISAID.The second most-commonly found variant in the last 60 days was the UK variant, or B.1.1.7, at 13% of the samples, according to the assessment by scientists from Scripps Research.Both trends could be worrying for India, and, at least to some degree, explain the outbreak pattern. B.1.617 was first found in a large number of samples in Maharashtra, the first hot spot region of the second wave of infections that, till April 7, added more than half the new cases being recorded in the country.The researchers at outbreak.info added that this data may not reflect the true prevalence patterns. “SARS-CoV-2 (hCoV-19) sequencing is not a random sample of mutations. As a result, this report does not indicate the true prevalence of the mutations but rather our best estimate now.”The data may also be skewed depending on whether all genomes sequenced were uploaded, although the trends -- where B.1.617 has steadily grown in comparison to others variants among samples -- supports the overall pattern.But a top official involved in India’s coronavirus genome sequencing efforts said the findings were consistent with what has been observed by them at the ground.“Nearly 60 to 80% of the samples from Maharashtra have the variant; the prevalence must be similar in Gujarat. Elsewhere, it is under 10 to 20%. From barely existing in December, it is now found pretty much everywhere we look. We have a separate column for the variant for every state now,” said Anurag Agarwal, director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, one of the ten labs under Insacog.“We have a fairly good idea about which mutated variant is prevalent where; but the important thing is all of them are increasing,” he added.“The B.1.617 variant is prevalent towards the West in Maharashtra and Gujarat. The B.1.1.7 variant is prevalent in the North in Punjab. In South India, the one with N440K mutation is prevalent but that seems to be quiet. Eventually, one of the other variants will reach there. And, in the East, we do not have a particular variant but the South African variant is fairly common in Bangladesh, causing almost 80% of the cases so that might cross over to India. That will be troublesome for the AstraZeneca vaccine.”The double mutation refers to specific changes, among some others, that are denoted by E484Q (glutamate is replaced by glutamine at the 484th spot of the spike protein) and L452R (substitution of leucine with arginine at the 452nd position).Both are being investigated for giving the virus an ability to evade immunity from a past infection, even vaccines. L452R has also been found in a variant spreading in California, US, where it was implicated in a large outbreak earlier this year. In an interview to HT on Wednesday, India’s principal scientific adviser K VijayRaghavan said B.1.617 could now be considered a “variant of concern”, or VOC.The UK variant, B.1.1.7, has been confirmed to be more transmissible and was similarly implicated in a large resurgence of cases across the UK.A second scientist involved in the sequencing efforts said more evidence is required to tie mutations with case trends. “The double mutant variant is increasing in the country. But the rise in cases cannot be attributed solely to the mutated variants. Human behaviour plays a very important part in transmission; in the UK when the new variant started spreading a lockdown controlled the spread,” said Dr Rakesh Mishra, director, Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), one of the 10 laboratories in Insacog.Dr Saumitra Das, director of National Institute of Biomedical Genomics – Kalyani, said: “We have not been able to establish that the new variant is the reason behind the faster spread of the infection during the second wave; it is the behaviour of the people.”The analysis, published on outbreak.info, also showed that a large number of B.1.617 samples were detected in West Bengal. The 117 B.1.617 samples in Bengal accounted for 9% of the all genomes sequenced in the state till now. In Maharashtra, at 120, there were more samples but these accounted for 6% of the 1,931 samples sequenced.“To describe the prevalence of sets of mutations in our Mutation Situation Reports, we rely on shared virus sequences from the GISAID Initiative. While we apply filters to remove some low quality sequences and unreasonable metadata as described in our methods, we rely on the accuracy of the sequences and sample metadata deposited in GISAID,” the outbreak.info website said.In all, the B.1.617 variant has been found in 408 sequences sampled across the world. Of these, 265 have been found in India from among the 8,455 sequences analysed in the outbreak.info report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/double-mutant-now-most-common-of-variantsdata-101618512310963.html
