He later said the video wasn’t posted by him and that he would file a complaint with the cybercrime cell.“I am not connected to this in any manner,” said Pandiarajan in a video message. “This tweet was posted without my permission. I will get to the bottom of this and action will be taken against those responsible. I will also be filing a complaint with the cybercrime cell. I never have the intention to defame anyone,” the minister said in his video.” The tweet was deleted from his official handle.The doctored video was that of a 17-year-old female who had died by suicide after being unable to clear the National Eligibility Cum Entrance Test (NEET). The video sourced various footage of her television interviews, with doctored audio mimicking her voice to seek votes for the AIADMK.The woman’s brother has filed a complaint with the Ariyalur district police against his sister’s videos being used for politicking. The woman has become the face of the struggle against NEET, which is an emotional issue in Tamil Nadu, and one of the DMK’s core campaigns against the AIADMK.Also read: Dr Ramadoss and the dynamics of Vanniyar quota in Tamil Nadu pollsIn another issue, a purported letter was being circulated on WhatsApp and social media platforms. The letter was allegedly addressed to the DMK president from the I-PAC team stating that they were losing the election. Poll strategist Prashant Kishore’s I-PAC team is a consultant for the DMK, In a tweet, the I-PAC clarified that the letter was fake. “Disgusting to see a ruling political party @AIADMKOfficial circulating a fake email to support their false propaganda. Reeks of desperation,” the I-PAC’s said in a tweet.The campaigning for the 234 assembly election seats came to an end on Sunday evening. Tamil Nadu goes to the polls on April 6 in a single phase. Counting of votes will be held on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fake-emails-hacked-twitter-account-as-tamil-nadu-poll-campaign-draws-to-a-close-101617560652165.html

04-04-2021||India||Farmers not leaving protest sites near Delhi, says Rakesh Tikait||Refuting claims that farmers have left protest sites along the Delhi border, Bharatiya Kisan Union leader Rakesh Tikait on Sunday said they had gone to the fields to work and would return when the Central government was "free from West Bengal elections".Farmers, mainly from Punjab, Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, have been protesting at the Delhi border for over 4 months now against the Centre's three agri marketing laws, and have demanded its repeal along with a legal guarantee on the minimum support price mechanism.Tikait, who reached Gujarat to drum up support for the stir, began his two-day visit by praying at the Ambaji Temple in Banaskantha district and then addressing groups in Ambaji and Palanpur.He told a gathering that the three laws were enacted to help businessmen and not farmers, and the latter had decided to not move from the protest sites till victory, that is acceptance of all their demands, was achieved."All reports that farmers have left the agitation sites are wrong. Farmers come and go. At present, they have gone to work in their fields. We have told them to come back once the government is free from (West) Bengal elections. The entire government is camping in Bengal. Once the government returns, we will start negotiations with it," Tikait claimed.He said farmers from Gujarat must also join the protest in large numbers so that the country feels confident that cultivators from the state from where some of the big leaders hail, a possible reference to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union Home Minister Amit Shah, are also against the new laws.Exhorting farmers from Gujarat to use tractors to protest, Tikait said these vehicles are the "tanks of farmers" and were put to good use in Delhi to remove police barricades.While former Gujarat chief minister Shankarsinh Vaghela accompanied Tikait in his rally from Ambaji to Palanpur, Congress MLA Geniben Thakor welcomed the BKU leader when he entered the state earlier in the day.Incidentally, Tikait had taken a swipe at the BJP government in Gujarat earlier in the day by showing his passport to reporters while entering the state after alighting from a train in Abu Road in neighbouring Rajasthan.Asked about whether he was carrying a Covid-19 negative certificate, which is mandatory while travelling to Gujarat, Tikait showed his passport and said, "I have all the documents with me. This is my passport if it is required to enter Gujarat".Tikait will visit Sabarmati Ashram on Monday and go to Bardoli on the second day of his Gujarat visit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-not-leaving-protest-sites-near-delhi-says-rakesh-tikait-101617549393644.html

It can spread by live or dead pigs and pork products.Transmission can also occur via contaminated feed and objects such as shoes, clothes, vehicles, knives and other equipment. Unlike Classical Swine Fever (CSF), there is no vaccine for ASF.The only way to stop this disease is to depopulate all affected or exposed swine herds.What are the signs of ASF?The USDA says that the signs of ASF include high fever, decreased appetite and weakness, red and blotchy skin or skin lesions, diarrhea and vomiting, and coughing and difficulty in breathing.Experts have suggested on-farm biosecurity to prevent the animal disease from developing and spreading.Can it spread to humans?While swine flu can spread from animals to humans, swine fever does not, and therefore is not a public health threat.ASF is found in countries around the world, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Last year, the infection killed many pigs in Assam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panic-over-suspected-asf-in-mizoram-everything-you-need-to-know-about-it-101617555938331.html

04-04-2021||India||Direct payment to farmers: Navjot Singh Sidhu claims Centre wants to ‘destroy’ mandi system in Punjab||Congress leader Navjot Singh Sidhu on Sunday dubbed Union minister Piyush Goyal's letter regarding direct payment to farmers as “part of a larger conspiracy” against Punjab to “destroy and disrupt” the state's tried and tested mandi system.Goyal had written a letter to the Punjab government, asking it to implement a system for direct payment to farmers for crop procurement. The state government was also asked to integrate land records, available with the revenue department, with the procurement portal.Addressing the media in Patiala at his residence, the cricketer-turned-politician questioned the timing of the letter and alleged that the Centre wanted to “instigate” farmers and “create a law and order situation” in the state.“This tantamounts to economic blackmail by the central government to force the farmers and Punjab to withdraw their agitation against the three farm laws,” he further alleged.Sidhu said the motive of the letter was to “disrupt” the age-old, tried and tested and successful mandi system that allows for the implementation of the minimum support price in the state.It also intends to create a “division” between arhtiyas (commission agents) and farmers in the state, he alleged.This letter is part of a “larger conspiracy” to stall the procurement of wheat crop in Punjab and destroy the state's agricultural economy, he alleged.         The Amritsar East legislator said according to Goyal, the revenue department of the state government had all the information about the land records of farmers in the state.        But according to data collected by the National Sample Survey for year 2012-13, it shows that more than 24 per cent of the land under cultivation in Punjab is under tenancy.“These tenancy contracts are oral or unwritten in nature,” he stated, adding that the land under tenancy may have increased and not decreased over the years.If the sale of wheat crop is allowed with ownership rights, then about 25 to 30 per cent farmers will not receive payment for sale of their crops, he claimed.The former Punjab minister accused the Centre of planning to “destroy” the state's successful Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee model and also questioned the timing of the letter.He emphasised that the state and its people should come together and build “an alternative economic model” for Punjab's agricultural prosperity.Asked when he would return to the state government, Sidhu refused to comment.Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh and Sidhu had on March 17 met over tea at the former's farmhouse, where they had discussed the cricketer-turned-politician's possible reinduction into the state cabinet.The following day, Singh had expressed confidence that Sidhu would be back in his cabinet.For the last several weeks, the Congress circles have been abuzz with speculation over a key cabinet berth for Sidhu and there has also been talk of him being appointed the state Congress president.The rift between Singh and Sidhu had come out in the open in May 2019 when the chief minister blamed him for the "inept handling" of the local government department, claiming it had resulted in the "poor performance" of the Congress in urban areas in the Lok Sabha polls.Sidhu was later stripped of this portfolio in a cabinet reshuffle, following which he had resigned.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/direct-payment-to-farmers-navjot-singh-sidhu-claims-centre-wants-to-destroy-mandi-system-in-punjab-101617549093293.html

04-04-2021||India||High-octane campaigning in Kerala draws to close, experts predict ‘close battle’||The high-pitch campaign for April 6 assembly elections in Kerala came to an end on Sunday with all three formations - the ruling Left Democratic Front, opposition United Democratic Front and BJP-led National Democratic Alliance - claiming a clear edge. About 2.67 crore voters will exercise their franchise on Tuesday across 40,771 polling booths to elect 140 legislators.On the final day, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi carried out a roadshow in Kozhikode (north Kerala) and flew down to Thiruvananthpuram. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman led BJP rallies in the state capital and outskirts. “The UDF is well placed and we are sure to form the next government in the state,” said Gandhi, also a member of parliament from the state, who toured extensively in the state to whip up the party’s chances.Sitharaman, however, said the wind is blowing in the NDA’s favour. “I can see PM Modi everywhere and the chorus for change is louder,” she said. Going by the ground situation, it looks like it is anyone’s game as there is no wave in favour of any coalition in the state. In the last leg, the UDF has managed to lessen the gap by “better selection” of candidates and Gandhi siblings’ (Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra) intense campaigning that stopped faction feud in the lead party Congress. Rahul Gandhi visited Kerala on three occasions and spent more than a week in the state for campaigning. Resurgent UDF shows the state is most unlikely to change its four-decade-old political script (changed governments after five years since 1982) of alternating government after every election, say political observers and election experts. True, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) was much ahead in campaigning and visibility giving an impression that there will be a continuation of power, but experts say the situation is almost similar to the India Shining campaign of the Vajpayee era. In the 2004 election, the NDA let loose a big campaign called India Shining citing robust growth rate eyeing a continuation of power but lost to the Congress. Also read: Rahul has Easter lunch with Kerala orphans; kids talk to Priyanka on video callA distant third runner, the BJP-led NDA, is also upbeat and it is likely to improve its vote share this time. Other than the BJP winning a couple of seats, the state is likely to retain its bi-polar polity. But whose votes the BJP-led NDA cuts into will be a decisive factor in the poll, experts say. In the outgoing assembly, the party had a single seat (Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram) and it is likely to go up to three. “It is a close match. The LDF managed to build a public perception that continuity will be there but in the last lap, there is a considerable dent in this perception,” said political theorist and author J Reghu. Former vice-chancellor of the Central University of Kerala and political scientist Dr G Gopakumar said a split in anti-incumbency votes between the NDA and the UDF will only favour the LDF.“The BJP is campaigning vigorously and if it attracts more votes it will damage UDF’s prospects,” he said, adding a rise in the saffron camp’s vote share will be a threat to the UDF.Reghu, however, begs to differ, saying people of the state are known for their “tactical voting.” Experts like him say there is pent up anger in the party against CM Pinarayi Vijayan’s “autocratic style of functioning” and it will reflect in ballots. It is a fact that almost all pre-poll surveys have predicted an edge to the ruling left. But political observers and party watchers say things are not that easy for the left to buck the trend. Its public relations blitz has created a good atmosphere and this euphoria will not reflect in ballots. They say early warnings have forced the UDF out of its slumber and overcome some of the inherent weaklings like faction politics in the do or die battle. One of the factors for the left’s euphoria is its victory in the December 2020 local body elections that came when the government was in the thick of many scandals like the gold smuggling case and arrest of the then party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri in money laundering case related to the drug trade. Experts say the same narrative may not work in the assembly polls too. “You can’t scale both, local body and assembly elections, with the same parameters. Other than a loud publicity campaign I don’t see any tangible reason for the left come back,” said Reghu. “The UDF failed to project a strong leader and many new faces (candidates) at the eleventh hour may affect its prospects,” said Gopakumar. But Congress leaders defend it, saying it has been the custom of the UDF to release the list late but this time it managed it without much drama or delay.“More than half of our candidates are new faces and grassroots workers. I am sure a majority of them will romp home and we are comfortably placed,” said Chandy, the star campaigner of the UDF. But the LDF said there was no looking back for it and it was steadily maintaining its upper hand. “It seems the UDF has admitted defeat. That is why even in the dying hours, opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala is raising absurd charges against the government,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. The BJP has paraded some of its top leaders, including PM Modi and home minister Amit Shah, and raked up the contentious Sabarimala issue. It has also flaunted its favourite card, Metro Man E Sreedharan, to curry favours with voters. The 88-year-old is locked in a fierce three-cornered battle in Palakkad. “The party will rewrite the poll history of the state,” said party state president K Surendran, adding that people were fed up with the alternate regimes.While the LDF is concentrating more on social security schemes and development activities, both Congress and the BJP have harped on alleged commissions and omissions of the left government. In Ernakulam district Twenty20, a corporate party, is posing a big threat to major players. It is contesting eight seats in Ernakulam.“The poll picture is quite hazy. There is a silent anti-incumbency factor. I feel the state will stick to its four-decade-old script,” said actor and writer Joy Mathew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/highoctane-campaigning-in-kerala-draws-to-close-experts-predict-close-battle-101617548531776.html

Marking this day as FCI Bachao Divas,” news agency ANI quoted a statement from SKM.“A memorandum letter will be given in the name of the Minister of Consumer Affairs,” the statement added.On March 11, FCI sent a proposal to the government recommending tighter quality controls for the procurement of wheat and paddy. For wheat, a reduction in moisture level from 14% to 12% was proposed, along with a reduction in procurement of damaged grain from the existing 4% to 2%. For paddy, stricter quality control measures like reducing the permissible limit of foreign material in grains from 2% to 1% have also been proposed.Congress Member of Parliament Pratap Singh Bajwa strongly opposed the new recommendations in Parliament during the budget session. He contended that presence of foreign materials and moisture content in food grains is weather related, and farmers cannot be penalised for it since global warming is not in their hands, reported news agency PTI.SKM told PTI on March 19 that protests were held across mandis in the country over these new procurement norms."In addition to being unresponsive to protesting farmers' legitimate demands, the Government of India's Food Corporation of India has brought in new quality specifications and procurement norms in a direct attack on the procurement regime and the ongoing protests,” the morcha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-across-india-will-protest-outside-fci-offices-on-monday-says-samyukt-kisan-morcha-101617544254334.html

I further request you to stop the election process in Tamulpur constituency immediately," Bora said.In his party's representation to the CEO, the Congress Rajya Sabha MP said, "Himanta Biswa Sarma should also be debarred and disqualified from contesting in the Assembly Election, 2021 in view of his above stated act of promoting and conspiring against Congress and grand alliance..."Meanwhile, BPF chief Hagrama Mohilary appealed to people of the Tamulpur seat to vote on the symbol of his party.Basumatary told a local TV channel that he had decided to quit the BPF as the party did not lend any helping hand to him to fund his campaign.The BPF candidate had said he couldn't withdraw himself from the contest now due to technical issues, but he would be supporting BJP's ally United People's Party Liberal (UPPL) nominee Leho Ram Boro in the seat.Echoing views of his Grand Alliance partner Congress, CPI (M) Assam secretary Debeen Bhattacharya said at a press conference Sunday that such an incident has never been seen in Indian politics."On the basis of money power, BJP wants to win the election. They know that people have rejected them. So, we demand that electuon in Tamulpur constituency be suspended," he said.The first phase of the Assam assembly elections was held on March 27, followed by second phase on April 1 and finally the third round of voting will take place in 40 constiruencies on April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-cpi-m-demand-suspension-of-poll-in-tamulpur-seat-after-bpf-candidate-joins-bjp-101617542862640.html

04-04-2021||India||India's Covid-19 cases rose from 9,000 to 90,000 in less than 50 days||Caught amid a severe grip of Covid-19 infections in a second wave, India is seeing an increased surge in the daily cases - a spike escalating at a rate worse than that seen last year.According to the numbers provided by the Union health ministry, the number of daily Covid-19 cases have shot up 10 times in a span of 50 days.India reported 9,121 cases on February 16, according to the health ministry. But in the weeks that followed, the number of daily cases increased at an alarming rate. When April began, the number touched 90,000 and on Sunday (April 4), India reported 93,249 new cases within a span of 24 hours, the highest since September last year.India on Friday added the most cases of Covid-19 than any other country, and when it comes to average, even surpassed the number of new infections in the United States, an analysis of health ministry data showed.India had seen its worst daily spike in cases on September 17, 2020, when 97,894 infections were recorded in a span of 24 hours.Worsening the situation, five states - Maharashtra, Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Kerala and Punjab - cumulatively account for 76.41 per cent of the total active cases in the country, according to the health ministry. India's worst-hit state - Maharashtra - single-handedly accounts for more than half (58.19%) of the total active caseload of the country.Experts have pressed for strict measures to restrict movement and activities in the country, with a sharp focus on speeding up the vaccination drive. Amit Singh, associate professor at, Centre for Infectious Disease Research at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, told HT, "I think there are going to be more cases this time around than during the first wave; the increase has also been very sharp as compared to the first wave. We can only hope that the case fatality remains the same.”The active cases in the country have steadily increased for 25 days in a row, and surged to 6,91,597, accounting for 5.54 per cent of the total infections.In a high-level meet chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, it was pointed out that the reasons for the sharper rise in cases could be mainly attributed to the severe decline in compliance of Covid-appropriate behaviour primarily in terms of use of masks and maintaining safe distance, pandemic fatigue and lack of effective implementation of containment measures at the field level, a statement by Prime Minister's Office (PMO) said."Although the exact contribution of mutant strains to the escalation of cases in some states remains speculative, the measures to control the pandemic remain the same and hence implementation of various protocols for Covid-19 management are all the more critical in those areas," the statement added.PM Modi directed central teams to be deployed to Maharashtra and other badly-hit states. The PMO later said that he also ordered a special campaign to be carried out to tell people about Covid-appropriate behaviour with emphasis on 100% mask usage, personal hygiene and sanitation at public places, workplaces and health facilities.The campaign will start from April 6 and go on till April 14, the PMO statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-cases-rose-from-9-000-to-90-000-in-less-than-50-days-101617533782376.html

04-04-2021||India||In Kerala’s flood-hit villages, people wait for compensation as parties make new promises||Shanmuganathan P, a worker of Kerala Bank, still visits the disaster site sometimes after losing his two children in Pettimudy landslide in Munnar last year. Amid a flurry of promises being made by political parties in the poll-bound state, Shanmuganathan has just one wish - getting what the ruling CPIM promised them after the flood.“I got a compensation of ₹5 lakh announced by the government initially. Since my second son’s body was not recovered, I failed to get any relief in his case. Some of the survivors are still running around for legal heir certificates,” Shanmuganathan said, repeating a common complaint of the people in the area of not having received what the ruling CPIM promised after the flood.The body of one of Shanmuganathan’s sons was not recovered. His sons went to a birthday party in Pettimudy when the flood fury washed them. Among 70 people who lost their lives in the disaster, rescue officials could locate only 64 bodies from the slush strewn around six kilometres. A carved hill and mound of dried slush stand testimony to nature’s fury that decimated a settlement of poor tea plantation workers.Since both his sons were visitors to a relative’s house, they were not entitled to the house or the land as announced by the government. Shanmuganathan said more than half of the victims’ families are yet to receive even the initial compensation, a claim not denied by local officials who blame the delay on lack of documents.Another disaster took place in the same month last year when an Air India Express aircraft slipped from the tabletop airport in Kozhikode while landing. The incident claimed 22 lives. Locals say the victims of the airport mishap got ₹20 lakh, while the landslide victims received only ₹5 lakh. When asked about this disparity, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said for landslide victims it was only the first instalment. The families of the landslide victims, however, feel what they received was the first and the last instalment of compensation. Also read: Kerala poll campaigning ends today with no clear winner in sight“We don’t expect to get anything more. Most of the victims claim that they have no title deeds of land where they stayed and others are making umpteen rounds to government offices to get legal heir certificates. All this is taking a lot of time,” he said.For the last three years, Kerala has been witnessing a series of disasters. The worst among them was the flood of the century in 2018 monsoon that claimed over 400 lives. Most of the flood victims are still on the long road to recovery. Amid another election, there is no end to tall promises and many see poll exercise as a hollow ritual.About 150 kilometres downstream of misty getaway from Munnar is Pathanamthitta, where three major rivers - Pambha, Manimala and Achankovil - overflowed in the monsoon of 2018 and took different course submerging many settlements.Many victims are yet to receive any compensation. One of the residents in flood-affected Ranni, Sunil P, said some of the voluntary organisations helped him build his house that was washed away in the flood. But in his neighbourhood, a relatively wealthy family got a fresh house and piece of land due to their alleged political affiliation, he alleged.“In our area, charity organisations chipped in to piece our lives together more than the government machinery. Shameless political parties are even taking credit for this. Politics is the best way to fool people and loot them,” said another resident Narayanan Thampi (62), a retired government official. Thampi said he is yet to decide whether to cast his vote in the upcoming assembly polls.Indignation and despair are quite visible on the ground and many admit they have lost interest in politics. A senior revenue official of the district, who did not wish to be named, admitted the government machinery was slow and many deserving people have been left out.“Even in wild dreams, I never thought my house, situated on a small cliff, will be affected. Gushing waters came to my roof. I spent five days in a relief camp for the first time in my life,” said Alex Thomas (60), a planter in Konni. He said his wife was yet to come out of the trauma.Amid the high octane poll campaigning, the 2018 flood figured prominently in some areas of the state. Former chief minister Oommen Chandy said if the UDF comes to power the government will announce a detailed probe into circumstances that led to the flood.“It was a man-made disaster. Dams were not de-silted properly and allowed to fill eying hydel power. When all dams were submerged, they panicked and opened the dams simultaneously,” said Chandy. Two years ago, Metro Man E Sreedharan had also approached the High Court with a plea stating poor dam management and planning behind the disaster. Sreedharan wanted to fix responsibility on those who erred. The plea is before the court till now. Though natural disasters are not uncommon in Kerala, none of the political parties mentioned them in their manifestos.“All are after free food kits and doles. Some of them even promised they will not implement ecologically sensitive zone plans. Kerala is yet to learn a lesson from natural disasters. Many hilly areas are still sitting ducks,” said Dr VS Vijayan, one of the members of the Madhav Gadgil Committee which prepared a report to save fragile areas of the Western Ghats in 2012.Wayanad, a mountainous district in north Kerala, witnessed a shutdown last month due to protests against the Environment Ministry’s draft notification on ecologically sensitive areas. In 2019, a massive landslide in Puthumala claimed 24 lives.“Nobody is there to speak for nature. Political parties want votes and don’t bother if people live or die. No point in shedding tears when a mishap takes place,” said N Badusha, an environmental activist from Wayanad. He said the Gadgil report has pointed out that unmindful quarrying and deforestation have affected the green district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-kerala-s-flood-hit-villages-people-wait-for-compensation-as-parties-make-new-promises-101617537733090.html
04-04-2021||India||3 reasons behind Covid surge: PM Modi reviews situation, sends teams to 3 states||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday reviewed the present Covid-19 situation of the country and directed that central teams need to visit Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh in view of the ongoing surge in the number of new infections and deaths. The Central teams will comprise health specialists and clinicians, government sources said.A special campaign for Covid-appropriate behaviour with an emphasis on 100 per cent mask usage, personal hygiene and sanitation at public places /workplaces and health facilities will be organised from April 6 to April 14, it has been decided in the meeting.The high-level meeting comes on a day when India reported 93,249 daily infections in the last 24 hours, inching closer to its highest ever spike of 98,000 cases. As several states are again opting for stricter restrictions to contain the spread of the infection, it was emphasised in Sunday's meeting that there have been primarily three reasons behind the surge: severe decline in adhering to Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, pandemic fatigue and lack of containment measures.Covid 2nd wave: Severe than 1st in Maha, 'less serious' in Delhi | What we knowThe 5-fold strategy of testing, tracing, treatment, Covid appropriate behaviour and vaccination, if properly implemented, would be the most effective, it was discussed in the meeting, attended by the principal secretary to PM, cabinet secretary, home secretary, chairperson (Empowered group on Vaccine Administration), health secretary, DG ICMR among others.Here is PM's 10-point guideline to address the Covid-19 situation> People's participation, community involvement is of paramount importance in India's fight against the pandemic.> Testing, tracing, treatment, Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination — only this 5-point formula can curb the spread.> To spread awareness about Covid- appropriate behaviour, a special campaign will be organised from April 6 to April 14.> Healthcare facilities need to be ramped up.> Availability of oxygen, ventilators should be ensured to those who are under home care.> Mortalities have to be avoided under all circumstances.> Central team will visit Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh to look into the situation.> All states need to impose restrictions in places where cases are high.> Community volunteers can be involved in tracing active cases and in the management of containment zones.> States and districts must continue working in mission mode.The situation of Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh is the most precarious, experts in the meeting pointed out. Maharashtra has contributed 57 per cent of total cases in the country in the last 14 days and 47 per cent of deaths in the country during the same period, while the state is seeing its worst daily rise of infections. Punjab's contribution to the total number of cases remains only 4.5 per cent, but its addition of 16.3 per cent to the death toll is worrying, experts discussed. Like Punjab, Chhattisgarh too is contributing more to the daily death toll, the experts noted as a threadbare discussion on where each state and Union territory is standing was held.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-reasons-behind-covid-surge-modi-reviews-situation-sends-teams-to-maharastra-101617536529858.html

04-04-2021||India||Maharashtra Covid-19: Demand for Oxygen cylinders goes up 3-fold in Aurangabad||The requirement of oxygen cylinders for treating Covid-19 patients has gone up by about three times in Maharashtra's Aurangabad district, officials said on Sunday.The district administration has also initiated steps to increase the oxygen storage capacity in hospitals here and has asked contractors to pace up the work, a health department official told PTI.With the number of active Covid-19 cases reaching 15,341 in the district, the demand for oxygen supply has also gone up in hospitals and by patients in home isolation, another official said."The oxygen consumption in the district was 17.10 ton per day on March 14. It has now gone up to 49.50 ton per day," an official from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said.The rates have been capped by the government and oxygen is being supplied at the rate of ₹15.22 per cubic metre, which is the highest now. Earlier, the rate came down to ₹12 when the demand was less, the official said.The demand of oxygen cylinders in households has also gone up as more home isolation is being advised now, the FDA official said.Every patient in home isolation may not need oxygen, but many of them are ordering cylinders as a precautionary measure, he said.Local supplier Abdul Hakim said in January this year, he was supplying about 200 oxygen cylinders to hospitals and households here."Now, the demand has gone up to 750 to 800 oxygen cylinders per month. To meet the rising demand, we need to run our facilities round-the-clock, which has raised our expenses," he said.Hence, the rate for refilling an oxygen cylinder has also gone up by nearly ₹50, he said.An oxygen cylinder of 7.5 cubic metre capacity was earlier refilled for ₹230. The price has now gone up to ₹280, he said.Earlier, the deposit to be paid at the time of buying an oxygen cylinder was ₹7,000, which has now reached ₹10,000, Hakim said.The hike is due to extra labour cost, transportation charges and running of the oxygen supply facilities round-the- clock, he added.An official from the district Civil Hospital said the private and government medical facilities here have a total of 2,124 oxygen beds and 532 ICU beds."Out of 840 beds in government-run health centres in the district, nearly 350 have oxygen facility. The remaining beds will also have the oxygen facility in about 10 days," civil surgeon Dr Sundar Kulkarni said.He said they may require around 78 KL (kilo litre) of oxygen per day at the peak of the viral infection here, for which preparations are underway."We need 32 cylinders of 7.5 cubic metre each in 24 hours at the civil hospital, which is second largest facility to treat COVID-19 patients here (after the Government College and Hospital). In January this year, the requirement was 10 to 15 such cylinders," he said.As of now, there are 106 oxygen beds and 25 ventilator beds in the civil hospital, Kulkarni said.The district administration has demanded 150 ventilators - 100 for the Government Medical College and Hospital and 50 for the civil hospital, another official said.On Saturday, 1,394 new Covid-19 cases were reported in the district, taking the infection count to 86,981, an official said.The district also recorded 21 deaths due to the viral infection on Saturday, raising the toll to 1,758.So far, 69,882 patients have recovered from the infection, the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-covid-19-demand-for-oxygen-cylinders-goes-up-3-fold-in-aurangabad-101617531004818.html

As details of the encounter keep emerging, it appears to be one of the biggest attacks on India's security forces in the last few years. Not much is known about whether the Maoists also suffered losses, or what kind of weapons they used against the security forces. But the possibility of this being a planned attack is not being dismissed yet. One woman Maoist is believed to have been killed.Here is what we know about the encounter:What happened?A gunfight broke out between the security forces and the Naxals on Saturday which went on for three hours and five jawans were martyred. A day after, 17 bodies were found and the toll is likely to go up. Around 30 security personnel have been injured. A woman Maoist leader has been found dead.After the encounter, Naxals looted more than two dozen weapons from security personnel, news agency ANI reported citing CRPF sources.Where did the encounter take place?A stronghold of Maoists, the encounter took place inside a forest near Jonaguda, which falls in Bastar's Bijapur and Sukma district border.How did the encounter start?On Friday night, separate teams of security forces launched a massive anti-Naxal operation in South Bastar forests. According to reports, the security forces were getting tip-offs about Madvi Hidma, a top Naxal leader linked with 2013 Jhiram Ghati killings, in which over 30 people, including senior leaders of Chhattisgarh Congress, were killed.The joint operation was launched from five places — Tarrem, Usoor and Pamed (Bijapur), and Minpa and Narsapuram (in Sukma).The gunfight took between when the patrolling team that was dispatched from Tarrem was inside the forest near Jonaguda. Cadres of the Peoples' Liberation Guerilla Army battalion ambushed the team and there was heavy firing for hours.It is not yet clear whether the tip-offs were traps to draw security forces to the spot or whether the anto-Naxal operation actually stirred one of the layers that protect Hidma. Hidma's security cover starts from almost one kilometre. The top Maoist leader at the time of the encounter might have been in the vicinity, which triggered the heavy firing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-encounter-a-tip-off-3-hour-long-gunfight-what-happened-in-sukma-101617528512522.html

While primary classes up to class 9 will remain closed for two weeks; classes 10 to 12 will be shut down for a week till April 11.“In view of rising trend in Covid-19 cases in Jammu and Kashmir and the likelihood of young children getting infected and transmitting infection in large numbers, all classes up to and including Class 9 in schools will be closed for 2 weeks in all schools beginning on Monday,” office of the lieutenant governor (L-G), Manoj Sinha informed in a tweet.The schools were earlier reopened by March 01, 2021 in a staggered manner, a year after they were first closed owing to Covid pandemic in March 2020.The decision comes after at least, 90 students from various Kashmir schools including 33 students from a government higher secondary school in Budgam district, 36 from a private school in Kulgam district and 14 in a government school in Anantnag district were found infected with coronavirus along with a handful of teachers and staff during random testing drives in schools over the past 4-5 days.At-least 10 schools were ordered to close in the past few days owing to detection of infection among students and staff during random testing drives. Concerned parents were requesting the government to close all the schools to safeguard children’s health.The government said classes 10, 11 & 12 will also be closed for one week in the entire Jammu and Kashmir.“Further, all gatherings for social and customary functions will be restricted to 200 only and after following due Covid SOPs (standard operating procedure),” it said.Earlier this year, the schools were reopened for students of 9th to 12th classes from March 1 and from March 8 for 6th to 8th classes.

He is returning after addressing one out of three rallies he was supposed to address."Shah was scheduled to address three public rallies in Assam today including one each in Sarbhog, Bhabanipur and Jalukbari.At least 22 security personal have lost their lives in Chhattisgarh's Bijapur Naxal attack on Saturday."22 security personnel have lost their lives in the Naxal attack at Sukma-Bijapur in Chhattisgarh," said Bijapur Superintendent of Police, Kamalochan Kashyap.16 out of 31 who sustained injuries in the encounter are from CRPF.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amit-shah-cuts-short-campaign-returns-to-delhi-after-naxal-attack-in-chhattisgarh-s-bijapur-101617526707724.html
04-04-2021||India||Kerala poll campaigning ends today with no clear winner in sight||The month-long campaign for Kerala assembly elections 2021, slated for April 6, draws to a close on Sunday evening with the last few days having witnessed some aggressive campaigning by Gandhi siblings--Rahul Gandhi and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. The Congress will hope that it not only helps contain the factional feud in the party but also paves the way for the United Democratic Front’s (UDF) return to power, aided by “better selection” of candidates, experts said.Some political observers said Kerala’s four-decade-old trend of changing governments after five years may continue; others weren’t so sure.According to several opinion polls, when the campaigning started, the ruling Left Democratic Front (LDF) appeared to be ahead in messaging and visibility, giving an impression that it will return to power, however, some experts said the sentiment was similar to the ‘India Shining campaign’ of the Atal Bihari Vajpayee era in 2004, when the NDA’s poll slogan spectacularly flopped with Congress-led UPA returning to power.“It is a close match. The LDF had managed to build a public perception that continuity will be there. But in the last lap there is a considerable dent in this perception,” said political theorist and author J Reghu.The BJP-led NDA was hopeful of improving its vote share and of BJP winning a couple of seats; however, it was unlikely to change the bi-polar nature of Kerala politics, experts said. They added that a division of votes, affected by the BJP-led NDA, may prove to be decisive in several close fights between the two leading fronts. In the outgoing assembly, the BJP had a single seat-- Nemom in Thiruvananthapuram and its tally may improve to three this time, experts said.Former vice-chancellor of Central University of Kerala and political scientist Dr G Gopakumar said a split in anti-incumbency votes between the NDA and UDF will only favour the LDF. “The BJP is campaigning vigorously and if it attracts more votes, then that will damage the UDF’s prospects,” he said, adding, a rise in saffron vote share will be a threat to the UDF. Reghu, however, begs to differ, saying people of the state are known for their “tactical voting”. According to him, there is pent-up anger in the party against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan’s “autocratic style of functioning” and it will reflect in ballots.It is a fact that almost all pre-poll surveys have predicted an edge to the ruling Left parties. But political observers and party watchers say it won’t be easy for the Left to buck the trend despite its public relations blitz and the euphoria, which will not reflect in ballots.The notion of a Left victory was built on LDF’s victory in December 2020 local body elections even when the state government was knee-deep in scandals such as the gold smuggling case and the drug trade case, in which the then party secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan’s son Bineesh Kodiyeri was arrested for money laundering. Experts say the same narrative may not work in assembly polls.“You can’t measure both, local body and assembly elections, with the same parameters. Other than the loud publicity campaign, I don’t see any tangible reason for the left to come back,” said Reghu.Gopakumar says, “The UDF failed to project a strong leader and (introduction of) many new faces (candidates) at the eleventh hour may affect its prospects.” However, Congress leaders say that the new faces may actually help the UDF“More than half of our candidates are new faces and grassroots workers. I am sure the majority of them will romp home and we are comfortably placed,” said former chief minister Oommen Chandy, star campaigner of the UDF.On the other hand, the LDF sounds confident. “It seems UDF has admitted defeat. That is why even in the dying hours (of campaigning), opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala is raising absurd charges against the government,” said CPI(M) acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan.The BJP has paraded some of its top leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah and used the emotive Sabarimala issue in its favour. The party is also projecting Metro Man E Sreedharan, to curry favours with voters. The 88-year-old is locked in a fierce three-cornered electoral battle on Palakkad assembly seat.“The party will rewrite the poll history of the state,” said BJP state president K Surendran. He added that people were fed up with the same alternating governments.While these three political formations are a major force throughout the state, in Ernakulam district, a corporate party-- Twenty20 is posing a big threat. It is contesting on eight seats in Ernakulam. “The poll picture is quite hazy. There is a silent anti-incumbency factor. I feel the state will stick to its four-decade-old script,” said actor and writer Joy Mathew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-poll-campaigning-ends-today-with-no-clear-winner-in-sight-101617525910839.html

Cabinet meet today, stricter curbs likely||A meeting of the cabinet in Maharashtra will be held later on Sunday amid calls for stricter restrictions across the state, which has seen a massive jump in daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The meeting will come days after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray warned of a lockdown and said if Covid-19 cases continue to rise, the state’s health infrastructure would be affected severely. According to news agency ANI, the Maharashtra cabinet meeting is scheduled to be held at 3pm virtually.There were 49,447 Covid-19 cases and 277 fatalities on Saturday in Maharashtra, according to the state health department, which have taken India’s worst-hit state’s tally to 2,953,523 and the death toll to 55,656. The western state, which has clamped stringent restrictions to battle the surge, recorded more than 40,000 cases for the third consecutive day in a row on Saturday. Mumbai reported 9,090 fresh Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours and 27 deaths in the last 24 hours.Also read | ‘Tough Covid-19 curbs Maha need of the hour’On Friday, Thackeray warned that hospital beds will start falling short in the next 15 days if the current spike in the cases of the coronavirus disease doesn’t stop in the state, which has been driving the second wave of infections in India with record cases. “I am not announcing a lockdown, but definitely warning about it.

04-04-2021||India||Covid 2nd wave: Severe than 1st in Maha, 'less serious' in Delhi | What we know||India has been grappling with a sharp rise in the number of Covid-19 cases since March, which is officially being called the beginning of the second wave of the pandemic. In Maharashtra, however, the wave began early — from February beginning. The ongoing wave is different from the first one on several points and has impacted states differently.Here is what we know about the second wave so far> The first peak in India was around August- September 2020, with the highest daily spike of 96,551 cases being recorded on September 11. After that, the tally of single-day cases started to fall with small curves in November and December. The sharpest fall was recorded in January and February 1st week, after which the graph again took an upward curve and on Sunday 93,249 fresh cases were reported.> The growth rate of Covid-19 cases in March has surpassed the previous record of June 2020, which was 5.5 per cent.> States have been impacted differently, though many states, including Maharashtra and Punjab, reported their highest-ever single-day spike during this second wave of the pandemic.> Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal has said the situation in Delhi now is not as serious as it was in 2020. For Delhi, this is the 4th wave, not 2nd as in the rest of the country, the CM said. "Cases are spreading fast. This is concerning but in October when daily cases were around 3,000-4,000 like it is now, many patients were in ICU. There were many deaths as well. But this wave is less serious than the previous ones. More people are under home isolation," Kejriwal said.> Maharashtra's Covid-19 situation in this wave is more serious than it was during the first wave, Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray has said.> In this phase, the presence of several mutants of the virus has been found in the samples collected from 18 states. But this has not been held responsible for the surge as the mutation is common.> Scientists have projected that this wave might reach its peak between April 15 and 20. After that, cases will come down sharply, which has been mathematically projected.> The 2nd phase has impacted tier 2 and tier 3 cities along with peri-urban areas more than the 1st phase, which has also emerged as an area of concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-2nd-wave-severe-than-1st-in-maharashtra-not-so-much-in-delhi-what-we-know-101617519879887.html
04-04-2021||India||‘BJP stands for everything we do not want Tamil Nadu to become’: Kanimozhi||Thoothukudi MP and DMK’s women’s wing secretary Kanimozhi Karunanidhi has been touring the state for five months as the party’s star campaigner and the tallest woman leader. On her way to campaigning in Tiruchendur for DMK candidate Anitha Radhakrishnan on March 29, Kanimozhi told Divya Chandrababu that though they were rivals, late J Jayalalithaa never gave up Tamil Nadu’s rights but the present AIADMK government was a “puppet” of the BJP. She spoke about BJP’s alleged attempts to disturb communal harmony in Tamil Nadu, sexism in the poll campaign while claiming that the DMK will form a government that is inclusive. Here are some edited excerpts from the interview:Q. You began campaigning in November on the ground, meeting various groups in villages and now you are addressing rallies. What have you gathered?A. I think there is a lot of displeasure against the government. People feel let down. Unemployment is at all time high. In the ten years (of AIADMK government), honestly, no investment has come into the state so there has been no growth in job opportunities. And look at the infrastructure-- this road is a good example. Except for the 8-lane highway (Chennai-Salem expressway), which they want, they are not interested in laying or repairing any roads. They’ve been an anti-farmer government, supporting the farm bills. They’ve also not ensured that crop insurance reaches the farmers. Every time we had floods, cyclones, drought, they’ve not reached out and given the farmers any compensation.Q. Is the displeasure only against the state government or the AIADMK-BJP combine?A. People feel that it is a BJP-run government in Tamil Nadu. BJP is making the decisions and the AIADMK is just implementing what is being dictated. So, that has actually doubled the anger against the government. Have they ever gone against any BJP order? Why would anybody go and support the farm bills or the CAA (Citizenship Amendment Act), in spite of knowing it won’t bring any good and won’t be taken well in Tamil Nadu. At least if they believed in it and supported the bills, maybe we could have accepted it. But, today, when the elections are close, they’re going back to the people and saying that they will emphasise that the Centre withdraws the bills. So that is where we feel there is so much pressure that they can’t take a stand on anything.Agriculture doesn’t even come under the central government list. Karnataka BJP minister J C Madhuswamy has raised the issue that the central government is infringing on the state rights. Our state which has always been insisting on state rights and federalism, is silent. Right from Anna (DMK founder C N Annadurai) to Kalaignar (M Karunanidhi), even Jayalalithaa-- they wouldn’t give up on state rights. We had differences (with Jayalalithaa) but she wouldn’t compromise on state rights. She wouldn’t be happy that this government has no issues compromising on that front. They are mere puppets in the hands of the BJP. Same with the UDAY scheme (centre’ power distribution utilities), she resisted it and wouldn’t accept it. But the present government has meekly signed up for it.Q. Jayalalithaa’s war cry in the previous assembly election was “Modi or Lady”…Yet, now, one of their ministers said Jayalalithaa was their mother and now Modi is their father. Obviously, they call their leader mother and now their next leader, they’re calling their father. Now, we know who their leader is.Q. Chief minister and the alliance leaders have said if DMK comes to power there will be lawlessness.I’m the Thoothukudi MP. The CM killed 13 people here (police firing at anti-Sterlite protesters) and the father and son died in custody (Jayaraj and Bennicks in 2020). He has no right to talk about lawlessness.Q. You’ve said before that women are going to be the deciding factor in this election. Women electorate outnumber men in Tamil Nadu.A. Yes, definitely. And, I think, they’ve become more assertive about their decision making. That’s what I see from meeting women in different parts of the state. Before, it was always believed that women will go along with what the husband or what the family decides. But, now, I can see that there is a very clear minded choice. I think there is more awareness. I am certain that women are looking for leadership which reflects their aspirations and choices, which they will find only in the DMK.Q. Women are a traditional vote bank of the AIADMK. What do you think they want in this election?A. Women want jobs. They want some industry and some kind of job opportunities where they live so they can have a career and income. I see this everywhere I go among the young and middle-aged women. Self-help groups which were doing very well under the DMK government are to be brought back. They want dignity. Sharing of house-hold work is still a distant dream. Making sure there is food on the table, bringing water to home is a woman’s responsibility. They have to wait hours to get a pot of water and going to rations shops is a huge battle. These are issues which hurt them every day. And without women’s safety, there is no empowerment. In every sense, they have been let down by the AIADMK government.Q. Both DMK and AIADMK have promised a payout for women to address unpaid labour at home. Is that a temporary solution until you create jobs for women?A. We have suggested a Universal Basic Income scheme. Covid-19 has hurt the economy in a very big way. You have to put back money in the hands of people to revive the economy, and there can be no better choice than women for this purpose. This will also empower them.Q. How crucial is this assembly election, the first since the demise of your father and Jayalalithaa?A. It’s very important. You know, we have to preserve what Tamil Nadu has stood for. TN has always been a development focussed state. Our human development indices have always been good. We want to ensure that we continue to progress. When you look at investments, we have fallen from the third place to the 14th place. Without job opportunities everything gets hit. In TN, we have been proud of our PDS and social justice. This is the basic fabric of TN and this is what keeps us away from communal disharmony. And the BJP is trying to change it. People will not like it. We have different religions and castes but we live in peace and harmony. There is no hatred. There is acceptance of differences. People from across the country live here. It’s a friendly place. It’s because everyone is focussed on development, education, social justice. See the NEET exam, the New Education Policy is unfair. Cluster schools and huge universities are being talked about for 6000 students. It might work in a developed nation but in our country it’s not easy. In a TN school in Valparai, there is only one student and we have not closed down that school. That’s what TN stands for. If you shut down remote schools, the first to be hit will be girls’ education besides the financially and socially marginalised. You have to understand the country before coming out with a policy. What the NEP is targeting in 2030 we have already achieved in TN-- 50% of our population has gone to higher education.Q. You have been at the forefront of speaking up against Hindi-imposition. Do you think it is a factor in the election?A. Definitely. We are not against any language but when there is no need, don’t impose something on people.Q. BJP has mobilised more than 40,000 booth-level committees, pumping infrastructure projects to gain a foothold in TN. Do you think they’re connecting with people on the ground?A. No, they don’t have booth-level committees here. They are bringing booth-level people to work for their candidates from neighbouring states like Karnataka. Maybe in a few pockets (they have a connect) but overall, I don’t think so. People are angry and upset with the BJP. They stand for everything which we do not want TN to become. The Hindutva ideology and... while majority of TN people are Hindus, religion is personal here. Everyone participates in all festivals. When some leaders say all true Tamils are Hindus, what are they trying to do? We have Jains, Muslims and Christians, who are as Tamil as anybody else.Q. What is your opinion of Narendra Modi?A. As a person he is very warm. He came and met my father when he was not well. But politically we stand for completely different ideologies. They stand for something which we don’t want in Tamil Nadu. We should never bring in hate. There will not be peace for decades if you bring in religious division among people.Q. What are you trying to convey to the people as DMK’s star campaigner?A. I’m saying if you bring in hate and disharmony, it stalls everything else. The future becomes unsafe for your own children. I’m talking about the importance of development, jobs, a better life for people and an inclusive society. I mean inclusive for everybody; for the differently-abled; the transgender; women; all castes; all religions.Q. What do you think of other women candidates like BJP’s Khushboo Sundar who was previously with the DMK and also Premalatha Vijayakanth?A. Both of them are very strong women and I know them personally. I’ve always been saying more women are needed in assemblies and parliament. You can’t make laws, changes without listening to 50% of the population. That’s why we insisted on the Women’s Reservation Bill, which was an election promise of the BJP but I don’t know why they are not bringing it.Q. But the DMK has fielded only 12 women out of 173 candidates..A. Many of the constituencies which we had earmarked for women candidates had to go to the allies. Once you bring the Women’s Reservation Bill nothing can change it.Q. What is your reaction to the sexism on the campaign trail including comments by the DMK leaders (such as A Raja)?A. I had tweeted earlier about it.Q. Even if it happens within the party, you’d take a stand?A. Definitely. And it’s good that he (Stalin) also condemned it. Not many leaders would have done that.Q. Does it hurt that even after so many years you continue to face sexist comments and questions?A. Sometimes, yes. I ignore it as much as possible. It talks more about the mindset of the person than about me. This is what I tell myself. This is what they will keep using against women in public life-- whoever tries to come up. We have to ignore it and keep cleaning the system. It has to be a simultaneous process. We have to start at school-level and teach children not to objectify women. I think it’s an entire mindset, which exists in every corner of the society. Our films, literature reek of sexism.Q. From whom do you draw your political influences?A. My father, Periyar (EV Ramasamy), Anna...I’ve always admired the unflinching fighting spirit of communist party leaders like K Balabharathi, U Vasuki.Q. Since when did you start nursing political ambitions?A. I never wanted to be a politician. When my father wanted me to go to the Rajya Sabha, I resisted a lot, but then, I think all daughters give in to their fathers. He said we need you and once you get in it’s easier to get things you believe in done rather than being outside politics. I think he was right in a way. I felt I was making a big sacrifice. But it has given a lot of meaning. We have been fighting for rights for the differently-abled for years and right in front of my eyes, when they were protesting, he invited them when he was the chief minister and in ten minutes, except for a couple of things, nearly all their requests were met over the table.Q. So who decided that you should fight 2019 Lok Sabha elections?A. That was my decision. I wanted to contest and I discussed it with my brother. Once I’ve decided to stay, better to go into electoral politics.Q. What is your ultimate goal in politics?A. When I think of my constituency there are certain things like agriculture based industry, more jobs, women empowerment, better colleges and upgrading the schools that I want. When the DMK government comes, I would like to help resolve certain issues like women empowerment, safety of children, women and the marginalised. In Parliament, I’d like to speak more and bring the Central government to make a change. I don’t have just one goal, it keeps changing as we go on. Maybe if you ask me what I will do after retirement from politics, maybe I’ll write- that’s my goal. I want to start writing fiction. I still read a lot of fiction.Q. When we asked Stalin what advice his father would have given him at this juncture, he said he would have asked him to throw away the communal forces and restore TN’s self-respect. What do you think?A. This is exactly what DMK stands for-- federalism, self-respect, social justice and a society where everyone is equal. He would have asked us to ensure that.Q. What kind of a leader do you think Stalin would make?A. He’s been a very good administrator and a very hard-working politician. He’s one of those MLAs who is in his constituency and takes care of its people. So, I think he will put in the same hardwork and dedication when he is chief minister.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-stands-for-everything-we-do-not-want-tamil-nadu-to-become-kanimozhi-101617520210666.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi will attend the India-EU summit at Lisbon before he flies to France for a high-profile bilateral visit, people familiar with the matter said.Technical negotiations on the trade agreement, which is also being pursued by external affairs minister S Jaishankar at a diplomatic level, will begin between April 9 and 19. There is a possibility of a meeting between commerce minister Piyush Goyal and EU executive vice president and commissioner for trade Valdis Dombrovskis later this month-end. The date for the Goyal-Dombrovskis meeting is still to be decided, EU diplomats said.Despite India being one of the largest trade partners of the EU, the trade negotiations, which began in 2007, have been sluggish in the past with differences over tariff levels of wines and spirits, auto components, small cars and data security. “However, both sides have shown more accommodation this time and are willing to have a positive view towards exports from both blocks,” said a senior official.Also read | India calls big economies’ pressure tactics to gain market access unfairThe EU will be under pressure to complete the trade deal with India since India is expected to sign a bilateral trade agreement with post-Brexit Britain during UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to New Delhi on April 26.PM Modi, who will travel to Portugal for the India-EU Summit being held under the shadow of the coronavirus pandemic, will continue on the second leg of his tour to France for a bilateral visit.

04-04-2021||India||National Policy for Rare Diseases approved by health minister: 7 points||Union health and family welfare minister Harsh Vardhan has approved the National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021, according to a statement issued by the health ministry on Saturday. The policy aims to bring down the high cost of treatment for rare diseases and was brought about after "multiple consultations with different stakeholders and experts in the area," the statement said.Around 40 per cent of the population covered under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana will benefit from the policy and financial assistance will not be limited to just the BPL families, it added.Here are 7 points you need to know about the National Policy for Rare Diseases:1. Along with lowering the cost of treatment of rare diseases, the policy aims to increase focus on indigenous research and local production of medicines.2. Those who are suffering from rare diseases (diseases listed under Group 1 in the rare disease policy) that require one-time treatment will have the financial support of up to Rs20 lakh under the umbrella scheme of Rashtriya Arogya Nidhi. It will cover about 40 per cent of the population who are eligible under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana.3. The policy will make use of a crowdfunding mechanism to cover the cost of treatment of rare diseases. As part of it, corporates and individuals will be encouraged to extend financial support through a robust IT platform.4. A national hospital-based registry of rare diseases will be created to ensure adequate data and comprehensive definitions of such diseases are available for those interested in research and development. 5. Through the help of Health and Wellness Centres, District Early Intervention Centres and counselling, the policy aims to screen and detect rare diseases early at early stages, which will in turn help in their prevention.6. A draft of the policy was put in the public domain on January 13, 2020, and comments from stakeholders, the general public, organisations, states and Union territories were invited on the same. "All the comments received were examined in depth by an expert committee constituted by the health ministry," the statement issued by the ministry read.7. The Supreme Court and various high courts expressed concern about the lack of a national policy for rare diseases, the statement said. Rare diseases are difficult to research upon and availability and accessibility to medicines are important in the process of treatment. The policy aims to help the nation overcome these fundamental challenges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-policy-for-rare-diseases-approved-by-health-minister-7-points-101617512536250.html
04-04-2021||India||Puducherry elections: Congress banks on sympathy as BJP looks to gain hold||Puducherry will vote to elect a new government on April 6 following the collapse of the previous Congress-led administration on February 22 due to a spate of resignations. It is being seen as a battle between the wounded Congress party and the opposition led by a resurgent former chief minister N Rangasamy who is in alliance with the BJP, the party accused of engineering the previous government’s collapse by ‘purchasing’ and ‘threatening’ Congress MLAs.The only Congress government in the South fell following seven dramatic resignations in a span of two weeks with two of those legislators joining the BJP. The Congress hopes the sympathy factor would return it to power in the Union Territory.Puducherry has 30 assembly seats plus three nominated seats with an electorate of 10.03 lakh. Congress is contesting in 14 constituencies- seven fewer than the 2016 assembly polls. The remaining seats have been allotted to allies DMK (13) and the VCK (1) and CPI (1). V Narayanasamy, who was forced to resign after his government lost the floor test in March, has not been fielded. This has led to opposition claiming that the Congress was on the backfoot and in disarray. The opposition members and those who quit the Congress had blamed Narayanasamy for their exit. The Rangasamy-led All India NR Congress (AINRC), which is leading the opposition coalition, is contesting on 16 seats and has allotted nine seats to the BJP. The national party has no presence in the tiny UT apart from the three nominated MLAs—who tilted the balance against the Congress in the assembly. The BJP is determined to make inroads here and national leaders including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and party president J P Nadda have consistently campaigned here for the party’s growth. The AIADMK, which is in the opposition alliance, will contest on five seats. But the opposition is divided over its chief ministerial candidate. While Rangasamy has declared himself as the chief ministerial candidate, the BJP has not endorsed it. “AINRC has announced their chief ministerial candidate but NDA will decide the candidate for chief minister only after the elections are over,” said BJP Puducherry election in-charge Nirmal Surana. “We will sweep the elections. That’s what all surveys are predicting and it’s what people want.”The dispute over the CM candidate here is similar to the back and forth seen in Tamil Nadu, where the BJP faced flak from the AIADMK for taking over three months to endorse chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami as the CM face of the alliance in January 2021, reversing its stand that it would decide on the matter after the elections.In Puducherry, the BJP will have to assuage Rangasamy, a veteran politician, while managing ambitions of the Congress rebels. Rangasamy was once with the Congress, before quitting in 2011 to float AINRC and become the CM after winning the assembly elections held that year. In a major issue in the polls, Madras high court has ordered a probe into allegations that BJP’s Puducherry unit accessed and used Aadhar-linked mobile numbers for targeted election campaigning. Congress has also urged the Election Commission of India (ECI) to disqualify BJP candidates for alleged violation of the model code of conduct. “People of Puducherry are against the BJP and will support us,” says RKR Anantharaman, former government whip and incumbent candidate from Manavel constituency. “Puducherry is secular and the Hindutva ideology won’t work here,” he said.While the Congress accuses the BJP-led Centre of interfering in Puducherry government’s functioning, stalling welfare schemes using Kiran Bedi as the UT’s lieutenant governor (L-G). The BJP in turn alleges that the Narayanasamy-led government misappropriated funds. “He only served the Congress high-command in Delhi and not the people of Puducherry,” said Modi at a public meeting in the UT two days after the government was dissolved.Ahead of the floor-test, in a move that came as a surprise, Bedi was shunted out and Telangana governor Tamilisai Soundararajan was given additional responsibility of Puducherry. Soundararajan, formerly BJP chief of Tamil Nadu, is seen as an amiable person as opposed to Bedi. The UT is currently under the President’s rule until the next government is elected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/puducherry-elections-congress-banks-on-sympathy-as-bjp-looks-to-gain-hold-101617513130359.html

04-04-2021||India||Murshidabad TMC rebels pose challenge to party, BJP sniffs opportunity||In Bengal’s Murshidabad district, rebel Trinamool Congress (TMC) leaders are posing a challenge to the ruling party as independent candidates on three assembly seats. While the TMC remains unperturbed, the BJP feels the infighting may help the saffron camp in the Muslim-majority district, where the party has struggled in the past.At Suti, Raghunathganj and Jalangi, members of the TMC-run Murshidabad zilla parishad are contesting against their own after they were denied tickets. Polls in the district will be held on April 26 and 29, in the last two of the eight phases. Muslims comprise 66.28% of Murshidabad’s population, the highest in any district in the state. In 2019, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) set a record by winning 18 of the state’s 42 Lok Sabha seats, the saffron camp could not make much progress in Murshidabad, which accounts for 22 of Bengal’s 294 assembly seats. Political observers feel that a division in Muslim votes may not bring good news for Mamata Banerjee. Murshidabad has traditionally been known as a bastion of the Congress with the Left parties having control over a few pockets. Bengal state Congress president Adhir Chowdhury is the Lok Sabha member from the district’s Berhampore seat. The TMC, however, has benefitted from the defection of Left and Congress MLAs since the last state polls held in 2016. Many rebel TMC leaders in this district are known to be close to former minister Suvendu Adhikari, who joined the BJP in December last year and contested against the chief minister at Nandigram in East Midnapore district, his home turf, on April 1. Adhikari was the TMC’s poll observer for several districts, including Murshidabad, till he was stripped of that position in 2020. Bengal’s Muslim population stood at 27.01% during the 2011 census and is projected to have increased to around 30% now. According to surveys done by the TMC and the BJP, a swing in Muslim votes can influence poll results in as many as 120 assembly seats. At Murshidabad’s Suti assembly seat, which the Congress won in 2016, the TMC has fielded Emani Biswas, the former Congress lawmaker who defected to the ruling party. He won the seat in 2011. The National Investigation Agency (NIA) recently quizzed Biswas for suspected involvement in the Nimtita bomb blast in which minister of state for labour Jakir Hossain and more than 20 people were injured on February 17. Biswas was fielded amid resistance from a number of district TMC leaders. Opposing his candidature, Maidul Islam, the TMC leader in charge of the food and supplies department at Murshidabad zilla parishad, has resigned from the party to contest as an independent candidate. “There are several complaints of corruption against Biswas. Also, he has never voiced his concern for the plight of bidi factory workers in Suti because he owns a production unit. I am contesting because these poor people approached me,” said Islam. Biswas did not want to comment on the allegations levelled by Islam. At Raghunathganj, Nasir Sheikh, another zilla parishad member, is contesting against the TMC’s official candidate. The seat was formed during delimitation before the 2011 polls and the Congress won it. “The TMC candidate, Md Akhruzzaman, failed to discharge his duties as the local MLA after defecting from the Congress. A huge number of people want to see him go. Hence, I decided to challenge him,” said Sheikh. Sheikh joined the Congress a few days ago with the hope of getting a ticket. TMC zilla parishad member Sayed Rafika Sultana is contesting as an independent nominee from the Jalangi seat that the CPI(M) won nine times in a row from 1977 to 2016. The TMC has fielded outgoing MLA Abdur Razzak Mandal, who, too, is a turncoat. A number of local TMC leaders are unhappy with Mandal and Sultana has already started her campaign. TMC leaders said the party’s former district president, Sagir Hossain, is also likely to contest as an independent candidate from the Bhagabangola seat from where the TMC has fielded Idris Ali. Hossain did not campaign for the official candidate till Saturday. The TMC’s district spokesperson Goutam Ghosh said, “People cast their votes by seeing the symbol of our party. We are not bothered about these independent candidates.” The BJP’s Murshidabad north zone organizational unit president Sujit Das said, “Infighting in the TMC is getting exposed before the elections. People have decided to usher in a change. The division of votes may help us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/murshidabad-tmc-rebels-pose-challenge-to-party-bjp-sniffs-opportunity-101617506589999.html

04-04-2021||India||Rural jobs scheme generated record 3.9 billion days of work||As millions of migrant workers returned home last year after factories and businesses downed shutters during the country’s 68-day long hard lockdown, India’s federal job guarantee programme (MGNREGS) generated a bumper 3.877 billion days of work in FY2020-21, benefitting 112 million people — its best performance since inception.Nearly all big states significantly scaled up their MGNREGS operations, with Rajasthan emerging as the top state in terms of work, generating 454 million days of work (in person days) followed by West Bengal (414 million). India’s most populous state Uttar Pradesh generated 394 million days of work, Madhya Pradesh, 341 million, and Tamil Nadu, 333 million, according to official data from the Union rural development ministry.Also Read | The role of MGNREGS in the climate crisisBihar, the state estimated to have received highest number of returning migrant workers last year, could only generate 227 million days of work in the federal job programme that served as a vital source of income for 75 million poor households as Covid-19 raged through the country, infecting millions, killing tens of thousands, and roiling the economy. The government estimates the Indian economy to contract by 8% in 2021-22. In these straitened circumstances, the rural job guarantee scheme was the lifeline for tens of millions of households.A senior official of the Union rural development ministry said on condition of anonymity that even Bihar has improved its performance from FY19-20 during which it could only generate 140 million days of work. “A state like Rajasthan has a lot of area available for MGNREGS work but Bihar has mostly agricultural land. It also suffered floods.”“But there’s no denying that states such as Andhra Pradesh or Tamil Nadu have an efficient administration and a strong presence of civil society; Bihar lags in these areas,” added the official.West Bengal provided works to the highest number of individuals (12 million), followed by Tamil Nadu, 11.6 million. In Rajasthan, 11 million people have worked in MGNREGS last year, while 7.9 million people got MGNREGS work in Bihar.The government last year poured more than ₹one lakh crore into the MGNREGS and introduced Prime Minister’s Garib Kalyan Rozgar Abhiyan, targetting migrant workers, in 116 districts across Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Jharkhand and Odisha. Each selected district received at least 25,000 returnee migrant workers. This special job campaign frontloaded existing programmes to create a basket of work worth ₹50,000 crore, targetting both skilled and unskilled migrant workers.The scheme eventually received an additional allocation of ₹10,000 crore, which was used primarily for MGNREGS-related work such as construction of rural houses or water conservation and harvesting. Under MGNREGS, a beneficiary can avail up to 100 days of construction-related work in the government’s rural housing programme.The Centre has continued to pump in more money into rural India and this year’s annual budget saw a 10% hike in funds for rural development ministry compared to last year’s budgeted estimate. But the allocation fell short by ₹66,000 crore than the revised estimate for 2020-21, which was sharply increased to address the impact of Covid.The budget allocation for the rural development ministry has been hiked to ₹1.32 lakh crores for FY21-22 from ₹1.20 lakh crore in FY20-21. The revised estimates for FY20-21 went up to ₹1.97 lakh crore as the government rolled out two stimulus packages to provide jobs and social security during an unprecedented health emergency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rural-jobs-scheme-generated-record-3-9-billion-days-of-work-101617497484686.html

The girl, who was from a village under the Sardhana Kotwali area in Meerut, consumed poison after returning home on Thursday, the police said, adding that she later died in a hospital.On Saturday, the accused sustained a bullet injury in his leg and was hospitalised.Superintendent of police (rural) Keshav Mishra said that Lakhan, 18, and his aide Vikas were arrested for the alleged gang rape. A suicide note recovered from the girl’s room held Lakhan and three others responsible for her death. Two other accused are still at large.Mishra said that a team of the district surveillance department and Sardhana police was taking the accused to a court in Meerut on Saturday when Lakhan snatched the pistol of a policeman and ran towards a sugarcane field. A hunt was launched, following which he opened fire at the police, the officer said. He was injured in retaliatory firing and was arrested, he added.Lakhan is a Class 12 student and both he and the girl took tuitions at the same institute, according to the police. Lakhan and three others allegedly dragged the girl to a secluded place on Thursday when she was returning home from the tuition centre and gang-raped her, they said. A case under sections 376D, 302 and 328 of the Indian Penal Code and Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act was registered against the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/man-arrested-for-raping-up-teen-shot-at-while-trying-to-flee-police-101617489591631.html
04-04-2021||India||India Covid-19 curve beats US, set to surpass Brazil||India on Friday added the most cases of Covid-19 than any other country, surpassed, on average, the number of new infections in United States, and was set to overtake Brazil over the weekend to become the country with the worst outbreak in the world amid a raging second national wave that led to 92,961 new infections on Saturday — the highest since September 17.In the seven days till Friday, India recorded 68,969 new cases a day on average. On the same day, the US recorded 65,753 while Brazil recorded 72,151 new cases a day over a week’s period. In Brazil, the outbreak appears to be receding with the number dropping roughly 0.92% on average over the week. In US, cases are growing afresh but the expansion — 0.87% — is significantly slower than India’s rate of 4.24%.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageOn Friday, India added 89,030 cases and an immediate daily comparison of Saturday’s numbers with that of US and Brazil was not possible due to the time difference. At the current pace, India could well surpass the record set by the first peak shortly, even breach the 100,000 daily cases mark.This is not the first time India records the most number of cases for any country in the world – at the peak of its first wave, it recorded 99,181 cases on September 10. But this would eventually be eclipsed by the US, which recorded 308,941 cases at its worst on January 8. The highest Brazil has recorded is in the current wave, with a peak at 97,586 on March 25.All India data is from the HT tracker. The US and Brazil data are from worldometers.info.Experts say the trend reinforces the need for India to restrict activities and speed up the vaccination drive. The problem is particularly stark since the number of doses administered in India covers only 4.57% of the population, compared to Brazil’s 7.57% and the US’s 30.44%.“I think there are going to be more cases this time around than during the first wave; the increase has also been very sharp as compared to the first wave. We can only hope that the case fatality remains the same,” said Amit Singh, associate professor, Centre for Infectious Disease Research at the Indian Institute of Science , Bangalore.“We are already in the middle of the second wave and we are not going to escape it. Having said that, partial lockdowns and aggressive enforcement of Covid-appropriate behaviours in public such as masking, social distancing, curbs on gatherings can help slow things down. What we really need to do is vaccinate everyone, and quickly,” he said, adding that the government must open the vaccination drive for all.The current surge of infections prompted the government to on Friday meet with health officials from states , particularly to highlight the situation in 11 “states of grave concern” that contributed 90% of Covid-19 cases and 90.5% of deaths in the previous 14 days.At over 7% on Saturday, the country’s overall test positivity rate – the proportion of samples that turn up positive – has also risen drastically, indicating that efforts to stay ahead of the virus could require more testing in order to minimise the number of positive cases being missed.This necessity is also evident if absolute testing numbers are compared: the 1.02 million tests carried out across India on April 2 was slightly lower than the 1.05 million done on September 10, the day India recorded the peak of the first wave.Government officials have identified the situation in Maharashtra (which accounted for 53.2% of the cases on Saturday), along with Punjab and Chhattisgarh, as particularly worrying. Following a meeting of the cabinet secretariat with the chief secretaries of all states on Friday.At 9,108 cases, Maharashtra’s capital Mumbai on Saturday breached the 9,000 threshold, the first for any city in India.In the national capital, 3,567 new cases were recorded on Saturday — slightly lower than the 3,594 recorded on Friday — but the latest numbers corresponded to fewer tests. The positivity rate rose from 4.1% to 4.5%.The government said more small towns are being hit in the current wave, which could spread infections among people who may not as readily have access to health infrastructure as people in larger cities do. “Another worrisome aspect pointed out was that Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities along with peri-urban areas have recorded the recent high rises in Covid cases; the spread of infection from these areas to the rural areas with weak health infrastructure would overwhelm the local administration was also highlighted,” the government said on Friday, referring to the meeting with the states.Experts have urged the government to consider accelerating the vaccine process, and open it up to all. “Now, there are several other vaccines with proven safety and efficacy across the world that should be brought in. For example, the Pfizer vaccine has now been shown to be safe and effective for children. Data for Covaxin or Covishield is not available in these age groups. Rather than waiting for it, the government should bring in what is already established,” said Singh.On Friday, India administered 3.6 million doses of coronavirus vaccines – the most it has done so far. But experts fear the pace is inadequate, particularly since the country has a large urban population and many of its cities have high population density, factors that aid the rapid transmission of Covid-19.(With inputs from Anonna Dutt)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-covid-curve-beats-us-set-to-surpass-brazil-101617480579093.html
04-04-2021||India||Uttarakhand witnessing unprecedented forest fires||Uttarakhand is witnessing unprecedented forest fires, that too in April when temperatures are yet to touch the maximum range, forest officials said. Higher temperatures generally trigger such fires.This time around, forest fires started in the winter months in many districts. Most hill districts like Nainital, Almora, Tehri and Pauri have come under the grip of raging forest fires.Compared to 172 hectares last year, over 1290 hectares of forest land got affected by forest fires this year. The state has reported over 39 new forest fire incidents in the last 48 hours, taking the number of such incidents this year to 983. Also, four human deaths and seven animal fatalities have been reported so far due to these forest fires.Forest fire activity is generally reported in Uttarakhand from February to June, with a peak in fire incidents in May and June.According to forest officials, apart from less rain in the winter months, due to the fear of epidemic and the lockdown, movement in the forests was restricted. Due to this, a lot of combustible material, mostly pine needles, got accumulated on the forest floor. These materials are cleared every year during control burning but it was affected over the past year, which is one of the reasons for the spike in forest fires.Most cases of forest fire incidents in Uttarakhand are man-made and the reduced number of cases is likely due to restricted movement of people in and near forest areas.Since the formation of the state in 2000, over 44,554 hectares of the forest area has been damaged in forest fires, according to an RTI reply by the Uttarakhand government.Forest fires affected 172 hectares of jungles last year. The forest area affected due to forest fires in 2019 was 2,981 hectares. The corresponding figure was 4,480 hectares in 2018, 1,228 hectares in 2017, 4,433 hectares in 2016 and 701 hectares in 2015.Uttarakhand forest department has over 174 watchtowers and 1,437 station crews across the state to keep a tab on forest fires and take measures to check them.With the number of forest fire incidents rising, experts and Opposition parties have accused the government of "not focusing" to tackle the situation which is "turning catastrophic."Prominent social activist Anoop Nautiyal, who has been keeping an eye on forest fire incidents, said, "The forest fire situation is turning catastrophic in the state, destroying our forests.""The senior IFS officers of the state should come together and clear the actual picture of the situation and come up with effective solutions to tackle it," said Nautiyal who also questioned the use of a helicopter for showering flowers in Mahakumbh but not in fighting forest fires.State Congress president Pritam Singh also questioned the government's "inaction" against forest fires and said, "State's precious forests are burning down in these forest fires but the government is not looking at it. The state forest minister is nowhere to be seen in the picture when he should come forward to save our forest from this disaster which is now affecting people and their properties."State forest department officials, however, said that the number of forest fire incidents are increasing this year due to "change in climatic conditions."Maan Singh, chief conservationist of forest (fire and disaster management) said, "Forest fires have increased in the last one week because of strong winds and no rainfall. It is also due to the rise in temperature with less rainfall and snowfall during the winters."Informing that the department is fully alert and prepared to fight the forest fire situation, Singh said, "We have sent a proposal to the Centre demanding two choppers, one each for Garhwal and Kumaon regions to fight forest fires. Once it is cleared, we will then use them in tackling such incidents."He informed that about 3,000 forest department staffers and 6,000 forest fire watchers are involved at present to manage the situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uttarakhand-witnessing-unprecedented-forest-fires-101617475740357.html
04-04-2021||India||4 arrested for stabbing Muslim man travelling with Hindu woman||Mangaluru police on Saturday arrested four people, believed to be right-wing activists, who allegedly stabbed a 23-year-old Muslim man for travelling with a Hindu woman in a bus in coastal Karnataka’s Dakshina Kannada district earlier this week.The suspects have been identified as Balachandra (28), Dhanush Bhandary (25), Jayaprashanth (27) and Anil Kumar (38). Dhanush is already facing four cases of murder, said police.A senior police official familiar with the case said that the four men were associated with a right-wing organisation. The official, who did not want to be identified, refused to give more details.Mangaluru police commissioner Shashi Kumar said that four teams were formed to nab the accused soon after the incident on Thursday.“We are investigating who instigated them to assault the duo. We are questioning the arrested men at present,” the commissioner said, adding that there may have been at least four similar attacks in the region in the past four months. He did not give details about the attacks.It is not clear if there is any link between Thursday’s attack or the previous incidents.The man -- identified as Anwar Mohammed -- and the 23-year-old woman, who knew each other from school, were travelling in an overnight bus from Mangaluru to Bengaluru when the group of men stopped the bus and attacked the two.While the man has been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) of a private hospital in Mangaluru, the woman, whose identity was not released by the police, also suffered minor injuries. An FIR has been registered for attempt to murder (IPC section 307) among other sections at the Kankanady police station in Mangaluru.After the attack on Thursday, a WhatsApp message doing the rounds claimed Bajrang Dal activists stopped the duo from travelling. “Ongoing Operation by Bajrang Dal Today (Thursday). A Hindu young woman who was fleeing with a Muslim man was travelling from Mangaluru to Bengaluru. Bajrang Dal activists stopped the couple near Pumpwell,” read a message.Separately, Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s (VHP) leader Sharan Pumpwell also claimed on Friday the group’s men intercepted the couple as it was a case of “love jihad”, but that a mob gathered and turned violent.Police said they are investigating both claims.The incident comes in the wake of several Bharatiya Janata Party-led states in the country, such as Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, introducing laws regulating inter-faith marriages that are termed by right-wing activists as “love jihad”.In recent weeks, senior BJP leaders have also promised to bring out similar legislations in other regions, including in poll-bound Kerala and Assam, where assembly elections are ongoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-arrested-for-stabbing-muslim-man-travelling-with-hindu-woman-101617475508185.html

The body of a suspected Maoist has also been recovered from the encounter spot, an official added. According to the Director General of Police (Chhattisgarh), DM Awasthi, the encounter broke out when a joint team of the state police and the Central Reserve Police Force’s Commando Battalion for Resolute Action (CoBRA) were out on an anti-Maoist operation in the jungles of Tarrem along Sukma and Bijapur border.“As per the information received so far, five security personnel have been killed and twelve others injured. Among those who lost their lives in the gunfight are a jawan of CoBRA and two from the district reserve guard (DRG) and ‘Bastariya’ battalion of CRPF,” said Awasthi.“The encounter lasted for about three hours inside the jungle. The injured were airlifted to Raipur and an operation is underway to airlift the injured jawans and bodies,” he added.The attack comes days after five jawans of the District Reserve Guard (DRG) were killed and 14 injured after Maoists targeted a bus ferrying 27 security personnel in Narayanpur district of Bastar region.On March 21 last year, 17 security personnel, including 12 from the DRG, were killed in a Maoist ambush in Sukma district of the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-personnel-killed-in-gunbattle-with-maoists-in-cgarh-101617475448825.html
04-04-2021||India||Vaccination drive sign-ups for health, frontline staff halted||The health ministry on Saturday halted new registrations for healthcare and front line workers to receive coronavirus vaccines, citing a barrage of sign-ups of ineligible people under these categories in recent days in centres across the country.No new sign-ups will now be accepted for people in these two categories – who did not have an age bar – but healthcare and front line workers who have already registered can take doses.“Various inputs have been received from different sources that in some of the CVCs (Covid Vaccination Centres) some ineligible beneficiaries are being registered as healthcare workers and frontline workers and are getting vaccinated in complete violation of the prescribed guidelines,” said a letter by Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan to states informing of the change in the registrations process.Bhushan said there was an increase of 24% in the database of the healthcare workers in the “past few days” itself. The decision was taken after discussion at a meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for COVID-19 (NEGVAC) on Saturday.The announcement came within hours of the Uttarakhand chief minister saying journalists of all ages in the state will be eligible for vaccines as front line workers. “During the ongoing pandemic, the journalists in the state worked like front line workers in providing the required information to the people about Covid-19 which helped the government significantly,” said Tirath Singh Rawat.A similar decision was announced by the administration in Ludhiana, which classified judges, teachers as well as journalists as front line workers.Experts and doctors have previously said sign-ups under these categories may not be fool-proof since it there is no verification mechanism to determine the profession of those registering.The vaccination drive, which started on January 16, was meant to first immunise 300 million people who belong to three categories: healthcare workers, front line workers, and those at greater risk from Covid-19 due to their age or existing medical conditions.The first to receive the shots were 10 million healthcare workers and the drive was opened up to 20 million front line workers February 1 onwards. On March 1, the government allowed people above the age of 60 and those between the ages of 45 and 59 years with a combination of 20 specified comorbidities to take the shots.On April 1, the government relaxed it further to allow anyone above the age of 45 to take the dose, but experts have repeatedly said the drive must be opened to anyone who seeks a vaccine in order to get ahead of the raging second wave of infections.“We should quickly vaccinate as many people over the age of 18 years as we can. There is still a large proportion of susceptible population that is leading to the second wave of the infection. So far, we have immunised around 7 crore (70 million) people, which translates to about 5 to 6% of the population. With a 71% efficacy in preventing infections for AstraZeneca vaccine, we have only about 4% of the population protected. And, majority are yet to receive the second dose of the vaccine,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the pulmonology department at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi (AIIMS).The vaccination drive for healthcare workers was first planned to end on February 25 and for front line workers on March 6. The registrations were closed briefly were later re-opened once the vaccination of the old and the co-morbid began in March to ensure that any healthcare and frontline workers who had been left out were vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-drive-sign-ups-for-health-frontline-staff-halted-101617475448219.html

The CM, at a high level meeting on efforts to tackle Covid-19 cases, asked the officials to ensure that testing for the virus through RT-PCR is ramped up and the number of vaccinations is increased. “Covid-19 infections will be detected more if the tests are done with high intensity,” the CM said, adding more awareness among people should be created so that precautionary and safety steps are taken to avoid contacting the virus. Bihar has witnessed a spike in Covid-19 cases in the last 10 days with Patna registering 287 new cases as on Friday. At the review meeting, principal secretary, health Pratyaya Amrit gave a presentation by elaborating on the number of Covid-19 cases across the state and data regarding the recovery rate, death rate, day to day trends and testing. The CM instructed that facilities at the Covid-19 dedicated hospitals should be proper and also increase the volume of vaccinations so that more and more people could be inoculated. Incidentally, the CM’s suggestion to the crisis management group to weigh the option of keeping schools closed in the wake of rising cases of Covid-19 cases in the state and across the country may see some strict guidelines being issued for educational institutions by the government in the next few days. There are chances that schools which were planning to start their new academic session from next week by reopening for junior classes may have to alter their schedule, in case the government issues new orders to keep schools closed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-cm-nitish-kumar-asks-crisis-management-group-to-mull-keeping-schools-closed-101617475209488.html
04-04-2021||India||PM mounts attack on rivals in battlegrounds Assam, Bengal||Kolkata/GuwahatiPrime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday held his last election rallies in Assam and West Bengal before the third phase of voting in the assembly elections, launching a fresh political attack on rivals in the two eastern states.Modi alleged that the “obstructionist mindset” of chief minister Mamata Banerjee and her Trinamool Congress deprived East Bengal of industries and jobs. He also criticised her for branding Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders as “outsiders” and said it was an insult to the inclusive ideology of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose.In Assam, the PM said the people of the state had decided to form a BJP government.While the BJP has posed a challenge to the Trinamool Congress in West Bengal, it is seeking to retain power in Assam.The campaign for Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Puducherry and the third and final phase in Assam and the third phase in West Bengal will end at 5pm on Sunday. The voting will take place on April 6 and votes in all five states would be counted on May 2.On Saturday, Modi reacted to a tweet that said the PM may be challenged in Varanasi in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, saying with this, TMC chief Mamata Banerjee has accepted defeat in Bengal and is looking for a place outside Bengal to contest. “Didi’s party (TMC) is now saying that she would contest the Lok Sabha polls (in 2024) from Varanasi. After this statement came out, two things have become clear. One, she has accepted defeat in Bengal. Second, she is trying to find a place for herself outside Bengal,” Modi said while addressing a rally in South 24 Parganas.On Modi’s statement, senior TMC leader and state minister Subrata Chatterjee said: “There cannot be any comment on such nonsensical topics.”The Prime Minister also countered Banerjee’s “outsider” and “tourist” remarks against the BJP’s central leaders coming to Bengal for campaigning. “The people of Varanasi and Uttar Pradesh are big hearted, and they would never call you outsider or tourist. You get irritated with Jai Shri Ram but there, every two minutes you will hear Har Har Mahadev. You will get people with tilaks and choti. What would you do then? On whom would you vent your anger?”After allegations of electronic voting machine rigging surfaced in Nandigram, which went to the polls on April 1, the TMC lodged a complaint with the Election Commission against central forces and also raised the issue of EVM malfunction.Modi said: “You didn’t get a chance to rig the polls and that’s why you are abusing the ECI and questioning the central forces? Ten years ago you had so much faith on these security forces.”In Assam, Modi urged voters to bring back the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) government in the state to power again in order to continue the momentum of growth.“To continue this momentum of growth and development, it is very important to bring back NDA government to power. We believe in ‘sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas’ (with all, development for all, with trust of all). We don’t discriminate in our schemes and everyone is equally benefitted,” he said at a rally in Tamulpur while ending his campaign in the state poll.The PM took a swipe at the Congress-led alliance and said that they were conspiring to take over Assam. “The election is still on. But yesterday some people made an announcement saying what kind of dress those in the next government would wear. There can be no greater dishonor for Assam and its culture. It is shocking that they are conspiring to take over Assam. You have to come out in large numbers and vote to foil their designs,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-mounts-attack-on-rivals-in-battlegrounds-assam-bengal-101617475088145.html

04-04-2021||India||Woman given two Covid-19 shots in one sitting, probe ordered||Mere minutes apart, a 48-year-old woman was administered two doses of the coronavirus vaccine at a health care centre in Uttar Pradesh’s Kanpur Dehat district while the auxiliary nurse midwife (ANM) was speaking over the phone and allegedly forgot she had already given one shot, according to the recipient’s complaint to district officials.Kamlesh Devi received the Covishield vaccine; of which the second dose is supposed to be given 4-8 weeks after the first is administered. India has so far approved two vaccines: Covaxin and Covishield, both two-dose shots.District magistrate JP Singh has formed a three-member team of doctors to probe the incident that took place at the Madauli primary health centre (PHC) in the district’s Akbarpur area on Friday.The condition of the woman is stable. Her right arm is swollen (a normal symptom after vaccination), and she is currently under observation by doctors at her residence in Madauli village, said her husband Vipin Kumar.“The standard dose for the AstraZeneca vaccine (Covishield is the Indian version of the same) is 5x10^10 viral particles per dose. There are no reported cases of overdose of this vaccine, but the packet insert says that there is no specific treatment for it. The person will just have to be monitored and given symptomatic treatment as appropriate. From what I understand, the person would still need a booster dose four to eight weeks later to generate an optimal immune response,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.He added, “There have been instances of overdose documented with the Pfizer vaccine. There were some people in Brisbane, Australia, who received four times the recommended dose and eight health care workers in Germany who were administered five times the dose by error. Four of the eight persons in Germany were admitted to a hospital; they had flu-like symptoms.”According to the complaint to the health care centre incharge, Dr Rakesh Kumar, Devi said the ANM, identified only as Archana, was busy on a phone call when she injected Devi with two doses one after the other.Devi alleged that when she pointed out the lapse, Archana reprimanded her, asking why the 48-year-old woman had not left after getting the first shot. HT has reviewed a copy of the complaint.After the incident, the woman’s family members protested at the centre, and alerted the district magistrate and chief medical officer Dr Rajesh Katiyar.Katiyar said a panel of doctors had begun questioning the ANM and other staff members at the centre, and will submit a report to the DM in the coming days.The centre incharge, Dr Rakesh Kumar, too, said he had recommended the probe.With inputs from Anonna Dutt in New Delhi||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-given-two-covid-19-shots-in-one-sitting-probe-ordered-101617465187905.html
