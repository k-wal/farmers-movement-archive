27-04-2021||India||As foreign aid arrives, Centre lays down plan to ensure swift distribution||As relief materials for India’s Covid-19 response began pouring in from countries such as the UK and Ireland, the government on Tuesday established procedures to ensure supplies, especially oxygen and related equipment, promptly reach the worst-hit areas across the country. The UK and members of the European Union (EU), which activated its Civil Protection Mechanism for emergencies on Sunday, were among the first to respond to India’s pressing needs for oxygen and medical equipment as the country grapples with a devastating second wave of the pandemic that has seen six straight days of more than 300,000 infections. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that a high-level inter-ministerial group established procedures for immediate clearance of materials from abroad. “The material would be dispatched promptly to recipient institutions in various parts of the country in coordination with different government agencies,” said one of the persons cited above. A total of 100 ventilators and 95 oxygen concentrators arrived from the UK on Tuesday, part of a package of 495 oxygen concentrators and 140 ventilators pledged by London, while France is sending eight large oxygen generating plants that can each meet the needs of a 250-bed hospital and five containers of liquid oxygen that can cater to the needs of 10,000 patients a day. Germany is sending a mobile oxygen production plant that will be available for three months, 120 ventilators and more than 80 million KN95 masks. Other EU members have pledged more oxygen-related equipment, ranging from 700 oxygen concentrators being sent by Ireland on Wednesday to smaller batches of ventilators and oxygen concentrators from countries such as Romania, Luxembourg and Sweden. Belgium is sending 9,000 doses of Remdesivir while Portugal will provide more than 5,500 vials of the antiviral medicine and 20,000 litres of oxygen per week. Following discussions between India and American officials, the US is finalising a support package that is expected to include oxygen generation systems, both small and large-scale, and components for the oxygen supply chain such as concentrators, ventilators, cylinders and transport. The aid could include oxygen generation systems for field hospitals that cater for 50 to 100 beds. The US will also provide therapeutics, personal protective equipment and rapid diagnostic test kits, and approve the supply of vaccine raw materials such as filters needed to manufacture Covishield vaccine in line with pledges made by President Joe Biden during his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. The two sides are holding technical discussions to ensure the equipment supplied by the US can connect to devices in India, and the American side will provide training for using all the equipment and help with their transportation. “US commercial suppliers of Remdesivir that are immediately available have been identified. Rapid diagnostic test supplies and PPEs that can be transferred to India immediately have also been identified. Besides, the US will facilitate India’s access to supplies from US-based sources,” said a second person. India is also expected to benefit as and when the US begins donating up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from its stockpile after the shot clears federal safety approvals. Besides the donations, India has secured medical supplies through private and commercial channels. These include 500 BiPAPs, 250 oxygen concentrators and four cryogenic oxygen containers sourced from Singapore, 80 tonnes of liquid oxygen being shipped via sea from Saudi Arabia, 800 oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong, four cryogenic oxygen tanks from Thailand, six cryogenic containers from the United Arab Emirates, and 23 mobile oxygen generation plants being imported from Germany by the Armed Forces Medical Services. Officially, India has issued no appeal for international aid in keeping with the government’s stated policy. However, Janez Lenarčič, the EU commissioner for crisis management, noted on Sunday that the support is being provided in response to an Indian request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-foreign-aid-arrives-centre-lays-down-plan-to-ensure-swift-distribution-101619547030919.html
27-04-2021||India||Oxygen production up by nearly 60% since August, Modi told||New Delhi: India has increased its Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) production by nearly 60%, and has increased the share of oxygen allocated for states, according to a government statement that cited a top-level Covid review meeting on Tuesday between Prime Minister Narendra Modi, senior government officials, and members of three empowered groupsThe officials informed the PM that from 5,700 metric tonne a day in August 2020, the domestic production of medical oxygen has been ramped up to 8,922 MT as on April 25, 2021, and is expected to cross 9,250 MT per day by the end of April, the statement said.Modi instructed the officials to work closely with state governments to start the PSA (pressure swing adsorption) oxygen plants at the earliest. Last year, the government decided to install 162 PSA oxygen plants at various states. The increased share of oxygen to the states were also discussed during the meeting. The meeting -- in which the was given an overview on the situation related to oxygen availability, medicines and health infrastructure -- was attended by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, PM’s principal secretary PK Mishra, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, Niti Ayog member Dr VK Paul, and other top officials. “PM was briefed about the functioning of the Oxygen Express Railways Service as well as the domestic sorties & international sorties undertaken by IAF to transport oxygen tankers,” a government press release said. “The Empowered Group working on medical infrastructure and Covid management briefed the PM on efforts being undertaken to ramp up availability of beds and ICUs. They informed the PM on efforts being break the chain of transmission. PM stressed on the need to ensure that specific guidelines and strategies evolved regarding Covid management needs to be properly implemented by the relevant agencies in the States,” the release added.

27-04-2021||India||‘Demand for medical oxygen rising rapidly in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, UP’: Experts||The shortage of medical oxygen in some of the northern and north-western states (and national capital Delhi) has been or is in the process of being resolved, the head of the empowered group on oxygen supply, Giridhar Aramane, said. He, however, said that demand from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat are rising rapidly.“Bengaluru’s caseload is increasing apart from Kerala. Karnataka’s allocation has gone up from 300 MT to 800 MT as the caseload has more than doubled in a few days,’’ said Aramane, who also serves as Union secretary of road transport and highways. He heads the empowered group since Guruprasad Mahapatra, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is recovering from Covid-19. Karnataka has just announced a 14-day lockdown but the increasing oxygen demand by the new states may be the new challenge for the Centre.While there is still a lack of clarity over the situation in Delhi, the Centre said it is supplying enough, the state said it isn’t receiving enough while the Delhi High Court has criticised both governments for not doing their job. The demand from other parts of the country is rising.”What needs to be seen is that Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana have all started asking for more oxygen,” said Sumita Dawra, additional secretary of DPIIT under which comes under the commerce minister, the body responsible for medical oxygen.The figures which were presented in Delhi High Court on Tuesday bear out this shift in oxygen demand. The empowered group’s mapping shows that on April 15, Karnataka consumed 250 MT of oxygen which reached 770MT by the weekend. The state expects demand for over 1000 MT by the end of the month.HT reached out to the CM’s office for a comment but is yet to get a response. However, state minister MTB Nagaraj told reporters in Bengaluru, “Covid is spreading at an unimaginable speed. We have given some suggestions to the CM at the cabinet meeting.’’Karnataka has 262,162 active cases of Covid-19 as of Monday. Similiarly, Tamil Nadu saw its oxygen allocation go up from 208MT on April 15 to 355MT over the weekend. The state expects demand to further increase to 400. “At present, Tamil Nadu is using around 350 MTs of oxygen for Covid- 19 treatment. It is likely to touch 400 MTs if active cases shoot up,” said P Umanath, director, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC). Senior officials said that the EG’s allotment for the state is incorrect. Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami wrote to PM Modi on this issue on Sunday and asked the Centre to immediately cancel oxygen being diverted from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which have fewer active cases compared to the state. Tamil Nadu has an oxygen production capacity of 400 MT and storage of 1167 MT.It’s not just the southern states; Uttar Pradesh has seen a rise in demand from 550MT on April 15 to 850MT on Sunday. Its projected demand for the end of the month is also likely to be over 1000 MT. Gujarat has gone from 550MT to more than 1000 MT and has now demanded 1500MT by the end of the month.“Maharashtra, with 700,000 active cases, is consuming 1600 MT, Kerala with 219,000 cases is consuming 241 MT but Gujarat with 115,000 cases is consuming 1000MT,’’ said Saket Tiku who heads the gas manufacturers association (AIGMA), adding that the usage needs to be “rationalised”.“That’s what I told the Prime Minister in our meeting with him last week. It’s a message that the health ministry needs to send out.’’The solicitor general also said this during the Delhi High Court hearing, “We have to redistribute in a way that they are taken care of. This is a need-based exercise,’’ said Tushar Mehta, putting the views of the central government in court.But things are getting better in the national capital, Dawra insisted.“Delhi has a good stock of oxygen now. 450-500 MT and another 100 with resellers and rest is on the way.” Tiku added that 24 tankers with 100 MT of oxygen are on their way to Delhi from Jamshedpur. And on Tuesday, the first train from Raigarh, Chattisgarh to Delhi, carrying 64MT tonne of oxygen arrived.On Tuesday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that things were getting better. ‘‘Last week, the oxygen crisis in Delhi worsened on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Hospitals were jam-packed and I was personally scared of any major untoward incident leading to several deaths due to lack of oxygen. But, in the last two days, the situation has improved significantly. We do not have as many SOS calls from hospitals now as we got on those three days. I want to thank the Central government for helping us through this time by providing their top officials who worked in close coordination with the senior officers of the Delhi government. I thank our Delhi government officials too who’ve worked day and night to address the crisis,” Kejriwal said.Uttar Pradesh acknowledged that there was an increase in demand, “The demand for medical oxygen in Uttar Pradesh has increased by 25 to 30% from the normal times,” said additional chief secretary, health, UP Amit Mohan Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-medical-oxygen-rising-rapidly-in-karnataka-tamil-nadu-up-and-gujarat-experts-101619544571238.html
27-04-2021||India||Australia announces initial support package for India, suspends all flights for 2 weeks||Australia on Tuesday unveiled an initial support package for India’s Covid-19 response, including 500 ventilators, even as it suspended all flights between the two countries for two weeks to prevent the spread of the virus.“I stress this is an initial package, there will be more to follow, of support and to deliver this as soon as possible,” Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison told a news conference.The assistance was announced jointly by foreign minister Marise Payne and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who said more medical equipment, including 100 oxygen concentrators, will be procured and shipped to India over the next week.“We recognise the challenging Covid-19 crisis that India is currently battling and we stand ready to provide more support to our friends in India and Indian Australians during this difficult time,” Morrison and Payne said in a statement.The initial support package will include 500 non-invasive ventilators, one million surgical masks, 500,000 P2 and N95 masks, 100,000 surgical gowns, 100,000 goggles, 100,000 pairs of gloves and 20,000 face shields.The supply of ventilators will be scaled up 3,000 and the Australian government will procure 100 oxygen concentrators, along with tanks and consumables. All the equipment will be shipped to India over the next week.Though the Australian government had earlier planned to temporarily reduce flights from India by 30% after recording a spike in incoming travellers testing positive for Covid-19, Morrison announced the National Security Committee had decided to pause all direct passenger flights from India until May 15.The statement noted that Australia’s Chief Medical Officer had designated India a “high-risk country” for travel arrangements. The suspension of flights will have an immediate impact on two passenger services to Sydney and two repatriation flights to Darwin, affecting around 500 people.When flights from India resume, passengers will be required to have both a negative Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result and a negative rapid antigen test result prior to taking off.Indirect flights from India through the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Malaysia have already been paused by the respective governments. “Once flights restart, the government will prioritise the return of vulnerable Australians. Already almost 20,000 registered Australians have returned from India since the pandemic began,” the statement said. A hardship program and consular support is already in place for Australians in India.Morrison described the situation in India as a “very significant outbreak” and said, “From the scenes we are seeing from India, they are truly heartbreaking. India is a great friend of Australia and a comprehensive strategic partner. We share so much in common as peoples, as democratic nations, and we extend our deepest sympathies and condolences and our support to the nation of India and the people of India and...Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi.”Payne pointed to India’s generosity throughout this pandemic and the export of more than 66 million vaccines, including gifts of doses to Nauru and Fiji. “It has also manufactured vaccine doses for Papua New Guinea, for the Solomon Islands, being delivered through the COVAX facility and we warmly acknowledge that generosity,” she said.There are currently a little more than 9,000 Australians registered in India, including 650 registered as vulnerable, Payne said. Australia has joined a growing number of countries rushing medical equipment, supplies and oxygen to India, which recorded 323,144 new Covid-19 infections since Monday – the sixth consecutive day of record-breaking tallies above the 300,000 mark. Nearly 2,800 more people succumbed to the virus, taking the death toll to 197,894.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-announces-initial-support-package-for-india-suspends-all-flights-for-2-weeks-101619543851079.html

This is a positive while we get quantitative data for better understanding of infection protection," Agrawal tweeted.IGIB is an institute under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).Another study by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad under the CSIR suggests that early results using in-vitro neutralisation assay show that both convalescent (prior infection) sera and Covishield-vaccinated sera offer protection against the B.1.617 variant."Very preliminary but encouraging result: #Covishield protects against #B1617. Early results using in vitro neutralization assay show that both convalescent (prior infection) sera and Covishield vaccinated sera offer protection against the B.1.617 variant, aka #DoubleMutant,” CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra tweeted last week.The B.1.617 variant has three new spike protein mutations. Two mutations -- E484Q and L452R -- are in the area important for antibody-based neutralisation.The third mutation -- P681R -- allows the virus to enter cells a little better. These are defining characteristics of the variant.The B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2 has been found prevalent largely in Maharashtra and Delhi that have been severely hit by a devastating second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-covaxin-effective-against-indian-strain-of-coronavirus-report-101619537999479.html

27-04-2021||India||PM Modi chairs high-level Covid review meet, tells officials to 'ensure rapid upgradation of health infrastructure'||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday chaired a high-level meeting with the top officials to review the Covid-19 situation in India. The Prime Minister was briefed about the availability of essential medical supplies like oxygen, medicines, health infrastructure that has reached its capacity due to the massive surge in the number of daily coronavirus disease cases.During the meeting, the Prime Minister instructed the officials to work closely with the state governments to begin the functioning of the PSA oxygen plants at the earliest. The officials also informed him that the states were encouraged to set up the plants to meet the required demand of the life-saving gas.Also read | PM Modi, home minister directly monitoring oxygen supplies: Govt tells SCThe Prime Minister was informed by the Empowered Group working on boosting oxygen supply about the measures being taken to step up the allocation of oxygen to the states. It was discussed that the production of liquid medical oxygen has increased by over 3000 MT from August last year. From 5700 MT per day produced in August 2020, the country is producing 8922 MT presently, as of April 25, according to a statement from the Prime Minister's office. The domestic production of the essential liquid medical oxygen is expected to increase further and cross 9250 MT per day by the end of this month.This comes after the Centre informed the Supreme Court earlier in the day that the Prime Minister is working to increase the oxygen supply in the country on a war footing and is constantly supervising the availability of oxygen.The officials also apprised Modi about the functioning of the Oxygen Express by the railways as well as the domestic and international sorties undertaken by the Indian Air Force for transportation of oxygen tankers.On Monday, a C-17 aircraft of the IAF airlifted six empty cryogenic oxygen containers from Dubai. The C-17 transport plane was also used for domestic oxygen transportation on Tuesday as it carried two empty tankers from Indore in Madhya Pradesh to Jamnagar in Gujarat for oxygen filling amid the huge demand for the gap due to the spike in Covid-19 cases.The Empowered Group working on medical infrastructure and Covid management briefed the Prime Minister about the efforts undertaken to boost the availability of beds and ICUs in the nation as people struggle with an acute shortage of hospital beds.Also read | 'Better prepared to beat Covid-19 this year compared to 2020': Harsh VardhanPM Modi stressed on the need to ensure that specific guidelines and strategies for Covid management are properly implemented by the states.Another Empowered Group, which is working on communication informed Modi about the efforts undertaken to increase awareness among people on Covid-appropriate behaviour.India is struggling from a seemingly high contagious second wave of Covid-19 that has left its infrastructure in complete disarray. On Tuesday, 323,144 new fresh Covid-19 infections and more than 2,700 deaths in the last 24 hours, the health ministry's data showed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-chairs-high-level-meet-to-review-covid-situation-in-india-tells-officials-to-ensure-rapid-upgradation-of-health-infrastructure-101619536593585.html
27-04-2021||India||PM Modi, home minister directly monitoring oxygen supplies: Govt tells SC||The Centre on Tuesday told the Supreme Court that the Prime Minister is working towards increasing oxygen supply on a war footing in order to ease the burden on Covid-19 patients on a war-footing and is constantly supervising oxygen supply in the nation.“The Central Government, with active and constant supervision and direct involvement of the Prime Minister and the Home Minister, is augmenting the oxygen supply on a war footing evolving and implementing innovative measures,” the Centre said in an affidavit to the Supreme Court.The Centre in its 200-page affidavit, filed in the suo motu case in distribution of essential services and supplies during the Covid-19 pandemic said that any deviation in plan for any particular state (either under a judicial order or otherwise) without keeping in mind the national availability or ever changing requirements of each state will have “cascading effect on oxygen supply to other States.”The Union ministry for home affairs also said that the unprecedented surge in the number of coronavirus cases has also brought about certain limitations in terms of resources. It added during such times resources need to be “professionally augmented and utilised.”A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat took the affidavit on record and posted the matter for further hearing on Friday. “It is also pertinent to note that the medical oxygen in any country cannot be unlimited. While the government started all out efforts to augment oxygen resources and procure more and more oxygen from all available sources, these supplies available at any given time in the country are to be distributed to all the states, especially those which are critically burdened with high number of active COVID cases, in a balanced manner,” the government said, according to news agency PTI.The Union ministry of home affairs also said that it is in the process of commissioning 162 PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption technology to generate oxygen at local level) plants across the nation a war footing. “It is submitted that 38 plants have already been installed and another 21 plants will be installed by April 30, 2021. A further 105 plants will be installed by May 31, 2021 and thereafter increasing to 156 plants by June 30, 2021. Besides, 500 more PSA plants are planned to be installed in the hospitals in district headquarters to enhance oxygen generation in smaller cities and towns,” Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-home-minister-directly-monitoring-oxygen-supplies-govt-tells-sc-101619534641894.html
27-04-2021||India||No surplus Covid-19 vaccine doses to send to India right now, says UK||The UK is currently moving through its domestic priority lists for Covid-19 vaccines and therefore has no surplus doses to share with countries in need such as India at this stage, Downing Street said on Tuesday.In reference to India’s devastating second wave of the pandemic, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said the process is kept under constant review, while the country sends an assistance package made up of 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators and 20 manual ventilators to India to meet the supply shortages over the course of the week.The first tranche of 100 ventilators and 95 oxygen concentrators arrived in New Delhi early on Tuesday.“We committed in February to sending excess doses from the UK’s supply to the COVAX procurement pool and to countries in need, once they are available,” the UK PM’s spokesperson said.“Right now we are moving through the UK prioritisation list for our domestic rollout and don’t have surplus doses, but we keep this under constant review. We recognise that no one is safe until we’re all safe in this pandemic which is why the UK has contributed GBP 548 million to COVAX and sent vital medical supplies to India,” the spokesperson said.The COVAX facility refers to the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access global initiative aimed at equitable access to vaccines led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organisation (WHO).The latest update from Downing Street comes as it emerged that the US is to export around 60 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with India expected to be among the biggest recipients of the consignment after talks between US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.With 3,23,144 people testing positive for the coronavirus in a day, India's infection tally climbed to 1,76,36,307 on Tuesday. The death toll mounted to 1,97,894 with 2,771 new fatalities.Several efforts are on within the Indian diaspora in the UK to fundraise for essential supplies such as oxygen concentrators and coordinate distribution of across India’s struggling hospitals through a series of emergency appeals, including by charities such as the British Asian Trust and British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-surplus-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-send-to-india-right-now-says-uk-101619532367341.html
27-04-2021||India||Army chief Gen MM Naravane reviews readiness in eastern Ladakh||Army General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday reviewed the Indian Army’s operational readiness in eastern Ladakh where India and China have been locked in a standoff for nearly a year and are currently negotiating a withdrawal of frontline troops and weapons from friction points on the contested border, a senior official familiar with the development said.“Gen Naravane interacted with the troops and complimented them for their steadfastness and high morale while being deployed in some of the harshest terrain, altitude and weather conditions,” the army said in a statement. This is Naravane’s first visit to eastern Ladakh after the Indian and Chinese armies wrapped up the disengagement process in the Pangong Tso sector in February, with both sides pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) after 45 years.The disengagement process between the two armies has hit a wall at other friction points as a result of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) unexpected reluctance to pull back its forward deployed troops from Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. The army chief will visit forward areas, including the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector, near the LAC on Wednesday, he said. The army chief also visited Siachen Glacier where two soldiers were killed in an avalanche on April 25. Naravane’s visit to India’s farthest frontiers comes at a time when the country is reeling under the Covid-19 crisis and the military is at the forefront of providing relief. Lieutenant General PGK Menon, commander of the Leh-based HQs 14 Corps and the man leading the military dialogue with China, briefed the army chief on the prevailing security situation in the sensitive sector.“As far as internal Covid situation is concerned, it should not affect the territorial integrity of the country for which the armed forces have to remain prepared all throughout. It warrants that the army chief reviews operational plans on ground and also boosts the morale of the troops,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). The swift pace of disengagement in the Pangong Tso area in February - it began and ended in less than 10 days - raised hopes of positive outcomes at the remaining flashpoints on the LAC. But the initial optimism appears to have waned after the latest 11th round of military talks on April 9 during which the PLA demonstrated a lack of commitment to restore the status quo of April 2020, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. Disengagement of frontline troops on the LAC is the first crucial step to restore peace and tranquillity in eastern Ladakh. Until that happens, there is no question of de-escalation of the border conflict and the eventual de-induction of rival soldiers in the sensitive theatre.Days after the mutual withdrawal of front-line troops and weapons from the Pangong Tso heights in February, Naravane cautioned that the disengagement process with China would be a long-drawn one. He described disengagement as a “win-win situation” for both sides but added that de-escalation of conflict and the de-induction of rival forces was “still a long way to go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-mm-naravane-reviews-readiness-in-eastern-ladakh-101619532869547.html
27-04-2021||India||WHO steps up aid to India to stem Covid-19 surge||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday it was stepping up efforts to help India as hospitals there struggled to cope with a huge surge in coronavirus cases, including bringing in oxygen and other essential supplies.India's death toll is now nearing 200,000, and some hospitals are turning away coronavirus patients as they do not have enough oxygen supplies and beds.WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the crisis had worsened due to mass gatherings of people, more contagious variants and low vaccination rates."We are working with the government to bring in essential supplies like oxygen and alleviate the immediate situation," Jasarevic said.The WHO was providing 4,000 oxygen concentrators, which only require an energy source, he said. Mobile field hospitals are being set up and laboratory supplies provided for testing.He urged people not to stockpile essential supplies. Wider distribution of high-quality masks was also key to control transmission, he said.More than 2,600 WHO experts already working in the country on other health programmes have been deployed to respond to the pandemic, the U.N. agency has said.The problem has been exacerbated by some people going to hospital when home care would suffice, Jasarevic said.Less than 15% of people infected with Covid-19 actually need hospital care and even fewer will need oxygen, he said.Community-level centres should screen and triage patients and provide advice on safe home care, he said.Studies continue into virus variants circulating there, including the B.1.617 variant with two mutations, first detected from samples collected last December, he said, citing some evidence that they may be more contagious."The extent to which these virus changes are responsible for the rapid increase in cases in the country remains unclear, as there are other factors such as recent large gatherings that may have contributed to the rise," he said.India's 323,144 new cases over the past 24 hours stood below a worldwide peak of 352,991 hit on Monday, while 2,771 deaths took the toll to 197,894.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-steps-up-aid-to-india-to-stem-covid-19-surge-101619530703514.html
27-04-2021||India||Tripura hikes transport tariff by up to 25%, three years after last revision||The Tripura government has increased transport tariff by up to 25% citing the hike in petrol and diesel prices during 2020-2021 financial year. The transport tariff was last hiked in July 2018.“We have decided to increase transport fares with the rise of petrol and diesel prices by 30% and 32% (respectively). However, we are not going to hike fares for Air Conditioned buses,” said transport minister Pranajit Singha Roy.After the revision, per kilometre fair for ordinary state transport buses has increased to 73 paise from 58 paise, similarly the fair for minibuses has increased to 90 paise from earlier 72 paise per kilometre.Fares for metered auto and contract auto services have also been hiked to ₹20 for two kilometres and ₹8.66 per kilometre from ₹7.20 respectively, said the minister.The government also announced a new bus service in hilly areas. The fare for minibuses under this service will be ₹1.20 per kilometre and ₹1.45 per kilometre for other small buses.Night bus services operating from 9pm to 5am will charge an additional 25% fare and express bus services will levy an additional 15% charge.Petrol prices rose sharply across the country after recovery in prices of international crude oil in the last few months of 2020-2021 since the Central and state taxes were not reduced in the same proportion. The domestic prices for petrol and diesel vary across states due to various taxes and levies by various state governments. Central and state taxes constitute 60% of the retail selling price in petrol and over 54% in diesel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-hikes-transport-tariff-by-up-to-25-three-years-after-last-revision-101619531789874.html

27-04-2021||India||Gujarat govt's handling of Covid-19 pandemic 'not satisfactory': High court||The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday expressed its displeasure over the state government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, noting the entire exercise lacks "transparency" and pointed to the death of patients outside hospitals due to "non-attendance by doctors".The court also advised against imposing a lockdown and said it is not a solution to fight the pandemic.The HC asked the Gujarat government to direct hospitals to admit all Covid-19 patients approaching them instead of just those coming through '108' (helpline) ambulance service."We are not saying that the government is not doing anything or the (Ahmedabad Municipal) Corporation is not doing, but the manner in which it is being done is not satisfactory, not transparent, and therefore all these problems are arising," said a division bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice B D Karia.The bench made the observations while hearing a suo motu (on its own) PIL over the Covid-19 situation in Gujarat which has seen a sharp rise in coronavirus cases in the last few weeks."If you had a more practical, thoughtful and a more meaningful system of working, it would be doing much better and there would be much less crisis."These untimely deaths or unfortunate deaths that are taking place outside hospitals because of non-attendance by doctors should not happen," the court said.The HC raised the question of government and designated Covid-19 hospitals in Ahmedabad attending to only patients coming in EMRI (Emergency Management and Research Institute-run) '108' ambulances and ignoring those brought in private vehicles.The court said a doctor cannot refuse to attend to a patient who has not come in a '108' ambulance and let him die."Everybody has to be attended irrespective of which vehicle he has come from," it said.The bench asked the government to ensure that patients who arrive at hospitals in private vehicles are also attended by doctors and not left "high and dry"."Why doesn't the government issue directions to corporations all over the state, to government hospitals, designated hospitals, that whenever a patient arrives, attend to him. A patient attended to would be mentally satisfied that immediate care has been taken," the bench said.When Advocate General (AG) Kamal Trivedi, representing the state, said it will be difficult to control a steady flow of patients approaching a hospital in private vehicles, the HC suggested that each medical facility should have a display board outside showing the status of available beds."We had directed the Principal Secretary Health to convene a meeting of all stakeholders and decide a common policy to be followed."All these are common issues... corporations cannot have their own policy contrary to what the government has," the court said.The bench questioned the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC)'s policy of not giving admission to patients in its hospitals coming from outside the city."Can you do that? Is this a kind of domicile thing that we are only catering to Ahmedabad and therefore we cannot care for patients from outside, even if he is critical?" it asked.The court also questioned the government over people lining up to fill up oxygen cylinders required to treat critical Covid-19 patients.The HC's observation came after Advocate General Trivedi said the existing mechanism is to divert the supply ofmedical oxygen to the Centre for it to allocate to states.When the AG told the court that there was a "sea of difference" in the Covid-19 situation today compared to a week ago, the bench asked him whether the government was ready to handle the projected heavy flow of patients in the coming days."What is going to happen on May 1 when the number of patients doubles? Everyday there is an increase. Are you ready for it?"What are the steps you are going to take? All the patients will not be attended and they will be allowed to die?" it asked.The court sought to know the preparations to tackle a further surge in cases."What is the way this system is working? There is a projection of half a million patients in the next 15 days. What is your preparation? Nothing," it said.The court asked the government to consider ways to "break the chain" to contain the spread of the virus."It is for the government and experts to decide how to break the (transmission) chain," it said.When a lawyer appearing in the case pressed for imposing a lockdown to break the chain, the court said unlike Germany or London, such a step is hard to take in India and appealed to people to remain in self-imposed lockdown as far as possible."Lockdown is not a solution. By imposing lockdown, do you know how many people would lose their daily meal? This is not Germany, New Zealand, London, this is India...Why can't we have our own self-restrictions and not depend on the government?" the bench said.The court asked the government to ensure Covid-19 patients get the full dose of Remdesivir injections.A civil application, filed by three persons, has been made a part of the PIL. The application seeks court direction for urgent supply of medical oxygen to the needy patients.The PIL will be further heard on May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-govt-s-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic-not-satisfactory-high-court-101619530757666.html

Abandon all political work and help people, they were told amid the surge in Covid-19 cases that has overwhelmed hospitals and triggered a shortage of essential supplies such as medical oxygen.Congress, the principal opposition party, wants to raise an army of Covid Sevaks, or those eager to reach out and help distressed families, amid the pandemic.“During this Corona crisis, I request my Congress colleagues that all political work should be abandoned. Just help the people, by all means remove the misery of the countrymen. This is the religion of the Congress family,” said Gandhi in his message to party workers, accessed by HT, delivered through the Congress’s app.The aim, a Congress leader said, is to create a dedicated force in every block and every district. On the first day, 27,000 workers registered themselves for this voluntary work in these challenging times.Other political parties are also trying to extend their helping hand at the grassroots level, widening their role in India’s worst health crisis ever. The pandemic has left more than 195,000 dead and 17.3 million infected.Bhartiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s youth wing, has also been working to provide hospital beds, medicines and oxygen cylinders. It is setting up camps for blood plasma donation from those who have recovered from Covid-19. On Monday, Tejasvi Surya, BJP lawmaker and the Morcha chief, tweeted about his work at Mahabodhi Hospital in Bengaluru and instructions to set up 100 plus beds and 10 ventilators.“During the first [Covid-19] wave, our focus was on providing food and transportation to migrants, the second wave requires more medical attention,” said Neha Joshi, the national media co-in charge of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha.Also Read | ‘Your system has failed’: HC asks Delhi govt to take action on oxygen hoardingTens of thousands of migrant workers were forced to walk or cycle back to their homes after the lockdown imposed last year to check the pandemic spread left them jobless.

27-04-2021||India||6-year jail term for Saritha Nair in Kerala solar scam||The judicial first class magistrate court in Kozhikode (north Kerala) on Tuesday sentenced the second accused in solar cheating case Saritha S Nair to six years rigorous imprisonment and fined her ₹40,000.Congress leader and former home minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan welcomed the verdict. “The ruling front has used her to target Congress leaders. It is a slap on its face,” he said. The court found Nair guilty of breach of trust, cheating, forging documents and other offences. The first accused, Biju Radhakrishnan, her second husband, is in quarantine and his sentence will be announced later. The court held that she has to undergo the sentence separately. She had already been convicted in three other cases.This is one of the 30-odd complaints registered against the duo in the solar cheating case in 2013. This case relates to the cheating of a businessman Abdul Majeed in 2012. He had accused both of cheating him of ₹42.70 lakh after promising to install imported solar panels in his office and house and franchisee rights of their firm. Fearing bad publicity many withdrew their plaints later.Though the trial in the case was completed in 2018, the verdict was postponed. The case dragged after Nair failed to appear before the court citing many reasons. Later, the court issued an arrest warrant and she was held from her house in Thiruvananthapuram last week.The solar scandal, one of the reasons for the fall of the Oommen Chandy regime, surfaced in 2013. Nair and Radhakrishnan floated a fictitious solar energy company called ‘Team Solar’ and cheated many by seeking investments with the promise of making them business partners or offering to install solar power units. They flaunted their ‘high connections’ to attract gullible investors.She used to frequent the CM’s office using her connections. Oommen Chandy, the then CM of Kerala, had to sack two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director when their names cropped up in the case. Later, Nair also accused many Congress leaders, including Chandy, of sexually harassing her. This complaint was handed over to the CBI by the Pinarayi Vijayan government two months back but the central agency is yet to take up the case.Nair allegedly figured in another cheating case last year when some of the job aspirants filed a police complaint against her saying she accepted money from them in the guise of helping them to get government jobs. However, due to her alleged proximity with the left front government, which used her to target Congress leaders, she was spared.She also tried to contest against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad in the 2019 Lok Sabha election but her papers were rejected. Last November, the Supreme Court rejected her plea challenging the election of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi with a fine. Her nomination from Wayanad was rejected by the returning officer on account of her conviction in cheating cases related to the solar scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6year-jail-term-for-saritha-nair-in-kerala-solar-scam-101619525308431.html

27-04-2021||India||Ireland to send 700 oxygen concentrators to back India’s Covid response||Ireland announced on Tuesday it is sending 700 oxygen concentrators from its stockpile to back India’s Covid-19 response, joining the growing list of countries that are rushing aid to help health facilities tackle a severe shortage of oxygen. The concentrators, devices that draw oxygen from the air and deliver it to patients, are expected to reach India early on Wednesday. Ireland has also pledged to send ventilators to India as a gesture of solidarity that is part of the European Union’s (EU) coordinated response to help the country cope with the massive surge in Covid-19 cases. Irish ambassador Brendan Ward said: “The situation in India is being followed closely in Ireland, where there is now a large Indian community. Indian medical professionals are very important to our health system. “We are pleased to be able to offer these oxygen concentrators now. We are in close contact with the Indian government and we are looking at what further assistance we could offer, such as ventilators and other equipment.” According to official data released on Tuesday, India recorded 323,144 new Coronavirus infections since Monday – the sixth consecutive day of record-breaking tallies above the 300,000 mark. Nearly 2,800 more people succumbed to the viral disease, taking the death toll to 197,894. Ireland’s donation of oxygen concentrators is being made from stocks originally purchased for use in a field hospital setting, as part of pandemic preparations, national broadcaster RTE reported. Oxygen cylinders need to be refilled, while oxygen concentrators can provide a continuous flow of oxygen that doesn’t run out and are lighter than cylinders and can be moved easily. A spokeswoman for Ireland’s Health Service Executive said they are ideal for patients who don’t require mechanical ventilation but would benefit from oxygen via a face mask. The donated items are brand new and were purchased specifically for Covid-19 patients. Ireland’s health minister Stephen Donnelly, who worked on the plan to send supplies to India along with foreign minister Simon Coveney over the weekend, said, “We have all seen the rapidly deteriorating situation in relation to Covid-19 in India. I am pleased that Ireland is in a position to make this emergency donation of 700 oxygen concentrators to India.” Tanaz Buhariwalla, India director for IDA Ireland, the agency responsible for inward foreign direct investment, said, “India and Ireland have a strong relationship spanning decades. We are happy that during these difficult times, the Irish government has extended an arm to support our war against Covid-19 and aid the healthcare workers.” The aid from Ireland is part of the response under EU’s Civil Protection Mechanism, which was activated on Sunday following a request from India. Germany and France have also announced support packages as part of the EU response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ireland-to-send-700-oxygen-concentrators-to-back-india-s-covid-response-101619515826928.html

On Monday, 991 beds were available in around 100 private hospitals and their satellite facilities. The 12 state-run hospitals in the city had just 458 remaining beds.“The rush in Kolkata is more than the districts. While state run-hospitals are 80% occupied, across the state the occupancy rate is around 55%. We are augmenting the infrastructure not only in the state-run hospitals but also in private hospitals,” said a health department official, requesting anonymity.The number of available beds in state-run hospitals was around 5,600 on March 26, a day before the assembly elections kicked off in the state. West Bengal reported 646 Covid-19 cases that day. On April 26, the state recorded 1,5992 cases. Some private hospitals, which ran out of beds, have come up with satellite facilities.Also Read | EC bans election victory rallies as Covid-19 cases continue to surgeOfficials said at least one out of every three private hospitals in the city and its fringes has no beds left. A few state run-hospitals are also left with no beds, they added. Around 35 top private hospitals in the city have no beds available.The highest number of cases are being reported from Kolkata, which recorded 3,868 infections on Monday. As many as 5,321 cases were reported from the three adjacent districts of North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, and Howrah. The surge has led to a depletion of oxygen supply and shortage of antiviral Remdesivir and prompted the authorities to issue guidelines for their strict rationing.“Due to the high caseload, we need to decongest the hospitals and more importantly the CCU [cardiac care unit] and HDU [high-dependency unit] beds. For this, detailed guidelines have been brought out...which patients could be kept in HDU and CCU beds and who could be referred to isolation centres from hospitals depending on the severity. Also, guidelines have been brought out over the use of oxygen and Remdesivir,” said another official, who did not wish to be named.Hospitals have been asked to start oxygen therapy only if the saturation of a patient drops below 94%. The state government has also made it mandatory for pharmacists to sell Remdesivir to hospitals only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-left-with-less-than-1-500-beds-in-hospitals-as-covid-19-cases-break-new-records-101619515166405.html

Annapurna, (8091 mtrs) 10th highest mountain in the world on 16th April 2021 at 1.30pm. And also I am the first Indian woman to scale Mt Annapurna.” Her journey that kick-started on March 21 was followed by a 5-day quarantine period. Before she started the climb, she also updated her followers as she captioned her post, “Going towards my dream. Mt Annapurna I, whose elevation stands at 8091m making it fall under 14× 8000m plus peaks of the world.”“I was confident, excited and a bit scared as it is one of the deadliest mountains because of its unpredictable climate which makes it even more difficult for a climber. I am also happy because there were no causalities this year,” says Mohite on this remarkable achievement. She also adds, “After every climb, I get at least 1,000 new followers on social media and I hope I am able to have good influence on them.” In the past, Mohite has also achieved success in climbing Mt Makalu, the fifth-highest peak in the world, in 2019, and became the first Indian woman. She has previously scaled Mt Lhotse, the fourth highest mountain in the world, in 2018 and Mount Everest in 2013.The mountaineer didn’t let the lockdown play a spoilsport in her practice and training last year as she believes that endurance and preparation play a key role for a climb. “From August onwards, gym and fitness centres reopened, so I also restarted my work out regime. However, the outdoor training and activities were reduced due to the Covid-19 situation and I need to be cautious as getting infected will have an impact in the long run as a mountaineer, so I resorted to strength training, cross fit, and high-intensity interval training,” she says. Mohite, who works at a pharmaceutical company in Bengaluru, wanted to climb Kangchenjunga this year but couldn’t due to unavailability of the team credits her parents for the continuous encouragement through the years. “My parents have always supported my decisions and pushed me to strive better,” she says.In her leisure time, Mohite likes to go for nature treks, do rock-climbing and watch films that are related to mountaineering. However, she also feels there’s a dearth of movies in Indian cinema that portray the lives of mountain climbers. “There should be more films depicting the lives of mountaineers...Climbing is really difficult but I understand shooting outdoors would be hard too, but there should be one like the film, Everest (2015),” she concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-mohite-the-first-indian-woman-to-scale-mt-annapurna-there-should-be-more-films-depicting-the-lives-of-mountaineers-101619514566063.html

Following this different 'akhadas' (sects) had agreed to keep their participation symbolic.Crowds at the ghats of the Ganga started thinning down drastically since last week after the key 'akhadas' of seers began pulling out of the Maha Kumbh, one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, citing the spike in coronavirus case numbers.Many spots wore a deserted look on Tuesday at the Kumbh which will formally close only on April 30.With 3,23,144 people testing positive for coronavirus infection in a day, India's total tally of Covid-19 cases has climbed to 1,76,36,307, while the national recovery rate has further dropped to 82.54 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Tuesday.Uttarakhand reported 5,058 Covid-19 cases on Monday with Dehradun registering 2,034 cases and Haridwar 1,002 cases.By 10.45 am, 600 seers of the Joona, Agni, Avahan and Kinnar 'akhadas' had taken a dip in the river followed by 70 seers of the Niranjani and Anand 'akhadas' on Chaitra Purnima, Zonal Officer (Intelligence) of Haridwar Sunita Verma said.Seven more akhadas will converge at 'Har ki Pairi' during the day for a symbolic 'snan', the officer said.Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat, Inspector General (Kumbh Mela) Sanjay Gunjyal and Senior Superintendent of Police, Kumbh Mela, Janmejay Khanduri reviewed the arrangements at Har ki Pairi before commencement of the bath on Tuesday.Talking to reporters, Rawat thanked the seers for scaling down the shahi snan in response to the prime minister's appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kumbh-mela-seers-keep-last-shahi-snan-symbolic-affair-101619513645128.html
27-04-2021||India||EC bans election victory rallies as Covid-19 cases continue to surge||New Delhi: The Election Commission (EC), which has drawn flak for letting political parties flout Covid-19 protocols, on Tuesday banned victory rallies on or after the counting of votes in five states and a Union Territory on May 2 besides barring over two people from accompanying winning candidates for receiving their election certificates. The ban came a day after the Madras high court blamed the EC for the second pandemic wave, which has overwhelmed hospitals, and said officials of the poll watchdog should probably be tried on murder charges for allowing the violation of the norms.“No victory procession after the counting on 2.5.2021 [May 2, 2021] shall be permissible. Not more than two persons shall be allowed to accompany the winning candidate or his/her authorized representative receive the certificate of election from the Returning Officer concerned,” the EC said, as it detailed new protocols on the counting day in view of the Covid-19 situation.The poll watchdog cited the broad guidelines issued on August 21 last year to conduct elections during Covid-19 and added they were framed after receiving suggestions from political parties. It added the guidelines for political parties on election campaigns and meetings were reviewed based on suggestions received from chief electoral officers. The EC said the Covid-19 related provisions for counting of votes on May 2 are to be in accordance with the broad guidelines of August 2020, with the addition of the new protocols issued on Tuesday.The poll watchdog has faced criticism for allowing political parties to hold big rallies, where most participants, including political leaders, have been seen in attendance without masks. It issued guidelines reiterating the importance of adhering to Covid-19 protocol but did not act against any leader or party for flouting them.The EC has also faced criticism for holding the West Bengal assembly elections across eight phases, and for refusing to combine later phases even as the health crisis escalated and triggered a shortage of critical resources such as medical oxygen needed to save lives.The daily Covid-19 cases in the country have risen by over 400% since April 1 and deaths by over 600%. India on Tuesday reported 68,546 new infections and 2,771 fatalities (CHECK).The lowest turnout--roughly 75.06%—so far was recorded in the seventh and the penultimate phase of elections in West Bengal amid surging Covid-19 infections in the state on Monday when it reported around 16,000 infections and 68 deaths.Elections were also held in Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry in March and April. The counting of votes there will take place along with that in West Bengal after the last phase of polling in the state on Thursday.The campaigning for the West Bengal elections has ended. The EC earlier banned it at night, increased the silence period from 48 hours to 72 hours, and limited election rallies to 500 people after the Calcutta high court last week expressed dissatisfaction over measures taken to enforce Covid-19 norms during the polls.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Jagat Prakash Nadda welcomed the EC order banning victory processions. “I have directed all state units of BJP to strictly adhere to this decision. All karykartas [workers] of BJP are using their energies to help the ones in need in this hour of crisis,” Nadda said in a tweet.RESPONSES FROM OTHER MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES Jagdeep Chhokar of the Association of Democratic Reforms said that EC’s move came far too late and would achieve very little. “The Commission should have ensured that the protocols were followed far more sternly,” he said. “The EC has lost its credibility, which will take a long time to recover.”The Madras high court on Monday warned it could even stall the counting of votes unless the EC produced a Covid-19 protocol blueprint for it on April 30. The court said at no cost can counting be allowed to become a catalyst for a further surge. It toned down its observations as the reference to murder charges was not part of the written order. The court said public health is of paramount importance. “It is only when a citizen survives that he’ll be able to enjoy the rights that a democratic republic guarantees.”The court noted that face masks, sanitisers were not used, and no social distancing was maintained during election campaigning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-bans-election-victory-rallies-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge-101619513845904.html
27-04-2021||India||How exactly is the US planning to help India fight Covid-19? All you need to know||The United States on Tuesday said that it will be delivering raw materials to the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine, with an aim to help India tide over the current wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In a White House briefing, senior officials of the Biden-Harris administration detailed the comprehensive plan for support that involves transporting raw materials, oxygen supplies, ventilators, therapeutics, Remdesivir, testing and protective equipment, and providing public health assistance to India.Raw materials for vaccineFirstly, the United States will be "diverting" its own order of raw materials to the Serum Institute of India for the production of the AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine against Covid-19, senior administration officials said, adding that this was the "most effective and rapid step" that could be taken at this stage to provide support.Also Read: 'We remember India's generosity': US to 'divert' vaccine resources to Serum Institute"Given that there is not enough of the supply for the entire global manufacturing effort and in light of the current crisis, we, the United States, are diverting our order to India. So, I want to be clear here that we did not intervene with the manufacturer to make them fill the Serum Institute’s order; we don’t have that power. Instead, what we are doing is diverting our own order of our own supplies to the Serum Institute for their manufacturing," the official said.Medical oxygenRegarding oxygen supplies, US officials said that these are the resources that India has "specifically requested" and are situated very high on the priority list."There’s a number of different buckets — oxygen transport, oxygen generation, oxygen cylinders, the oxygen supply chain. And, in particular, our Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are pursuing options to provide oxygen generation systems," the official said.Also Read: Covid Crisis: 7 steps India took to ramp up oxygen supply amid shortageThe administration is also working on oxygen generation systems, including larger-scale as well as smaller-scale units, which have been used in US field hospitals to provide oxygen for 50 to 100 beds, the White House said. "And I’ll stress that some of these elements are in the exploration phase; they’re shorter- and longer-term options that we’re providing in the immediate, and then we plan to continue to be engaged over the longer term," a press noted cited senior administration officials as saying.Technical assistanceMoreover, US experts are also engaged in technical discussions with their Indian counterparts to ensure that the supplied equipment, oxygen concentrations, and ventilators, are compatible with the devices in India. "And we’re also going to be providing training associated with all of these requests as needed."Also Read: How Biden admin changed stance on supply of vaccine raw materials to IndiaProviding further details, said that the USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be providing additional technical assistance and materials to strengthen vaccine communications between India and the US and support "vaccine readiness at the national and sub-national levels."The US government is also preparing to help with the transportation of these and other supplies to India.Therapeutics, personal protective equipment, and testsThe United States has identified commercial suppliers of Remdesivir that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering of Covid-19 patients in India. Rapid diagnostic testing supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) have been identified, and will be available to be transferred to India immediately, the White House said. "Finally, we mentioned the antiviral drug Remdesivir and rapid diagnostic tests, but we are also facilitating India’s own access to those supplies through US-based sources," officials said.Public health assistance, a 'strike team'The US acknowledged that the CDC and India's Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS) have a "long, long history of working together closely and helping one another."The US CDC, working with the USAID, will urgently deploy a strike team to India, the White House said, which will include public health experts to work in close collaboration with the American embassy, with India’s health ministries and experts, and with India’s EIS staff."That strike team will work hand-in-hand with India’s experts in a number of areas, including laboratory services; surveillance and epidemiology; bioinformatics for sequencing and modeling of the disease; infection, prevention, and control; vaccines rollout; and risk communication," the press note detailed.Providing further details, senior administration officials said that the 'strike team' will also include CDC-EIS officers and laboratory leadership service officers who will work directly with India’s experts in peer engagements for the model for areas to allow support at the state and the local level. Support from the strike team could also support India being able to immediately add residents to epidemiology class sizes to add new training experts in the Field of Epidemiology Training Program frontline cohort, where the two countries are already working together.The USAID will also work in the public health arena with the CDC to support and fast-track the mobilization of emergency resources available through the Global Fund. India’s base allocation through the Global Funds Covid-19 resource mobilisation round is $75 million, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-exactly-is-the-us-planning-to-help-india-fight-covid-19-all-you-need-to-know-101619510233000.html

Senior doctors present in the meeting also advised the L-G on additional steps needed to contain the disease. The rising number of infections in the second wave led to imposition of restrictions such as night curfew in the UT last week.The L-G asked senior doctors and religious leaders to use social media among others to educate people on the pandemic and to clear misconceptions related to Covid vaccines. He also said that people not wearing face-masks should be denied entry at all religious places.“All necessary measures must be taken to ramp up the availability of beds and medicines for Covid patients,” he observed.Night curfew was clamped across all municipalities and urban areas of the UT on April 20 and places of mass gatherings such as public parks were closed; restrictions have been placed on public gatherings and transport services and markets have been asked to operate at 50% capacity.UT officials informed the L-G that hospitals in the region had enough oxygen and beds. The administration has approved setting up of 36 oxygen generation plants to meet with the possibility of a sudden rise in demand as seen in many Covid hotspots across the country. A total of 1,743 Covid beds were also vacant out of the total capacity of 3,062 beds as of Monday. Similarly, 203 Covid ICU beds, out of the 338, were vacant. The UT on Monday recorded 25 deaths including 11 from Jammu and 10 from Kashmir—the highest so far this year. 2,135 fresh Covid cases were reported on Monday, pushing the tally to 162,868. 791 fresh cases were reported from the Jammu division and 1,344 from the Kashmir division. Srinagar district recorded the highest number of 632 cases, followed by 472 in the Jammu district, said officials.Sinha promised all necessary support including equipment, additional manpower for hospitals and doctors, who suggested adoption of a multi-pronged approach such as tightening of Covid containment measures including restrictions on social and political events on one hand and meticulous inoculation of all people on the other. Some experts also stressed the need to strengthen the three-tier healthcare system to take off pressure from big cities.On his part, Sinha thanked doctors and frontline health workers for their continuous service in the times of crisis.“I am truly grateful for the amazing work you and your team members and health workers are doing. You are an inspiration for all of us...,” Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-l-g-takes-stock-of-covid-19-preparedness-in-ut-101619511565330.html

Tejpal, the former Tehelka editor-in-chief, is accused of sexually assaulting a woman in 2013.The court, which had listed the case for judgment on Tuesday, said it would not pronounce its verdict today. The decision was made by Additional Judge Kshama Josh.Speaking to media persons, Special Public Prosecutor Francisco Tavora informed that if the accused is convicted then there might be a sentence of a "minimum of 10 years to a maximum life sentence" depending on the "discretion of the judge".Tejpal was arrested on November 30 in 2013 after being accused of raping a colleague at a five-star resort in North Goa. He is currently on bail.On September 29, 2017, the court had charged him under various sections of the Indian Penal Code, including rape, sexual harassment and wrongful confinement. He, however, pleaded not guilty. Following the framing of charges, Tejpal moved the Supreme Court seeking quashing of the charges levelled against him.In August, the top court refused to quash the charges and directed the trial to be concluded within six months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tarun-tejpal-case-goa-court-defers-verdict-to-may-12-101619511167126.html
27-04-2021||India||'We remember India's generosity': US to 'divert' vaccine resources to Serum Institute||The United States on Tuesday said that it remembers "India's generosity" in the early days of the pandemic and will hence be delivering raw materials to the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine, with an aim to help India tide over the current wave of the coronavirus disease.In a White House press briefing earlier this day, senior officials of the Biden-Harris administration said that the United States was "diverting" its own order of raw materials to the Serum Institute in light of the current crisis as this was the "most effective and rapid step" that could be taken at this stage to provide support.Also Read: How Biden admin changed stance on supply of vaccine raw materials to India"As requested by the Government of India, we will be providing raw materials for the production of the AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine at the Serum Institute of India," a senior administration official said, elaborating on the "complexities of the global supply chain" and the exact nature of the assistance that the US is providing to India."Given that there is not enough of the supply for the entire global manufacturing effort and in light of the current crisis, we, the United States, are diverting our order to India. So, I want to be clear here that we did not intervene with the manufacturer to make them fill the Serum Institute’s order; we don’t have that power. Instead, what we are doing is diverting our own order of our own supplies to the Serum Institute for their manufacturing," the official said.Providing further details, the senior administration official said that the Defense Production Act (DPA) in the US requires American companies to prioritise US government contracts over others. "But what it does not mean is an export ban or a de facto ban or an embargo or any restrictions on sales to any other outside clients or customers anywhere. Companies are able to export however they need," he said.Also Read: Joe Biden’s wartime law use blocks India’s vaccine ramp-upAdding that the DPA doesn't cause any shortages in global supplies, the official pointed out that the US government doesn't even have the power to intervene with the manufacturing companies' orders. Hence, it was diverting its own supplies to India in view of the recent surge in Covid-19.The official further said that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be providing additional technical assistance and materials to strengthen vaccine communications between India and the US and support "vaccine readiness at the national and sub-national levels."US experts, however, believe that the Biden administration can do more. The US Chamber of Commerce had earlier last week called on the White House to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots will more than meet its needs. The US has also not authorised the AstraZeneca shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-remember-india-s-generosity-us-to-divert-vaccine-resources-to-serum-institute-101619506818134.html

27-04-2021||India||Counting of votes: Madras HC suggests lockdown in TN, Puducherry on May 1-2||The Madras high court has suggested a May 1-2 lockdown to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry governments to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases during vote-counting for the recently held assembly elections. The court said on Monday that only vehicles required for counting and emergency services could be allowed. “Public health is more important than counting votes. The process may be delayed or even deferred, but public health must not be compromised,” the court said.The first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations while hearing a suo motu petition by the court on the status of the availability of oxygen, ventilators, hospital beds, and Remdesivir drug for treating Covid-19, besides vaccine availability. “If an appropriate announcement in such regard is made well in advance, say by April 28, ordinary citizens may have sufficient notice and may complete the weekend purchases by Friday and abide by the restricted movement norms as was evident in course of the lockdown observed on Sunday, April 25, 2021,” the court said. “As of now, the situation does not appear to be completely out of control, though there are some horror stories in media and some other anecdotes on the social media.”Also Read | Madras high court blames Election Commission for surge in Covid casesThe state submitted to the court that it had enough supply and that chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi a day ago against oxygen diversion so that oxygen is available for Tamil Nadu even in a worst-case scenario. The court also suggested that vaccine-manufacturing units at Chengalpattu, Coonoor and Ooty could be re-started. The state informed the court that Remdesivir is being sold at ₹1,400 plus GST per vial and a counter has been opened specifically for this purpose at Kilpauk Medical College. The Centre has allotted 59,000 vials of Remdesivir till April 30 to Tamil Nadu against pending orders of the state totalling 250,000. State health secretary J Radhakrishnan informed the court that only 25% of the Covid-infected may need hospital admission and 15% of them may need oxygen beds. The court noted that people may panic and hinder functioning at hospitals and healthcare centres as many have expressed serious concerns over black marketing of drugs, on the number of beds being far too few and on the lack of information regarding the availability of beds, drugs and doses of vaccine. Based on the court’s suggestion, the state agreed to widely publicise the do’s and don’ts.Both Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have announced a series of curbs starting Monday, such as closure of places of worship, spas, beauty parlours and salons to check the spread of the virus.The court will hear the matter next on April 29 unless it has to be taken up earlier on an urgent basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/counting-of-votes-madras-hc-suggests-may-1-2-lockdown-to-tn-puducherry-101619507664742.html

Senior lawyer Harish Salve, appearing for Vedanta, told Justice Chandrachud that the unit can begin producing oxygen in around 10 days.Appearing for Vedanta, senior lawyer Harish Salve tells SC, "We'll run only oxygen plant & not power plant. Electricity will be provided by the state."Justice DY Chandrachud asks, "When can you start the plant?""We can start producing oxygen in maybe 10 days," Salve replies.Also Read | Tamil Nadu allows Vedanta to temporarily reopen, company opposes operation of oxygen plant by govt"There is a national calamity," the judge further said, referring to the shortage of medical oxygen reported from hospitals across the country which has led to concerns over treatment of Covid-19 patients, especially those in serious condition, amid a rapid and alarming surge in daily new cases of the viral disease.On Monday, hours after the Tamil Nadu government's decision, Vedanta opposed the top court's suggestion from last week to let the state government operate the oxygen production unit at the plant, saying, "it is just beyond the competency and financial ability of the government to run this oxygen plant."

The Madras high court, last year, dismissed Vedanta's appeal to reopen the plant.

Shashi Tharoor gives it a political twist||Congress leader Shashi Tharoor tweeted a video of medical college students of Kerala taking on the Rasputin dance challenge, praising the video as an example of peaceful coexistence amongst people of different religions in the state of Kerala.Highlighting how the students used dance as a medium of solidarity, Tharoor, who is a member of the Parliament from Thiruvananthapuram, wrote on Twitter, “The medical college students who first did this (&were attacked because one of them was Muslim) have started a wonderful viral trend in solidarity. Kerala will always remain a place where all religions coexist. The communal virus will not be allowed to spread in our state.”The medical college students who first did this (&were attacked because one of them was Muslim) have started a wonderful viral trend in solidarity.

The communal virus will not be allowed to spread in our state. pic.twitter.com/SmeMuZjbtsAmid rising coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, medical practitioners across the country are at the frontline of the challenge that the second wave of the pandemic poses. At a time like this, when the country passes one grim milestone after another, Janaki Omkumar and Naveen Razak, students at Thrissur Medical College attempted to break the monotony and spread cheer with their dance moves on Boney M’s 1978 hit Euro-disco track ‘Rasputin’, as part of the popular Rasputin challenge that is sweeping social media across the world. Although the video went viral on social media, it took a communal turn when the video began garnering hate as the two students belonged to different religious communities.To protest against the hate meted out to the video, more medical students have joined the Rasputin dance challenge and shared videos on social media platforms. These videos were then reshared using the hashtag #StepWithRasputin and have also been collated on Instagram by student political organisation SFI’s Cochin University of Science and Technology wing.Earlier as well, Tharoor had praised the original video by Janaki Omkumar and Naveen Razak, tweeting, “These kids deserve applause and encouragement, instead of the Hindutva venom being spewed at them because of their different religions.

27-04-2021||India||SC appointed panel suggests scrapping railway project in Western Ghats||Empowered Committee (CEC) constituted by the Supreme Court has recommended withdrawal of the environmental approval to doubling of the single line railway track between Tinaighat in North Karnataka and the port town of Vasco da Gama in Goa. The line cuts across the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats and the CEC said that the project will only marginally enhance railway capacity but cause big damage to the fragile ecosystem of the Western Ghats, an internationally recognised Biodiversity hotspot. The recommendation is being seen as a big win for environmental activists. The CEC also recommended that the Goa-Tamnar 440KV power line should be set up along the alignment of the existing power line to save fresh forest areas from intrusion. In the third major recommendation, the panel cleared the four-laning of NH-4A between Anmod and Panajim if done as an elevated corridor to prevent any harm to the wildlife. All three projects were cleared in April last year by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife (SCNBWL), chaired by Union minister of forests Prakash Javadekar, sparking uproar and protests in Goa. The Goa Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) invested in preserving the ecology, challenged the projects in the SC. A copy of the CEC report was submitted to the top court and another was given to the Goa Foundation.“[The] CEC does not find any justification for undertaking a project of this nature which will destroy the fragile ecosystem of the Western Ghats... an internationally recognised Biodiversity hotspot and one of the most important wildlife corridors of the Country. Moreover this doubling project will only be marginally enhancing the capacity of the most inefficient section of the Railway Network passing through ecologically sensitive and biodiversity rich tiger Reserve, two Wildlife Sanctuaries and a National Park,” the CEC headed by P V Jayakrishnan, said. “In these circumstances it is recommended… to revoke the permission granted by the (SCNBWL) for doubling of the railway track,” the CEC said. The railway line passes through the Western Ghats from Tinaighat-Castlerock in Karnataka to Kulem in Goa, involving 120.875 hectare of forest land from the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary (BMWLS) in Goa, 10.45 and 0.88 hectare in Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and Haliyal Forest Division respectively in Karnataka. In 2010, the Ministry of Railways sanctioned the doubling of the existing Hospet-Tinaighat-Vasco railway line of a total length of 342 kilometres. The first phase between Hospet and Tinai ghat involved easier terrain atop the largely flat Deccan plateau and had already been completed. It was the second phase between Tinaighat and Vasco da Gama, involving crossing the steep slopes, raging rivers and the thick forests of the Western Ghats as well as the densely populated areas of coastal Goa, that was contested. The railways maintained there was no alternative to the current alignment passing through the protected area and claimed the existing single railway line was saturated. The authorities had also announced four underpasses to allow for wildlife crossings, which activists dismissed as insufficient.The CEC in its findings, recorded that the doubling of the existing rail line will not have any positive impact on the gradient and curvature of the new line and it will operate at the same inefficient level as the existing line, made in 1890s. The CEC also observed that the proposed doubling of the line will pose a serious impediment for the movement of long-ranging animals like tigers and elephants. “At present the Konkan railway line gives excellent connectivity to Northern and Southern parts of India. The connectivity between Goa and Karnataka is being strengthened/improved by way of 4 laning of NH-4A [between Belgaum and Panaji] along the same route and by the development of a new airport,” the CEC said. The SC will now decide whether to accept or reject the recommendations in the CEC report. The Goa Foundation has welcomed the findings of the CEC but said they will consult other environmental activist groups before finalising the stance before the top court in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-appointed-panel-suggests-scrapping-railway-project-in-western-ghats-101619501843506.html
27-04-2021||India||India likely to receive Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccines from Russia on May 1||India is expecting to receive the first batch of Russia's Covid-19 vaccine 'Sputnik V' on May 1, according to an official of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), cited by news agency Reuters. Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the RDIF, told the news agency that the first doses of Sputnik V will be delivered on May 1, adding that he hoped the Russian supplies would help India navigate its way out of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in time.India, the world's second-most populous country, is struggling with the new, more infectious wave of the pandemic, as hospitals throughout the nation report running out of bed and critical oxygen supplies. India's new coronavirus cases stayed above 300,000 for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday, recording 323,144 daily Covid-19 cases in the preceding 24 hours. As many as 2,771 new deaths were reported, but health experts believe the tally runs significantly higher.Several countries, including Britain, Germany, and the United States have pledged to send urgent medical aid to help tackle the coronavirus crisis that is overwhelming India's hospitals. At this time, the arrival of the Sputnik V shot from Russia would mean an addition to India's vaccine arsenal, which is currently running dry with Serum Institute of India's 'Covishield' (the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot) and Bharat Biotech's indigenous 'Covaxin' vaccines.Although the RDIF chief did not specify how many Sputnik V vaccines would there be in the first batch or where they would be made, Reuters reported that Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which is marketing Sputnik V globally, has already signed agreements with five leading Indian manufacturers for over 850 million doses of the vaccine a year. The RDIF has said it expects production of the vaccine in India to reach 50 million doses a month by the summer and to rise further.Meanwhile, Russian pharmaceutical firm Pharmasyntez said earlier on Monday that it was ready to ship up to 1 million packs of the Remdesivir antiviral drug to India by the end of May, once it has received the approval of Russia's government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-receive-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccines-from-russia-on-may-1-101619498099409.html

Issuing an order to the chief electoral officers of all states and union territories, the EC said that it has decided to put out more stringent provisions, to be followed during the process of vote-counting. No victory processions after the counting on May 2 shall be permissible. Additionally, no more than two persons shall be allowed to accompany the winning candidate while receiving the election certificate, the poll body said.Also Read: Election Commission is BJP’s parrot: West Bengal CM Mamata BanerjeeIn a letter signed by Sumit Mukherjee, the senior public relations secretary to the Election Commission of India, the poll body said that it had issued broad guidelines on August 21 last year to conduct elections during Covid-19, after receiving suggestions from national and state-based political parties. The guidelines for political parties conducting election campaigns and public meetings had also been reviewed based on suggestions received from various chief electoral officers of states and union territories, the letter read. The Covid-19 related provisions for counting of votes on May 2 are to be in accordance with the broad guidelines dated August 21, 2020, with the addition of the new protocols issued today."No victory procession after the counting on 2.5.2021 shall be permissible.

Coming down heavily on the poll body, the high court bench said that a proper "blueprint" of a plan to ensure Covid-19 protocols are followed on May 2 must be submitted before it by April 30, failing which the court might even resort to stopping the counting of votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-bans-victory-processions-on-or-after-counting-on-may-2-101619499681690.html
27-04-2021||India||Use masks indoors until you’re sure your family isn't infected: Gagandeep Kang||The government on Monday urged people to do more to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission with VK Paul, member (Health), Niti Aayog, saying people may need to wear masks even while they are at home. Gagandeep Kang, a virologist at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, spoke to Sunetra Choudhary about the need for wearing masks even indoors. Edited excerpts:Is there a need to wear masks at home even if there is not a Covid-19 patient around?The thing to think about is how are infections acquired. Infections are acquired when you have someone who is infected in your vicinity and that person is a source. When that person, speaks, eats, sings, breathes in and out, she will be putting out viral particles even with the new infectious variant for about a week to nine days. With the older version of the virus, we thought it was about a week--two days before symptoms and five days after. Now, what seems to be happening with the UK variant is that the amount of virus that is in the respiratory tract is quite a lot, much more than the ancestral variant. This means that a lot more virus is getting shed. In that situation, whenever you are around infected persons, it makes sense for them and you to mask so that you are each protecting the other. Should you be masking at home? If you are in contact with people that you do not know whether they are infected or not, it makes sense to stay masked. Should you stay masked inside with people you know who have not been exposed to anybody infected? I am not sure what level of risk that has and whether in that situation also you should be masked up.Watch: Everything you want to know about masks, explained by Dr Gagandeep KangSo, if people want to err on the side of caution, they can choose to wear the mask...A lot of infection happens when you are asymptomatic. So, if anyone in your family has been in contact with other people who might be potentially infectious and you want to be sure that they have not really brought the infection home, then it makes sense to stay with a mask until you are sure that your family members have not been infected during the time they were in contact with others. This applies at a time when there is very high transmission outside and you are really worried about the risk. Once the risk settles down and you have less transmission in Delhi, then it might be time to rethink the intensive wearing of masks at home.Also Read | IAF to airlift 6 oxygen containers from Dubai todayIs masking a good idea in homes where someone is going out to work? At this time, there is a very high risk in places like Delhi that a person going outside is going to come in contact with people whose infection status is unknown. Anytime that happens, you should be treating that person as a potentially infectious contact. If you want to be really careful, that is good advice to follow at this time.The other thing is should you be following the same when everyone is vaccinated? In other parts of the world, the [The United States] CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for example, says if everybody in the family is vaccinated, then it is safe for you to be around each other without masks. If there is an incentive to get vaccinated, that is it.Can you say definitively now that cloth masks are not enough and N95 are required?I think N95 masks are expensive and a luxury. N95 masks without valves are the safest protection that you can have. It is very important that with the N95 or the surgical mask, you wear them well. If for example, your glasses are steaming up on top of the mask, you are not wearing it well as air is coming out from the mask. The order is N95 masks for any situation that is a high risk, three-layered good surgical masks for most other interactions. I would advise that you use...[cloth masks in Delhi] only to make sure the surgical mask is fitting as well as possible.The doubts about masks began following a study about the coronavirus being airborne. What does that mean? The virus has always been airborne as it is a respiratory virus. So, it is a virus that comes out of your track in a range of particle sizes. You can have very small particles and you can have very large ones. Originally when we first heard about the virus, we were not sure there was human to human transmission. When we knew there was, we knew it was due to droplet infections. ...when you breathe out, ...large particle size...settles in an area around you approximately 3-6 feet. ...We now know that it is not only droplets. It is also aerosol that is generated, smaller than the 5-micron cut off. If those particles are that small, they have the ability to float around in the air for a lot longer. So, if you are in an enclosed space with an infected person, those particles will build up over time. So, ventilation is good because it creates an airflow that dilutes the particles out. So how can a person be infected if they have never been near an infectious person? There are two ways. One, you did not know that someone was infected, and they came home. If you live with young people, they may have an asymptomatic infection that was never picked up but was infectious enough to infect an older, susceptible person. The other one that has been hypothesized but not yet proven is that when you have a droplet infection and droplets fall all around you, when you clean after that, those droplets can become an aerosol which can float around for a while and infect someone else. The latter theory sounds a little less clear to me. It has been shown in experimental systems... but for humans, there is no data that backs that.Also Read | Covid-19: Flight from UK carrying vital medical supplies lands in IndiaCould the current situation of oxygen shortage have been avoided?It is difficult to assess. Obviously, we do not have as much oxygen as needed in the worst-hit places at this time. In terms of logistics for establishing new infrastructure, could we have been faster? We could always have been. Did we not do the right thing? I do not think anybody was anticipating a surge of this size. Should we have looked at other countries and predicted this? We did not even though there have been second waves in other places. The behaviour of viruses is difficult to predict. What is happening now, I hope this will be a lesson to us for the future. That building up infrastructure which allows for surge capacity is always going to be a good investment.Do you think our policymakers should have been working very hard from January to March when numbers were down? Did they get complacent?I am working with a group that is seeking to develop a road map for health care in India. We really think that not just for these few months, both short term and long term, we need investments in health and primary health care. This happens time and again. Every time there is an emergency, certain issues get highlighted. As soon as the emergency is over, it is no longer an urgent need. It happened after the first wave. I hope it would not happen after the second.What is the most important step the government can take right now?I think urgent care outside of hospital facilities. So, if they do not have beds, then what is it that you can do to ready beds as soon as possible. Nobody should be left lying outside of a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-masks-until-you-re-sure-your-family-hasn-t-been-infected-gagandeep-kang-101619499743440.html
27-04-2021||India||Navy to get aircraft carrier Vikrant, missile destroyer Visakhapatnam in 2021||Indian Navy is expected to get delivery of 45,000-tonne indigenous INS Vikrant aircraft carrier and 7,500-tonne Visakhapatnam class stealth guided missile destroyer by end-2021 to add to its capability to defend and dominate the Indo-Pacific region.The indigenous aircraft carrier and INS Visakhapatnam will be formally commissioned into the Navy next year. “Contractual clauses come alive once the warship is handed over to Indian Navy but commissioning takes times as the vessel is to be tested by the Naval personnel for its capability,” said a former Western Navy commander.While the Chinese Navy has commissioned three main battleships last Saturday at Sanya in Hainan naval facility in disputed South China Sea, the Cochin shipyard will start final trials of INS Vikrant as precursor of handing over the carrier to the Indian Navy. The Mazagon Dockyards will complete trials of INS Visakhapatnam and deliver the stealth destroyer close to the Indian Navy Day.Powered by General Electric turbines, INS Vikrant will carry two squadrons of MiG-29K fighters and 10 Kamov Ka -31 helicopters. The aircraft carrier strike force will have a range of over 15000 kilometre with Barak surface to air missile to give aerial protection to the vessel. INS Visakhapatnam’s main attack weapon is anti-ship and land attack BrahMos cruise missiles apart from torpedos for anti-submarine warfare.With the Indian Navy deciding to give preference to nuclear powered conventional submarines in future sea-warfare, the third aircraft carrier also called INS Vishal will now be seen as a replacement for the presently serving INS Vikramaditya. India’s sole aircraft carrier is currently under maintenance and will be available for operations in the coming months. The decision to project INS Vishal as a replacement for INS Vikramaditya means that the third aircraft carrier plan has not been shelved. Instead, it will go on concurrently so that there is no gap when INS Vikramaditya is decommissioned and mothballed.In fact, Indian Navy will add more teeth to its capability next year when INS Arighat, India’s second ballistic missile nuclear submarine, will be delivered to the Strategic Forces Command. The vessel is under trials and will be equipped with 3500 km K-4 intermediate range ballistic missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-to-get-aircraft-carrier-vikrant-missile-destroyer-visakhapatnam-in-2021-101619498533809.html
27-04-2021||India||IIT scientists predict India's Covid-19 active caseload likely to peak at 38-48 lakhs in mid-May||Active cases in the ongoing second Covid-19 wave in India may peak at 38-48 lakh between May 14-18 and daily new infections could hit a high of 4.4 lakh from May 4-8, according to a mathematical model by IIT scientists who have revised their projections upwards.India on Monday saw a single-day rise of 3,52,991 (3.52 lakh) Covid-19 infections and 2,812 fatalities with 28,13,658 (28.13 lakh) active cases.The scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur and Hyderabad applied the Susceptible, Undetected, Tested (positive), and Removed Approach' (SUTRA) model to predict that active cases would go up further by over 10 lakh by mid-May.The latest projection tweaks the time frame as well as the numbers.Last week, the researchers predicted the pandemic may peak between May 11-15 with 33-35 lakh total active cases and decline steeply by the end of May.Earlier this month, their modelling approach projected that active infections in the country would peak by April 15, which didn't come true.“This time, I have also computed minimum and maximum for predicted values and posted it. I am reasonably confident that the actual values will be within the min and max values mentioned,” Maninder Agrawal, professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT-Kanpur, told PTI.On Sunday, Agrawal shared the new peak values for active and new Covid cases in a Twitter thread.“Peak timing: May 14-18 for active infections and May 4-8 for new infections. Peak value: 38-48 lakhs for active infections and 3.4 to 4.4 lakhs for new infections,” he said.He also noted that it was not clear what the final values would be.“I have now computed a range of values for peak value and timing and the final numbers should be within this range,” Agrawal said in another tweet.Explaining the changing projections of the model over time, Agrawal said, “The primary reason is that there is a continuous slow drift in parameter values of current phase for India. This makes the guess of the right values difficult. That is causing a slow change in predictions.”The scientists in the as yet unpublished study said there are several novel features in the SUTRA model.Whereas previous papers divided the patient population into asymptomatic and Infected, the new model also accounts for the fact that some fraction of asymptomatic patients could also be detected due to contact tracing and other such protocols.The IIT Kanpur professor noted that the SUTRA model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the pandemic.The first is called beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-nought value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads the virus to over the course of their infection, Agrawal explained.The other two parameters are ‘reach', which is a measure of the exposure level of the population to the pandemic, and ‘epsilon' which is the ratio of detected and undetected cases.Independent calculations by Gautam Menon and his team at Ashoka University in Haryana had predicted that the peak of the ongoing wave of infections could be between mid-April and mid-May.Menon also cautioned that such projections of Covid-19 cases should really be trusted only in the short term.Any excessively precise prediction, of a peak within just a five-day window would ignore the many uncertainties associated with the inputs to any such calculation, Menon, who was not involved in the modelling, had told PTI earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-scientists-predict-india-s-covid-19-active-caseload-likely-to-peak-at-38-48-lakhs-in-midmay-101619498786123.html

Health ministry’s graphic explains||Following Covid-appropriate behaviour, using non-medical interventions such as wearing a face mask, face cover and maintaining a minimum of six-feet distance, can significantly reduce the risk of transmission of the coronavirus from an infected person, a graphic shared by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday showed.Taking to Twitter, the ministry tweeted the graphic with the text “Follow Covid appropriate behaviour to lower the risk of transmission.” The image showed the varying levels of risk of an uninfected person contracting the virus from those already infected, with the highest chance of transmission being 90% risk when no distance is maintained and no face masks or covers are used.#Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/00nlbyuajiHowever, the chance of transmission remains the lowest with negligible risk when a facemask and cover is worn and a minimum of six-feet distance is maintained from the patient, the image showed.The graphic also highlighted that discarding the distancing rule, despite both the infected and the uninfected wearing a face mask and cover, posed a 1.5% risk with a low chance of transmission of the virus. Also, when the uninfected person is without a mask and within six feet of an infected person, the risk increases to 5% with a medium chance of transmission, even if the infected person is masked, the graphic showed.Also read | Flight from UK carrying vital medical supplies lands in IndiaIn the advisory, the health ministry red-flagged two conditions which posed a bigger risk with higher chances of transmission. When an infected person is not wearing a mask, the risk increases to 30% with a high chance of transmission within six-feet distance, in spite of the other person wearing a mask.The highest chance of transmission is possible when all such safety measures are discarded and both the infected and uninfected do not wear a mask or a face cover and are within six feet distance of each other. The risk increases to 90% in this case, the image showed.The advisory from the ministry comes at a time when the country is reeling under the second wave of the pandemic.

27-04-2021||India||France joins global call to help India, to send medical equipment||France is the latest country to join the global call for support to India India ride out the crisis of coronavirus pandemic that has destabilised the country’s healthcare mechanism.The French government late on Sunday said that President Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron has requested the country’s ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs to mobilise a solidarity operation to support India ride out the crisis of coronavirus pandemic with the help of the French embassy in India.ALSO READ: Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe statement released by the French ministry said the operation will air and sea support to deliver 8 oxygen concentrators, containers of liquid oxygen, specialized medical equipment including 28 respirators and 200 electric syringe pumps among others.The call for support comes at a time when India is facing an acute crisis of medical oxygen as state governments and hospitals scramble for oxygen for thousands of critical patients across the country.ALSO READ: Why India is facing an oxygen crisis as Covid-19 cases mountFrance said the oxygen concentrators that it will provide can provide a hospital with oxygen autonomy for a dozen years. “These units are permanent fixtures that can produce medical oxygen from the oxygen present in the air. Each one can continuously supply a 250-bed hospital. The system’s flow rate is sufficient for 15 intubated Covid patients in a resuscitation care unit (or 30 patients in conventional intensive care) or 150 patients requiring oxygen in a conventional hospital setting. Also included are devices to refill oxygen cylinders,” a statement released by French ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs read.It further said that in response to needs expressed by Indian officials the equipment is designed to respond to the emergency but also to boost the capacity of Indian hospitals over the long term to treat patients and fight the pandemic.“France and India have always stood together in solidarity at difficult times. This solidarity lies at the heart of our strategic partnership and the friendship between the French and Indian people,” the release read.Close allies United States, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have come forward to support India’s fight against Covid-19 pandemic with Washington asking its nearest bases to air-lift oxygen generators, concentrators, Remdesivir anti-viral drug and raw materials for vaccine in the next 48 hours. On Monday, US President Joe Biden took to Twitter to say that his administration is determined for India to tide over the crisis of coronavirusUAE is sending a huge shipment of oxygen concentrators and Saudi Arabia large number of oxygen generators to India.Medical support to India has started to come from countries like Denmark, Singapore Israel and some other EU nations in reciprocation to New Delhi’s solidarity for the world when it stood firm with the democratic world in supply of much-needed drugs and vaccine.Under its ‘vaccine maitri’ initiative, India supplied much-needed drugs in the form of grants as well as on commercial basis. Since the Covid-19 pandemic started last year, India supplied hydroxychloroquine to the US and Europe with the total number of countries touching 150. India supplied 6.5 crore vaccine doses to 93 countries in Asia, Latin America and African countries apart from UK.India's Covid-19 crisis continued unabated as the country reported over 300,000 new infections of the disease for the fifth straight day on Monday.

27-04-2021||India||Madras high court blames Election Commission for surge in Covid cases||The Madras high court on Monday observed that the Election Commission of India (ECI) was responsible for the second wave in the country and that its officials should probably be tried on murder charges for allowing political parties to hold massive rallies without following Covid-19 norms.The first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy warned ECI that the court could even stall the counting of votes on May 2 unless it produced a blueprint on April 30 on Covid-19 protocol at counting centres. “At no cost can counting result as a catalyst for a further surge, politics or no politics, whether the counting takes place in a staggered manner or is deferred,” the court said.An official familiar with the functioning of ECI said that the poll watchdog has told the high court that according to the Covid-19 rules notified under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) has the responsibility to ensure the rules are followed. “Commission has always emphasised in its 21.8.2020 and all subsequent instructions that the State authorities shall ensure COVID compliance in the matter of public gatherings etc. for campaign purposes. At no occasion, the Commission takes over the task of SDMA for enforcement of COVID-19 instructions,” it told the high court, according to official who did not want to be named.“The campaign [for Tamil Nadu] ended on 4.4.2021. Fortunately, the second wave of COVID-19 was yet to be visible fully by that time. Polling was conducted following all prescribed COVID appropriate measures on 6.4.2021, which witnessed good electoral participation with full compliance of norms by all concerned,” the commission told the high court, the officials said.The election commission has come under criticism for its decision to allow political parties to wilfully flout Covid-19 protocol through huge rallies, with most participants, including the political leaders unmasked. The body has, from time to time, issued guidelines reiterating the importance of adhering to Covid-19 protocol but has steered well clear of acting against any leader or party for flouting these. ECI has also come under fire for staggering the West Bengal assembly elections across eight phases, and for making no effort to combine later phases even after it became clear that India was facing a serious health crisis.“When campaigning was on going in Tamil Nadu, we did not have so many cases and polling also ended before cases began to rise,” said Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) spokesperson A Saravanan. “Perhaps ECI could have imposed certain curbs. Except for the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], all parties in Bengal asked for the last phases to be clubbed. Until Modi cancelled his rallies, ECI didn’t bring in restrictions and by then cases had exponentially risen.”West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee welcomed the Madras high court observations “which clearly said ECI cannot escape its responsibility”. “Both Prime Minister Modi and EC are responsible for the (current) situation (of Covid spreading in the state),” Banerjee alleged at a workers meeting in North Kolkata on Monday.The HC order was passed during a hearing on a writ petition filed by Tamil Nadu transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar seeking a direction for safety measures and fairness during counting in Karur constituency from where he is contesting.“You are the only institution that is singularly responsible for the situation today,” the chief justice said during the hearing. “No action against political parties taking rallies despite court orders. Your election commission officials should be put up on murder charges probably.”In its order copy released later in the day, the court had toned down its observations against the election body as the statement on murder charges wasn’t part of the written order.The bench noted that face masks, sanitizers weren’t used and no social distancing was maintained during election campaigning. “Were you on another planet when the election rallies were held?” the chief justice asked the ECI counsel, Niranjan Rajagoapalan.Stating that public health is of paramount importance, the court said, “It is only when a citizen survives that he’ll be able to enjoy the rights that a democratic republic guarantees.” The court directed ECI to file a blueprint after a detailed consultation with the state health secretary.Assembly elections were held in four states- Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, West Bengal and the union territory of Puducherry . Except for Bengal, elections have concluded in other states. All these states are seeing a surge in cases, but so is almost every part of India.India ended Monday with 319,509 news cases of Covid-19 and 2,764 new deaths, taking its totally tally to 17,625,626 cases and 197,901 deaths. Daily cases have risen over 400% since April 1, and daily deaths, over 600%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-blames-election-commission-for-surge-in-covid-cases-101619488095052.html
27-04-2021||India||Biden pledges US help for India’s Covid fight||US President Joe Biden on Monday pledged his support for India’s Covid-19 response through emergency assistance such as ventilators and vaccine raw materials, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the importance of ensuring “smooth and open supply chains”.These matters figured in a phone conversation between the two leaders, a day after the US announced it would supply raw materials urgently needed for making the Covishield vaccine and oxygen generation equipment to bolster India’s efforts to counter a second wave of record-breaking Covid-19 cases.Shortly after the conversation, US surgeon general Vivek Murthy announced a plan to share America’s stock of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines with the world. Murthy said in a tweet that 60 million doses will be shared “as they become available” but didn’t give details.US lawmakers and experts had called on the Biden administration to do more to support India, which set a global record for the rise in infections for the fifth consecutive day on Monday, with 352,991 new cases reported since Sunday. The US has also faced criticism from some quarters for what was perceived as a lethargic response to the crisis in India.According to a readout from the White House, Biden “pledged America’s steadfast support for the people of India who have been impacted by the recent surge in Covid-19 cases”. The US is providing a “range of emergency assistance, including oxygen-related supplies, vaccine materials, and therapeutics”, it said.Modi emphasised the “need to ensure smooth and open supply chains of raw materials and inputs required for manufacture of vaccines, medicines, and therapeutics”, said a statement from the Indian side.Experts believe India will be among the countries to immediately benefit from the US plan to share its stocks of AstraZeneca vaccine, which is made under licence by the Serum Institute of India and is one of the two shots rolled out for India’s immunisation programme. The AstraZeneca shot isn’t approved for use in the US and the Biden administration had faced immense global pressure for not taking a call on sharing its stockpile.The US will begin sharing the AstraZeneca vaccine once it clears federal safety reviews, and doses are expected to be available for export in the coming months, the White House told The Associated Press.“Given the strong portfolio of vaccines that the US already has and that have been authorised by the FDA, and given that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorised for use in the US, we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next several months,” said White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients.Zients said the process of safety reviews could be completed in the next several weeks. About 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have already been produced and another 50 million doses could be available to ship in May and June.Modi described his conversation with Biden as fruitful and tweeted: “We discussed the evolving COVID situation in both countries in detail. I thanked President Biden for the support being provided by the United States to India.”He also tweeted that he had “underscored the importance of smooth and efficient supply chains of vaccine raw materials” at a time when the India-US health care partnership “can address the global challenge of Covid-19”.Modi briefed Biden on India’s efforts to contain the second wave of Covid-19 infections through expedited vaccination efforts and ensuring the supply of critical medicines, therapeutics and health care equipment.Biden said the US is “determined to support India’s efforts by quickly deploying resources such as therapeutics, ventilators and identifying sources of raw materials to be made available for the manufacture of Covishield vaccines”, the Indian statement said.Since February, the Indian side has urged the US to ease curbs imposed on exports of vaccine raw materials after the Biden administration invoked the Defense Production Act, which requires American suppliers to prioritise orders from American buyers. This was done in line with Biden’s plans to vaccinate all Americans by the end of May.However, as Covid-19 cases spiked in India, there were growing calls in both countries for the export curbs to be eased so that Indian manufacturers could ramp up the production of vaccines.The White House readout further said the two leaders resolved that the US and India will “stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the effort to protect our citizens”. The Indian statement said Modi mentioned India’s commitment to contain the pandemic globally through the Vaccine Maitri initiative and participation in the COVAX and the Quad vaccine initiatives.Modi also raised with Biden India’s initiative at the WTO for relaxing norms under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries.Meanwhile, a key American official said on Monday the US is diverting its own “pending orders” of vaccine raw materials to help India and that earlier supply bottlenecks were not the result of an export ban.Tim Manning, the White House Covid-19 supply coordinator, explained an issue that made the Biden administration look egregiously insensitive to the crisis in India and said the Defense Production Act “doesn’t even mean a ‘de facto’ ban”.“Now here’s what we did yesterday: we diverted our pending orders of vaccine filters to India’s vaccine manufacturing effort. This will help India make more vaccine,” Manning said.Manning set up his argument in the context of an unprecedented demand in vaccines globally, going up from four billion a year, mainly for flu and measles, to 14 billion because of the Covid-19 epidemic, and this strained the global supply chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biden-pledges-us-help-for-india-s-covid-fight-101619474795324.html

Even in these times of curfew, he pedals about this south Delhi neighbourhood, collecting empty bottles and boxes from the pavements, and selling them to a recycler.“I’m also a spice seller.”Before the city shut down in the most recent Covid-ridden crisis, Mr Fazil would pedal all the way to the famous spice market in Old Delhi’s Khari Baoli to get the masalas, which he would hawk in little sachets in south Delhi localities. “My spice trade has stopped for the time,” he says, shrugging his shoulders, as if implying he has surrendered to events beyond his control.But that’s not the thing worrying him for the moment. “My family in Rampur—my wife and daughters—I haven’t been able to send them money for weeks.”Until a month back, Mr Fazil would be able to earn ₹500 daily, “but now I’m lucky if I can make even ₹100.”He notes that things were never this bad—“Good people would sometimes help me with cash... but now nobody wants to help.” Everybody is concerned for their own emergencies, he explains.“I have six daughters... four are still to be married,” he says, giving a nervous chuckle.Working in Delhi since 1979, Mr Fazil lives alone. “These days I wake up early in the morning because I’m keeping roza (Ramzan fast).” He cycles around the area, returning to his single-room home in the evening in time for prayers and for iftar, when the fast ends. “Then I cook dal roti.” Not knowing when his life might return to old certainties, he hesitantly confesses that “my family is surviving by God’s generosity... but for how long?”Although he is wearing a mask, isn’t he scared of venturing outside, and catching the virus?Mr Fazil looks on blankly, and says after a long pause—“who knows what will happen tomorrow?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-surge-era-portrait-101619485849891.html
27-04-2021||India||A tenure that withered on the vine||Justice SA Bobde is perhaps the only Chief Justice of India in the country’s judicial history who gave a clean chit to his predecessor as well as his successor. Leading an in-house inquiry as the second senior-most judge in the court, cleared former CJI Ranjan Gogoi in a case of sexual harassment; then, as CJI, he cleared the decks for justice NV Ramana by shutting a complaint of alleged impropriety against the latter from Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Both the inquiries were conducted with utmost secrecy by an institution that otherwise preaches transparency and decries conflict of interest.However, there are more than one reason why justice Bobde’s tenure reflects peculiarity. His 17-month tenure, most part of which was spent conducting proceedings through video-conferencing, was marked by justice Bobde’s idiosyncrasies instead of an institutional response. This was a man who made the headlines, repeatedly, for his utterances; the following day was usually spent clarifying what had been said or contradicting the older statements. In March, he asked a government employee seeking protection from arrest in a rape case if he was willing to marry the survivor? A week later, justice Bobde blamed the incident on “misreporting” and said he had highest respect for women. Similarly, in a hearing earlier this month, justice Bobde commented on how some women lawyers had turned down offers to become judges because of familial responsibilities and education of their children. Two days later, the CJI was yet again clarifying that he did not mean all women lawyers had declined to become judges because of family issues.Two days before his retirement, justice Bobde’s bench took suo motu cognisance of the crisis triggered by the second Covid-19 wave, and decided to monitor the equitable distribution of medical supplies. The move was contentious because at least seven high courts were already supervising these issues in their jurisdiction, keeping the Centre and state governments on their toes. Justice Bobde, in his distinctive style, once again remarked that the Supreme Court would consider transferring all the cases from the high courts to itself – something that the Union government said was the proper course of action. Justice Bobde appointed senior advocate Harish Salve as the amicus curiae to assist the court even though Salve represented Vedanta, which wanted its controversial shuttered plant in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi reopened for producing oxygen. A massive controversy erupted with several senior lawyers raising questions if this was an attempt to hold the hands of the proactive high courts. On his last working day, justice Bobde was seen not only issuing a clarification about there being no restraint against the high courts but also retiring without hearing this case any further. Salve withdrew as amicus in the wake of the disputations over his possible conflict of interest.The issues that arose out of justice Bobde’s personal traits were sometimes compounded by a lack of judicial determinateness and decisiveness by the benches he headed, leaving very little as his legacy as a Supreme Court judge. He headed the benches which were seized of some of the most important cases of the times, including validity of statutes, such as the three farm laws, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and the constitutional amendment providing for quota for economically weaker section; the Sabarimala case which was expanded to include various other religions and their practices; the definition of a “money bill”; the validity of electoral bonds; the deportation of Rohingya refugees; and the handling of the migrants’ crisis during the lockdown last year. Not one of these cases attained finality. Interim orders passed in some of these matters simply meant more delays in long-pending cases, often without good reason.Meanwhile, cases of constitutional importance were put on the back burner. An argument can be made that constitutional matters involve at least five judges, a battery of lawyers, and a lot of paperwork, making them infeasible once the top court shifted to virtual hearings. However, it is pertinent to underscore that CJI Bobde did set up a five-judge bench when he decided in April to issue guidelines for cheque-bounce cases in a suo motu matter. Another five-judge bench also heard on a day-to-day basis and reserved its verdict in the Maratha reservation case in March this year. Moreover, most of the benches in the apex court did not sit for full hours, till 4pm on several days during the pandemic. Experts have pointed out that matters of constitutional import, if not decided immediately when they are topical and impact citizenry of the country, run the risk of becoming an academic exercise in adjudication, and may well benefit the executive.Justice Bobde’s inclination towards constitution of committees and commissions in various matters also appeared to be symptomatic of a reluctance to close matters. He formed panels in cases on farm laws, the Hyderabad and Vikas Dubey encounters, environment and wildlife-related matters such as monetary valuation of a tree, protection of rare species of birds and the undergrounding of high-tension wires, and the water dispute between Delhi and Haryana. Some panels have submitted their reports, and others are yet to express their views.Interestingly, justice Bobde launched parallel proceedings in several cases that the jurisdictional high courts were already looking into, causing some amount of consternation in legal circles. At the moment, both the Supreme Court and the Allahabad high court are seized of challenges to Uttar Pradesh government’s anti-conversion law. Despite being informed that the high court was examining the validity of the law, justice Bobde neither left it to the high court to decide nor transferred all the cases to the apex court. Similarly, justice Bobde agreed to examine the new user privacy policy of WhatsApp while the Delhi high court was already hearing the same. In the Hathras case, even after the Allahabad high court took suo motu notice, justice Bobde admitted the matter, asked the UP government to clarify certain aspects, observing: “We want to widen the high court proceedings and make it more relevant.” However, in less than a month, he had a change of heart and his bench acknowledged that the matter was already being examined by the high court. It finally referred everything back to the high court.The tenure of justice Bobde will also be remembered for another unlikely distinction. He is the first CJI in judicial history who has retired without making recommendation for a single appointment in the top court after the advent of the collegium system in 1990s. Even during an unprecedented standoff between the judiciary and the central government over the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) that aimed to redefine the appointment process, the then CJI, HL Dattu, made one appointment. But justice Bobde was unable to do this. When he retired last week, the top court had only one woman judge. The failure was indicative of a lack of cohesion and understanding between justice Bobde and other judges in the collegium.The shortage of judges across the high courts also rose to a new high with around 40% positions being vacant during his tenure. But as the first judge of the country and guardian of judiciary, justice Bobde’s endeavours fell way short of nudging the high court chief justices into sending proposals for appointments, resulting in a situation where there are no names for consideration for at least 200 positions of high court judges.Having not been able to do much on the administrative side, justice Bobde, however, did try to deal with the issue of pendency of cases and shortage of judges on the judicial side. His bench paved way for the high courts to appoint ad hoc judges to deal with old cases but with an array of stipulations and limitations. The order made the entire process cumbersome and conditional on several factors instead of letting each high court devise its own formula, based on its own needs. Similarly, his bench sought to fix a timeline for the government to clear the appointment of judges to the high courts, but did not prescribe any schedule for the high courts to send names , which is the first and the most important step in the entire process. He also delivered a judgment in the Tata Vs Cyrus Mistry case, ruling in favour of the former while rendering a contentious jurisprudence on the rights of minority shareholders.Justice Bobde’s tenure came across opportunities to affirm the supremacy of judiciary by making the executive accountable and by deciding issues of seminal importance that mattered the most to the citizens at a particular point in time. Most remain unresolved, though, and CJI Ramana may have to start from scratch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-sa-bobde-a-tenure-that-withered-on-the-vine-101619480203818.html
27-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India will likely cross a total of 200,000 reported deaths on account of the coronavirus disease on Tuesday. In the absence of standardised death data — the number of people who can be expected to die in a region in a certain length of time; and ideally, this should be a long period average that takes into account various population metrics — there is no way to accurately arrive at a so-called excess death number for the entire country.The only way to do this is to assume other parameters; for instance, some models doing the rounds assume the degree of under-reporting and estimate the number of deaths. A better approach may be to make two assumptions: one, the infection fatality rate for Covid-19, the proportion of people dying to those infected; and two, the proportion of cases unreported or undiagnosed for every recorded Covid-19 case. The second could be one in 10, 15, maybe even 20 or 25; and the first, based on what we know of other viral diseases in general, 0.1% (conservatively). I’ll leave the math to readers interested enough to work it out because this is a hypothetical exercise, although it is evident from HT’s own ground reporting, and that of other media, that there is a discrepancy between the claimed death numbers appearing against each state in the HT dashboard (this is sourced from the state health departments), and the number of Covid-19 cremations and burials taking place every day.Most models expect the situation to stabilise by the third week of May, but there’s no telling. The positivity rates of many states are at a level where a sharp fall is next to impossible (and will possibly suggest manipulation); and some states (notably Maharashtra) saw their positivity rates plateau at a relatively high level during the first wave of the pandemic in India. Given that, it is likely that cases and deaths will continue to rise. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of the deaths are being caused by factors such as lack of oxygen or ventilators, which is only to be expected as the health system across many parts of the country gets overwhelmed by cases; this also means that once supply and distribution of oxygen is enhanced (an effort that is already underway, and is expected to be completed by the end of the week), the number of deaths should start declining. Oxygen has emerged as a key constraint in India’s ability to deal with the second wave — and this is important to remember as the country prepares for the third wave, which will break at some point.Vaccines hold the key to helping crush the second wave and lower the intensity of the third — but there are a lot of gaps in what we know about their supply and availability.There is a complete lack of clarity on the number of vaccine doses that will be available in the domestic market (for the Centre, states, and private buyers) over the rest of the year from the two large domestic manufacturers, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, after these companies meet their contractual export commitments. There is an equal lack of clarity on the number of Sputnik V doses that will be available (as import at first and from local manufacturing subsequently). What is clear, based on the incomplete numbers that are in the public domain, is that India will fall well short of its requirement. Indeed, with the third phase of vaccination set to start from May 1, there is still no visibility on when the states that have placed orders will start receiving vaccine doses.We need data on availability, and timing. And we desperately need a comprehensive vaccine strategy that prioritises first doses (in the case of Covishield, which accounts for almost 90% of the vaccine doses administered so far) over complete vaccination so as to protect as many people as possible from the pandemic. If that is done over the next six weeks, India can crush the second wave. And be ready for the third.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101619478174078.html
27-04-2021||India||Ahead of phase 3, states divided over vaccine stocks, availability||Multiple states have said that they may not be able to begin coronavirus vaccinations for all adults from May 1, while some others said they will use the stocks at hand and hope for replenishments from the companies or through the central government as they go along, shrouding the third phase of the drive in confusion since large numbers of people also become due for their second doses soon.India’s Covid-19 vaccination programme has significantly slowed down in recent days as outbreaks expand across the country, triggering restrictions and reluctance among people. In the last week, 2.6 million doses were administered in a day on average, which is a 38% drop from the peak daily vaccination rate of 4.1 million doses on average during the week ending April 21.Officials in at least two states – Rajasthan and Punjab – said they will not be able to open up vaccinations for all aged 18 and above from May 1, while Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka said they will roll-out the expansion with the stocks they have at present but were hoping more doses come in later in the month.Officials in Bengal, where assembly election results are to be declared on May 2, said they will likely begin 18+ vaccinations from May 5 but need more stocks. “Existing stock is dwindling. Only 5-7 lakh doses are left in Bengal so to carry out universal vaccination, we need fresh stock,” said a Bengal health department official, asking not to be named.In Rajasthan, an official said the target launch date is now May 10. “The state is facing shortage of vaccines and is asking the Union government for bulk stock. The shortage has forced the drive to be halted at several places,” said an official, who asked not to be named. This person added that the state has placed direct orders for 37.5 million doses, though delivery timelines were not immediately clear.Last week, on April 19, the Union government announced it will allow direct sales of coronavirus vaccine to states and private hospitals, who were free to give it to anyone above the age of 17, accepting a long-standing demand to open the drive up.Experts say rapid, universal immunisation may be the only way for India to emerge out of the current crisis, since sustained lockdowns are economically damaging.But the plan has been mired in confusion about procurement as well as pricing. States will need to negotiate deliveries and purchase the doses on their own and their share is likely to be from within a kitty of half of what India-based vaccine makers produced, which will also be shared by private hospitals.The rest will go the Union government, which will continue the free vaccination programme for people above the age of 45 at centres to which it delivers. Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech (the makers of Covishield and Covaxin) drawing criticism for different pricing for centre, states and private outlets.Several states have announced they will make vaccines free for people between the age of 18 and 44. Officials in Maharashtra, which was the first to make such an announcement, said on Monday the state is unlikely to roll the drive out for those in the 18-44 age category in a big way owing to challenges related to supply and lack of clarity on whether it would provide free vaccines to all.A day after Maharashtra ministers announced the government will provide free vaccines to beneficiaries over age 18, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said that it may not be possible, adding that the department will move a proposal to provide free vaccine jabs to the poor only.In Delhi, which too will offer free doses for all adults at state government-run centres and announced it had placed an order for 13.4 million doses, an official said the expansion will begin with the existing stocks and orders are being place for more, which will likely arrive at least two weeks later.Tamil Nadu, which too said it will sponsor doses for all adults, said it will begin with existing stocks, possibly from May 1. “We are preparing to vaccinate everyone above 18 from May 1,” said Tamil Nadu health minister C Vijayabaskar. “Chief minister will make an important announcement tomorrow on how we will go about this so it won’t be right if I speak on [procurement] now,” he said, while adding that the priority is to give the second doses to eligible people.The state is yet to place orders directly with the manufacturers.In Punjab, where chief minister Amarinder Singh said on Sunday that the expansion is unlikely to be possible till May 15, officials said on Monday that direct orders are yet to be finalised.Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Husan Lal, said the state government has ordered three million doses of Covishield, but “SII is yet to respond on the schedule of delivery. We are prepared for the roll-out provided we have the enough doses of vaccinations”.KV Trilok Chandra, Karnataka’s commissioner for health, family welfare, said the state will begin offering doses to all adults from May 1, and had placed an order for 10 million doses of Covishield. “Delivery schedule is awaited. Hopefully we will get replenished,” he added.Union government officials said on Monday that state governments will have to directly procure vaccines from manufacturers, whether domestic or foreign. From May 1, the Centre will not get into procurements, including imports, beyond their 50% quota, a senior official familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named.Experts said this could create complications due to the different pricing announced by SII and Bharat Biotech, which offer the cheapest rate to the Union government, citing bulk orders. “There should be same charges for central and state governments,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-phase-3-states-divided-over-vaccine-stocks-availability-101619474782481.html
27-04-2021||India||States may have to directly purchase doses for phase 3 drive||State governments will have to directly procure coronavirus vaccines from domestic or foreign manufacturers to give doses to people in the 18-44 age group when they become eligible from May 1, senior officials aware of the matter said, while adding that the centre will not get into procurements, including imports, beyond their 50% quota.Even though both the Indian vaccine manufacturers that have been granted emergency use authorisation – Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India -- have declared the price at which they will sell their vaccines to states, state governments are free to further negotiate and explore procurement options for foreign made vaccines, these people said.The foreign manufacturers in the fray are Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, with Johnson & Johnson having already applied to DCGI for bridging studies in India for its Covid-19 vaccine.“The cost of vaccination depends entirely on the rate at which the state government procures the vaccines. We have been given to understand that some state governments have already begun negotiations with vaccine manufacturers. The same logic applies for cost of vaccination at central government run hospitals; once state governments procure, they can provide such doses for vaccination to their hospitals or, and, to central government hospitals,” said a senior health ministry official aware of the matter, who did not want to be identified.Another official said, on condition of anonymity, “The states are free to go for foreign made vaccines also provided the vaccine is imported as per the government of India guidelines. Usually, a foreign made vaccine is imported through their local distributers. Foreign manufacturers get in to local tie-ups.”Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, for example, has a tie-up with the Russian Direct Investment Fund for importing and distributing the Russia-made Sputnik V vaccine. Sputnik V is the first foreign made vaccine that has been granted emergency use authorisation by the Drugs Controller General of India, Dr VG Somani.If states are able to better negotiate the price, in effect, it would mean the cost of vaccination for people in the 18-44 age group could come down further. Some states have already announced that they will be providing the vaccine for free. The cost for vaccinating those 45 and above will continue to be free under the Union government’s vaccination programme.So far, 17 states including Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Tamil Nadu have decided to vaccinate their population for free.The Indian manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines – at present this includes SII and Bharat Biotech – will need to keep at least 50% of their doses for the Union government while the rest can be sold to states or private hospitalsSII announced a prices of ₹400 for state governments and ₹600 for private hospitals/institutions, while Bharat Biotech’s quoted a price of ₹600 for state governments and ₹1200 for private hospitals and institutions.As some states showed apprehensions regarding the high cost, the central government asked the manufacturers if they could reduce the selling price, one of the officials said. “It was always demanded that the prices be kept reasonable, and if some states are feeling it is expensive then they should consider bringing it down further,” said the second official cited above.Experts, however, say that given the Covid-19 surge in the country, India needs to vaccinate its people faster.“It is very important that the vaccination pace is increased. However, the impact on second wave is minimal and it will mostly be beneficial in reducing mortality in subsequent waves,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-may-have-to-directly-purchase-doses-for-phase-3-drive-101619474776203.html
27-04-2021||India||Tamil Nadu allows Vedanta to temporarily reopen, company opposes operation of oxygen plant by govt||Tamil Nadu on Monday granted temporary permission to a shuttered copper plant in Thoothukudi to reopen for medical oxygen production for four months, almost three years after the facility was closed over pollution concerns after the deaths of 13 protesters in police firing.Hours later, Vedanta Industries, the plant’s owner, opposed the Supreme Court’s suggestion to let the Tamil Nadu government operate the oxygen producing unit at the plant, saying “it is just beyond the competency and financial ability of the government to run this oxygen plant.” The next hearing in the case is on Tuesday.Last week, Vedanta moved the Supreme Court for permission to operate its oxygen producing unit at the Thoothukudi’s Sterlite copper plant, which was shut down in May 2018, citing dire oxygen shortages across the country dealing with surging Covid-19 infections. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant. The Supreme Court also rejected requests to reopen the plant for a trial run on January 22 this year..To be sure, the Tamil Nadu government order didn’t mention that the administration will run the plant but mentioned that a government committee, including civil society members, will be set up to oversee the plant’s functioning.Submitting its affidavit in the apex court, Vedanta said the oxygen plant must be operated by its own team, under possible supervision of a central government’s expert body such as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF).“The running of the oxygen plant by the state government is likely to pose grave danger not only to the assets but to the personnel deployed for operation, as the operation critically involves the operation of high-pressure vessels, heavy duty compressors, high voltage equipment and proprietary control systems. There is a high probability that if untrained personnel were to operate the oxygen plant, the quality of oxygen produced can be substandard and may not be safe for use,” stated its affidavit in the top court.The Tamil Nadu government decision came after an all-party meeting passed a unanimous resolution that set five rules: only the oxygen unit will function, not the copper smelter; preference for oxygen will be Tamil Nadu; a supervising committee under the district collector, superintendent of police, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, two state officials knowledgeable in oxygen production along with civil society, non-governmental organisations and anti-Sterlite protestors, will be formed ; admission passes will be given to workers operating the oxygen unit; and the state will provide security and supply electricity for four weeks, or howsoever long the plant functions, depending on oxygen needs.“This is only a temporary permission and attempts shouldn’t be made to turn this into a permanent permission to produce oxygen or to reopen the facility,” Thoothukudi MP K Kanimozhi who was present at the meeting told the media.The meeting led by chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami was attended by representatives from eight political parties including the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress, Left and other regional parties.The copper unit was sealed by the state government in May 2018, days after 13 agitators were killed in police firing during a violent protest against pollution caused by the facility in the southern district.Reopening of the plant continues to be a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu as local residents and activists fear that the company is attempting to gain back-door entry. “This polluting company made it hard for us to breathe and now they want to help in oxygen production? It seems suspicious to us and we will never accept for it to be reopened,” said S Gunaseelan, an anti-Sterlite activist in Thoothukudi.In the top court last week, Vedanta’s plea was opposed by the Tamil Nadu government, citing law and order and local residents’ anger towards the company.The state’s resistance had prompted the court to asks the Tamil Nadu government if it was willing to operate the plant on its own. “When people are dying, can a state say we will still not run it because there could be law and order problems or that Vedanta did this and that? We are not on who will produce. Let Tamil Nadu government produce it if they have a problem with Vedanta,” it had asked the state.In its response, Vedanta maintained that its oxygen plant had a capacity of 1050 MT per day and that this plant is a non-polluting unit which can be operated without touching the copper smelter.“The only intent of the petitioner in running the oxygen plant is to initiate the production within 7-14 days, in order to cater to states, which are in need of oxygen supply for treating the Covid patients... Further, the petitioner undertakes that it will not carry out any kind of production activities apart from the production of oxygen under the directions of this Hon’ble Court,” said Vedanta.It stated that the state government did not have the requisite expertise or personnel for the maintenance and operation of the oxygen plant and that in view of the national emergency triggered by the surge in infection, the Tamil Nadu government must fulfil its sacrosanct responsibility of maintaining law and order.Separately, during a suo motu hearing on the health infrastructure of Tamil Nadu to manage Covid-19, the state informed Madras high court that only limited supply of liquefied oxygen may be initially available through the Sterlite plant in Thoothukudi. “But the owners have assured the state that immediate measures would be taken to put in place a system by which gaseous oxygen will be converted into liquefied oxygen for medical use with the appropriate content in excess of 99% oxygen,” the order copy of the case read. The high court didn’t delve into the matter further as it is being dealt with by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-allows-vedanta-to-temporarily-reopen-company-opposes-operation-of-oxygen-plant-by-govt-101619474701186.html
27-04-2021||India||UK and South African virus variants present in Kerala, says Vijayan||Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said that the presence of deadly Covid-19 mutant strains of the United Kingdom and South Africa are confirmed in the state.Talking to media persons in the state capital, Vijayan said preliminary studies have found that mutant strains fanned the second wave in the state. “Among the new patients, at least 40% are infected with the mutated variants. Of these 30% are UK variant and 7% with double mutants and 2% with South African variant,” he said. He said experts would divulge more on this issue in the coming days.“Detection of UK and African variants calls for stricter restrictions. The situation is really critical. We don’t want to create panic but people will have to be extra vigilant. We are going through a bad phase. Now experts have advised people to wear double masks in public places to avoid fast infection,” he said.The CM said vigil has been stepped up in areas where mutant strains were reported.Last week the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in Thiruvananthapuram had done an extensive study on the spike protein of the virus with the help of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi. Going by the rapid spread and nature of the second wave, experts have earlier warned about presence of strong mutants.Earlier in the day, the CM chaired an all-party meeting which decided not to enforce a complete lockdown but partial closure in weekends to be continued and restrictions in containment areas to be tightened.The meeting has also decided not to hold victory processions or rallies on vote counting day on May 2_when assembly election results will be out. Almost all political parties have agreed that a complete lockdown will affect people who are already reeling under the impact of the pandemic.“Mini lockdown will continue in the weekend for the time being. Shops and business establishments will be allowed to open till 7.30pm. Bars and malls will be shut. We will tighten measures in containment zones and effective policing will be there,” said the CM adding it is the duty of respective political parties to ensure that big victory rallies or processions don’t take place on the counting day.As cases rise alarmingly the core committee on pandemic had earlier recommended two-week lockdown but the all-party meet felt that complete closure and curfew will impact people badly and it will affect their livelihood.Kerala on Monday reported 21,890 new cases with a high positivity rate of 22.71%.In terms of daily caseload, Kerala is on the third spot with 21, 890 cases and active cases have also risen to 2,31,812. Out of 96,378 people tested, 21,980 were tested positive, according to the data released by the state health ministry. The state has also reported 28 fatalities taking the toll to 5,138. Among the infected are 70 health workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-and-south-african-virus-variants-present-in-kerala-says-vijayan-101619474691205.html

Modi thanked Suga for providing aid to India to combat the pandemic, and expressed the hope he would be able to receive the Japanese prime minister in India in the near future after the Covid-19 situation stabilises.Suga recently called off a planned visit to India and the Philippines because of the Covid-19 situation.In January, Japan provided a loan of up to 30 billion yen (about ₹2,129 crore) to support the Indian government’s efforts to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. This was the latest addition to Japan’s support to India in its fight against Covid-19.Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Japan has provided a 50-billion yen (about ₹3,549 crore) loan to implement health and medical policies and develop hospitals equipped with ICUs and infection prevention and management facilities, a grant of a billion yen (about ₹71 crore) to provide oxygen generators to treat Covid-19 patients in critical condition.Japan has also partnered with international organisations such as UNDP, UNICEF and UNHCR to provide assistance worth more than $7.26 million to the Indian government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-holds-talks-with-japan-pm-on-cooperation-in-covid-19-fight-101619474323300.html
27-04-2021||India||Armed forces to recall retired medics to work in Covid facilities: CDS to PM||Military medical personnel who retired or took premature retirement during the last two years are being recalled to work in Covid facilities near them, chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat told Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a briefing on Monday.This comes at a time when the country is reeling under a public health emergency and its health care resources are stretched to breaking point.Medical officers who retired more than two years ago have also been requested to make their services available for consultation through medical emergency helplines, the PMO said in a statement after the CDS briefed the PM, who reviewed the military’s preparations to assist in Covid management.At a meeting on April 20, defence minister Rajnath Singh asked the military to explore the possibility of utilising the services of vaccinated retired military personnel to help the civil administration and state governments to deal with the Covid crisis.India reported 354,709 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of infections in the country to 17.3 million till Sunday night. A total of 2,808 new deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Sunday, pushing the total number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 195,137, according to the HT Covid-19 dashboard.The CDS told the PM that all medical officers on staff appointments at Command HQ, Corps HQ, Division HQ and similar HQs of the navy and the Indian Air Force will be employed at hospitals.“The CDS informed the PM that nursing personnel are being employed in large numbers to complement the doctors at the hospitals. The PM was also briefed that oxygen cylinders available with armed forces in various establishments will be released for hospitals,” the PMO statement said.The PM reviewed the operations being undertaken by IAF to transport oxygen and other essentials in India and abroad. IAF is making a significant contribution in the fight against Covid by transporting much-needed empty oxygen containers to filling stations across the country to tackle the oxygen crisis.IAF on Monday ferried six empty cryogenic oxygen containers from Dubai to Panagarh in West Bengal in a C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, with the airlift of six more containers from Dubai planned on Tuesday. On Monday, the air force also airlifted two containers from Jaipur to Jamnagar for refilling. The containers will be filled up and transported to different centres for Covid relief by rail or road.Last week, IAF airlifted four such containers from Singapore to Panagarh, apart from carrying out several domestic shuttles. IAF is using a variety of aircraft for Covid relief including C-17, C-130J, IL-76, An-32, Avro, Chinook and Mi-17 helicopters, as previously reported by HT.General Rawat informed the PM that the armed forces are setting up a large number of medical facilities and, wherever possible, military medical infrastructure will be made available to civilians.“The PM also discussed with the CDS that Kendriya and Rajya Sainik Welfare Boards and officers posted in various headquarters in veterans’ cells may be instructed to coordinate the services of veterans to extend the reach to maximum extent possible including in remote areas,” the PMO statement added.The armed forces and other wings of the defence ministry can play an important role in the fight against Covid, Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS), said last week.“They have the manpower, resources and discipline to provide relief in these hard times. The military especially has a culture of quick response, be it enemy action or natural catastrophes. It can do a lot to alleviate the sufferings of our countrymen during the pandemic too,” Chopra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-to-recall-retired-medics-to-work-in-covid-facilities-cds-to-pm-101619470383668.html
27-04-2021||India||France aids India's Covid-19 fight, to send massive oxygen generators, container||France on Tuesday announced a support package for India’s Covid-19 response, including major equipment such as oxygen generators and liquid oxygen containers that will be shipped by air and sea by the end of this week.The solidarity mission, initiated by President Emmanuel Macron, is supported by French companies present in India and the European Union, and aims to respond to both emergency needs and boost long-term resilience of India's healthcare system, French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain said.France has become the second European country after Germany to announce a support package for India, which registered record-breaking Coronavirus infections for the fifth consecutive day on Monday, with 352,991 cases reported in 24 hours. Official data showed the death toll rose to an all-time high of 2,812.The support packages of most countries, including France, are aimed at helping address a severe shortage of oxygen in numerous cities. Experts have blamed many deaths on the lack of oxygen and plants across the country have been hard pressed to meet the growing needs of health facilities.France’s support package will include eight medical oxygen generators, each capable of uninterrupted supply for a 250-bed hospital. The generators can meet the needs of 15 critically ill Covid-19 patients in an ICU, or 30 patients in the ICU of a non-Covid hospital or 150 patients on oxygen therapy in a conventional hospital.The units can make a hospital “autonomous in oxygen supply for approximately 10 years” and are durable installations that produce medical oxygen from ambient air yearlong, the French embassy said in a statement.France will also ship five containers of liquid medical oxygen as a first instalment, each capable of supplying medical oxygen to up to 10,000 patients a day, and specialised medical equipment, including 28 ventilators and 200 electric syringe pumps.The statement said the package is part of the support announced on Sunday by the European Union (EU) under its Civil Protection Mechanism, which helps coordinate the EU’s response to emergencies in Europe and beyond.“France and India have always stood by each other’s side in difficult times. This solidarity is at the core of our strategic partnership and the friendship between the Indian and the French peoples,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-aids-india-s-covid-19-fight-to-send-massive-oxygen-generators-container-101619468597811.html
27-04-2021||India||More offers of oxygen support come in amid Covid-19 challenge in Uttar Pradesh||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday called for doubling the health resources to fight Covid-19 while reiterating that oxygen supply to the state was being augmented from various sources even while the number of active cases under treatment crossed the three-lakh mark with the state recording 33,574 new cases and 249 more deaths, which was the highest single-day fatality count in Uttar Pradesh.At the same time, the total recoveries showed an upward trend, going past the eight-lakh mark with 26,719 more patients being discharged in the last 24 hours statewide, according to official data.The state’s total Covid-19 caseload stands at 11,20,176 now.Dwelling on more help on the oxygen front, the chief minister said the Tata and Reliance groups had offered to supply oxygen to UP.The officers concerned should negotiate with them to speed up the process of supply, he said at the Covid review meeting he held virtually with officials.He also asked for increasing the number of oxygen tankers and seeking help from the central government.He also told the officials to keep a close watch on all Covid-19 hospitals in the state and immediately provide them with oxygen as and when they required it.The chief minister once again noted that oxygen supply was being augmented daily with supplies from Roorkee and Kashipur (Uttarakhand), Modinagar (UP), Bokaro (Jharkhand) and the state’s MSME units.He warned the officers concerned that once the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCCC) allotted a hospital to Covid positive patients, it must be ensured that they find admissions in those hospitals, or else the officers will be held responsible and face action.“Considering the intense transmission rate of the virus this time, there is a need to increase the health resources for Covid-19 at least by double. The health department and the medical education department should prepare a work plan for increasing beds. Now, two more CHCs (community health centres) each should be added to the Covid management list in each district,” he said.Since OPDs (outpatient departments) were closed in hospitals, it was necessary to promote online consultation, publicise the lists of doctors for Covid and non-Covid consultation for the convenience of the people, he added.The chief minister asked the state health minister to monitor the supply of Covid medicine kits to home isolation patients across the state. All Covid patients in home isolation must get the kit containing medicines for at least one week, he said.“Through the CM helpline, the administration must keep in touch with the home isolation patients to track their condition,” he said.He also said many Covid recovered patients wanted to extend a helping hand.“So, encourage such people to come forward, make a list of them. There could be doctors, paramedics etc. Rope them in, they could be deployed at hospitals,” he said.He reiterated that there was no shortage of Remdesivir and other such Covid-19 drugs. Since the state was getting their supply every day, they should be provided free of cost to patients in government hospitals and at concessional rates in private hospitals, he said.Talking about vaccination, he said so far 97,83,416 people had got the first dose of the Covid vaccine and more than 20 lakh had been given both doses. Thus, a total of 1,17,83,880 doses had been administered in the state.“Prepare well for the vaccination drive that is scheduled to begin from May 1,” he said to the officers concerned.Apart from publicising the Covid safety protocols, health specialists should be engaged in spreading awareness about foods that boost immunity and techniques to increase the oxygen level in blood, the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-offers-of-oxygen-support-come-in-amid-covid-19-challenge-in-uttar-pradesh-101619465571346.html
27-04-2021||India||Wear masks at home, Covid-19 now a runaway outbreak: Govt||Covid-19 is now a “runaway outbreak” in several parts of the country, and people may need to wear masks while they are at home, especially if they or someone in the household is infected, a top official said on Monday, as the government urged people to do more to break the chain of transmission.The officials said it is now crucial to reduce the scale of the outbreak since India’s large population means the “health infrastructure will never be enough”.“If there is one positive person at home, it is very important that the infected person wears a mask because he transmits the virus to others. In fact, now it is time, I’d say, that we should anyway wear a mask at home. We used to talk about (wearing a mask) outside but now because the spread is high, and if someone is accidentally infected at home, we should keep a mask on. It will be beneficial,” said VK Paul, member (Health), Niti Aayog, during the government’s weekly briefing on Covid-19.A health ministry official described the scale of outbreak.“We have reiterated it many times, but today it becomes all the more important -- in the light of runaway spread of infection that we find -- in certain regions that Covid-appropriate behavior such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, and wearing a mask is strictly observed,” said Lav agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare.India recorded 319, 509 new cases and 2,764 more people died, according to HT dashboard on Monday.“Almost all the states have currently crossed their highest daily reported cases during previous wave’s peak in September last year, which is a major cause for concern as it overloads our health care delivery system and poses a challenge in clinical management of patients,” said Agarwal.“Given the scale of India’s population, the health infrastructure will never be enough. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent infection to avoid putting undue stress on our health infrastructure. Some states have more than 1 lakh active cases; therefore, our focus will be containment and effective clinical management of these cases. But most important is to observe Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” he added.The official quoted from certain studies to illustrate the gains from social distancing, pointing out that if no distancing measures are followed, one person can infect 406 people in 30 days. But if people reduce exposure by 50%, this number falls to around 15 in the same period.OXYGEN CRISISThe government officials at the briefing also addressed the oxygen crisis in several parts of the country, which in some cases has led to people in critical condition succumbing after the facilities they were in ran out of supply.“India is going through a critical phase as far as second wave is concerned, and for optimal hospital utilisation, there is a need for community participation. The panic is causing more harm than good. As even mild cases rush to a hospital, start medicines that are not required or even have started hoarding oxygen and essential medicines,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.“Oxygen is an important strategy for treating Covid, but misuse is not recommended. 94% oxygen saturation is good, which means enough oxygen is reaching all organs and tissues. You don’t have to bring it up to 98-99%. We say 94% that’s to keep a buffer,” he said, also adding hospitals to cut down on wastage.For drugs like antiviral injection remdesivir, Guleria said that not everyone needs the drug, and it should be given only to hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease.“Only about 10-15% of the cases require oxygen therapy, and medicines like remdesivir. As high as 85-90% Covid-19 positives get mild or no symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and need symptomatic treatment.Guleria said if for some reason there is a delay in getting Covid-19 RT-PC tests, those with all typical symptoms of the disease should immediately get isolated and consult a doctor.“Now we will have to do clinic-radiological diagnosis and treat these patients like Covid-19 cases. Fever, cold, cough, sore throat is most likely Covid-19 in these times. So, if there are symptoms just isolate and consult a doctor,” said Guleria.Experts said the recommendation to use masks indoors depends on the risks involved, including whether the transmission rate at the time is high.“Should you be masking at home? If you are staying someone who is infected or infectious, it makes a lot of sense for you to do so. If you are in contact with people you do not know or how much exposure they had outside, you should stay masked. Now should stay masked inside the house with people you know who have not been infected or exposed to someone who is unknown to the family? I am not sure the level of risk that has or whether in that situation also you should mask up,” said Gagandeep Kang, one of the country’s leading health experts, in an interview to HT.(With inputs from Sunetra Choudhury)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wear-masks-at-home-covid-19-now-a-runaway-outbreak-govt-101619463347182.html
27-04-2021||India||Germany, Australia to rush equipment to India||Germany and Australia are working to rush equipment such as an oxygen production plant and ventilators to India to bolster the country’s Covid-19 response in the wake of record-breaking infections over the past few days.The German Army will provide a large oxygen production plant and efforts are on to transport the broad-spectrum antiviral medication Remdesivir among other medicines from emergency stocks, German ambassador Walter Lindner said on Monday.The Australian government is considering donating non-invasive ventilators to India from stocks created at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, health minister Greg Hunt was quoted as saying by ABC News. The National Security Committee of Australia’s Cabinet will meet on Tuesday to finalise the assistance for India.In a separate development, Anthony Fauci, Biden administration’s chief medical advisor, said the US could “actively consider” providing vaccines from its stock of 30 million AstraZeneca Covid-19 shots to India.On Monday, India set a global record for the rise in coronavirus infections for the fifth consecutive day, with 352,991 cases reported since Sunday. The number of deaths too rose to an all-time high of 2,812, according to official data.Lindner said Germany understands the urgency of the situation and authorities are “working day and night” to airlift critical equipment and medical supplies to India. People across Europe have been moved by the scenes of loss emerging from India, he added.The Germany Army will ship a large oxygen production plant and other authorities are working to provide respirators, ventilators and huge quantities of Remdesivir and other medicines from German emergency stocks.In the private sector, Tata and Linde Group have partnered to provide more than 20 oxygen tanks to increase transport capacity between oxygen producers and Covid-19 hot spots, while more than 20 oxygen plants being purchased by the Indian side from a company in southern Germany will be airlifted by the Indian Air Force, Lindner said.Cooperation between UNICEF and Germany, which started last year, will be intensified to provide cooling chains for vaccines, he added.Australian health minister Hunt said a specific request had been received from India for the physical supply of oxygen and authorities would check if any oxygen supplies could be donated. The government could donate non-invasive ventilators from Australia’s national stockpile that was created last year.“We are in a strong position on that front because we don’t need them [ventilators] at this point in time,” Hunt said.A cleared picture on the aid from Australia is expected after the meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday.Fauci told ABC News’ This Week programme that the US needs to do more to help India’s current Covid-19 response. “I don’t think you can walk away from that,” he said.He said discussions were underway “about really ramping up what we can do on the ground – oxygen supplies, drugs, tests, PPE, as well as taking the look into the intermediate and long run about how we can get vaccines to these individuals, both immediately now, as well as in the situation where you help them to be able to essentially make vaccines themselves”.Asked specifically if the Biden administration could help India with its stock of about 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which hasn’t been approved for use in the US, Fauci replied: “You know, I think that’s going to be something that is up for active consideration...I don’t want to be speaking for policy right now with you, but I mean, that’s something that certainly is going to be actively considered.”People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that critical equipment and supplies was coming into India as a mix of donations – such as the assistance being provided by Germany, Australia and the US – and commercial purchases, such as the oxygen tanks airlifted from Singapore and United Arab Emirates.The people said China’s offer to provide support hadn’t been taken up so far, and pointed out that tweets and statements by Chinese officials about equipment being sent to India – such as a tweet from the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka about 800 oxygen concentrators airlifted from Hong Kong to New Delhi on Sunday – involved commercial purchases made by Indian firms.Chinese embassy spokesperson Wang Xiaojian said in a statement that China “will encourage and guide Chinese companies to actively cooperate with India to facilitate acquiring medical supplies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/germany-australia-to-rush-equipment-to-india-101619463384429.html

27-04-2021||India||IIT professor’s remarks on SC, ST students trigger row||An associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT KGP) who verbally abused students purportedly belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities and those with physical disabilities during a preparatory class is likely to face institutional action after videos of her online classes went viral on social media, following which student bodies sought her termination for alleged casteist slurs.The recordings, which are under review of the institute, were posted on Sunday afternoon anonymously on the confessions page of IIT KGP, an informal group of students on social media. The clips are of online preparatory classes taught by Seema Singh, a professor of English from the department of Humanities and Social Sciences, which were attended by several students and parents. In it she can be heard repeatedly hurling abuses at them.The Mumbai chapter of the Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle (APPSC)—a student organisation with chapters in various IITs -- demanded that the professor be terminated and booked under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. “She is in complete cognisance of her actions and proclaims immunity from any disciplinary actions and consequences,” said APPSC in a statement.IIT Kharagpur registrar Tamal Nath said that the institute was reviewing the veracity of the videos and the claim that she made casteist slurs, brought forward by student bodies.“The incident has come to our notice. We are reviewing the veracity of the claims. The institute does not tolerate such behaviour. Action will be taken,” he said.Singh remained unreachable for comments.The institute’s director Virendra Kumar Tewari also did not respond to calls, messages and emails.“[Tewari] has expressed his support to the students and their parents during an online meeting on Monday evening. Meanwhile the professor concerned has been referred to a review committee,” an official from the institute said on the condition of anonymity.The official confirmed that the video was of the preparatory classes taken for students belonging to SC/ST communities and persons with disability (PWDs). However, the students that HT reached out to refused to comment on the video as they were afraid of possible repercussions. HT has not been able to independently verify the video.IITs offer preparatory courses for two semesters to aspirants of SC and ST communities as well as PWDs. The preparatory courses are offered against vacant seats reserved for the students who missed out on admissions through the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE). At the end of the two semesters, the students can either take the JEE again or seek admission based on their performance during the preparatory course.In the video clips, Singh can be heard verbally abusing both students and their parents for not attending classes, and keeping their cameras switched off during the class. Singh also castigated a student for sending an email stating that they would not be able to attend the class for a few days due to the death of their grandparent.“The professor at IIT KGP is all-powerful… What I have to do, I will do. You can go to ministry of women and child. Go to ministry of SC, ST and minorities (sic). Nothing can prevent me from doing what I have to do to you,” Singh can be heard telling the students in one of the clips.It was not immediately clear whether the recordings were of the same class, or of different classes.“The words used by her such as “dumb” and “bastard” have casteist connotations, especially since she uses them in plural. There is an inherent assumption that students belonging to the reserved categories are somehow lacking merit,” said a member of the APPSC, IIT Bombay chapter.The APPSC has also demanded that a permanent SC, ST, Other Backward Classes cell be set up at IIT KGP and other IITs, which will act as anti-discrimination cell to take action against “structural forms of caste discrimination”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-professor-s-remarks-on-sc-st-students-trigger-row-101619463389317.html
27-04-2021||India||TN allows Vedanta to temporarily reopen, comapny opposes operation of oxygen plant by govt||Chennai/New Delhi: Tamil Nadu on Monday granted temporary permission to a shuttered copper plant in Thoothukudi to reopen for medical oxygen production for four months, almost three years after the facility was closed over pollution concerns after the deaths of 13 protesters in police firing. Hours later, Vedanta Industries, the plant’s owner, opposed the Supreme Court’s suggestion to let Tamil Nadu government operate the oxygen producing unit at the plant, saying “it is just beyond the competency and financial ability of the government to run this oxygen plant.” The next hearing in the case is on Tuesday.Last week, Vedanta moved the Supreme Court for permission to operate its oxygen producing unit at the Thoothukudi’s Sterlite copper plant, which was shut down in May 2018, citing dire oxygen shortages across the country dealing with surging Covid-19 infections. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant. The Supreme Court also rejected requests to reopen the plant for a trial run on January 22 this year.. To be sure, the Tamil Nadu government order didn’t mention that the administration will run the plant but mentioned that a government committee, including civil society members, will be set up to oversee the plant’s functioning. Submitting its affidavit in the apex court, Vedanta said the oxygen plant must be operated by its own team, under possible supervision of a central government’s expert body such as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF). “The running of the oxygen plant by the state government is likely to pose grave danger not only to the assets but to the personnel deployed for operation, as the operation critically involves the operation of high-pressure vessels, heavy duty compressors, high voltage equipment and proprietary control systems. There is a high probability that if untrained personnel were to operate the oxygen plant, the quality of oxygen produced can be substandard and may not be safe for use,” stated its affidavit in the top court. The Tamil Nadu government decision came after an all-party meeting passed a unanimous resolution that set five rules: only the oxygen unit will function, not the copper smelter; preference for oxygen will be Tamil Nadu; a supervising committee under the district collector, superintendent of police, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, two state officials knowledgeable in oxygen production along with civil society, non-governmental organisations and anti-Sterlite protestors, will be formed ; admission passes will be given to workers operating the oxygen unit; and the state will provide security and supply electricity for four weeks, or howsoever long the plant functions, depending on oxygen needs. “This is only a temporary permission and attempts shouldn’t be made to turn this into a permanent permission to produce oxygen or to reopen the facility,” Thoothukudi MP K Kanimozhi who was present at the meeting told the media. The meeting led by chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami was attended by representatives from eight political parties including the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress, Left and other regional parties. The copper unit was sealed by the state government in May 2018, days after 13 agitators were killed in police firing during a violent protest against pollution caused by the facility in the southern district.Reopening of the plant continues to be a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu as local residents and activists fear that the company is attempting to gain back-door entry. “This polluting company made it hard for us to breathe and now they want to help in oxygen production? It seems suspicious to us and we will never accept for it to be reopened,” said S Gunaseelan, an anti-Sterlite activist in Thoothukudi. In the top court last week, Vedanta’s plea was opposed by the Tamil Nadu government, citing law and order and local residents’ anger towards the company. The state’s resistance had prompted the court to asks the Tamil Nadu government if it was willing to operate the plant on its own. “When people are dying, can a state say we will still not run it because there could be law and order problems or that Vedanta did this and that? We are not on who will produce. Let Tamil Nadu government produce it if they have a problem with Vedanta,” it had asked the state. In its response, Vedanta maintained that its oxygen plant had a capacity of 1050 MT per day and that this plant is a non-polluting unit which can be operated without touching the copper smelter. “The only intent of the petitioner in running the oxygen plant is to initiate the production within 7-14 days, in order to cater to states, which are in need of oxygen supply for treating the Covid patients... Further, the petitioner undertakes that it will not carry out any kind of production activities apart from the production of oxygen under the directions of this Hon’ble Court,” said Vedanta. It stated that the state government did not have the requisite expertise or personnel for the maintenance and operation of the oxygen plant and that in view of the national emergency triggered by the surge in infection, the Tamil Nadu government must fulfil its sacrosanct responsibility of maintaining law and order. Separately, during a suo motu hearing on the health infrastructure of Tamil Nadu to manage Covid-19, the state informed Madras high court that only limited supply of liquefied oxygen may be initially available through the Sterlite plant in Thoothukudi. “But the owners have assured the state that immediate measures would be taken to put in place a system by which gaseous oxygen will be converted into liquefied oxygen for medical use with the appropriate content in excess of 99% oxygen,” the order copy of the case read. The high court didn’t delve into the matter further as it is being dealt with by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-allows-vedanta-to-temporarily-reopen-comapny-opposes-operation-of-oxygen-plant-by-govt-101619464038844.html
27-04-2021||India||Blood banks across B’luru struggle to find donors for plasma||Bengaluru: Swamy Vivekananda voluntary blood bank near the corporation circle in Bengaluru was crowded on Friday, with desperate family members of Covid-19 patients pleading with strangers to donate plasma after the donors they brought with them could not clear the requisite tests. Two days later, on Monday, the blood bank wore a deserted look after it stopped taking more plasma request. “We have run out of the apheresis kits. Until we get a fresh lot, we won’t be able to restart. We have spoken to companies, but they don’t have any stocks. We can’t say for sure when the supplies will reach us,” said a staff member of the blood bank. Plasma therapy, broadly known as ‘convalescent plasma therapy’, is a procedure to treat Covid-19 patients with the plasma of a person who has recovered from the infection. Several blood banks across the city said they were getting at least 10-15 calls per day for plasma. However, they were facing difficulties in finding donors, which has escalated problems for both blood banks and relatives of Covid patients. At Jeevaraksha blood bank, four plasma apheresis procedures were done on Monday. “There is a high demand for A+ group and most of the people are struggling to find donors. In our system, if anyone takes plasma, they also have to make plasma donation. We see people making frantic calls to get donors every day,” said Abdul Rahaman Shariff, a staff of the blood bank. Shariff said in seven cases, they were able to provide plasma without a donor because some volunteers had made plasma donation at the blood bank, which has now run out of stock. Stating that the blood bank performed at least 26 plasma apheresis last month, Shariff pointed out that the demand for plasma has gone up in the recent times as compared to the first wave of the pandemic. “We have enough kits to last for at least a month. But we also hear that there isn’t enough stock of the kits in the market, as such high demand was not expected,” Shariff said. At Sankalp India Foundation, a Bengaluru-based non-government organisation working for blood donation, volunteers said they were not able to find many donors, adding that they would call any number from which they receive a missed call, in hope that it was a donor. “We are not getting donors and there is a huge demand,” said Akansha, a volunteer at the foundation. At Bengaluru’s Victoria Hospital, its blood bank could only provide plasma to three patients this month since there were no donors, a staff member from the hospital said. With the Karnataka government imposing a 14-day lockdown, hopes of getting more people to donate plasma were also fading away. “There have been advertisements from the government and other campaigns asking those who have recovered from Covid-19 to come forward to donate plasma, but the response has been poor. With the lockdown in place, no one will come out now. The government should allow people to donate and make arrangements for the same during the lockdown,” said a staff member at the Victoria Hospital blood bank. Even though a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) across 39 hospitals in September last year had found that Convalescent plasma therapy failed to benefit Covid-19 patients, many doctors in the city swear by the treatment protocol. Recently, cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar, who recovered from Covid-19 after being hospitalised last month, has offered to donate plasma and urged others who have recovered from the infection to follow suit. The latest guidelines, released by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi, ICMR-Covid-19 national task force, and the joint monitoring group under the Union health ministry, said that plasma can be administered in early moderate disease within seven days of the onset of Covid-19 symptoms. As the city finds it difficult to manage the demand for plasma, healthcare professionals are requesting people to come forward to donate. “There is no need to be concerned about safety. We understand the value of every donor and ensure that the procedure is done keeping safety as a priority. But we want more people to come forward and donate,” said Shariff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/blood-banks-across-b-luru-struggle-to-find-donors-for-plasma-101619463919422.html
27-04-2021||India||Shopkeepers say need more clarity on curbs||BengaluruAs soon as the state government announced new restrictions for 14 days in the state on Monday, residents in Bengaluru thronged various markets, shopping for groceries and other essential items in a state of panic. Long queues were reported from outside supermarkets and local markets across the state, even though the government announced that shops dealing with essential commodities will be allowed to open from 6am to 10 am on all days.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday announced that the state will go in a “closed down” for two weeks from Tuesday night in a bid to contain the raging Covid-19 crisis in the second wave of the pandemic. The decision came following a cabinet meeting that went on for over two hours on Monday morning. The government said that public transportation, including BMTC and Bangalore Metro services, will not function during the closed down period. Goods can be transported from one state to another and takeaway from restaurants and home delivery of alcohol have been allowed. A shopkeeper in Bengaluru’s RT Nagar said there was no shortage of supplies to the shop. “There is still some confusion over if we can keep the shops open after 10 am. The government has said essential supplies can open between 6 am and 10 am. But it also said that home delivery is allowed. This is very confusing and there should be clarification on this,” said shopkeeper Ravi Kumar.Rajesh Bhatt, who runs a restaurant, said only those affiliated with the delivery apps will gain. “We are allowed to have home deliveries but if people don’t come out, we lose out on business. We are now offering home deliveries. We will know how it will work in the next few days,” said Bhatt, who runs a restaurant in Babusapalaya.While shopkeepers remain upset about the loss in business, they agreed that strict measures were required. “We are still recovering from the losses from last year. Many shopkeepers had to shut down because they couldn’t handle the debt. We face similar problems, but we can understand the situation. We hope the government will do something to help us after this,” said Peter Antony, another shopkeeper.Meanwhile, Bengaluru police have made elaborate plans to enforce the restrictions. A senior police officer told HT that since a lockdown was in effect, more manpower is being diverted for enforcement. “We will increase patrolling and check posts across the city. We hope people will cooperate with us but if they don’t, we will take strict action. We have seized more than 2,000 vehicles during the weekend lockdown. This drive will continue,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shopkeepers-say-need-more-clarity-on-curbs-101619463920113.html
27-04-2021||India||IT professionals aim to develop support system for dissemination of Covid information||Bengaluru A qualified group of persons from Bengaluru among other places like Hyderabad and Coimbatore are working on creating a WhatsApp bot and other technological interventions to complement the existing voice call-based support system for dissemination of Covid-19 information and to reduce the stress on the already overstretched resources.The team, which comprises Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other software solutions startups, are using their technical expertise to streamline a volume of requests in Bengaluru, one of the worst Covid-hit cities in the country, by collating information and providing a platform to integrate both government and volunteer-driven efforts in order to gain a grip on the pandemic, people aware with the developments said.“Last time around, there were multiple people trying to solve a problem. Chatbots hadn’t percolated as much but most of the chats happened via WhatsApp as people forwarded everything through the platform. We learnt from that and decided to use WhatsApp as a chatbot-based system. There is no soiling of information, everything is put into a google sheet which every non-profit or CSO (central statistics office) sector person knows how to use,” Gautam Prakash, co-founder and chief problem solver at Reap Benefit, a startup that devises community-based solutions, said.Bengaluru recorded 16545 new infections in the 24 hours on Sunday and accounted for 105 fatalities out of the total 201 in the state. Karnataka reported 29744 new cases and the positivity rate was 17.87%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. Caught napping for over four months since the submission of a report on Covid-19 and its imminent surge from a government-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC) in November, the B S Yediyurappa-led administration has now resorted to lockdown-like restrictions across the state to buy time and increase preparedness for rising cases.The WhatsApp bot, which is expected to be rolled out anytime now, aims to reduce the burden on call centres that have otherwise witnessed a three-fold increase in traffic since the beginning of March with each of the 100 or so executives (working in three shifts round the clock) answering and following up on a range of requests, as reported by Hindustan Times earlier.The techies aim to disseminate accurate inputs with the help of the rural development and panchayat raj (RDPR) department of Karnataka which is providing real time information, and the same can be accessed by pinging the bot.Gayatri Meka from Hyper Verge, an AI startup that also channels its efforts into social capital, said that last year, the bot on WhatsApp was used to share information on the nearest ration shop to help relief work. But this time around, the requests have centered around securing hospital beds, oxygen and medicines among other information critical for treatment of Covid-19.Last year, several leading startup founders like Mekin Maheshwari of Udhyam Learning Foundation, Aprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder of Vokal, Abhiraj Singh Bhal, co-founder of services startup, Urban Company, Vivekananda Hallekere, CEO of Bounce among scores of others were part of the efforts, building key software and developing solutions to help the government issue lockdown passes, provide information on the pandemic and streamline relief work.“Basically, when a person pings for help, the bot asks for location or pincode.... then it asks what help is required, if it is hospital bed or oxygen or medicines. Then it looks up the database with hospital data close to their location, with bed count in realtime and this is shared with the user,” Meka explained.In the wake of shortage of beds, the bot raises a request following which a volunteer group looks into it and gets back to the user.Uma Mahadevan, principal secretary at Karnataka’s panchayat raj department, said that the professionals were also mapping resources and monitoring Twitter regularly for any request-related post and figuring out solutions for better integration.“Lots of people are helping us develop the platform. This year, we want to continue with this effort and make it as hyper local as possible,” she said.Meka said the platform is built in such a way that it can also be expanded to integrate work of volunteers from other cities for better reach.“For the next few days, we are trying to get more volunteer groups on board. We know that there are so many efforts round the country, people in different cities putting together their own databases, responses, etc. This helps them reach more people and we can integrate their work with ours,” Meka said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-professionals-aim-to-develop-support-system-for-dissemination-of-covid-information-101619463858790.html
27-04-2021||India||Chinese airlines suspends cargo flights to India||Beijing: The largest cargo flight operator from China to India, the Chinese state-owned Sichuan Airlines, has suspended all cargo flights to India for 15 days because of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the country.The suspension, which is likely to disrupt frantic efforts by Indian private companies to import medical supplies including oxygen concentrators to fight the pandemic from China, comes despite Beijing’s repeated offers of “support and assistance” to India to fight the pandemic.The airlines operated 10 flights on six routes to four Indian cities - New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore.In a late night development, the airlines told the state-run tabloid Global Times that it was “discussing a new plan” to resume cargo services to India.“We are re-evaluating the original plan of suspending cargo services to India, and actively discussing a new plan to guarantee cargo services to the region,” the company told Global Times.The company said the reason why it suspended cargo flights to India was the recent sudden change in Covid-19 cases in the country.A discussion to resume cargo flights was taken after Indian media from Beijing reported the company’s decision to suspend the operations, the Global Times report said.In a letter to the sales agents on Monday, the Sichuan Chuanhang Logistics Co. Ltd, part of Sichuan Airlines, said the airline has suspended its cargo flights on all six routes -- Xi’an-Delhi, Xi’an-Mumbai, Chengdu-Chennai, Chongqing-Chennai, Chengdu-Bangalore, and Chongqing-Delhi – for 15 days,The airlines said “…in the face of sudden changes in the epidemic situation (in India), in order to reduce the number of imported cases, it is decided” to suspend the flights.The airlines added the India route has “always been the core strategic route for Sichuan Airlines” but added that the Indian Covid-19 outbreak had not only caused “…a record number of deaths but also caused a surge in imported cases”.The Chinese foreign ministry, however, did not offer any comment. “With regard to the operation of airlines, I will refer you to the relevant airlines for more information,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked about the development.The ministry also did not confirm or deny a tweet by the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka, which said 800 oxygen concentrators have been airlifted from Hong Kong to Delhi with another 10,000 to be dispatched in the coming week.“800 Oxygen Concentrators have been airlifted today from #HongKong to #Delhi; 10000 more in a week. #China is keeping in touch with #India for urgent needs. Stay Strong,” the tweet published by the Chinese embassy in Colombo early on Monday said.When asked to comment on the tweet at the regular ministry briefing, Wang said: “As I said, China is willing to provide necessary support and help to India in its fight against the virus. If India raises specific demands, we will provide help and support to the best of our capability.”He added: “We have stated that we are ready to help India fight the virus in the first opportunity available. [The] two sides are in communication regarding this... China has been following closely the epidemic situation in India. We show our sincerest sympathies to the worsening situation in India.”To a question from Blommbergon three other Quad members (the US, Australia, and Japan) not helping the fourth member, India, during this crisis, Wang said countries should work together to fight the virus.“With regard to some mechanisms that you mentioned, we hope we can also follow this principle and work towards building a community with a shared future and to provide support and help to other countries in their fight (the) virus and show their true responsibilities and obligations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chinese-airlines-suspends-cargo-flights-to-india-101619463859324.html
27-04-2021||India||K’taka imposes stricter curbs for 14 days amid Covid surge||BengaluruThe Karnataka government on Monday announced stricter restrictions across the state from Tuesday night for 14 days, in a last-ditch attempt to contain the rapidly deteriorating health crisis amid unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic.“Strict measures to control Covid pandemic will be taken. From tomorrow (Tuesday) night till next 14 days, there will be closed down for the whole state,” chief minister BS Yediyurappa said in Bengaluru after an over two-hour cabinet meeting on Monday. He added that essential commodity shops will be open between 6 am and 10 am, after which all shops will be closed.The state cabinet also decided to provide Covid-19 vaccinations free of cost at government hospitals for those between 18 and 44 years of age in the new vaccination drive starting May 1.The government said that the restrictions, termed as “closed down”, were enforced to “break the chain of Covid-19 transmission in the state” and will be in place from 9 pm on April 27 to 6 am on May 12.Yediyurappa added that if the situation did not come under control within this period, there would be chances of extending the same.“Regarding control of Covid pandemic, the cabinet has taken decisions after consulting with an expert committee,” Yediyurappa said. Earlier, the Karnataka government has been accused of neglecting warnings given by the state-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC) in its report in November last year about the imminent second wave of infections and level or preparedness required to deal with the surge.The decision came on a day when Karnataka reported 29,744 new Covid-19 cases and 201 fatalities, taking the caseload and deaths in the state to 1,368,945 and 14,627, respectively. The case positivity rate in the state was 17.87%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. The state had recorded its highest-ever tally of 34,804 cases in a day on Sunday.Bengaluru accounted for 16,545 fresh infections and 105 deaths on Monday, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases and related deaths in the city to 670,201 and 5,905, respectively.While the state government refrained from using the term ‘lockdown’, restrictions announced on Monday were nothing short of it, business owners and government officials said.Several other states like Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra have relapsed into lockdown mode as a measure to contain the surge.The government said all shops and establishments serving food, groceries and other essentials can remain open from 6 am to 10 am till the period of the curfew. Yediyurappa said that stand-alone liquor shops will be allowed to remain open for take away services only. However, officials at the Excise department said they would have to now make fresh orders as existing provisions under the stringent act allows opening of liquor stores only from 10 am.“We are not sure how to remain open at 6 am and then close down at 10am. Unless we have orders from the excise department, it will be hard for us to operate since any violation can end up with us losing our licence,” said a liquor shop owner in upscale Indiranagar locality, requesting not to be named.The government has also allowed industries, except garments, to continue operations. Construction workers will be issued passes, the government said in its guidelines.Meanwhile, the Karnataka Employers Association on Monday appealed to the government that it should be allowed to operate its units with 50% strength.“The garment industry has already received lot of orders with strict timelines to deliver. European markets have just opened and they have sent huge orders. If there is a delay in supply of finished goods to the buyers, it will result in huge penalty, losses and also it will result in employment loss,” BC Prabhakar, the president of the association, wrote in the letter.Earlier in the day, Yediyurappa said garment factories will not be allowed to function since the sector employs lakhs of people who have to sit side-by-side and work.Meanwhile, the announcement triggered confusion and anxiety among residents of the city and other parts of the state, who resorted to panic buying, not knowing what turns the current restrictions would take.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-imposes-stricter-curbs-for-14-days-amid-covid-surge-101619463738732.html
27-04-2021||India||48 hours on, forest fires rage across Mizoram||Massive forest fires that broke out on Saturday and continued to rage till Monday have affected several parts of Mizoram and damaged vast tracts of land, satellite images have revealed. No human casualty has been reported so far.According to a satellite data assessment by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), there were as many as 2,671 forest fire points in the state between April 20 and 26, with over 400 points on Monday alone. NASA’s Earthdata website also showed a very large concentration of fires in and around the state both on Sunday and Monday.Speaking to chief minister Zoramthanga, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assured all possible assistance to deal with the situation. “Spoke to Mizoram CM, Mr Zoramthanga and took stock of the situation arising due to forest fires in parts of the state. Assured all possible support from the Centre in overcoming the crisis,” Modi tweeted.The chief minister later thanked Modi and even tweeted a video of an Indian Air Force (IAF) chopper with bambi buckets (used for aerial firefighting), trying to douse the flames. “Thank you so much Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji. I thank the Central Government for its prompt assurance and swift action. The people of #Mizoram says ‘Kan lawm e,” Zoramthanga posted on Twitter.The forest fire reportedly broke out at Saisih forest area in the outskirts of Lunglei town between 6 am and 7 am on Saturday and spread to Lunglei town on Sunday, Lunglei district deputy commissioner M Misael told news agency PTI.While Lunglei is the worst affected, Serchhip, Lawngtlai and Hnahthial were also hit by the blaze as firemen deployed in several sites struggled to douse the flames.According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the states of Mizoram and Tripura recorded “large deficiency” in rainfall during the pre-monsoon period from March 1 to April 26 at 74% and 67% below normal.“There were over 400 forest fires today. Several factors may have led to this. They (forests) have large bamboo plantations and bamboo leaves are highly inflammable. When there is less moisture and high fuel load in the form of dry leaves and twigs on the forest floor, fire catches easily and spreads rapidly. Jhum cultivation is also another factor. Mizoram has very good forests. During this dry season, certain manmade factors may have led to extensive fires. But this needs to be ascertained on ground,” Sunil Chandra, deputy director (Forest Geoinformatics Division) of FSI, said.Meanwhile, the weather body has predicted heat wave conditions over isolated pockets of Gujarat and coastal Odisha on Monday. A fresh feeble western disturbance is also likely to affect the Western Himalayan region from April 27, causing isolated rainfall/snowfall with thunderstorm and gusty winds over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand between April 27 and 30.A north-south trough (low pressure area) runs from Marathwada to south coastal Tamil Nadu across north interior Karnataka, Telangana and Rayalaseema in lower tropospheric levels, the IMD said. Under its influence, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall or thunderstorm is very likely over Kerala and Mahe, and isolated to scattered rainfall/thunderstorm over Maharashtra and remaining parts of south Peninsular India in the next three to four days. Heavy rainfall is also likely over north Kerala on April 28 and 29 and over south interior Karnataka on April 28 and 29.Strong surface winds (speed reaching 20-30 kmph) are very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north Rajasthan on Monday and Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/48-hours-on-forest-fires-rage-across-mizoram-101619463394309.html

Joe Biden recounted India's contribution in US' fight against the deadly disease in a tweet from his official President account. The call between the two leaders comes on the day India recorded more than 3 lakh cases for fifth day in a row."Today, I spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pledged America’s full support to provide emergency assistance and resources in the fight against Covid-19. India was there for us, and we will be there for them," the US President said in a tweet.Today, I spoke with Prime Minister @narendramodi and pledged America’s full support to provide emergency assistance and resources in the fight against COVID-19.

The new infections brought India’s total to more than 17.3 million, behind only the United States.The US on Monday said it is working to relieve the suffering in India by supplying oxygen, diagnostic tests, treatments, ventilators and protective gear.The White House has also said it would make available sources of raw materials urgently needed for India to manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” President Joe Biden tweeted on Sunday.Help and support were also offered from archrival Pakistan, which said it could provide relief including ventilators, oxygen supply kits, digital X-ray machines, protective equipment and related items.Germany’s Health Ministry said it is urgently working to put together an aid package for India consisting of ventilators, monoclonal antibodies, the drug remdesivir, as well as surgical and N95 protective masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joe-biden-speaks-to-pm-modi-says-india-was-there-for-us-we-ll-be-there-for-them-101619461791850.html
27-04-2021||India||Inspector accuses ex-Mumbai top cop of cheating, corruption||A serving inspector of Maharashtra police force has levelled serious allegations of corruption against former Mumbai police commissioner Param Bir Singh, in yet another twist to the saga of charges and counter charges that have roiled the department over the past months. Inspector BR Ghadge, posted at Akola, wrote on April 20 , a 14-page complaint (HT has a copy) against Singh to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackerey, home minister Dilip Walse Patil, the Director General of Police Maharashtra, Sanjay Pandey and DG Anti-Corruption Bureau, alleging that while serving as Commissioner of Police, Thane, Singh indulged in several illegal acts and made crores of rupees.Pandey confirmed receipt of the letter: “A complaint has been received by my office and as per legal procedure it is being looked into.”Singh did not answer phone calls and messages seeking comment. Ghadge’s letter claimed that as Thane CP, Singh gave orders to police officers to extricate some influential people from criminal cases registered against them, allegedly in return for huge sums of money.The letter further alleged that Singh accepted ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore for posting of senior inspectors, and that he insisted on being gifted gold biscuits on Diwali from all zonal DCPs, ACPs and senior inspectors of Thane police . The letter specifically mentions a cheating and forgery case from 2013 where Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation officials gave extra FSI to builders in dead people’s names and claimed that Ghadge was asked to drop the name of 22 government officials from the case. It also mentions the case involving a fake call centre on Mira road and several others. Ghadge alleged that because he refused to drop the case against the 22 in the KDMC case, four false cases were registered against him.  Ghadge has furnished details of the FSI case along with his complaint. According to the complaint, Singh bought 21 acres in Sindhudurg district in someone else’s name. He also alleged that Singh was using two government residences at one time, which amounts to criminal misconduct. Inspector Ghadge said that all these complaints were also previously made by him on September 21, 2015, March 17, 2016, May 30, 2016 and June 8, 2016, but that no action was taken. He added in the letter that he has also filed five write in the Bombay High Court in this regard over the years. Singh was removed as commissioner for what the state government claimed was his mishandling of the Antilla explosives case, and the murder of Mansukh Hiran, the man in possession of the vehicle in which the explosives were found, outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Hiran reported the vehicle stolen around a week before it was found with the explosives in late February. He himself was subsequently found dead. Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze has been named as the main accused in both cases by the National Investigation Agency. After his removal as commissioner, Singh wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that the state’s home minister Anil Deshmukh instructed Vaze to extort money from restaurants and bars in the city. He also approached the courts with his complaint, following which the Bombay High Court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, a move that forced Deshmukh’s resignation. Singh is already facing two enquiries being carried out by DGP Sanjay Pandey.In the first, Pandey is checking whether there was any dereliction of duty on part of Singh in not apprising the government about the Antilia bomb scare . The second inquiry pertains to corruption allegations made against him by police inspector Anup Dange.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inspector-accuses-ex-mumbai-top-cop-of-cheating-corruption-101619462778580.html
27-04-2021||India||Covid-19 situation in India 'beyond heartbreaking': WHO chief||The World Health Organization chief voiced alarm Monday at India's record-breaking wave of Covid-19 cases and deaths, saying the organisation was rushing to help address the crisis."The situation in India is beyond heartbreaking," Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told reporters.His comments came as India battles a catastrophic coronavirus wave that has overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums working at full capacity.A surge in recent days has seen patients' families taking to social media to beg for oxygen supplies and locations of available hospital beds, and has forced the capital New Delhi to extend a week-long lockdown."WHO is doing everything we can, providing critical equipment and supplies," Tedros said.He said the UN health agency was among other things sending "thousands of oxygen concentrators, prefabricated mobile field hospitals and laboratory supplies."The WHO also said it had transferred more than 2,600 of its experts from various programmes, including polio and tuberculosis, to work with Indian health authorities to help respond to the pandemic.The country of 1.3 billion has become the latest hotspot of a pandemic that has killed more than three million people worldwide, even as richer countries take steps towards normality with quickening inoculation programmes.The US and Britain rushed ventilators and vaccine materials to help India weather the devastating crisis, while a range of other countries also pledged support.Since the virus that causes Covid-19 first surfaced in China in late 2019, the disease has killed more than 3.1 million people out of at least 147 million infected, according to a tally from official sources compiled by AFP.Tedros on Monday lamented that global new case numbers have been rising for the past nine weeks straight."To put it in perspective," he said, "there were almost as many cases globally last week as in the first five months of the pandemic."The United States remains the worst-affected country, with some 572,200 deaths and over 32 million infections, followed by Brazil and Mexico.But India, in fourth place, has in recent days been driving the global case numbers.The country, which has recorded over 195,000 deaths, registered 2,812 new deaths and 352,991 new infections on Monday alone -- its highest tolls since the start of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-situation-in-india-beyond-heartbreaking-says-who-chief-101619454928067.html
