This was decided at a meeting of the India-Bahrain high joint commission that was co-chaired in New Delhi by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Bahraini counterpart Abdullatif bin Rashid Al Zayani. “Both sides recognised that the bilateral security dialogue has helped institutionalise cooperation in the area of intelligence-sharing as well as in identifying new areas for security cooperation, including cyber security,” said a joint statement issued after the meeting. “They agreed to further strengthen bilateral defence and security cooperation including through regular consultations in the areas of maritime security, combating piracy and counter-terrorism,” it added. The two sides reiterated their condemnation of all forms of terrorism and “called on all states to reject and abandon the use of terrorism against other countries”. The Bahraini side expressed interest in setting up pharmaceutical and vaccine production units with Indian collaboration, and the Indian side agreed to facilitate dialogue on this issue between relevant stakeholders, according to the joint statement. The Indian side also made a request for greater acceptance and market access for Indian pharmaceutical products in the Bahraini market. Following the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for cooperation in healthcare in July 2018, both sides have held talks to identify suitable areas for collaboration such as health services, medical and clinical research, social health insurance, pharmaceuticals and medical devices. As a follow-up to a MoU on space cooperation signed in March 2019 and a statement of intent for space cooperation signed in August 2019, both sides have held discussions for collaboration between the NewSpace India Limited (NSIL) and Bahrain’s National Space Science Agency, including building and launching a nano-satellite, establishing a ground station and providing assistance in capacity building to Bahrain. The Indian side thanked the government of Bahrain for the safety, security and welfare of the Indian community, especially during the Covid-19 pandemic. It expressed its appreciation to the Bahraini side for facilitating repatriation flights and for providing free Covid-19 vaccination to all, including the Indian community. The Bahraini side appreciated India’s role in keeping open supply chains for essential items, including food and medicines, amid the pandemic, and in gifting 100,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines. Bahrain is home to some 3,50,000 Indians, the largest expatriate community, and New Delhi had facilitated the travel of Indian medical professionals to Manama last year to cope with the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-bahrain-agree-to-bolster-defence-and-security-cooperation-101617818189266.html

He held a high-level meeting with senior officials on Sunday to review the existing situation where he ordered deployment of teams to worst-affected states and launch of an awareness campaign.A day after that meeting, India recorded over one lakh new cases of the infection. The record was broken on Wednesday when the daily caseload reached 1.15 lakh.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe Prime Minister's last interaction with chief ministers was on March 17 when he expressed concern over the rise in Covid-19 cases in parts of the country and called for "quick and decisive" steps to check the "emerging second peak".Thursday's virtual meeting comes after Union health minister Harsh Vardhan took stock of the Covid-19 situation via video conferencing with health ministers of 11 states where the situation is particularly bad. The 11 states are Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan.The daily rise in Covid-19 cases in India crossed the grim milestone of one lakh from 20,000 infections in just 25 days, unlike last year when it took 76 days for daily cases to reach the then peak of 97,894 on September 17, reflecting the speed at which the virus is spreading and concerning the government.Top central government officials have said that next four weeks are "very critical in the country’s fight against the pandemic.India is currently the third worst-hit country, just behind the United States of America and Brazil.On the occasion of the World Health Day, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday urged people to focus on fighting Covid-19 by taking all precautions, including wearing a mask, regularly washing hands and following other protocols."#WorldHealthDay is a day to reaffirm our gratitude and appreciation to all those who work day and night to keep our planet healthy," the PM Modi tweeted.India is also conducting the world's largest vaccination drive to strengthen the fight against Covid-19, he asserted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-interact-with-cms-on-covid-19-situation-vaccination-strategy-101617816754096.html

The Delhi Police cleared the protest site on March 24, 2020, a day before a nationwide lockdown was enforced in view of the coronavirus outbreak.Speaking to reporters here, Tikait said the Centre's farm laws will only spell losses for farmers."Farmers will not go back home till these laws are repealed. They talk of coronavirus but we have told the government that they should not treat this stir like Shaheen Bagh. This agitation will not end. We will follow the coronavirus guidelines and this agitation will continue till our demands are met," he said.In response to a question, he said, "Even if we have to continue the protest till 2023, we are prepared. Till the time these laws are not repealed and a law is not framed on MSP, farmers will not go back home."Tikait reiterated that the farmers are ready to talk to the government."Whenever the government has time, we are ready to talk. We will wait for their call," he said.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three border points of Delhi -- Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur -- demanding a repeal of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year.The Centre says the new farm laws will free farmers from middlemen, giving them more options to sell their crops.The protesting farmers, however, say the laws will weaken the minimum support price (MSP) system and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-treat-farmers-stir-like-shaheen-bagh-protest-tikait-tells-government-101617816473422.html

They (petitioners) wanted that no Rohingya be deported, we had said that we will follow the law. They are illegal immigrants. We are always in touch with Myanmar and when they confirm that the individual is their citizen, then only deportation can take place,” the Centre had said.Bhushan had alleged that Jammu and Kashmir administration has detained Rohingyas in Jammu, who have refugee cards and they will soon be deported.On March 11, an interim plea was filed in a pending PIL seeking immediate release of detained Rohingya refugees in Jammu.The plea also sought direction to Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant refugee identification cards through the Foreigners Regional Registration Office (FRRO) for Rohingyas in informal camps.The application, filed by Mohammad Salimullah, a Rohingya refugee, has said that it is filed in public interest in order to secure and protect the right against deportation of refugees in India.The plea said that it is filed to protect rights guaranteed under Article 14 and Article 21, read with Article 51(c) of the Constitution, against the deportation of Rohingya refugees who have taken refuge in India after escaping widespread violence and discrimination against their community in Myanmar.“Release the detained Rohingya refugees immediately and direct the Union Territory government and the Ministry of Home Affairs to expeditiously grant Refugee identification cards through the FRRO for Rohingyas in informal camps,” it said.It sought direction to the Union Government to refrain from implementing any orders on deporting Rohingya refugees, who have been detained in the sub jail in Jammu.Violent attacks allegedly by Myanmar army have led to an exodus of Rohingya tribals from the western Rakhine state in that country to India and Bangladesh.Many of them, who had fled to India after the earlier spate of violence, have settled in Jammu, Hyderabad, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi-NCR and Rajasthan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-order-on-release-of-rohingyas-detained-in-jammu-on-thursday-101617814906965.html

07-04-2021||India||Gujarat government refutes Congress' Covid-19 pandemic mismanagement claims||Refuting the Congress' allegation of mismanagement and failure in tackling the coronavirus situation in the state, the BJP government in Gujarat claimed that its track record was far better than other states.Gujarat Deputy Chief Minister Nitin Patel, who handles Health portfolio, said over 80 lakh persons in the state were already given the Covid-19 vaccine, which is a record in the country."Our government was always serious about coronavirus and we have implemented various measures in a well-planned manner during the last one year. Compared to other states, Gujarat is way ahead when it comes to fighting this pandemic," Patel told reporters at a press conference in Gandhinagar."Till now, 80.17 lakh persons have already been vaccinated in the state. This is more than any other state. Instead of helping the government or people in these difficult times, Congress leaders are levelling baseless allegations for political gains," the deputy chief minister said.Earlier during the day, Rajya Sabha MP and national spokesperson of the Congress Shaktisinh Gohil claimed that ICU beds and ventilators were not available for patients, neither in private nor in government-run hospitals.In a statement, Gohil also criticised the government over the issue of vaccination, claiming that the second wave could have been averted if the countrymen had been given preference in vaccination instead of giving the doses to other countries.Former Gujarat Congress President Arjun Modhwadia, in a press conference, alleged that the BJP government in the state is concealing the real figures about tests and infections."The BJP government shied away from discussing the issue of coronavirus in the recently held budget session of the state Assembly. This government is concealing figures to hide their failure. Instead of taking serious steps, the BJP only concentrated on elections and post-poll celebrations," Modhwadia claimed.Responding to the allegations, Patel said even the High Court and WHO had expressed satisfaction about the work done by the Gujarat government to stem the viral spread."We are conducting around 1 lakh tests daily, including 40,000 RT-PCR tests. Gujarat's recovery rate was once 98 per cent, which now stands at 94 per cent. It is true that the number of infections has increased in recent times. But we have never concealed facts or figures from the public," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-government-refutes-congress-covid-19-pandemic-mismanagement-claims-101617812528651.html

07-04-2021||India||China capable of launching cyber-attacks against India, says CDS Gen Rawat||Chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat on Wednesday said China was ahead of India in technology, and it was capable of launching cyber-attacks against India. He said the biggest gap between the two countries was in the cyber domain and it was being addressed in a serious manner.“We know China is capable of launching cyber-attacks on us. And that it (China) can disrupt a large amount of our systems,” Rawat said in response to a question after delivering a talk on Shaping the Armed Forces to Meet Likely Current and Future Challenges. Vivekananda International Foundation organised the event.Rawat said India was trying to create systems for cyber defence to deal with such attacks. He said cyber agencies in the military were working to ensure that “the downtime and the effect of a cyber-attack” did not last long.“We should be able to overcome cyber-attacks and continue with our systems either through an alternative or preventive means through firewalls. So, while we are trying to create firewalls for cyber-attacks, yet we are quite sure they (China) will be able to break through the firewalls…But then what we are trying to do is how long will your system be down, and how will you be able to operate through that phase of cyber-attack you have been put through. That is one thing we are looking at and addressing in a serious manner,” he said.The CDS’s comments come at a time when India and China are locked in a border standoff in eastern Ladakh and efforts are underway to withdraw front-line troops and weaponry from friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).Rawat said India was developing new technologies to bridge the gap with China. The CDS said closing the technology gap with the neighbour would require integration of the resources of the three services.“The three services are at different levels as far as our technology orientation is concerned. The navy is far ahead of the army and the Indian Air Force (IAF) in the way they have imbibed technology. If you integrate, you will at least be able to catch up with them (China). We may not be able to fully catch up with China, so we are trying to develop some kind of a relationship with western nations to see how we can get better support from them during peacetime at least to see how we can overcome this deficiency,” Rawat said.Cyber has, perhaps, come to acquire a pivotal position in any nation’s security architecture, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies.“While preparing to acquire offensive capability, it is critical that one’s own systems are protected. While we may be lagging behind China, our nation does not lack cerebral capital to catch up unlike in other capital acquisitions. All efforts must be made to tap the nation’s inherent cyber know-how to protect our vital infrastructure from cyber intrusions,” Bahadur said.Responding to a question on the challenges to theaterisation and the ongoing efforts to bring about jointness among the three services, Rawat said India as a nation believed in status quo and there was always a hesitation to change.“Also, there is a feeling amongst the three services that army being a very large service --- compared to navy and IAF --- will possibly usurp the two entities and everything will become army-centric. I think this is a misnomer because the army, navy and IAF have their own specialties. They will retain their autonomy and integration will only ensure that we have systems that at least operate together,” Rawat said.On women in the armed forces, the CDS said the services were opening more roles to them and there were some areas where they were performing better than men and vice-versa. He said the armed forces were looking at exploiting the capabilities of both men and women and ensuring they were utilised in roles they were best suited for.“There are some tasks that are better performed by women. For example, when we look at cyber, artificial intelligence, quantum computing --- areas where you need concentration and the ability to sit long hours on the desk --- we have found that the women workforce is better capable than the men folk. So somewhere the women have shown better capability and there are some areas where men have better capability,” Rawat said.One of the turning points for women in the military came in 2015 when IAF decided to induct them into the fighter stream. Tanks and combat positions in infantry are still no-go zones for women, who were allowed to join the armed forces outside the medical stream for the first time in 1992.This year, the navy deployed four women officers on warships after a hiatus of almost 25 years. The army has decided to allow them to fly helicopters this year onwards.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/china-capable-of-launching-cyber-attacks-against-india-says-cds-gen-rawat-101617808708167.html

Here are the facts: Total number of COVID vaccine supplied to State till date - 1,06,19,190; Consumption - 90,53,523 (of which 6% wastage - over 5L); Vaccine in pipeline - 7,43,280. Dosage available - nearly 23 lakhs," Javadekar said on Twitter.Central Govt replenishes more vaccine than what is needed for actual use."Central Govt replenishes more vaccine than what is needed for actual use," he said in subsequent tweet.The Union minister's comments came after Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader and Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope requested the Centre to supply vaccine stocks to the state for inoculating 600,000 beneficiaries a day. He also noted that several vaccination centres across the state have been shut because of the shortage.Watch | ‘Mumbai facing Covid vaccine shortage, stock may exhaust in 2-3 days’: Mayor“The union minister Prakash Javadekar had asked us to double the vaccination numbers and had assured to provide adequate stock. We accepted it as a challenge and increased the daily vaccination to 450,000 lakh from 300,000. We will achieve the target of inoculating 600,000 beneficiaries in no time. However, we have started facing shortage of vaccine stock and have to shut down many centres across the state as there is no stock left," the health minister told reporters.Earlier in the day, Mumbai city mayor Kishori Pednekar also raised similar concerns about shortage of vaccines in the city. “There is a shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses in Mumbai. Yesterday, we had 1,76,000 vaccine doses but in the coming days, we will require more vaccines,” she was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Meanwhile, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan has said that the allegations about shortage in vaccine supply are “utterly baseless”. In a strongly worded statement, Vardhan said, “I have seen statements made by public representatives in Maharashtra about shortage of vaccines. This is nothing but an attempt to divert attention from Maharashtra government’s repeated failures to control the spread of pandemic.

07-04-2021||India||'No vaccine shortage, attempts by state govts to spread panic': Harsh Vardhan||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday condemned what he called 'deplorable' attempts by some state governments to distract attention from their failures and called them out for their 'irresponsible statements' in the context of the coronavirus pandemic. His statement comes in the wake of Maharashtra health minister's comment that his state is facing shortage of Covid-19 vaccine stock. Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"At a time when the country is witnessing a fresh wave of rising Covid-19 infections, I am alarmed to note the fact that many State governments have failed to take appropriate response measures and apply the lessons that the nation has learned over the past one year of handling this pandemic," Harsh Vardhan said.Targeting Maharashtra over the state health minister's remarks, he said, "The inability of Maharashtra government to act responsibly is beyond comprehension. To spread panic among the people is to compound the folly further. Vaccine supplies are being monitored on a real-time basis, and state governments are being apprised regularly about it. Allegations of vaccine shortage are utterly baseless."Terming the demands made by some leaders to open up vaccination to everyone above the age of 18 'most concerning', the union health minister said the vaccination strategy was dependent on the the demand-supply dynamics. "The vaccination strategy has been drawn up after extensive deliberations and consultations in partnership with all state governments," he said.Reiterating the need to prioritise certain categories of citizens over others when it comes to vaccination, he said the supply of vaccines was limited and this was the only possible way forward."When states ask to open up vaccine supplies to everyone over 18, we must presume that they have done saturation coverage of healthcare workers, frontline workers and senior citizens. But the facts are altogether different," he said, further sharpening his attack.Maharashtra has vaccinated just only 86% of health workers with first dose, 41% with second dose, and among frontline workers, the state has vaccinated only 73% with first dose, he said."When it comes to senior citizens, Maharashtra has vaccinated just 25%, Delhi has vaccinated 30% & Punjab has vaccinated only 13%. There are 4 states/UTs that have already vaccinated more than 50%," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-no-vaccine-shortage-attempts-by-state-govts-to-spread-panic-harsh-vardhan-101617801041203.html
07-04-2021||India||Centre opens up Covid-19 vaccination at work places from April 11||The Centre has written to states to launch Covid-19 vaccinations at workplaces from Sunday, April 11, provided there is an availability of at least 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries.“…in order to increase the access of the vaccine to these populations, Covid-19 vaccination sessions may be organized at work places (both public and private) which are having about 100 eligible and willing beneficiaries by tagging these work places with an existing Covid vaccination centre (CVC). .. Please initiate due consultations with public and private sector employers and management to prepare for launch of work place vaccination. Such work place vaccination centres may be launched across states and UTs from April 11, 2021,” wrote Union health secretary, Rajesh Bhushan, to all state chief secretaries and principal secretary (health).The idea behind the move is to rapidly cover the eligible beneficiaries who are prone to getting severe Covid-19, and also to make it convenient for working professionals to access the vaccination. It will also ensure that people do not need to travel to get vaccinated, therefore, avoiding the risk of contracting the viral infection.“A substantial proportion of population aged 45 years and above are in the organized sector of the economy, and is involved in formal occupation in offices (government and private)…” the letter further read.The threshold of 100 minimum eligible beneficiaries has been set to have optimal vaccine utilization, and to avoid wastage as far as possible.It will be the responsibility of the district task force— chaired by district magistrate— and urban task force— chaired by municipal commissioner— to identify government and private workplaces after due deliberation with relevant employers and head of offices.The office management will designate an employee as a nodal officer to oversee and facilitate all aspects of the vaccination process in office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-opens-up-covid-19-vaccination-at-work-places-from-april-11-101617802947573.html
07-04-2021||India||Indian Navy to seek green light for expansion of nuke, diesel submarine fleet||The Indian Navy intends to approach the government for authorised force levels of nuclear-powered and diesel-electric attack submarines in addition to the ballistic missile submarines with Strategic Force Command (SFC), people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The navy’s new plan, inspired by a similar cabinet authorisation for 42 squadrons of the Indian Air Force, will seek approvals for 6 nuclear-powered attack submarines and 18 diesel attack submarines, a South Block official said. The authorisation for the diesel subs would include those with an air-independent propulsion system, or AIP, which ensures these submarines can remain under surface for a longer period and are quieter than the nuclear-powered submarine.The proposed move comes at a time the navy is finalising plans to seek approval from the Defence Acquisition Committee to build six nuclear-powered attack submarines, or SSNs, as part of the defence establishment’s continuing focus on expanding the navy’s capabilities to counter the rise of China’s navy in the Indian Ocean Region and beyond.India currently has only one Akula class SSN on lease from Russia, Akula-II nuclear-powered attack boat INS Chakra, and 15 diesel-electric submarines including the Scorpene-class submarine INS Kalvari. While three of the Kalvari class submarines have been commissioned, the remaining three will be fitted with the AIP system that makes the submarine more lethal than SSNs because its low radar signature minimizes the possibility of detection.The SSNs play a huge role in sea denial to the adversary and have the capability to remain under the sea without surfacing except for replenishing food stocks and other logistics.The Indian Strategic Forces Command, which is part of the Nuclear Command Authority and is responsible for the management of the country’s strategic nuclear weapons stockpile, has one 6,000 tonnes nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarine (SSBN) INS Arihant. The next SSBN, INS Arighat, is set to be commissioned in 2022, the 75th year of Independence and will have K-15 and K-4 nuclear-capable submarine-launched intermediate-range ballistic missiles on board. The K-15 is expected to have a range of up to 1,500 km while the K-4 is likely to have a maximum range of 3,500 km.Both missiles are being developed by the Defence Research and Development Organisation, or DRDO.The DRDO also has long-term plans to develop and test-fire the K5 missile, which will have a range of 5,000 km, the same range as the Agni-5 surface-to-surface missile.The SSBN is the most potent of the nuclear triad due to its survival capabilities and forms the backbone of India’s second-strike capability due to its no-first-use (NFU) policy as spelt out in the draft nuclear doctrine.India’s strategic ally France is willing to jointly design and develop SSNs with India, a partnership that will assume importance when Prime Minister Narendra Modi goes to Paris to hold a bilateral summit with President Emmanuel Macron after the completion of the India-EU summit at Lisbon on May 8. The French SSNs are based in Toulon in southern France, and its ballistic missiles submarines in the port city of Brest in northwestern France.India’s national security establishment is already in touch with its French counterparts to ensure that the Indian Navy builds up enough deterrence in the Indo-Pacific in the face of the rapidly expanding PLA Navy. The Indian Navy expects the PLA Navy to start sending carrier strike force patrols to the Indian Ocean by 2023.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-navy-to-seek-green-light-for-expansion-of-nuke-diesel-submarine-fleet-101617802467650.html

However, the outnumbered policemen escaped from the station sensing danger.The mob arrived at the police station around 11 pm on Tuesday looking to challenge the complainants-- one Raghunath Sahu and his wife Pramita Das, residents of Miyanbagh village, who were at the station complaining about the alleged ransacking of their houses by their rivals from neighbouring Mandarpur village.Remuna police station inspector Sriballav Sahu said Sahu and his wife reached the police station last night alleging their houses were ransacked by a group due to old enmity. “We were about to visit their village for an inquiry when around 150 people suddenly arrived at the police station. We immediately closed the gate but by that time 20-30 people barged into the police station and attacked the complainants leaving them critically injured,” said Sahu.The injured couple were first admitted to Remuna Community Health centre but later shifted to Balasore Medical College and Hospital after their condition deteriorated.The mob also vandalised the police station, said police. The assailants are yet to be arrested, however, a search operation has been launched based on the CCTV footage.Last month, a mob in the Jajpur district set a police jeep and a van at Balichandrapur police station on fire over enmity between two groups.

Several chief ministers have urged the Centre to reduce the age limit for vaccination.The Indian Medical Association (IMA), meanwhile, has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi suggesting that vaccination be allowed for all people above the age of 18 years."At present, we are vaccinating the population above 45 years. In view of the rapid spread of the second wave of the disease, we suggest that our vaccination strategy be geared up with immediate effect and on war footing," the IMA said in its letter to PM Modi.The nationwide inoculation drive began on January 16 this year, with healthcare and frontline workers getting the vaccine shot in the first phase. The drive was later expanded to include those above the age of 60 and 45+ with comorbidities.From April 1, the government opened the drive for everyone above the age of 45.The Union health ministry has said that India has surpassed the US to become the fastest Covid-19 vaccinating country in the world with an average daily rate of 30,93,861 doses.The cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed 8.70 crore.In India, two vaccines are being administered - Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-may-soon-organise-covid-19-vaccination-sessions-at-workplaces-101617798224468.html

Eight districts bordering Chhattisgarh accounted for the bulk of the daily caseload as the infection kept on spreading to rural areas.“This new wave of Covid virus seems more infectious and might create a devastating situation if we do not take it seriously. We will go for strict enforcement of Covid norms... to slow down the spread of the virus. DGP will deploy the police personnel in large numbers across the state in a 10-day drive to strictly enforce the Covid safety protocols as notified,” Patnaik said on Tuesday after a Covid review meeting through video conference.The state government has already rushed PG students in various medical colleges to the western Odisha districts to man the Covid hospitals.“We are now battle-hardened and I am sure we will be able to successfully tackle this resurgence of the virus.

Following a detailed probe into the matter, we nabbed the three men," he said."The three accused received ₹1.5 lakh from the ISI agent via Dubai-Mumbai 'angadia' (courier) route for setting the shops on fire," he said.Vanzara is a petty criminal and came in contact with the ISI agent through Facebook, the official said.Baba Bhai, without revealing his identity or motive, offered money to Vanzara to kill random people and set shops afire, the official claimed."Vanzara had earlier taken ₹25,000 from the ISI agent through Paytm to buy a gun," Singh said.Deputy Commissioner of Police Chaitanya Mandlik said Baba Bhai used to send friend requests to people having criminal mentality and those in need of money."We traced some of the IP addresses, used by the ISI agent to chat with Vanzara, to Karachi, which establishes the ISI connection. This was a money trap laid by them to lure Indian citizens to spread terror and cause economic losses," Mandlik said.The trio and the unidentified ISI agent, who was giving instructions to them from abroad, have been booked under Indian Penal Code Sections 121 (waging war against the government) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy), and relevant provisions of the UAPA, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paklinked-isi-terror-module-busted-in-gujarat-three-held-101617794997352.html

The district authorities have found that the people suffered from gastroenteritis after consuming water at Maremma Durgamma Devara, a folk festival at Gorakallu in Panyam block. “We have set up a health camp at Gorakallu, where 35 cases of diarrhoea were reported. A team of doctors treated 30 cases and referred the remaining five cases to Nandyal government hospital,” the DMHO said. District collector G Veerapandian directed authorities to stop drinking water supply from Gorakallu and to ensure clean and safe drinking water supply with adequate sewage management and sanitation.

An order to this effect was issued by the Madhya Pradesh transport department.On Sunday, Chouhan said that the Madhya Pradesh government will restrict the movement of people from Chhattisgarh to curb the spread of Covid-19.The high caseload in Chhattisgarh and 10 others states prompted Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to hold a meeting with health ministers of these states. After a detailed and comprehensive review of the measures taken by these states, Vardhan concluded that together they contribute to 54 per cent of the total cases and 65 per cent of the total deaths in the country.Maharashtra (25 per cent) and Chhattisgarh (14 per cent) have reported the highest positivity rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raipur-declared-a-containment-zone-tough-measures-in-place-from-apr-919-101617794429288.html

Vaze never obeyed the hierarchy of ranks to report over the cases under investigation,” the document said.Also Read: Time to clean up Mumbai | HT EditorialParam Bir Singh did not respond to phone calls and text messages sent by HT for his response to the report. This news report will be updated when he gives his reaction.Officials said the police commissioner was told to send the report to the home department after Sachin Vaze’s arrest.Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) on March 13 for his alleged role in planting a vehicle with 20 loose gelatin sticks near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, Antilia. He is the prime suspect in the murder of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who is linked to the vehicle found near Antilia. This case is also being investigated by the NIA.The police commissioner’s report, which is seen to link Param Bir Singh to the controversial police officer Sachin Vaze, immediately prompted calls to put the former city police chief’s role under scrutiny. On Wednesday, the NIA summoned Param Bir Singh for questioning in the two cases. Maharashtra Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said this was something they had been demanding for days, because of Param Bir Singh’s “close proximity” with arrested API Vaze.“It has now been established that Singh is as responsible as Vaze in these two cases,” the Congress leader said.Singh was removed as police commissioner on March 17 and shifted as commandant general of home guards. Param Bir Singh ignited a political storm soon after, with a letter to Uddhav Thackeray accusing the then home minister Anil Deshmukh of corruption. Singh later approached the Supreme Court and high court too. On Monday, Deshmukh finally had to resign after the Bombay high court asked the CBI to hold a preliminary inquiry into the allegation.Police Commissioner Hemant Nagrale’s report, sought by the home department while Deshmukh was still home minister, also links Param Bir Singh to the decision to revoke Sachin Vaze’s suspension.“The decision about the reinstatement of Vaze was taken in a suspension review committee meeting on June 5, 2020, chaired by Singh, joint police commissioner (administration) and other two senior officers. Vaze was reinstated on June 9 and was given posting in CIU, after initial appointment in the armed unit,” the report said, pointing that the then joint commissioner (Crime) had strongly opposed Vaze’s posting in the CIU.It said Param Bir Singh ensured that Vaze headed the CIU though he, unlike other police officers who led the crucial unit in the past, was not an inspector-rank officer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-vaze-took-orders-directly-from-param-bir-singh-says-mumbai-cp-s-report-101617792085083.html

Vaze's custody was ending today.He was arrested by the NIA on April 13, shortly after the agency took over the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case. He was taken into custody for his alleged role and involvement in placing the explosives-laden vehicle outside Ambani's residence Antilia in Mumbai.Hiran, the owner of the vehicle that was found containing explosives materials, was found dead on March 5 in Thane.Investigation into his death was being probed by Maharashtra Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS), till the Union home ministry handed over the probe to the NIA.The NIA sought Vaze's custody for four more days, according to news agency ANI. His lawyer said that he's not opposing NIA's demand of remand, and added that Vaze is ready to cooperate with the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in their probe.The CBI wants to question Vaze in connection with its preliminary enquiry into the allegations of corruption against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh. On Wednesday, the agency approached a special NIA court seeking permission to question the suspended police officer.Following an order of the Bombay high court, the CBI late on Tuesday night registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) to probe corruption allegations levelled by former Mumbai police chief Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh.Both Deshmukh and the Maharashtra government have approached the Supreme Court challenging the high court's order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sachin-vaze-to-remain-in-nia-custody-till-april-9-orders-court-101617790345358.html

The accused were summoned on March 24 after the court took cognisance of a supplementary charge sheet filed by the Enforcement Directorate (ED).The exemption was granted by Judge M K Nagpal after the Chidambarams' lawyer Arshdeep Singh moved an application for the same, saying the duo were 'star campaigners' of their party and were busy in the assembly election campaign in Tamil Nadu. The matter will now be heard on April 16.After being arrested by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) in the INX Media corruption case on August 21, 2019, the ED arrested P Chidambaram on October 16, 2019, in a related money-laundering case. He was granted bail in the case launched by the CBI on October 22, 2019 and in the ED case, he got bail on December 4, 2019.Meanwhile, Karti was arrested by the CBI in February 2018 and was granted bail in March 2018 in the INX Media corruption case and he was granted interim bail from the Delhi high court in the related money laundering case.The high profile case is related to the alleged irregularities in the Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) clearance granted to the INX Media group for receiving overseas funds of ₹305 crore in 2007.The Congress-led United Progressive Alliance (UPA) government was in power and P Chidambaram was the finance minister when the alleged transaction happened.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inx-media-case-delhi-court-exempts-chidambaram-son-from-personal-appearance-101617787769361.html

Every Indian deserves the chance to a safe life.” He had earlier urged people to wear masks and follow all safety precautions.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan had said on Tuesday, “The aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it, but to those who need it”.Gandhi is the latest to join the vaccination-for-all cause and demand that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government should open Covid-19 vaccination to all age groups. On Tuesday, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow all citizens above the age of 18 to get vaccinated. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also made similar requests.“It is high time that the government of India accepts what every public health expert within the country and globally has been saying— the second wave of Covid-19 is here. If having cases in excess of what we saw during the peak of the first wave in September 2020 is not a testimony to this, we wonder what else it would take for the government to accept this fact and re-strategise accordingly. The height (spike) of the Covid-19 cases is alarming, and the width (duration of the spike) of the Covid-19 cases needs to be curtailed now before this wave turns into a tsunami,’’ said Congress spokesperson Pawan Khera.The demand for opening vaccinations to everyone is becoming stronger as Covid-19 cases rise exponentially across India . India started the vaccination drive on January 16. The drive is currently in its third phase—everyone who is older than 45 is eligible to get vaccinated. Three months after it started the vaccination drive, India hit a grim milestone on Wednesday when it recorded 115,736 active Covid-19 cases, the highest since the beginning of the pandemic.India’s overall count has crossed the 12.8 million mark. Cases are rapidly increasing in Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Karnataka among others states.

Members of Manhas’ CoBRA unit, District Reserve Guard (DRG), and the Special Task Force (STF) lost their lives in the five-hour-long clash with Maoists at the Sukma-Bijapur border, with reports suggesting that around 20 insurgents were also killed. The Maoists, however, claimed that only four of their cadres were killed.“I don’t want anything. I just want my son back. Where is the government? Does the life of a Jawan has no value for this government?”, asked Manhas’ mother, who was among the protestors seeking his release.His father in law said, “For this day did we vote for this government? None has come to our rescue. He is our son in law and we want him back. How insensitive can the government be? It’s been four days since he was abducted by the Naxals on Saturday, but no one in the administration has bothered to reach out to us with an assurance”. Manhas joined the CRPF in March 2011 and got married in 2014. He has a five-year-old daughter and is the sole bread earner for his family. He was transferred to Chhattisgarh three months back from Assam. Manhas’ family first learnt about his abduction from a Chhattisgarh journalist, who called them to say that the Maoists told him that they had captured Manhas. The ultras, led by one of their top commanders, Mandvi Hidma, are said to have lured the security forces into a U shaped trap in the jungles near the Sukma-Bijapur border. The insurgents decamped with weapons, bullet-proof jackets, and even the shoes of dead soldiers after the ambush. Initial reports had then confirmed that one jawan was reported missing. Another relative said Manhas should be freed on priority as was done with the case of IAF wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman, who was released five days following his capture in Pakistan after his MiG-21 Bison was shot down after successfully intercepting a posse of Pakistani fighters over the Line of Control in the Rajouri-Mendhar sector on 27 February 2019, the day after the Balakot strike. Before the IAF pilot ejected from his ageing MiG-21 hit in the aerial dogfight over the skies of Jammu, he shot down a fourth-generation F-16 fighter. He was captured by villagers in Pakistan-occupied Kashmir where he landed and handed over to the Pakistan military. India had warned Pakistan of severe consequences if the fighter pilot was not released unharmed and immediately. Abhinandan was returned on March 1 via the heavily-guarded Wagah-Attari border post.“His mother sent him to serve the nation. We are poor people, we don’t have to do anything with politics but if the government could bring back wing commander Abhinandan Varthaman from Pakistan, then why have they been dragging their feet in getting our boy released from the captivity of Maoists,” he asked. The protestors in Jammu held tricolours and staged a sit-in at the main town chowk while shouting slogans against the BJP-led Central government and also against Jammu and Kashmir lieutenant governor (L-G) Manoj Sinha. No one from the administration was present there to meet the protesters till the filing of this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/protests-in-jammu-seeking-release-of-crpf-commando-in-maoists-captivity-101617786024848.html

The government has also banned political gatherings till the restricted period and said violators, including political leaders, will be booked under Disaster Management Act(DMA) and Epidemics Act. Punjab is one of the states of concern as said by the Union health ministry due to its major contribution to the active cases and fatalities of the country.Chief minister Amarinder Singh did not miss the opportunity to chide leaders like Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, SAD’s Sukhbir Singh Badal, and expressed surprise at their behaviour for attending political rallies without adhering to Covid safety protocol, at a time when the virus is spreading so fast in the country.Also Read | Rahul Gandhi bats for Covid vaccine for all; slams Centre’s ‘need vs want’ logic“How do you expect people to be serious about the spread of the disease if senior political leaders behave like this,” Singh said, adding that the government would need to be tough to tackle such violations and book the political leaders as well, in case of any violations.Ordering the police and district administrations to register cases against the leaders, organisers, and participants of the gatherings under the Disaster Management Act and Epidemics Act, he said even the venue owners, who would provide space for such events, will not be spared. They too would be booked, and their venues will be sealed for three months.The state government also put a cap on the number of attendees at funerals, cremations, and weddings to 50 people indoors and 100 outdoors. Wearing masks is now mandatory for all government employees while in the office. The new restrictions, with the curbs already in place like the closure of schools and educational institutions, except medical and nursing colleges, will remain effective till April 30.The chief minister during his weekly review of the Covid-19 situation said it is a matter of concern that over 85 per cent of the cases in the state are of the UK strain, which he said is more contagious and virulent.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Other curbs imposed in the state include a ban on social, cultural, or sports gatherings and related functions, in-person public dealing to be restricted in all government offices, and virtual modes of grievance redressal encouraged.

Prior to the pandemic, the state witnessed close to eight million domestic tourists and more than nine hundred thousand foreign tourists.“For now, we don’t have permission, but if we get the permission, then we are ready to vaccinate all those working in the tourism industry,” Sawant added.Various sectors in the state, including manufacturing and services, have been seeking the expansion of the vaccination drive to cover those who come in contact with customers while working, said the CM.“Being a touristic state and given that the economy has only now begun to revive, we are only advising people to avoid and restrict gatherings,” Sawant said, when asked whether tourists arriving in the state should be made to produce Covid negative certificates upon arrival, a demand that is being made by civil society in the state.Sawant said the police have been told to crackdown on those not wearing masks in crowded places like markets, bus stands and other public places, even beaches.“Enforcement will be done in a big way. It’s not that Covid is coming from the tourists only. Covid is spreading internally in the state as well. Our people should also not mix up with tourists,” Sawant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-seeks-permission-to-vaccinate-all-tourism-sector-workers-irrespective-of-age-101617777804308.html

The bench of Justice Pratibha M Singh said a mask acts as Suraksha Kavach, which would prevent the spread of the deadly virus."Wearing of a mask of a face cover in a vehicle, which may be occupied by either a single person or multiple persons, is... compulsory in the context of the Covid-19 pandemic," the order said.Also watch | 'Delhi Police will strictly enforce night curfew, issue fresh passes': PRO﻿While dismissing the petitions, the court also chided the lawyers of the petitions challenging the mandatory mask rule.

07-04-2021||India||Vivad se Vishwas solved 1.48 lakh legacy disputes, ₹54K crore recovered: CBDT||The direct tax dispute resolution scheme ‘Vivad se Vishwas’ (from dispute to trust) has settled more than 1.48 lakh cases and recovered 54% of about ₹1 lakh crore amount under litigation, Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Pramod Chandra Mody said on Tuesday.“The scheme has been successful as its objective was to reduce pending income tax litigation, generate timely revenue and provide taxpayers peace of mind,” he said.The scheme started on March 17, 2020 and closed on March 31 this year. However, taxpayers, who have already made declarations within the stipulated deadline of March 31, can make payments without any penalty or interest up to April 30, 2021.The Vivad se Vishwas scheme provides for the settlement of disputed tax, interest, penalty or fees in relation to an assessment or reassessment order. It grants immunity to taxpayers from levy of interest, penalty and institution of any proceeding for prosecution for any offence under the Income-Tax Act in respect of matters covered in the declaration.According to an official data, the government received a total 1,33,837 applications under the scheme, involving a total of 1,48,690 disputes. 1,45,237 disputes were related to appeals by assesses and 3,453 were related to appeals by the income-tax department. While the total disputed amount was ₹1,00,437 crore, the government received ₹54,005 crore in payments against the disputed tax. As on January 31, 2020, there were over 5.10 lakh litigations pending in various forums involving over ₹19.5 lakh crore. CBDT chairman Mody said that disputes over assessments were the root cause of litigation and technology and faceless assessments were making the process more objective, which was likely to reduce disputes.Abhishek A Rastogi, partner at law firm Khaitan & Company, said, “Vivad se Vishwas scheme has been a successful scheme that resolved several litigations quickly and settled the matter amicably. Any other approach would have prolonged these litigations.”Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced the scheme in the Union budget presented on February 1, 2020 with the aim to resolve legacy disputes involving direct taxes. Under the scheme, penalty and interest were to be waived if the disputed amount was paid before the stipulated date.“This year, I propose to bring a scheme similar to the indirect tax scheme ‘Sabka Vishwas’ for reducing litigations even in the direct taxes,” Sitharaman said in her budget speech last year. On July 5, 2019, Sitharaman had proposed the ‘Sabka Vishwas’ legacy dispute resolution scheme for excise and service tax, which resulted in settling at least 189,000 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vivad-se-vishwas-solved-1-48-lakh-legacy-disputes-rs-54k-crore-recovered-cbdt-101617771264152.html

Ansari’s return to Banda jail was in compliance with a March 26 Supreme Court order directing his transfer to UP where he faces trials in several criminal cases.The nearly 840 kilometre road journey took a little over 14 hours with Ansari, a five term MLA, in an ambulance that was part of the motorcade comprising GPS-enabled Vajra anti-riot vehicle, and gun-toting security personnel. About 100 policemen, including two deputy superintendents of police, and six sub inspectors, escorted the Bahujan Samaj Party MLA from Mau. The motorcade made only two stoppages in Agra – where drivers were changed – and then briefly in Satti in Kanpur. Also Read | ‘Mukhtar Ansari was given poison in same Banda jail,’ says his brotherAccording to Banda circle officer (CO) Banda Rakesh Singh, only the ambulance carrying Ansari and another vehicle were allowed to go inside the heavily guarded jail gates. Banda jail superintendent PK Tripathi said Ansari has been kept away from others in barrack number 15. He said security staff around Ansari would be sporting body worn cameras. Before being shifted out to Punjab jail two years ago, Ansari was lodged in this jail. While he was served food from outside then, this time, for security and medical reasons, he would be served prison food, jail officials said. Earlier new CCTV cameras were installed in Banda jail. “All the 19 cameras inside the jail have been changed or repaired,” a jail staff said, adding that strict watch was being kept on all visitors. A day ago, Ansari’s wife, Afshan Ansari, approached the Supreme Court, seeking a direction to the UP Police to “not kill” her husband in a fake encounter and allow him to face a “free and fair trial”. She pleaded that Ansari be provided security also during his transportation to court for trial proceedings. Her plea is likely to come up for hearing within a week or so.

The CBI initially formed a five-member SIT, in which two officers of National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) – including senior superintendent of police Mahesh Bhardwaj – were later included as members. The SC released Bhardwaj from SIT last month. In its application filed in the apex court on January 7 this year, reviewed by HT, CBI said the “SIT has investigated these cases with all sincerity, seriousness and full devotion to unearth the truth”. The anti-corruption probe agency added “these cases have been investigated with full objectivity and comprehensively to investigate all allegations of use of excessive force or retaliatory force by uniformed personnel resulting in the death of any person”. Requesting the SC to allow its officers to do other work in the agency, it said, “In view of the prevailing Covid-19 situation and ever-increasing workload of CBI, the already over-stretched resources of CBI are to be used optimally”. Expressing its helplessness in taking all the cases to conclusion, CBI said these cases are “years/decades old and are of special nature to the extent that these cannot be investigated only on the basis of documents.” “Circumstantial evidence, oral testimony of the eyewitness (if any) and other relevant witnesses, opinion of medico-legal experts, forensic experts and other scientific evidence are very important for proper investigation of such kind of cases,” CBI said. It said Covid-19 induced lockdowns and restrictions also affected its work but it is trying to complete the investigation at the earliest. The agency further said that SIT’s superintendent of police LS Padmakumar and deputy SP VPS Mann were superannuated in May 2019 and June 2020 respectively while inspector Amar Saxena has passed away.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/manipur-probe-almost-over-allow-sit-officers-to-do-other-work-cbi-to-sc-101617768564054.html

07-04-2021||India||Goa Speaker to decide on disqualification of 10 MLAs who joined BJP on April 20||Speaker of the Goa assembly, Rajesh Patnekar, told the Supreme Court of India that his final order in the disqualification petitions, filed by the Congress party against 10 Goa BJP MLAs, will be passed by April 20. The SC bench headed by the Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde had earlier twice rejected the dates proposed by the speaker. When the hearing began, solicitor general (SG) Tushar Mehta told the court that the speaker’s final orders will be delivered on April 29, however, the bench said such a late date was “not acceptable”. “The court again asked the SG to check with the speaker whether he is able to pass the order within a weeks’ time. The SG said the speaker can do it by April 22,” said advocate Abhijit Gosavi, who represented the Congress party. However, the court asked the SG to once again seek instructions from the Speaker whether orders could be passed latest by April 20, following which, Mehta informed the court that the order will be passed on April 20th. SC has set April 21 as the next date of hearing in the case and the judgement is expected before April 22, when the CJI retires. The SC is hearing a plea by Goa Congress president Girish Chodankar seeking directions to the Speaker of the Legislative Assembly to expeditiously hear the disqualification petitions filed against 10 MLAs, who switched from the Congress to the BJP in July 2019, reducing the party’s strength in the house to five. The party claims the switch amounted to a defection under the 10th schedule of the Constitution as there was no merger of the original party.As per the anti-defection law, two-thirds of the strength of a legislative party is allowed to merge with another without inviting disqualification. The law, amended in January 2004, does not recognise a split in a legislature party.The then Leader of Opposition (LoP) in the Goa assembly, Congress’s Chandrakant Kavlekar joined the BJP on July 10 along with nine other MLAs--Atanasio Monserrate, Jennifer Monserrate, Filipe Neri Rodrigues, Nilkanth Halarnkar, Francisco Silveira, Clafasio Dias, Isidore Fernandes, Wilfred D’Sa and Tony Fernandes. Chief minister Pramod Sawant, said the 10 MLAs had merged with the BJP, increasing the strength of the party to 27 in the state assembly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-speaker-to-decide-on-disqualification-of-10-mlas-who-joined-bjp-on-april-20-101617766883857.html

07-04-2021||India||World Health Day: Address inequities to build a healthier world, says WHO||At a high-level virtual event on World Health Day on Wednesday, the health ministers of countries in south-east Asia, including India, will commit to “building a fairer and healthier world”, the theme for this year’s event.The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked the countries in the south-east Asia region to prioritise actions to address inequities compounded by the ongoing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic.“Covid-19 is just the latest disease to expose, exploit and exacerbate inequities that negatively impact health and socioeconomic outcomes between and among vulnerable groups. Understanding and overcoming the many social and economic determinants of health is becoming critical in our efforts to achieve universal health coverage,” said Dr Poonam Khetrapal Singh, regional director, WHO south-east Asia.World Health Day is celebrated every year on April 7, with a different theme.Also Read | Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru: These cities are under curbs as Covid-19 cases riseThe United Nations health body stressed the need for collecting quality data to be able to take timely action.“We must enhance the collection and use of timely and reliable health data that is disaggregated by gender, age, income, education, migratory status and disability among other factors,” said Khetrapal Singh.India on Monday launched Integrated Health Information Platform (IHIP), the revised next generation Integrated Disease Surveillance Programme (IDSP) that is totally digital, in line with Union health ministry’s National Digital Health Mission.Instead of manually collecting data on infectious diseases, the new platform will upload and collate data digitally that will help pick up any clustering in realtime, and in turn avert a potential outbreak in the country. Also, the number of diseases to be covered as part of the country’s disease surveillance programme has been extended to 33, from the existing 18.Another key measure suggested by WHO is for the countries to strengthen their primary health care delivery system.“The launch of health and wellness centres under the government’s Ayushman Bharat Yojana will serve the exact same purpose, to be able to deliver primary health care at the grassroots level; making healthcare accessible even in hard-to-reach areas,” said a senior government official. The UN body also suggested that there was a need for countries to act beyond national borders, and strengthen regional and global health security.“As a new wave of infection is spreading across the region, there is a need for countries to come together, and strengthen the basic public health measures that are known to work, while also accelerating vaccine rollouts. Nearly 86 million people in the region have now received their first dose and more than 14 million have received both doses,” said Khetrapal Singh.“...The region continues to make rapid and sustained progress against diseases of poverty and marginalisation... All people have the right to achieve the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health. A fairer and healthier region and world is possible,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/world-health-day-address-inequities-to-build-a-healthier-world-says-who-101617765205072.html

The Indian Army also wants to resolve long-standing patrolling issues at Depsang Bulge due to friction in the area during the 2013 stand-off with the People’s Liberation Army.“The dialogue will most probably take place on Friday (April 9) but a confirmation is still awaited from the PLA side,” said a senior official. He, however, insisted that there is no delay from the Chinese side.While the situation on both banks of Pangong Tso is stable with the PLA and Indian Army going back to pre-April 2020 positions, a score of Chinese soldiers is still to restore status quo ante in the Gogra-Hot Springs area, or patrolling points 15 and 17 as per the Indian military lexicon.Also Read| ‘Russia closely watching LAC developments’: Foreign minister Sergey LavrovThe last round of military talks to resolve border tensions that began last May was held on February 20. This meeting stretched for 16 hours and ended with two sides agreeing that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided them with a “good basis” to resolve the outstanding issues at friction points in “a steady and orderly” manner.Indian Army commanders believe that the differences between the two sides at the Gogra-Hot Springs area were relatively a minor issue as compared to the diversion of views on the strategic heights on both banks Pangong Tso. But there is recognition that the talks could go either way though the army has approached the dialogue with an open mind.The 11th round of military talks comes at a time China is concerned about the QUAD security dialogue and the effort to raise the pressure on Beijing to loosen its hold over Taiwan and the South China Sea. Leaders of the four-member Quad grouping — the United States, India, Japan and Australia — held their first summit on March 12 to address concerns about Beijing’s growing economic and military heft. A meeting of US-China officials at Anchorage on March 18 also ended acrimoniously, making it clear that there was no possibility of a revival in US-China bilateral ties in a hurry despite the change in the White House.Also Read| China sees a 'weak India', says Rahul, explains why Cong is not winning pollTo add to China’s concern is the concerted effort by powers such as France and the United Kingdom to expand their footprint in the Indo-Pacific and India playing a pivotal role in the region, particularly in the Indian Ocean. Navies of France-plus Quad countries are already in the middle of exercises in the Bay of Bengal, with French carrier strike force led by aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle. The French nuclear-powered aircraft carrier will participate in the trilateral naval exercise along with the Indian and the United Arab Emirates navies in the strategically important Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman later this month.Officials suggest it is not clear these developments would impact the military talks. With both the US and China accusing each other of grand-standing at the Anchorage meeting last month, the PLA may either harden its stance or soften its attitude towards the resolution of Gogra-Hot Springs. The Indian Army, which has prepared for a long haul at the friction points, is also keeping a close watch on the entire 3488 km LAC as most stand-offs with PLA take place in April and May during exercises in Tibet and Xinjiang by the Western Theatre Command based in Chengdu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/next-round-of-military-talks-on-lac-row-likely-on-april-9-101617760450954.html

07-04-2021||India||Karnataka bus strike from today, public transport likely to be affected||Under the banner of Karnataka State Road Transport Employees League, workers of Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC), Karnataka State Road Transport Corporation (KSRTC), North Western Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NWKRTC) and North Eastern Karnataka Road Transport Corporation (NEKRTC), have given a call for an indefinite strike from Wednesday citing state government’s failure to implement salary system under the 6th pay commission for the workers of road transportation corporation. The strike is likely to affect public transport in the state.Here’s everything you need to know about the Karnataka transport strike from Wednesday:1. Karnataka chief minister B S Yediyurappa appealed to road transportation corporation workers not to hold the strike. “We have fulfilled eight out of your (workers) nine demands. We have to work together for the welfare of the people. Without giving room for the government to take strict measures, drop the strike and cooperate with the administration,” CM Yediyurappa said on Tuesd.2. The Karnataka government has warned of strict action against the workers if the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) restrictions are not followed. "There are Covid-19 restrictions in place and a notification has already been issued under the Disaster Management Act stating that people cannot gather in groups. If it is violated, action will be taken under the act, also IPC, police act among others," state chief secretary Kumar said. "Their demand for implementation of the sixth pay commission report, and thereby give them the salary on par with the government employees, cannot be accepted," Kumar added.3. With the aim to reduce inconvenience of the general public, the state government has made alternative arrangements for transport by roping in private operators. The government has also deployed more trains to places like Kalaburagi, Belagavi, Hubballi, Mysuru among others.4. The state government has also allowed the state road transport corporation to hire private buses and school buses for transportation, according to news agency ANI.5. The government has also said that strict action will be taken against autos and cabs if they charge higher fares taking advantage of the transport strike. Keeping in account the same, the government has issued a notification fixing cab and bus fares.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-bus-strike-from-today-public-transport-likely-to-be-affected-101617756569775.html
07-04-2021||India||‘Glad we took it’: Odisha couple urges others to dispel rumours about vaccine||Last year, Shiva Prasad Rath lost three relatives — a sister and two brothers-in-law — to the coronavirus disease. “All in a period of eight months,” said Rath, a 73-year-old former government employee from Odisha. “It was just horrific.”Rath lives with his wife, Swapna (64), in Bhubaneswar. The Raths could not attend the last rites of their relatives, two of which took place in September. In November, another sister and brother-in-law were hospitalised; this time, his sister survived, but her husband died.At the time, the caseload in Odisha was 294,457; as of April 6, 2021, the number of cases in the state is 343,856 and 1,975 people have died till date.“It was so scary,” said Swapna, a teacher, who stopped giving tuition classes when the lockdown began on March 25, 2020. “I didn’t even see the front gate of my house [for several months],” Rath said, alluding to how they stayed indoors through the lockdown and even after it was lifted. They got their vegetables delivered, they put off a visit to the cardiologist — necessary for Rath who had a stent inserted a decade ago — and they avoided all public places, including temples.The fear, said the Raths, was also driven by the number of messages over social media messaging platforms that began to circulate shortly after the vaccination drive started in the country. “There were so many videos and messages. One said that people with high blood pressure would fall down senseless after getting a shot; one said there were no guarantees of whether there would be any side-effects after vaccination,” Swapna said.Rath had an additional worry. The Covaxin fact sheet states that people on blood thinners should inform their health care providers. Initially, this led to widespread confusion about whether there were certain drugs that had contraindications for vaccination. The ICMR subsequently issued a clarification towards the end of January that both Covid vaccines — Covaxin and Covishield — approved for use in India were safe for people on such medication.All the same, Rath went to a doctor just to be sure, and the doctor advised him to take the jab.On March 25, the Raths visited a vaccination centre at the Hi-Tech Medical College & Hospital, close to their home, and got their first dose of the vaccine. “The process was very easy,” Rath said.Rath experienced some degree of tiredness after taking the shot. “I think it was psychological...,” Swapna said, adding that she only felt a little pain in the arm after the shot.The companies manufacturing these vaccines — Bharat Biotech (Covaxin) and Serum Institute of India (Covishield) — have published a list of possible side effects the respective vaccines could lead to. These range from pain at the injection site to chills, body ache and nausea.It was a very good thought, Swapna said, to think of senior citizens as the first group after health care workers, to get the shot. The main lesson from the pandemic, Swapna said, was that it is possible to take care of oneself — healthy diet, regular exercise, and “wearing masks at all times” but that “a little bit of fear [of the pandemic] is also a good thing, because it ensures that we follow rules”.The Raths rue the fact that the “younger generation” doesn’t wear masks or maintains social distancing anymore.“But there is nothing scary about taking the vaccine. We’re glad we did it, said Swapna.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/glad-we-took-it-odisha-couple-urges-others-to-dispel-rumours-about-vaccine-101617757522712.html

These 11 states together contributed 54% of the total cases and 65% of the total deaths in the country, with a disproportionately high number of deaths in Maharashtra and Punjab,” he added.Also Read| Jab for those who ‘need’ it, not those who ‘want’ it: CentreOn Tuesday, India added a record 115,320 new cases, to take its overall tally of cases to 11,789,781; 630 people died from Covid-19 on Tuesday. Of these, Maharashtra topped with 55,469, followed by Chhattisgarh (9,921). A high test positivity rate, of about 25%, has been reported from Maharashtra, and 14% from Chhattisgarh. He pointed out that since February 2021, these states have witnessed a steep increase in cases, a majority of which has been reported among people between the ages of 15 and 44. Also, a majority of the deaths have been reported among those above 60, he added.The minister also appreciated the fact that states were trying to increase the number of Covid-19 testing, but cautioned against the high rapid antigen testing proportion in Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh and Maharashtra. He assured to help the states in containing the spread of the virus. “The Centre has been and shall continue to support the States and UTs through all possible recourses to fight the global pandemic. While the cases are on the rise since the past few weeks, the national cumulative fatality rate has become 1.30% now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/weddings-farm-stir-polls-causing-surge-in-covid-cases-health-minister-101617753768129.html
07-04-2021||India||Brothers in arms in Maoist ambush: One looks for sibling, other mourns his loss||Raipur: Around 1.30pm on Saturday, as Maoist bullets rained on security forces in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, Hemant Andrik met his elder brother, Kishore.The siblings, both district reserve guard ( DRG) personnel, were exhausted. For 90 minutes, they had been firing relentlessly to break free from an U-shaped ambush that eventually killed 22 personnel.Hemant and four members of his team had just shot their way from lower ground onto a hillock and were resting, when they saw Kishore and four members of his team approach from another direction. At the time, around 350 personnel were still trapped by the surprise attack at the borders of Sukma and Bijapur districts.They stopped, greeted each other, and chatted for a few minutes. “We had broken the ambush…Kishore bhaiyya and his team were on the hilltop and firing to give us cover. Ten minutes later, Kishore bhaiyya came down with his team and we met near a rock. I told him to keep moving and meet me around 300 metres ahead,” Hemant said.It was the last time they saw each other.The brothers decided to rendezvous at a small hut nearby that soldiers frequented to drink water. But as Hemant advanced through the gunfire, he found it increasingly difficult to dodge bullets, and was separated from his team. “There was continuous firing from both sides. Maoists were using Under Barrel Grenade Launcher (UBGL) hence it was not easy to move ahead…I told my brother to move... It was sheer luck that I was not hit and managed to cross the ambush,” Hemant said. But in the frenzy, he could not stop at the hut, and moved ahead.When Kishore reached the hut, he stopped for a sip of water, and asked the soldiers present if they had seen Hemant. When they replied in the negative, Kishore determined that his younger brother must have been hit by the Maoists, and decided to go back into the gunfire to rescue him. “The other soldiers requested him not to go in the ambush again, but he told them he has to save his brother,” Hemant said.“I should have stopped at the hut, come what may,” he added, filled with regret.Around 3pm, Hemant returned to the Terrem camp, where helicopters were rescuing the injured. He waited for his brother, but in vain. Eventually, he asked other soldiers if they had seen Kishore, but no one had. “They told me my brother might be with some other team because all teams were scattered after the ambush,” he said.He waited until 9pm, when other soldiers told him that Kishore was asking for him at the hut, and had likely walked back into the attack. Hemant was still hopeful of his elder brother being alive, but on Sunday morning, Kishore’s body was discovered.The brothers resided in Cherlapal village of Bijapur district; Hemant joined the DRG in 2012 while his brother was inducted about 18 months earlier. Kishore is survived by his wife, who is pregnant with their first child.Senior officials confirmed the events. “Kishore was a brave jawan and was also with me for some time. He went inside the ambush again after not finding his brother and died. This is very painful,” said Abhishek Singh, a deputy superintendent of police in Bijapur district .Since Saturday, Hemant hasn’t been able to sleep. “Kishore bhaiyya was brave and ultimate fighter. He loved me so much. I can’t believe he’s gone,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-ambush-one-goes-to-look-for-missing-sibling-other-mourns-his-loss-101617750429900.html
07-04-2021||India||India, Russia discuss ways to strengthen strategic ties||India and Russia on Tuesday discussed ways to deepen military and strategic cooperation, including manufacturing of Russian military hardware in the country and the start of talks on creating a free trade area between India and the Eurasian Economic Union.These matters figured in the meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov, the focus of whose visit to New Delhi was preparations for the annual India-Russia Summit to be held in the country later this year.“We talked about the longstanding partnership in nuclear, space and defence sectors... We spoke of connectivity, including the International North-South Transport Corridor and the Chennai-Vladivostok Eastern Maritime Corridor,” Jaishankar told a joint news conference after the talks. Lavrov said the two sides discussed military cooperation, including the expansion of the manufacturing of state-of-the-art Russian weapons in India under the “Make in India” and “Atmanirbhar Bharat” initiatives. “In this strategically important area, Russia is a major foreign contractor for India. We are the only partner that indeed transfers to India cutting edge military technology,” he said. “Deepening of military cooperation serves national interests of both countries. At the same time, we respect the right of our Indian friends to diversify ties in this area,” he said.Jaishankar said India’s “defence sector requirements in the past year were expeditiously addressed” by Russia – an apparent reference to the country’s emergency military needs amid the border standoff with China in Ladakh sector.According to a recent estimate by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), Russia was the most-affected supplier as India’s arms imports fell 33% between 2011-15 and 2016-20.Responding to a question on reported US pressure on India to prevent military-technical cooperation with Russia, Lavrov said: “We did not discuss these statements from the US, instead we confirmed that we are going to deepen our military cooperation.”Did not meet PMLavrov did not have an interaction with the Indian Prime Minister, usually a standard feature for a visit to New Delhi by a senior Russian leader. The people familiar of the developments sought to play down the matter, saying no such meeting was scheduled as the PM Narendra Modi was away in West Bengal to address public meetings at Cooch Behar and Howrah as part of the BJP’s campaign for the state elections. There were no indications of differences at the joint press conference with both Lavrov and Jasishankar giving a positive readout on their discussions.Lavrov said the two sides had also agreed on joint efforts to tackle a decline in mutual trade due to the Covid-19 pandemic. They also discussed cooperation in nuclear energy, space, including manned programmes, building rocket engines and satellite navigation, and transportation infrastructure projects in Russia’s Far East and the Arctic, he said.Vaccine contractsCollaboration on Covid-19 vaccines figured in the talks, and Lavrov noted that the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) has signed contracts with several Indian firms to manufacture about 750 million doses of the Sputnik V vaccine. He didn’t rule out further cooperation to cover manufacturing of Indian vaccines in Russia, while Jaishankar said a decision would be made by regulatory authorities of both sides. “For us, were those vaccines to be made in India, it would be one more affirmation of the importance of ‘Make in India’ and our own vaccine capacities,” Jaishankar said. The Russian minister also conveyed a message from President Valdimir Putin to Prime Minister Narendra Modi and invited Jaishankar to visit Russia. Former ambassador Vishnu Prakash said there are various difficulties associated with infrastructure development projects in Russia’s Far East and the proposed free trade area with the Eurasian Economic Union. “Besides India’s resource constraints, there’s also the influence of China. It won’t be easy for us to compete with China’s financial resources and economic muscle-flexing. Russia itself has been concerned about increasing Chinese influence in these areas,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-russia-discuss-ways-to-strengthen-strategic-ties-101617740732350.html
07-04-2021||India||French investigator shelved graft probe into Rafale jet deal: Report||The former head of the financial crimes branch of France’s public prosecution services shelved an investigation into alleged evidence of corruption in the ₹58,000-crore Rafale jet deal with India despite the objection of colleagues, according to a French media report on Tuesday.This was the second in a three-part report by Mediapart, which earlier reported Dassault Aviation, makers of the Rafale, paid a million euros to a person described as a “middleman” in connection with the deal for 36 jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF).Mediapart contended the payment was made for manufacturing 50 large models of Rafale jets, though Dassault provided inspectors of French anti-corruption agency Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA) no proof that these replicas were made.Éliane Houlette, former head of the financial crimes branch of the public prosecution services, justified her decision to shelve the investigations as preserving “the interests of France, the workings of institutions”, Mediapart reported.French President Emmanuel Macron and his predecessor, François Hollande, were cited in allegations levelled in the case, the report said.Houlette was provided a legal statement in October 2018 by a Paris-based anti-corruption NGO called Sherpa, which alerted her office to a “suspected and potentially far-reaching scam involving the French state” and Dassault, the report said.Sherpa reported, citing media revelations, about “suspected corruption, including money laundering, influence peddling and favouritism” surrounding the sale of Rafale jets to India.The statement by Sherpa – called a “signalement”, which in France is a form of official alert about suspected criminal behaviour that can be filed by entities which aren’t direct victims of the alleged crime – was “politically highly sensitive, not only because it centred on a massive arms deal agreed between governments, but also because it threatened possible ramifications” for Macron, Hollande, and Jean-Yves Le Drian, who served as Hollande’s defence minister and is currently foreign minister, the report added.Mediapart cited documents and first-hand accounts to contend that following the “potentially explosive alert” from Sherpa, Houlette made “no serious attempts to investigate the suspicions of corruption and favouritism surrounding the Rafale deal”, though she held an informal meeting with a lawyer representing Dassault.In June 2019, shortly before leaving her post, Houlette closed the preliminary investigation into Sherpa’s complaint, citing the “absence” of any offence. The move went against the advice of the deputy prosecutor in-charge of the case, who “refused to write up the official notification of it being dropped”, Mediapart reported.Houlette’s decision was validated by two magistrates of the Paris public prosecution services and enacted by her successor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/french-investigator-shelved-graft-probe-into-rafale-jet-deal-report-101617736100937.html
07-04-2021||India||Covid: Gujarat imposes new curbs as HC says situation going ‘out of control’||With Covid-19 cases breaching the 3,000-mark for the second consecutive day, the Gujarat government on Tuesday announced a night curfew from 8 pm to 6 am in 20 cities from Wednesday till April 30.The government’s decision came hours after the high court cited that the virus situation was getting “out of control” and suggested that a curfew or lockdown be imposed for a few days to break the infection chain.In its order, the government restricted the crowd at weddings to 100 people and to 50 for political and social functions. It also directed government offices to remain closed on all Saturdays for this month.Taking note of the surge in cases earlier in the day, Chief Justice Vikram Nath had said: “The issue is that things are going out of control. Now this time, Ahmedabad is in pretty bad state with 700-plus cases yesterday (Monday).”“It would be a situation where again a lockdown will have to (come)... May be three-four day of curfew or a lockdown may, you know, check the situation at the moment. Then you can open it after three-four days. But, two or three days of curfew will help I think,” he added.Advocate-General Kamal Trivedi, who was representing the state, said the government would suitably respond to the suggestions on weekend curfew but pointed that a lockdown could increase the hardships faced by the people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/guj-imposes-new-curbs-as-hc-says-situation-going-out-of-control-101617735980889.html
07-04-2021||India||Days after ambush, Maoists say missing jawan in their custody||RAIPUR The Maoists on Tuesday evening released a statement confirming that the missing CoBRA (Commando Battalion for Resolute Action) commando is in their custody and sought the appointment of a mediator to whom he could be handed over.On Saturday, 22 members of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF)’s elite CoBRA unit, District Reserve Guard (DRG), and the Special Task Force (STF) lost their lives in a five-hour long clash with Maoists, with reports suggesting that around 20 Maoists were also killed. The Maoists, however, claimed in their statement that only four of their cadres were killed.One trooper was missing and it was believed he was abducted by the Maoists, which the Tuesday release by the CPI (Maoist) confirmed. The missing CoBRA commando, Rakeshwar Singh Manhas is from Jammu.”The jawan has not been located till now . A searching drive is underway. We got information through a Maoist press release about a jawan in their custody. We are still verifying the press release and appropriate decisions will be taken accordingly,” inspector general of Bastar, P Sunderaj, said.In 2012, Hyderabad-based professor G Hargopal and former Indian Administrative Service (IAS) officer B D Sharma had acted as mediators when Sukma collector Alex Paul Menon was abducted by the rebels.Shubharashu Chaudhary, a peace activist working in Bastar, believes that local journalists should be roped in to hold talks as soon as possible. “Local journalists should be appointed by the government as a mediator as soon as possible “Chaudhary said.A press note issued by Maoist Dandakaranya Special Zonal Committee, said: “The state government should appoint interlocutor, we will then handover the jawan to them. Until then, the jawan will be safe in the custody of Jantana Sarkar”.The statement added that four Maoist cadres were killed in Saturday’s encounter and that they seized a huge number of arms and ammunition after the attack.“Total 14 weapons and around 2,000 bullets were seized after the encounter,” the statement said. It also claimed that at least 150 villagers have been killed in operations of security forces since November 2020.In Saturday’s encounter, out of the 22 deaths, the CRPF lost eight men, including seven commandos of CoBRA and one jawan of the Bastariya battalion; eight of the other deceased were from the DRG and six from the STF.On Monday, Sunderaj said the state police were committed to bringing the commando back if reports of him being abducted were confirmed.Meanwhile, the family members of the jawan have appealed to his abductors to release him.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/days-after-ambush-maoists-say-missing-jawan-in-their-custody-101617735860907.html
07-04-2021||India||After protests, new orders puts J&K DDC chiefs at par with mayors||The Jammu and Kashmir administration on Tuesday issued a revised warrant of precedence, placing the status of chiefs of the district development councils (DDCs) at par with those of the mayors of the Jammu and Srinagar municipal corporations.The order, which was issued by the Hospitality and Protocol Department, came nearly a month after the newly-elected DDC members staged a protest over the issue of protocol and monthly honorarium.The latest warrant of precedence also places DDC chairmen above Members of Parliament in terms of precedence.Besides this, the order also put ”District Magistrates, Officers of the rank of Brigadiers and equivalent, Major Heads of Department, Conservator of Forests, District & Session Judges, Chairpersons, Block Development Councils, Presidents of Municipal Councils and Municipalities under the same protocol.”In the maiden DDC polls in the Union territory, Farooq Abdullah-led People’s Alliance for Gupkar Declaration (PAGD) won 110 seats while the Bharatiya Janata Party emerged as the single largest party by securing 75 seats,On March 9, the newly-elected DDC members, irrespective of their parties, boycotted a two-day programme and staged a protest against the warrant of precedence. Some of them also demanded a hike in their honorarium.“This is our insult and humiliation,” Shabir Ahmad Lone, DDC member from Rafiabad, said then.The protest was, however, called off a day later following an assurance by Lt Governor Sinha to address the issue.The old honorarium ensured ₹35,000 per month to a DDC chairperson, ₹25,000 per month to vice chairperson and ₹15,000 per month to a DDC member. The new honorarium is yet to be released.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-protests-new-orders-puts-j-k-ddc-chiefs-at-par-with-mayors-101617735800830.html
07-04-2021||India||Another record, over 115,000 new Covid cases in India in one day||India set yet another record for daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), with 115,320 new infections reported across the country on Tuesday – the second time in three days that the country has broken previous single-day case records, highlighting the dangerous rate at which the second wave is growing.The previous record for daily cases (103,796) was set on Saturday when new infections in the country had crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time since the start of the outbreak.A total of 630 new deaths were reported across India on Tuesday, taking the total number of fatalities due to the viral outbreak in the country to 166,229, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.The number of active cases in the country, meanwhile, also continued to surge as the recoveries failed to keep up with the huge surge in cases. As of Tuesday night, there are 843,754 active cases of Covid-19 in India.After Tuesday's tally, the seven-day average of new cases across India is 93,041 – just shy of the record high of 93,617 on September 16, 2020, considered the peak of the first wave. At the current pace, the trajectory appears set to surpass the previous peak on Wednesday. India is currently the world’s biggest Covid-19 hot spot, having surpassed the rate of daily cases in the US and Brazil last week.India’s second wave of Covid started around the third week of February, and since then, the alarming rate of new infections has forced several state government to reintroduce curbs on social movements. The rate at which cases have been rising, however, has been far more rapid than in the first wave.Maharashtra, India’s hardest-hit state, continued to dominate daily statistics with 55,469 new infections on Tuesday. With 9,921 new cases on Tuesday, Chhattisgarh had the second-highest number of daily infections in the country. Both of these states have seen their seven-day averages (48,560 and 5,949, respectively) surpass the peak of the first wave.Along with these two, three other states have so far surpassed their peaks from the first wave – Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab. The seven-day average of daily infections in these states is 2,791, 2,970 and 2,895, respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/another-record-115k-new-covid-cases-in-one-day-101617735560795.html
07-04-2021||India||‘Outstretched’ SII chief seeks ₹3,000-crore fillip to boost supply||At a time when the demand for the Covid-19 vaccine is rising in the country amid a surge in new cases, the chief executive officer of Serum Institute of India (SII), Adar Poonawalla, on Tuesday said that the company was “very outstretched” for capacity at the moment.He added that SII needed around ₹3,000 crore to scale up production from the current capacity of 60 to 65 million per month, and that the process would take roughly three months.“We are supplying the vaccine in the Indian market at approximately ₹ 150-160. The average price of the vaccine is approximately $20 ( ₹1,500)... because of the Modi government’s request, we are providing vaccines at subsidised rates... It is not that we are not making profits... but we are not making a super profit, which is key to re-investing,” Poonawalla told NDTV.“This (the amount needed) would be roughly ₹3,000 crores. The process takes 85 days, so it would be just under three months before we scale up operations,” he added.The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is manufactured by SII and sold in India under the brand name Covishield.“We are supplying two million doses per day. It varies... but we are making between 60 and 65 million per month. We have given, so far, over 100 million doses to India, and exported over 60 million,” Poonawalla said in the interview, adding that supply constraints will only ease once other manufacturers also scale up capacity.“We hope that, with them, even Covishield will increase capacity to 100 to 110 million doses a month (but) that’s only going to happen from June. That’s where we are at the moment,” he said.Covishield is one of the two Covid-19 vaccines approved for use in India. The other Covid-19 vaccine is Covaxin that is co-developed by Bharat Biotech and India Council of Medical Research.“Very stressed to put it quite frankly. The globe needs this vaccine... we are prioritising the needs of India (but) we are still short of being able to supply to every Indian,” Poonawalla told NDTV.Last month, COVAX facility, a global risk-sharing mechanism for pooled procurement and equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, said that it was looking at supply delays to the tune of at least 60-70 million doses produced by SII to lower-income countries because India was slowing down its Covid-19 vaccine exports.“We provided Serum Institute of India 150 million in pre finance to ramp up production. Our agreement stipulates 50% of production to be given to COVAX. Through Serum Institute of India, COVAX provides Covid-19 vaccines to more than 60 low income countries, primarily in Asia and Africa. If Government of India bans export of doses, all those countries would suffer,” Anuradha Gupta, deputy, chief executive officer, Gavi- the vaccine alliance that is co-leading COVAX facility, told HT on March 26..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/outstretched-sii-chief-seeks-3k-cr-fillip-to-boost-supply-101617735022504.html
07-04-2021||India||Early lung infections new Covid concern||A couple from south Mumbai in their 60s consulted a doctor last week after having a fever for two days. When the doctor examined them with the help of a stethoscope, he heard what are known as bilateral crackles, sounds from the lungs that suggest pneumonia. Sure enough, in both their cases, a Covid-19 test returned positive and a CT scan of the lung confirmed pneumonia. But what surprised the doctor, a consultant internist at Bhatia Hospital, Tardeo, was the progression of the lung infection. In the past, Covid-19 linked pneumonia was seen after at least 10 days of symptoms, but in this senior couple, pneumonia set in on the third day. And that, experts say, may well be the story of Mumbai’s second wave. “Involvement of the lung within the second or third day of the onset of symptoms is concerning,” said Dr Samrat Shah, who treated the senior couple. Shah said their lungs were considerably diseased, and the CT scan severity score was above 7, which meant that they had already crossed the mild stage of the infection. CT scans of many positive patients are revealing faster pulmonary changes even as severity scores are rapidly rising, doctors said. The result: more patients require intensive treatment and hospitalisation, although, on the positive side, most recover. Given their age, the couple were put on intravenous steroids and antiviral medication and are now on the road to recovery. According to Dr. Shah, almost 30% of his patients are showing signs of early lung infections. During the last wave, only very few patients would show up with such early infections, he said. Dr Khusrav Bajan, a physician, and intensivist at the PD Hinduja Hospital in Mahim said almost 15% of his Covid-19 patients are suffering from an early lung infection. “Last year, such cases were about 5% to 10%,” he added. A CT-scan severity score ranges from 0 to 25; 7 to 12 indicates moderate infection; above 12 indicates a severe infection; below 7 indicates mild infection. “I have so many patients who are slipping from a score of 5 to 20 within a day. They typically have pneumonia and acute respiratory distress. Also, a peculiar trend is that young people, under 45 years of age, are coming with such early infections,” said Dr Bajan. From reporting an average of 526 cases per day in January, Mumbai’s daily average rose to 655 cases per day in February and jumped sharply to 2866 cases per day in March. The city reported an average of 9500 per day in the first five days of April. The number of active cases in the city has jumped by at least 700% within a month’s time: from 9055 on March 5 to 73,281 on April 5. According to BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard, 12707 patients are currently hospitalised. Of these, 1776 are admitted to intensive care units. Another 1937 patients are admitted in Covid Care Centre (CCC2) that are meant for positive, asymptomatic patients. Around 2% of the total active cases are critical. “Even as the numbers have risen, and more patients are symptomatic, the response rate to therapy is much better. This helps as patients don’t get to the critical state,” said Dr. Pratit Samdani who is currently treating one unusual case of a 65-year-old jeweller who developed lung fibrosis on the seventh day of hospitalisation. Lung fibrosis is a severe condition wherein the lung tissues are severely scarred and the damage is irreversible. “We generally see fibrosis after three to four weeks. It is unusual to develop fibrosis so soon,” he said. Some experts say it is possible that the sheer volume of Covid-19 cases in the ongoing second wave has resulted in doctors observing such trends more clearly. “Some patients definitely deteriorate faster. We are also seeing significantly affected lungs in patients but we did see a similar trend last year too,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a critical care physician at Fortis Hospital and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. “I think what is concerning right now is the overwhelming number of cases.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/early-lung-infections-new-covid-concern-101617734961707.html
07-04-2021||India||Jab for those who ‘need’ it, not those who ‘want’ it: Centre||As India faces the worst wave of the Covid-19 pandemic yet, the Indian Medical Association (IMA) and chief ministers of several states have appealed to the central government to open vaccination for all people above 18, even as Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan resorted to semantics in the health ministry’s briefing on Tuesday, saying “the aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it, but to those who need it”.Experts pointed out that in the case of the coronavirus disease, no one is safe till everyone is safe – and in this case this means everyone over the age of 18 (neither of the vaccines in use in India has yet been approved for those below the age of 18). Other experts pointed that even if vaccines must be administered in a prioritised manner, it would make sense to prioritise urban centres, especially those that are seeing a huge surge in infections.“In cities, if we immunise about 30-40% (given that 45-55% have been infected), we should be in reasonable shape and begin to see slowing. However, there are lots of caveats such as duration of protection, variant escape, etc. In rural areas, we will need greater coverage to see a difference. But ultimately we will need to get everyone immunised including children,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India’s top vaccinologist.In a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, IMA said: “At present, we are vaccinating the population above 45 years. In view of the rapid spread of the second wave of the disease, we suggest that our vaccination strategy needs to be geared up with immediate effect. All citizens above 18 years of age shall be permitted to receive Covid vaccination.”Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot wrote a similar letter to the PM, seeking removal of the age bar on vaccination. “I appeal to the Prime Minister and the Central government to allow the vaccination for all by removing the age bar,” the letter read. “Also, in addition to the two vaccines currently being used in India, other vaccines should be allowed, so that more and more people can be vaccinated in the earliest possible manner,” it added.India is expected to approve the Sputnik V vaccine shortly.Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh, and his Maharashtra and Delhi counterparts, Uddhav Thackeray and Arvind Kejirwal, have made similar appeals to the Centre. On Monday, Kejriwal wrote to the Prime Minister, saying “if rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to be vaccinated irrespective of age, then the Delhi government can vaccinate all Delhi residents within three months.”India has so far administered 84 million vaccine doses till Tuesday night, according to HT’s vaccine tracker. Of this, 10,904,088 people have received both doses and 62,257,181 have received one dose. On Monday, the country vaccinated 4,300,966 people, a new high. According to an HT analysis last week, if India vaccinates 4 million people a day, it would have completely vaccinated 50 million people (both doses) by May 15 and 100 million people by June 16. It takes two weeks after the second dose for the vaccine to be completely effective.On Tuesday, India added a record 115,320 new cases in a single day, taking its overall tally of cases to 11,789,781; 630 people died from Covid-10 on Tuesday. The current seven-day average of cases is 93,041.IMA has also suggested that private sector family clinics should be included actively in the vaccination drive along with private hospitals. Making vaccination certificate mandatory for entering public places and to receive products under the public distribution system were among the several suggestions made by the doctors’ body as ways to dispel vaccine hesitancy.In the health ministry briefing, Bhushan sought to explain the rationale for the government’s phased approach to vaccination.“It is a common question that is being asked these days that why are not Covid-19 vaccinations being opened for all; why can’t all adults be given it. To those, I want to say that Covid-19 vaccination drive is essentially meant to serve two purposes: to prevent deaths and the other purpose is to protect your health care system. In the middle of a pandemic, the main aim is not to administer the vaccine to those who want it but to those who need it. The most vulnerable in the country have to be protected, and that is what is being done globally also,” said Bhushan.“The basic aim is to reduce death through vaccination. The other aim is to protect your healthcare system. If healthcare workers, doctors, nurses, paramedics and others fall sick, who will work in hospitals? So the aim, for any country, is to protect those who are the most vulnerable,” he said.Bhushan later told ANI it was “a fallacy that our vaccination process is heavily regulated and controlled by the state”.Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul said: “What we know so far is that all vaccines that are being used, including the two being used in ,India reduce mortality, severity of the disease, protect lives and keeping that in mind priority groups have been decided. We have to protect our most vulnerable.” He said the priority groups have been decided based on people vulnerable to mortality.“Pandemic situation no doubt has deteriorated in the country, as there has been a serious rise in Covid-19 cases. It has risen like a wave, and this time the speed of rise is greater than the previous time,” said Paul.India’s vaccine drive began on January 16 with health care workers, and on February 2 with frontline workers, and then moved, on March 1, to people over the age of 60 and those over the age of 45 but with conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid-19.On April 1, the country started vaccinating everyone over the age of 45.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jab-is-for-those-who-need-it-not-those-who-want-it-health-secy-101617734900780.html
07-04-2021||India||Andhra HC suspends elections to block, zilla parishads scheduled for Thursday||The Andhra Pradesh High Court on Tuesday issued interim orders suspending the elections to the mandal (block) parishads and zilla parishads in the state, which are scheduled to be held on Thursday (April 8). The High Court cited insufficient time for the enforcement of the model code of conduct for its decision.A single-judge bench of the High Court, comprising Justice U Durga Prasada Rao, gave the orders after hearing a batch of petitions filed by the Telugu Desam Party (TDP), the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Jana Sena Party.Justice Rao agreed with the contention of the petitioners that the state election commission (SEC) had not followed the Supreme Court orders directing that the model code of conduct should be brought into force at least four weeks before the polling date.The HC ordered that the notification issued by newly-appointed SEC Neelam Sawhney on April 1, and all the actions taken thereafter, be withheld. The court did not accept the SEC’s argument that the four-week gap between the notification and polling date for enforcement of the model code of conduct was only a suggestion and not a compulsion.Justice Rao posted the case to April 15 for further hearing and directed the SEC to file a counter by then. It also asked the SEC to follow the Supreme Court guidelines on the enforcement of the model code of conduct for four weeks before the polling date.An official in the state government said the SEC was contemplating challenging Justice Rao’s interim order by filing an emergency petition before a division bench late in the evening or Wednesday morning.Sawhney, who replaced Nimmgadda Ramesh Kumar as the SEC on April 1, announced the schedule for the conduct of mandal parishad territorial constituencies (MPTCs) and zilla parishad territorial constituencies (ZPTCs) within hours of taking charge.As per the schedule, the polling will be held on April 8 and the results will be declared on April 10. Since the polling process commenced in March 2020, before it was postponed due to the outbreak of Covid-19, there was no need for the issuance of fresh notification, Sawhney said.In all, there are 660 ZPTCs and 9,984 MPTCs in Andhra Pradesh, of which as many as 126 ZPTCs and 2,363 MPTCs were elected unanimously during the beginning of the election process in March 2020. As per the schedule announced on April 1, the campaigning came to an end by 4 pm on Tuesday.The opposition parties found fault with the SEC for hurriedly announcing the schedule without following the SC guidelines on the model code of conduct. The TDP said it would boycott the elections, alleging the ruling YSR Congress party of trying to bulldoze the election process with the help of the SEC and the police machinery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/andhra-hc-suspends-elections-to-block-zilla-parishads-scheduled-for-thursday-101617734841822.html
07-04-2021||India||Justice NV Ramana appointed as CJI||President Ram Nath Kovind on Tuesday appointed justice NV Ramana as the Chief Justice of India (CJI) with effect from April 24. Justice Ramana, 63, will serve till August 26, 2022.The presidential notification followed the recommendation made by incumbent CJI SA Bobde to the union law ministry on March 24 regarding appointment of justice Ramana as his successor.“In exercise of the powers conferred by clause (2) of Article 124 of the Constitution. The President is pleased to appoint Sri Nuthalapati Venkata Ramana, judge of the Supreme Court, to be the Chief Justice of India with effect from April 24, 2021,” the notification issued by the law ministry stated.Justice Ramana was appointed a permanent judge of the Andhra Pradesh high court in 2000 and was elevated as chief justice of the Delhi high court in 2013. On February 17, 2014, he was elevated as a Supreme Court judgeWith this, both the CJI and the central government have followed the seniority norm, as laid down under the memorandum of procedure (MoP) for judicial appointments. As per the MoP, appointment to the office of the Chief Justice of India should be of the senior-most judge of the Supreme Court, considered fit to hold the office.The speculations around appointment of justice Ramana as the next CJI had ensued in the wake of a formal complaint against him by Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy, who accused the senior judge of influencing the state high court and stalling investigations into the Amaravati land scam case in which the judge’s daughters were also being probed. Jagan contended in a letter to the CJI that the Andhra Pradesh high court was being used to “destabilise and topple my democratically elected government”.On the day justice Bobde recommended justice Ramana as the top judge, the Supreme Court also issued a short statement about the dismissal of Reddy’s complaint.Over the years, justice Ramana has been a part of several landmark judgments. He headed the bench which in January last year ruled that access to the internet is a fundamental right by extension while pulling the government up for the telecommunications blackout in Jammu & Kashmir after abrogation of Article 370. The bench then ordered the J&K administration to review all orders pertaining to the imposition of curbs on telecom and internet services and put them in the public domain.Adjudicating a bunch of petitions on the Kashmir restrictions, justice Ramana’s bench also underscored the significance of the freedom of the press. “Responsible governments are required to respect the freedom of the press at all times... journalists are to be accommodated in reporting and there is no justification for allowing a sword of Damocles to hang over the press indefinitely,” his verdict held.In a more recent ruling, a bench headed by justice Ramana held in February the restriction against grant of bail in a stringent law like The Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 “per se does not oust the ability of Constitutional Courts to grant bail on grounds of violation” of a fundamental right like the right to a speedy trial.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/justice-ramana-appointed-cji-101617734784335.html
07-04-2021||India||Ansari’s wife approaches SC||New DelhiGangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari’s wife Afshan Ansari has moved the Supreme Court seeking safety for the Mau MLA while he is being shifted to Banda district jail in Uttar Pradesh from Rupnagar jail in Punjab, and also during his trial in pending cases in the state. Afshan, alleging imminent threat to Ansari’s life, has sought intervention of the top court to ensure that her husband is not killed in a so-called fake encounter.“The petitioner is in complete fear that now any time an untoward incident can happen to her husband but for protective directions passed by this Hon’ble Court,” Afshan said in her plea.The court is expected to hear her petition on Friday. The petition has cited various attempts to eliminate Ansari over the years and alleged that Brajesh Singh, a mafia don and a former UP BJP MLA, is conspiring to kill Ansari with the state’s support. Earlier, Afshan wrote to President Ram Nath Kovind expressing similar fears and said that her husband was a witness in a murder case in which Singh and one of his accomplices are prime accused.The Supreme Court on March 26 allowed a transfer petition filed by the UP government seeking transfer of Ansari from Ropar jail in Punjab to Banda in UP. Ansari was initially lodged in a jail in UP as an undertrial when the Punjab Police obtained production warrant against him on a complaint of extortion and criminal intimidation and brought him to Punjab. As the Punjab government refused to shift Ansari back to UP citing his medical condition -- he is reportedly suffering from hypertension, diabetes, back pain, skin allergy and depression -- the UP government moved the top court, which allowed his transfer by an order last month. A hundred-member team of UP Police was in Punjab on Tuesday to bring Ansari to Banda district jail. They left in the afternoon and were expected to reach Banda by early morning Wednesday. Ansari has to stand trial in at least 14 cases in UP on charges of murder, extortion and under the Gangster Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ansaris-wife-approaches-sc-101617734720686.html
07-04-2021||India||NIA to question DCP-rank officer in Hiran murder case||Mumbai: The National Investigation Agency (NIA) will question a deputy commissioner of police (DCP)-rank officer of the Mumbai Crime Branch who allegedly visited the crime intelligence unit (CIU) office on March 3, when Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran – whose body was found from a Mumbra creek – was present at then CIU chief Sachin Vaze’s office.Vaze was arrested by NIA on March 13 for allegedly planting a vehicle with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threat letter near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house Antilia in February. Hiran was linked to the vehicle.“The agency wanted to verify certain details with all the people concerned in the case who were present at CIU office when Hiran had met Vaze. The agency will verify details and examine the facts,” an NIA officer said on Tuesday on condition of anonymity.However, a senior Mumbai Police officer contended that the DCP in question visited the CIU office for some other work, and was not part of the conversation between Vaze and Hiran.NIA has so far recorded the statements of around 40 people and further investigations are on in the Antilia explosives scare, as well as Hiran’s death case, added the NIA officer.On Monday at 11.40pm, a group of eight to 10 NIA officers – while recreating the crime scene in the Hiran death case – took Vaze to Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus (CSMT, former Victoria Terminus) after they found during investigation that the suspended cop had taken a train from there to Kalwa station on March 4, the day Hiran went missing. A team from Pune’s Central Forensic Science Laboratory (CSFL) was also present when the crime scene was recreated, and recorded a video of Vaze walking on platform number 4, from where he’d boarded a train around 7pm on March 4.Hiran was allegedly murdered on March 4, and his body was found floating in a creek at Retibunder in Mumbra the next day. The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) was investigating the Hiran murder case before it was handed over to NIA.During its probe, ATS found that Vaze got off at Kalwa railway station and had allegedly contacted Hiran around 8.30pm. They spoke for around 11 minutes, and Vaze allegedly asked him to meet near Ghodbunder Road. However, he requested Hiran to tell his family that he was going to meet an officer named Tawade from Kandivli police station.On Monday, NIA officers also took Vaze to Kalwa railway station, where he was made to walk from the platform to the station’s exit. The agency has also taken custody of the CCTV footage of CSMT and Kalwa station, said the officer cited above.NIA seized a high-end motorcycle linked to the case from Daman on Monday. A Benelli DSK TNT 600GT, it was registered in Thane in the name of a woman suspected to be close to Vaze. She was seen in a CCTV grab while entering a five-star hotel at south Mumbai where Vaze was staying between February 16 and February 20.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-to-question-dcp-rank-officer-in-hiran-murder-case-101617734661378.html
07-04-2021||India||Deshmukh, Maha govt move SC against HC’s order for CBI probe||A day after resigning as Maharashtra’s home minister, Anil Deshmukh moved the Supreme Court on Tuesday and said that the Bombay high court order for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into allegations of extortion against him “impacts the federal structure”, and could lead to a “biased investigation”, apart from destabilising the state government.The Maharashtra government also filed a separate petition in the apex court against the Monday order by the high court, complaining that the CBI investigation was ordered without any fact or formal pleadings and that the central agency was roped in without letting the state agencies first conduct their investigation.The CBI has registered a preliminary inquiry to investigate allegations against Deshmukh after the Bombay high court order, people familiar with the matter said late on Tuesday.The high court’s decision to allow the CBI inquiry came after former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh alleged that Deshmukh asked policemen, including suspended officer Sachin Vaze, to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants, and other sources. The allegations followed drama over police investigations into the discovery of an explosives-laden vehicle outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and the alleged murder of a man linked to the car.On Tuesday, the Maharashtra government argued out that the state, for valid reasons, has already withdrawn its general consent to the CBI to carry out investigations in Maharashtra, and that the high court should have remained mindful of this aspect before ordering the probe.While the two petitions were filed in the Supreme Court on Tuesday, Singh -- whose accusations and a petition before the high court led to the preliminary inquiry by CBI -- and another petitioner before the high court , Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil, have also filed their caveat in the apex court to ensure no order is passed without hearing them. The petitions are yet to be assigned a date of hearing.Deshmukh resigned on Monday, hours after the order by the high court asking CBI to conclude a preliminary inquiry within 15 days, making him the most high-profile casualty so far in the twists and turns over the discovery of the explosives and the death of Mansukh Hiran.As the row reached the Supreme Court, Nationalist Congress Party leader Deshmukh emphasised that the high court, relying on certain unsubstantiated allegations by Singh, entrusted the probe to an agency “which the state government has the least confidence in”, and that “such processes may well be followed to destabilise the government”.“In the annals of judicial history, there has hardly been an occasion when the court has taken the statement made against a sitting minister at face value and proceeded to direct an outside agency, without calling from for a response from the concerned minister, to conduct a preliminary inquiry,” said Deshmukh’s plea, filed through advocate Sudhanshu S Choudhri. The petition, which HT has seen, was settled by senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who is expected to represent Deshmukh in the apex court.Questioning the credentials of CBI, Deshmukh added that, presently, the agency was also being led by an interim director, and the legality of this ad hoc arrangement was already questioned before the Supreme Court.He said that the high court should have given sufficient time to the state agencies to carry out the probe at the first instance and only in the case of any lapse should a probe, preferably by a team of officers nominated by the court under its supervision, have been contemplated. But the investigation was handed over to an agency “under the control of the central government”, he added.“The court chose not to follow that procedure, thereby showing utter lack of confidence in the state machinery as if every investigating officer lacked the confidence of the court in conducting a fair and impartial inquiry,” read Deshmukh’s petition, which added that this assumption was “unsustainable and without any demonstrable reason”.Requesting the court to stay the order, the petition said the chief reason cited by the high court for a CBI probe was that Deshmukh served as the home minister, but now that he has resigned, the state machinery must be allowed to freely conduct its investigation.The state government, in its appeal, highlighted that Maharashtra had already ordered a judicial probe into the allegations on March 30 by retired Bombay HC judge KU Chandiwal and that the high court could not have straightaway passed the order of a CBI probe without examining the formal pleadings and submissions of the state.The state’s petition added that the accusations by Singh were unsubstantiated and that there was no justification to hand over the probe to the CBI, whose jurisdiction had been ousted by the Maharashtra government by withdrawing its general consent. Senior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi is expected to argue for the state government’s petition.Singh first approached the Supreme Court for a CBI probe but was asked to go to the Bombay HC at the first instance. Apart from him, a bunch of public interest litigations were also filed in the high court, which on Monday ordered CBI to complete a preliminary inquiry within 15 days and thereafter proceed in accordance with the legal procedure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deshmukh-maha-govt-move-sc-against-hc-s-order-for-cbi-probe-101617734660807.html
07-04-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh takes over Mukhtar Ansari’s custody from Punjab||Chandigarh/Lucknow A team of at least 100 officials of the Uttar Pradesh police on Tuesday took custody of gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari from the Punjab police.Officials at the Central jail in Punjab’s Ropar handed over the Bahujan Samaj Party’s Mau MLA to the police team from UP’s Banda, led by deputy superintendent of police Satya Prakash, after a team of doctors examined Ansari.A senior official said Ansari was handed over to the UP police at around 2.10 pm on Tuesday and the contingent is likely to reach Banda by Wednesday morning.UP police, equipped with sophisticated weapons, are bringing Ansari back to the state in an anti-riot vehicle, Vajra.The action has come after the Supreme Court directed Punjab to grant Ansari’s custody to UP after the Yogi Adityanath-led government in the state moved the top court against the Punjab government’s refusal to transfer him.Ansari has been lodged in Ropar jail since January 2019 in connection with an extortion case.The official said that all security measures have been employed to ensure Ansari’s safe transfer after a Special Task Force from UP was assigned to chalk out a route plan. Other prisons in UP have also been asked to prepare in case of any last-minute changes due to security reasons.Banda jailor Pramod Tiwari said all security arrangements in the jail have been beefed up.“Security personnel have been posted inside as well as outside the jail premises. In barrack number 15, where Mukhtar Ansari will be kept, arrangements of light, drinking water and cleanliness have been spruced up,” news agency PTI quoted Tiwari as saying.On March 26, the top court directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues. The court directed that Ansari’s custody be handed over to Uttar Pradesh within two weeks so as to lodge him in Banda district jail in the state.The BJP-run Uttar Pradesh government accused the Congress government in Punjab of “shielding” Ansari by not letting the state take custody.The apex court also noted that Ansari was allegedly involved in various cases of attempt to murder, murder, cheating and conspiracy apart from offences under the Gangsters Act, lodged in Uttar Pradesh. Out of these, 10 cases were at trial stage.In a related development, Ropar senior superintendent of police Akhil Chaudhary has ordered a probe into the circumstances under which an ambulance, ferrying Ansari from Ropar jail to Mohali court on March 31, was found abandoned near Nanak Dhaba in village Khwaspura fallinder Sadar Police Station of Ropar.A case was registered in Uttar Pradesh’s Barabanki after the documents of the ambulance were found to be fake and one person was arrested on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-takes-over-ansari-s-custody-from-punjab-101617734120663.html
