The states have also been advised to deploy volunteers of NSS (National Service Scheme), Nehru Yuva Kendra (NYK), women self-help groups as well as hire retired doctors/paramedics on contracts under National Health Mission (NHM) funds. In the review meeting, chaired by Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla and Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, the Director General of ICMR – Balram Bhargava recommended setting up of more testing labs, including mobile labs. He also advised about keeping a vigil and ramping up of testing on a continuous basis in districts showing more than 5% positivity rate. At the end of the meeting, a five-fold strategy for tackling the recent surge was re-emphasised, which includes significantly increasing testing in all districts with a minimum of 70% RT-PCR tests and use of Rapid Antigen Tests as screening tests in densely populated areas as well as areas where fresh clusters are emerging; ramping up effective and timely tracing, containment and surveillance activities to curb the chain of transmission; effectively following the protocol of clinical care, treatment and supported home/facility care; effective enforcement of Covid-19 safe behaviour and time-bound plan of 100% vaccination of eligible population groups, especially in the high focus districts, according to the Press Information Bureau (PIB) statement. States have been particularly asked to increase dedicated beds by using available buildings in the hospital campus (including AIIMS) for creation of additional Covid-19 dedicated wards. The PIB said that the “health ministry is informing states every day in the morning of the day’s supply of Covid-19 vaccines, to enable better planning for optimum utilisation of the vaccines. An augmented health workforce would be needed in the coming days for contact tracing and house-to-house survey for symptomatic patients.” Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh along with Maharashtra are the only three states in the country which have more than one lakh active cases. Both Chhattisgarh and Uttar Pradesh are reporting very high numbers of daily new Covid-19 cases and high deaths. “The reported shortage of hospital infrastructure such as ICU and oxygen supported hospitals beds resulting in difficulty to the public in easily accessing critical healthcare services were discussed in comprehensive detail, requiring an urgent ramping up of hospital infrastructure. The states were advised to increase the number of isolation beds, oxygen beds, ventilators/ICU beds, ambulance fleet as per requirement; plan for adequate oxygen supply; and focus on mortality reduction by early identification of positive cases and adherence to national treatment protocol,” said PIB statement. Bhushan informed the states that demand for oxygen cylinders (including 10 litre cylinders and 45 litre jumbo cylinders) and demand for additional ventilators (having high flow nasal canula) will be met very soon. Earlier in the day, Bhalla wrote to all states asking them to ensure smooth supply of medical oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-hospitals-of-psus-hire-retired-doctors-under-nhm-to-deal-with-surge-centre-tells-states-101618596316528.html
16-04-2021||India||Doctor talks about ‘horrors’ at Covid-19 hospitals, urges people to ‘wear masks'||A doctor took to social media on Friday to share the plight of healthcare workers at Covid-19 hospitals and the disturbing episodes they witness as people break down when told about the condition of their family members infected with the viral disease. As she spoke about her traumatic experience and reflected on how she could have been more tolerant and loving with the patients, Saandhra, in her now-viral Instagram post, urged the citizens of the country to “just wear your masks when you are out.”Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereTalking about the events in the past two weeks, Saandhra wrote, “I've been telling people that their 22-year-old son has died, lying to patients, telling them theek ho jaoge (you will getter better), when I know to my bones vo theek nhi honge… (they won’t getter better), hearing breathless women crying allah allah in anguish all night.”A post shared by Saandhra (@_saandhra_)She mentioned one of the Covid-19 patients who was put on a ventilator and eventually died. “...the last words of one of our patients before my friend intubated her was that she has an 11 and 4-year-old at home, not to let her die (she died), telling children that they may not get their mother's body, mother's standing before us with folded hands asking us to save their children's lives,” Saandhra wrote in a heart-rending post. The doctor’s post comes at a time when India is reporting over two lakh cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) daily for the past two days and the total infection tally has surged past 14.29 million. Following the spike as the country is witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 infections, several states have imposed restrictions including night curfews and weekend lockdowns to prevent the disease from spreading. The states have also imposed heavy fines for people found without masks.Saandhra also spoke about the trauma doctors deal with and wished they continued to work hard as their family members may also need the support of healthcare workers if they get infected with Covid-19. “Working as hard as I can wishing other healthcare workers would do the same for my parents if they were to be hospitalized with covid… Coming back from my duty and crying about all of that I am forced to do/forced to watch… Crying about how I could have been a little more patient and a lot more loving to people who are suffocating to their deaths.. (6 hours in PPE all the while anxious about being exposed, anxious about dying just like our patients does not exactly leave you the sweetest person). To think that the pain I feel as a spectator is not even a quarter of the pain that our patients/their relatives feel,” the doctor wrote in her Instagram post.As governments mull partial lockdown in view of the rising Covid-19 cases, Saandhra says, “Trust me your lockdowns are not difficult…You haven't seen the horrors we see… I wish I could show you videos of the pain I see, just to scare everyone enough for you to stay inside…Saying that it's difficult is the understatement of the century... I do not want to see this pain... None of us do. Do not put us through this.”Acknowledging that it may not be possible for everyone to stay off work and be inside their homes for a long time, the doctor requested the people of the country to wear masks every time they step out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/doctor-talks-about-horrors-at-covid-19-hospitals-urges-people-to-wear-masks-101618594884905.html

This was a policy decision taken by the then government,” stated the letter. “The move to change the names of the roads will insult Tamil personalities belonging to various political parties and create a tense and unrest situation in the state. May lead to further struggles and unrest,” it added.On Thursday, a three-member delegation of the DMK, led by organising secretary and MP RS Bharathi, submitted a representation to chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan urging him to intervene to roll back names of three arterial roads. They were named after Dravidian icons of the state such as EV Ramasamy, CN Annadurai and K Kamaraj but now bear English names.The AIADMK said that no names have been changed. “It seems the highways department used names from old records and during a routine job of installing name boards they have done this,” said AIADMK spokesperson and candidate C Vaigaichelvan. “We don’t have the power to do anything now. So after we form the government again we will take necessary steps,” he added. Vaigaichelvan dismissed DMK’s charges that this was done to appease their ally, the BJP. “BJP doesn’t tell us to change any names and we won’t do such things. We are also for Periyar. What do we have against these road names?” he said.Also read: TN govt agrees to hold online exams for arrear subjectsIn the past, both DMK and AIADMK have indulged in the name changing game of roads after Tamil scholars and personalities to evoke linguistic pride. Chennai’s Poonamallee high road was renamed in 1979 by AIADMK founder MG Ramachandran (MGR) to Periyar EVR high road after EV Ramasamy, the father of the Dravidian movement. Mount Road was renamed to Anna Salai and Beach Road as Kamarajar Salai. The names of these roads have now been changed to Grand Western Trunk Road, Grand Southern Trunk Road and Grand Northern Trunk Road. The DMK sought for the old names to be restored as signboards of the same have come up.“This action of changing the names of the roads, and the sheer disrespect to Tamil icons cutting across all parties, has brought uneasiness and unrest in the state and this may even lead to agitations and unrest,” Bharathi said in his letter. “It is quite apparent that the name change is done to please the ideologies of the AIADMK’s masters from the north, whose dislike of the Dravidian movement and its icon Thanthai Periyar is well known. They aim to ‘sanskritise’ and ‘saffronise’ everything.”Former Union minister P Chidambaram on Friday night tweeted that a smart government would immediately let leaders know that the names of the highways have not been changed. “The controversy should end tonight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiadmk-appeasing-masters-in-north-dmk-on-road-name-change-in-tn-101618591156229.html

However, whenever there are concerns, the state governments have discussed the issues with us and where there are containment zones, they are doing random tests and checks. The railways has all these details on the e-ticketing website and passengers are provided information on whether they have to undergo tests or carry a COVID-negative certificate on arrival," he said.Sharma also said the railways is doing a thermal screening of the passengers and has also notified the fine amounts for not following COVID protocols.He ruled out running Shramik Special trains and said trains will be run wherever there is demand and requirement.Sharma also said the price of platform tickets has been increased at several stations to discourage crowding."We have 4,000 isolation coaches for COVID-19 at different locations across the country. We have received a demand from Nandurbar in Maharashtra for over 100 coaches and 20 isolation coaches have been provided," he said when asked about the converted coaches that can act as COVID care centres.Sharma said the railways is keeping a close watch on all stations in Mumbai, Gujarat, Karnataka and wherever the demand is high, the zonal general managers have been authorised to operate more trains."I assure you that there is no dearth of services, the situation is quite normal, particularly in Mumbai, Surat and Bengaluru," he said.The Indian Railways is currently running 1,490 mail and express trains and 5,397 suburban train services on an average per day."We are also running 28 clone trains of highly-patronised trains and 947 passenger trains," Sharma said, adding that 70 per cent of the train services have been restored."To clear the extra rush across the country, the railways is operating 140 additional trains," he said.Sharma said the 140 special trains will make 483 trips in April and May.Citing the figures of the additional trains operating in several states, he said the Central Railway is operating 85 such services which will complete 284 trips, the Western Railway is operating 28 trains for 152 trips, the Northern Railway is operating 15 special trains for 19 trips, the East Central Railway is operating two special trains for four trips, the North Eastern Railway is operating nine trains for 14 trips and the North Central Railway is operating one train for 10 trips.Sharma also said trains for high-demand destinations such as Uttar Pradesh's Gorakhpur, Lucknow, Varanasi, Manduadih, Prayagraj, Bihar's Patna, Bhagalpur, Darbhanga, Barauni, Jharkhand's Bokaro, Ranchi, Assam's Guwahati and West Bengal's Kolkata are also being operated.The Railway Board chairman said the national transporter has operated 42 trains between Delhi and Mumbai from April 12 to 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-state-has-asked-to-stop-train-services-railway-board-chairman-101618583367453.html

Indian Genomic Consortium has so far processed more than 13,000 samples for Genome Sequencing,” the government said in a press release.The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) is a network of 10 laboratories established in December 2020 to continuously monitor the genomic changes of SARS-CoV-2 in India, through Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS), the release added.It further said that INSACOG guidelines were shared with states, which were also advised to send samples for genome sequencing along with clinical data of positive persons. This, the release said, would have helped INSACOG to discover other variants of concern, if present in the community. “However, several states, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kerala have not shared such data, though others including Punjab and Delhi have,” the government said.The release also noted that detailed INSACOG guidelines were uploaded on the website of the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) on December 27 last year. Out of the 13,614 WGS samples processed at the 10 designated INSACOG labs, 1,189 tested positive for “variants of concern” of SARS-CoV-2. Of these, 1,109 samples were positive with the UK variant, and 79 and one with the South African and Brazilian ones.“The RT-PCR tests being used in India do not miss these mutations as these tests being used in India target more than two genes. Sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR tests remain same as earlier,” the statement emphasised.According to the government-run Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), 263,476,625 samples have been tested for the viral disease till April 15. Of these, 1,473,210 samples were tested on April 15, ICMR said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rtpcr-tests-in-india-do-not-miss-any-variants-of-sars-cov-2-clarifies-govt-101618581682175.html
16-04-2021||India||UK home secretary Priti Patel approves Nirav Modi’s extradition||Almost two months after a UK court found fugitive businessman Nirav Modi guilty of fraud and money laundering in the Punjab National Bank scam and ordered his extradition to India, UK home secretary Priti Patel has approved the extradition, people familiar with the development said on Friday.The decision comes as a shot in the arm for the Indian government, which has been trying to bring fugitive economic offenders back to India, but Nirav Modi reserves a right to appeal his extradition in the high court, which his lawyer said would be the next course of action. Zulfiquar Memon, who represents Nirav Modi, told HT – “We will now go to the high court challenging the order of the Westminster Magistrate Court.”A UK Home Office spokesperson said: “On February 25, the District Judge gave judgment in the extradition case of Nirav Modi. The extradition order was signed on April 15.”Nirav Modi now has 14 days to make an application for leave to appeal to the High Court. He may seek leave to appeal against both the decisions of the District Judge and of the Home Secretary, people cited above said.While ordering his extradition on February 25, the Westminster District Judge Sam Goozee stated that Modi has a case to answer in India as he, along with his brother Nehal Modi and others, had defrauded the public sector bank, laundered the money taken from it and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses.The judge had observed that the circulation of pearls, diamonds and gold between the Nirav Modi firms and the Dubai and Hong Kong based dummy companies was not genuine business and the companies were being used for transferring funds generated in the guise of sale-purchase/export-import of goods colloquially referred to as round tripping transactions.Modi’s contention that he won’t get a fair trial in India and that he was being targeted due to political reasons was junked by the court.A Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) official following the case said, “UK government signing the extradition order is a positive development. Even if he goes to a higher court, he doesn’t stand a chance as there is very strong evidence against him.”Nirav Modi is lodged in Wandsworth prison, on the outskirts of London, since March 19, 2019, when he was arrested on the basis of India’s extradition request.Modi’s is the second high-profile economic offender after former liquor baron Vijay Mallya whose extradition has been cleared by the trial court in the United Kingdom. Mallya lost his appeal against the extradition in April 2020 as well as any opportunity to approach the UK Supreme Court the next month but the British government has claimed that his extradition is held up due to a ‘confidential legal issue’.Officials familiar with Mallya’s case say he has applied for asylum in the UK and it is not known how much time British authorities will take to decide it.Like Vijay Mallya, the CBI and Enforcement Directorate (ED) investigators are confident that the UK high court will reject Nirav Modi’s plea too as there is irrefutable evidence of fraud and money laundering against him.TIMELINE:January 2018: Nirav Modi flees India along with his family after cheating Punjab National Bank of around ₹6,498 crore while his partner-in-crime, his uncle, Mehul Choksi – who siphoned of another ₹7,080 crore from PNB, is hiding in Antigua and Barbuda. Choksi’s extradition may take some time.July 27, 2018: India applied for Nirav Modi’s extradition for fraud and money laundering.March 19, 2019: Nirav Modi is arrested by Scotland Yard and sent to jail and is lodged in Wandsworth prison on the outskirts of London. He has never got bail in two years.May 2020: Full hearings pertaining to extradition of Modi begin in the Westminster’s’ Magistrate Court.February 25, 2021: The Magistrate Court orders extradition saying Nirav Modi has a case to answer and added he and his brother, Nehal Modi, and others, defrauded the public sector bank, laundered the money taken from it, and conspired to destroy evidence and intimidate witnesses. The case is sent to UK home secretary for consideration. She has two months to decide the extradition.April 15, 2021: Much before two month deadline, UK home secretary Priti Patel signed the extradition.During the trial, which went on for more than one year, the UK court rejected Modi’s lawyers’ argument and the testimony of experts, including retired Supreme Court judge Markandey Katju, that he would not get a fair trial in India and that he was being targeted due to political reasons.Describing Katju’s testimony as not reliable, the court said it had the “hallmarks of an outspoken critic with his own personal agenda”.The court also said Modi’s extradition is compatible with the Convention Rights within the meaning of the Human Rights Act 1998.What next? Nirav Modi has 14 days to appeal against the Westminster Court’s decision and Priti Patel’s approval in the UK high court.If his leave to file appeal is accepted, the high court will hear his arguments and decide the case. The whole process may take six months to one year.Post high court decision, if it comes in India’s favour, he can go to Supreme Court as well only if the high court allows him. In Vijay Mallya’s case, the UK high court had denied him permission to go to the Supreme Court.Post court appeals, Nirav Modi can also apply for asylum in the UK.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-home-secretary-priti-patel-approves-nirav-modi-s-extradition-101618582156083.html

Hearing a petition filed by Tresa Josefine, an engineering graduate, working with the Kerala Minerals and Metals Limited, a state PSU, challenging the provision put forward by it that for the post of the safety officer only men can apply, the court said such protective provisions cannot stand in the way of employment. The court later set aside the notification of the PSU and said it was violating provisions of the Article 14, 15 & 16 of the Constitution. “It is the bounden duty of respondents to take all appropriate steps to see that a woman worker is able to carry out duties assigned to her at all hours, safely and conveniently. Protective provisions cannot stand in the way of a woman not being considered for an employment for which she is otherwise eligible,” the single bench of Justice Anu Sivaraman observed. The petitioner was working as an engineering trainee at the PSU, when the post of the safety officer fell vacant. She was denied the opportunity citing night hours which she challenged. She contended that Section 66 (I) (B) of the Factories Act 1948 was violative of the Constitution_ the said provision mandates that no woman shall be required to work in any factory except between 6 am and 7 pm. The court observed that provisions of Section 66 (1) (B) are beneficial in nature and are intended to protect women from exploitation but it cannot be used as an excuse for denying a job to the woman.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/women-can-t-be-denied-jobs-citing-late-hours-rules-kerala-hc-101618577776180.html

16-04-2021||India||Ajay Seth takes charge as economic affairs secretary||Ajay Seth, a 1987-batch Karnataka cadre officer of the Indian Administrative Service (IAS), on Friday took charge as economic affairs secretary. His appointment comes at a crucial time when India is witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic that is threatening to slow down economic recovery.Seth, who was previously the managing director of Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited, will now be responsible for the execution of the government’s efforts to insulate the economy from the adverse impact of the second Covid-19 wave.The new economic affairs secretary will coordinate the policy efforts of various arms of the government, the central bank and states to ensure that the projected growth path of the economic recovery is maintained, one official said, requesting anonymity. Although there is unlikely to be a nationwide lockdown during the second wave, local and state-level lockdowns, particularly in economic hubs such as Maharashtra, will adversely impact the economy.Also Read | How will the second Covid wave affect India’s economy?India’s economy shrank by 24.4% in the first quarter of 2020-21, which bore the brunt of a 68-day lockdown imposed to slow the spread of coronavirus disease, and 7.3% in the second, before entering growth territory and expanding by 0.4% in the last three months of 2020 (ending December 31). Overall, it is expected that the economy will contract by 8% in 2020-21. According to an estimate of the Reserve Bank of India, the economy is expected to grow at 10.5% in 2021-22, with a quarterly path of 26.2% in Q1, 8.3% in Q2, 5.4% in Q3, and 6.2% in Q4.Seth is expected to take stock of sectors that will be adversely affected due to the second wave of the pandemic and help the government in framing both fiscal and monetary policies to boost growth, the person mentioned above said. The economic affairs secretary plays a crucial role in the country’s monetary and market-related policies as he is the bridge between the Union government and regulators such as RBI and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi). The department of expenditure (DEA), one of the five arms of the Union finance ministry, is the nodal department for the execution of the government’s efforts to boost the economy, implement policies to enhance domestic and international investments, and prepared budget-related proposals.In a bureaucratic reshuffle last week, DEA secretary Tarun Bajaj was made the new revenue secretary, while Seth was brought in from his home cadre to manage economic affairs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ajay-seth-takes-charge-as-economic-affairs-secretary-101618563734762.html

Non-disclosure of the material information of the Respondent No. 1 (Henry) amounts to violation of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951 and rules thereof, and hence his election is fit to be declared as null and void,” it said.Henry recently moved the Supreme Court seeking a direction to the Election Commission to hold by-poll in Wangkhei constituency. However, the apex court on April 7 told him to approach the state high court.It may be worth mentioning here that this is the second time the Manipur high court has passed such an order recently.In a similar case in November last year, the court also declared the election of Y Surchandra from Kakching assembly constituency in 2017 assembly elections as null and void over non-disclosure of information in his election affidavit and named M Rameshwar, who secured the second place in the elections, as the elected MLA.

16-04-2021||India||Vaccination not shield against Covid, can reduce severity: Experts||Amid cases of the coronavirus infection being reported post vaccination from a few parts of the country, experts have said inoculation against COVID-19 "does not produce a shield" against the deadly virus, but helps reduce the severity of the infection and chances of death.They have also said that "no causal link has been established" yet between vaccination and the complications suffered thereafter by a person through any clinical or epidemiological studies.From Delhi to Chennai and even in tier-2 cities like Patna, cases of vaccination beneficiaries contracting the coronavirus infection have been reported in the last couple of months.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThirty-seven doctors at the Sir Ganga Ram Hospital in Delhi have tested positive for COVID-19 since the latest surge in cases, five of whom were admitted for treatment, hospital sources said last week.Many of them had taken both doses of the Covieshield vaccine, the sources said.A 54-year-old sanitation worker in Delhi died from health complications on February 22."My father had received his first shot of Covieshield on February 17. That day, when he returned home, he started feeling uneasy and the very next day, he was running temperature, which lasted for two-three days," his son Dheeraj had said.He had said his father continued to go to work despite the "weakness post vaccination", collapsed while being on duty and died at a hospital later.In Chennai, a vaccination beneficiary, who had got his first shot on March 15, tested positive for COVID-19 on March 29. He was hospitalised on March 30 and died on April 4, raising concerns among the family members on the efficacy of the vaccine.While cases of minor adverse events following immunisation (AEFIs) have been reported in various parts of the country, in some cases, it has been major too, leading to hospitalisation.The Centre, however, has maintained that both Covieshield and Covaxin are safe to take, and urged people not to get swayed by rumours.Several experts have concurred that vaccination against COVID-19 "does not produce a shield" against the deadly virus, but helps reduce the severity of the infection and chances of death."We know of cases of the infection reported post vaccination, even after taking two doses. But these cases are largely where the beneficiaries have had very mild symptoms. The vaccine at least reduces the severity of the infection and chances of mortality," Dr Avdhesh Bansal, a pulmonologist at the Apollo hospital here, said.Also, the full efficacy of the vaccine comes in only after two doses, he added.Dr Richa Sareen, consultant, pulmonology at the Fortis hospital here, echoed Bansal, saying, "The anti-bodies fully kick in only after both the doses have been taken. So a person getting infected after the first dose is possible, if exposed to a source of infection."A senior doctor at a Delhi government hospital, on the condition of anonymity, said "the vaccine is not a full safety shield", but wearing masks can complement the fight against the virus, which is mutating in multiple ways."Many people after getting vaccinated think that now they are immune to getting the infection. So they either do not wear a mask or wear it improperly. The virus first attacks the nasal passage and then the chest region. So if the mouth and the nostrils are exposed, chances are high that a person, after vaccination, may still get infected," he said.Also, the individual immunity level and associated co-morbidities could be a factor when it comes to getting infected after the first or the second dose of the vaccine, the doctor said, adding, "Our mask is our best vaccine now."While medical and pharmaceutical industry experts debate over the efficacy of vaccines, many doctors conjecture that as the coronavirus has been mutating, it will affect the efforts to detect the infection, develop vaccination and capability to develop herd immunity.So far, a UK strain, Brazil and South African variants and a double mutant of the virus have been reported in Delhi.Vaccination of healthcare workers began in India since the launch of the inoculation drive on January 16 and then it was opened in phases to the elderly and those in the 45-59 age group with co-morbidities, with the Centre eventually allowing all aged above 45 to be eligible for immunisation against COVID-19.The post-vaccination infection has brought trauma to the family members of the patients, who were hoping to get some reprieve after getting the shots.Former IT cell head of the BJP and ex-CEO of MyGov Arvind Gupta on Friday wrote on Twitter: "#Vaccine being put to test in our family. All taken Dose2 1. Patient 1 - Infected +- 7 days. In hospital with mild-moderate symptoms 2. Patient 2 - Infected +- 9 days. At home with high fever & cough 3. Patient 3 - Infected +- 14 days. At home with ~100F fever @MoHFW_INDIA."Hyderabad-based doctor Lakshmi Lavanya Alapati replied to his tweet on the microblogging platform, saying, "After both doses are admi­nistered, antibodies develop and severity of infection and chances of death are lowered. There is a 85% reduction in chances of hospitali­sation after vaccination. But vaccines cannot prevent the virus to enter your body - only mask can stop virus entry."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-not-shield-against-covid-can-reduce-severity-experts-101618563246984.html

This is the second time that the chief minister contracted the infection. In August 2020, he was infected for the first time, along with several of his family members.The 78-year-old CM complained of running a fever for the last two days following which he got tested on Thursday.

Although I am doing fine, I am being hospitalised based on the advise of doctors. I request all those who have come in my contact recently to be observant and exercise self-quarantine.In March, the chief minister took the first dose of the vaccine at Bengaluru's Victoria Hospital when several other state chief ministers took their jabs after the vaccination drive was open for senior citizens. He was due to take the second dose in a few days. After he was admitted to the hospital for Covid-19 treatment, the CM tweeted saying he is doing fine and doesn't have any symptom apart from mild fever. He also urged those who came in close contact with him in the past few days to go into self-isolation.Yediyurappa called an emergency meeting on Friday at his residence to discuss the Covid-19 situation of the state, as the state is recording the sharpest single-day spike of fresh Covid-19 cases. On Wednesday, Karnataka reported 14,738 new infections and 66 fatalities.Amid the raging second wave of the pandemic, concerns over reinfections are gaining ground as several such cases have been reported, though the Union health ministry has not confirmed reinfection. However, an investigative study by the Indian Council of Medical Research has found reinfection in 4.5 per cent of those who earlier contracted the disease. Yeddyurappa's 2nd-time infection is being seen as a rare case of this reinfection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/karnataka-cm-yediyurappa-tests-positive-for-covid-19-for-2nd-time-101618563329770.html

16-04-2021||India||April 29 meeting shores up hopes on India-EU trade, investment talks next month||Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal will hold a virtual meeting with Valdis Dombrovskis, the European Commission executive vice-president and commissioner of trade, on April 29, brightening the prospects for a firm start of negotiations on an India-European Union broad-based trade and investment agreement, people familiar with the matter said.This is their second meeting in less than three months; the first was on February 5 when Piyush Goyal hosted the first India-EU high-level dialogue, or HLD, where the two sides had extensively discussed the state of play of India-EU bilateral trade and investment relations and the way forward. At this discussion also, Dombrovskis had reiterated the EU’s interest in resuming negotiations for ambitious, comprehensive and mutually beneficial trade and investment agreements.New Delhi expects the resumption of negotiations for the India-EU trade and the investment agreement at the India-EU Summit scheduled to be held on May 8 in Portugal’s Porto given the broad-based support to the pact within the EU. There is, however, a possibility that the summit could be advanced by a day to May 7 due to a change in French President Emmanuel Macron’s sked.The topic had come up for discussion during the visit of French Foreign Minister Jean Yves Le Drian as well; he added weight to the forward movement by reassuring his Indian counterparts that Paris is committed to supporting the deal. The India-EU trade pact also came up during Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte’s summit-level meeting last week. Both sides expressed hope for early resumption of negotiations.Indian officials suggest that the two sides have decided to hold negotiations on separate trade and investment pacts since they believe it will be easier to seal an agreement on investments. India’s investment agreements with most of the 27 members of the EU expired during 2017-18, leading to higher costs of investment and some uncertainty among European investors.Officials said the contentious issues related to market access for an all-encompassing free trade agreement will take more time to be addressed.The India-EU trade negotiations were launched in June 2007 but have been stalled since May 2013, when both sides failed to bridge the gaps on issues related to data security and sustainable development.But this time both sides are more accommodating with the UK post-Brexit looking for a bilateral free trade agreement with India during Prime Minister Boris Johnson visit to India on April 25.Officials acknowledge that there may be some uncertainty around the format of the India-EU Summit, which was to mark the resumption of negotiations for the trade and investment pacts, due to the surge in coronavirus cases As things stand, the plan is that PM Modi is scheduled to Portugal for the summit to be held in Porto, its second-largest metropolis after Lisbon, before flying to France for a crucial bilateral visit.An official said the final call on holding the in-person summit is yet to be taken in view of the surge in Covid cases though all the leaders are vaccinated against Covid-19 and the situation in Portugal is considered to be under controlPortugal, according to news agency Reuters, imposed a lockdown in January to curb what was then the world’s worst Covid-19 surge but has started lifting restrictions from March, reopening some schools, restaurant and cafe terraces, museums and hair salons.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiaeu-to-start-groundwork-for-talks-on-trade-investment-deals-on-april-29-101618559820117.html

16-04-2021||India||Bengal has been committed to secularism in a way that’s remarkable: Amartya Sen||Ahead of the fifth of eight phase assembly elections in West Bengal on Saturday, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the elections and the issues involved. Edited excerpts from the interview:How closely have you been following the Bengal elections?There is a lot of time difference between Kolkata and where I stay right now [Harvard]. So as closely as possible, I do try to follow these elections.Also watch: Amartya Sen on why BJP’s attracting Dalit and backward voters | On The Record﻿The elections are largely seen as a battle for Bengal’s soul wherein all the parties are claiming to be representatives of real Bengal. What do you make of this electoral fight?Well, it’s an extraordinary fight and there can’t be any other occasion when an election in a state has generated so much interest, given the unusual amount of importance that the Central government has given it. On the other hand, it’s not so unusual that the local Bengalis think the elections really are an important thing. The two together have caused a confrontation rare in the history of elections anywhere in the world.Also Read | ‘Criminal negligence’: Mahua Moitra slams EC over 8-phase WB polls amid Covid-19Why are Bengal elections associated with violence? The fear of violence was also cited by Election Commission (EC) to have the elections over eight phases...I don’t think it is because Bengal is more violent. I think the EC wanted it divided and if you see how the election is going, where the Prime Minister goes away and does a little bit of work for his Prime Ministerial role and then comes back in time for another part of the elections. This is something in which the Central government clearly has some ability to participate in every activity in a way that would not have been possible if it were a one-day election or a two-day election. Now, I don’t know whether that was the reason for EC doing it in this form. A lot of people in Bengal are rather critical of the Election Commission, the way law and order situation has gone. Even in the firing [during the fourth phase of polling], four Bengalis, all Muslims were killed. I’m not going into that story. But it is not the case that it’s only the issue of peace in Bengal and the absence of it that makes Bengal prone to having...eight-phase [elections]...rather than for similarly sized places that have it in one or two-day scenario. There’s an element of political reasoning involved in it, and we could discuss that too....I don’t know that traditionally Bengal has had more bloodshed in elections. There have been many fights over Bengal over the years if you think of the history of the British Empire. The British Empire was established in Bengal in the Battle of Plassey. There were fights going on between Siraj ud-Daulah, the last King of Bengal, and the British. Then in the Indian national movement, a lot of the violence in trying to get the British out had its roots in Bengal. So, there’s a historical tradition too.Bengal is divided between Hindus and Muslims that has not been traditionally a big divider. On the contrary, if you go back to the beginning of Bengali culture and literature, in the 10th century, you will see an intermingling of Hindus and Muslims... The main epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, the main translating initiative came from the Muslim King in Bengal who was very fond of the epics. There has been a tradition of Hindu-Muslim unity from time to time... The British were quite keen on a division between Hindus and Muslims. It used to be called divide and rule. A certain amount of that going on now if you take a thing like the new citizenship act. That is not popular among Muslims as they don’t have rights that the Hindus are given in this. That generates not only discontent among Muslims but also Hindus who are very strongly involved with the cause of secularism.After all, Bengal with Rabindranath Tagore and Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose has been committed to secularism in a way that’s quite remarkable... so any violation where only Muslims are shot in a particular incident involving police from outside, or a major party trying to win elections with the party leader saying, “we don’t expect Muslims to vote for us”. Why not? That raises all kinds of questions. So, there are reasons for tension that we have to think about. And these are not necessarily to the detriment of the civilization of Bengal. Secularism has been a very big cause in Bengal. Our most famous poet is Rabindranath Tagore but the next one is Kazi Nazrul Islam. And the magazine in which he used to publish had as its masthead a Bengali poem from the 15th century which said: “Above everything, a human being and there’s nothing above that”. ...secularism is very much on the ground, on the battlefield in these elections.BJP no doubt uses polarisation, but election strategist Prashant Kishore has acknowledged that TMC and Congress had only tried to appease Muslims and now Hindus wanted to vote for a party that was looking at their interests. Do you agree with this?It seems like an approximate history. Bengal has been a divided ground for a long time. When the British partitioned it early in the 20th century and wanted a Muslim part separated out, they hoped that there would be support from the Muslims in Bengal to having a part in which their numerical dominance would be acknowledged. What did the Bengalis do? Bengalis, both Hindus, and Muslims, were totally against it. One of the poems about the unity of Bengal “Amar Sonar Bangla” became later the national anthem of Bangladesh. Given that Muslims have been traditionally a lot poorer than Hindus in Bengal, which has been demonstrated by various studies, there is a need for justice in dealing with it, in looking after the poor, in looking after those at the rougher end of the pyramid of justice. This is important as people like Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose always pointed out. It is important to see who the poor in a region are and what can be done to help them. Now some of the concern with Muslims came for the same reason as the concern for Mataus, Namasudra, and the Hindu lower caste or the Hindu-related tribal population of Bengal.So, I think the whole idea of Muslims having done it, and now it was the time for Hindus to teach them a lesson, is just a part of the propaganda of a party inspired by Hindutva thoughts. And whoever says it is making a mistake because you have to look at people in terms of privilege and under-privilege. Indian government itself has made Muslims underprivileged so if you are being maltreated outside India, you cannot ask for a home in India as Hindus can. In these circumstances, you have to look at a fuller picture.Also watch | 8 phases not due to violence threat but political: Amartya Sen | On The RecordYou spoke about the lower caste communities and the underprivileged, the BJP counts them as their voters. They also voted for them in Uttar Pradesh and in the 2019 general elections. What would explain that?That’s a very interesting question because what happens electorally is not just a matter of what preceding justice was in a particular area. It depends so much on the organisational facility. One of the interesting things to look at far away from Bengal or UP would be say Kerala. Kerala had more untouchability, more caste division than almost anywhere else in India. And yet, because of ultimate organisation, in this case by the Left, the caste situation changed radically over time. And it was possible for the Communist Party, which ignored these caste divisions, to get support from all the castes. We must not ignore the enormous role that political organisation plays.Hindutva has been a very dynamic political movement. I may not agree with them, but I certainly admire many of their organisational feats and they were successful not in all the elections. ...As happened in some tribal areas, for example, take Tripura, the tribal population could be captured by BJP... We have to look at these organisational sides. That’s why if you were to ask the question, if Bengal is so secular, how come a Hindu party, whether they win or not, could be counted as a possibility? That’s because of the organisation. I don’t think we have ever seen an election in which we have seen so much attention paid from the Centre. Not only the Prime Minister but the [Union] Home minister [Amit Shah] and CM of the largest state of India [Yogi Adityanath] coming every other day, as it were, but also spending a lot more money. BJP has a lot more money to spend and is making good use of that. So, I think I would tend to look at it that way, that is neither a reason for hopelessness saying there’s nothing we can do. If you believe in your principles including that of secularism and non-divisive justice, you have to work for it. You have to work for it in a way that your own principles resonate better with all the groups, whether they be Muslims or Hindus, Dalits or non-Dalits.Do you think certain crucial mistakes were made by the state government?There may well have been, I haven’t studied it in particular. There are also achievements. The Bengali peasants still have a better health condition than the Gujarati peasants, despite being poorer. There are some delivery issues, but distribution has worked quite well and so on. There are mistakes made, for example, the way farmers are treated in India, but that doesn’t mean that the farmers are lost forever to the Central government. They still manage to win elections at the central level. So, it’s not such a simple thing because it’s very easy to point out mistakes but when we are doing political analysis, we have to search for the truth, and we have to have some humility also. What looks immediately like an answer, may not be an answer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-has-been-committed-to-secularism-in-a-way-that-s-quite-remarkable-amartya-sen-101618558274488.html

The state 2 that Gandhi mentioned was in the context of PM Modi’s appeal to the public to ring bells and thalis during Janta curfew last year.A day ago, Gandhi had mocked the PM-Cares Fund by alleging that there weren’t enough hospital beds, ventilators or oxygen, and yet, there was a sham of a festival. In a letter addressed to PM, Gandhi had also criticised the Centre for the poor implementation of the vaccination programme by exporting the vaccines and thereby creating “vaccine starvation” in the country.Earlier, in a meeting held with the Congress-led states, Congress chief Sonia Gandhi had also blamed the Centre for mismanagement of the situation in the country.The country has been witnessing a sharp increase in Covid cases with a daily tally of 217,353 new infections taking India’s total tally to 1,569,743.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tughlaqi-lockdown-says-rahul-gandhi-as-he-slams-centre-over-covid-strategy-101618557914504.html

16-04-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine: One dose isn't enough. Govt explains why you need both||The Centre on Friday released a video on why citizens need to take two doses of the vaccine against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) to keep themselves and their loved ones safe. Dr Randeep Guleria, director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, explained the importance of getting two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine. The clip issued on the Press Information Bureau’s (PIB)'s Twitter account.#COVID19Vaccine Is the first dose enough? No, 2 doses are essential to give us protection. Learn why & get yourself or your loved ones vaccinated And remind your loved ones to get their 2nd dose promptly#Unite2FightCorona @MIB_India @ddsahyadrinews @airnews_mumbai pic.twitter.com/2z34RRPyfwThe AIIMS chief said the first Covid-19 vaccine dose, known as the "prime dose", prepares the human immune system to build antibodies. However, these antibodies that are generated with the first dose won't last for a long time and will gradually wane with time, according to the senior doctor. After the second dose, called the "booster dose”, the immune system receives the boost to produce a large number of antibodies, Dr Guleria said, adding that it gives good "cell-mediated immunity", another defence mechanism against the coronavirus infection."It also stimulates what we call your memory cells so that the body remembers this infection for the long-term and is able to quickly produce anti-bodies later on as well if you get this infection,” the AIIMS director said. Dr Guleria urged citizens to get the two essential doses of the Covid-19 vaccine for optimum protection against the coronavirus disease.The Union ministry of health and family welfare, in its official Covid-19 related guidelines, states that an individual needs to take two doses of the vaccine, 28 days apart, to complete the vaccination schedule since protective levels of antibodies are generally developed two weeks after receiving the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. The guidelines by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) also recommend taking the second vaccine dose as close to the required interval as possible. If the second dose cannot be taken within the specified timeframes, it can be given up to six weeks (42 days) after the first dose as well, CDC’s guidelines state. It is not yet known if delaying the second dose longer than the aforementioned timeframe has an impact on the immune system's response to the coronavirus.Meanwhile, India extended its record daily run of new Covid-19 infections on Friday, with 217,353 fresh cases, according to the Union health ministry. This marks the eighth record daily increase in the last nine days and took total cases to nearly 14.3 million.

The statement, which I had made, has now been echoed by a poll panel observer. I am telling yet again. If central forces are attacked and people are obstructed from casting their votes, central forces should open fire. It doesn’t matter who gets killed ...

He talks all nonsense. He knows that he is going to lose and is hence talking through his hat to grab attention.

16-04-2021||India||The 1994 espionage case that led to Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan's arrest||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into the conspiracy behind the alleged framing of former Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) scientist Nambi Narayanan in a 1994 espionage case.Terming the matter as ‘serious’, the bench headed by Justice AM Khanwilkar ruled that the matter required ‘deeper investigation’ into the role of the officers responsible for the false implication of the former space scientist.What was the espionage case?In 1994, Kerala police arrested Isro scientist Nambi Narayanan for alleged espionage over the allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India's space programme to foreign countries.The case came to the light after a Maldivian national named Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram in October 1994 for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of Isro rocket engines to sell it to Pakistan.Narayanan was arrested along with the then Isro deputy director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.After two years of investigation, Narayanan was given clean-chit by CBI following a closure report in 1996. The investigation agency blamed state police officials and the then intelligence bureau deputy director RB Shreekumar for implicating the scientist.In 2018, the top court directed a high-level panel to probe the role of police officials and ordered the Kerala government to award ₹50 lakh in compensation to Narayanan for wrongful incarceration. The court called the police action against the former Isro scientists as a ‘psycho-pathological treatment’. In its order, the top court said, the scientist’s "liberty and dignity", basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face "cynical abhorrence".On April 5 this year, the central government approached the Supreme Court seeking consideration of a report filed by a committee regarding the role of police officials in the 1994 case.What Narayanan said:The 79-year-old Narayanan said that the Kerala police had "fabricated" the case. He also claimed that the technology that he was accused of stealing did not even exist at that time.Political fallout of the case:A section of the Congress leaders targeted the then chief minister of Kerala, late K Karunakaran, over his alleged involvement in the case. It eventually led Karunakaran to resign from his post.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-1994-espionage-case-that-led-to-isro-scientist-nambi-narayanan-s-arrest-101618555565896.html

After two years of above average rain, we are likely to receive normal monsoon rain this year,” said M Rajeevan, secretary, ministry of earth sciences (MoES). The LPA is the average rainfall recorded during 1961 to 2010 which is 88cm. IMD considers rainfall between 96% to 104% of LPA to be in “normal” range.The 2020 and 2019 monsoon was “above normal” at 110% and 109% of LPA respectively. During 1996, 1997 and 1998, monsoon was normal for three consecutive years at 103.4%; 102.2% and 104% respectively. La Niña conditions, which started in 2020, have started weakening, Rajeevan said. “La Niña conditions are likely to prevail only till May so we will transition to ENSO neutral conditions during monsoon. There is very little chance of El Niño conditions developing during monsoon months. There is a very small probability of Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) negative condition developing during monsoon. So these conditions are likely to lead to a normal monsoon this year,” Rajeevan explained.Also Read | Pre-monsoon rain deficiency hits statesEl Niño and the Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a periodic fluctuation in sea surface temperature and the air pressure of the overlying atmosphere across the equatorial Pacific Ocean according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).ENSO has a major influence on weather and climate patterns and leads to heavy rains, floods and drought. El Niño has a warming influence on global temperatures, whilst La Niña has the opposite effect. In India for example, El Niño is associated with drought or weak monsoon while La Niña is associated with strong monsoon and above average rain and colder winters.IOD is characterised by warmer sea surface temperature in the equatorial Indian Ocean; positive IOD conditions are usually associated with normal or above normal monsoon.A large part of east and northeast India including Jharkhand, Odisha, Bihar and the northeastern states are likely to record below normal rains this year according to IMD’s analysis.Monsoon is likely to be “normal” or “above normal” for the third consecutive year, according to private weather forecasting company Skymet Weather’s preliminary monsoon forecast for 2021. The forecast said monsoon rain from June to September is likely to be 103% of the long period average of 880.6mm.“The onset month of June and the withdrawal phase of September is assuring good countrywide rainfall distribution,” Skymet Weather said in a statement on Tuesday. In June, July and August, rainfall is likely to be “normal” with higher probability of “above normal” rain in September according to the forecast.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/monsoon-likely-to-be-normal-at-98-of-long-period-average-imd-101618555694722.html

In total, the government had filed three cases against the probe agency and also announced a judicial probe against it.One of the cases was based on the statement of accused Sandeep Nair, in which he said there was pressure on him to implicate the state government and the CM in the smuggling case. Earlier, according to another case filed by the state police, main accused Swapna Suresh alleged that the CM, three of his ministers and the Speaker were aware of the smuggling activities through the consulate.On Monday, the ED approached the HC and demanded that the FIRs be quashed as its officials were 'intimidated' and it was a ploy to weaken the gold smuggling case.

16-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||A young population, previous exposure to other coronaviruses, and some amount of resilience in warding off or fighting the SARS-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 may have all helped India flatten the curve of the first wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic, from a peak of 93,617 (seven-day average on September 16) to a low of 10,988 (seven-day average on February 11), but the three most significant factors were not any of these.These were, in no particular order, non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), mostly to do with behaviour (masking, hand-washing, social distancing) and restrictions on movement and activities; the test-trace-isolate-treat protocol that most states and territories adopted; and the fear of getting infected. It was the last that made people stay at home, not socialise, put off weddings or keep them really small, and generally behave as if going out would endanger their lives as well as the lives of those they lived with (in truth, it would have), and that it was not worth it.Over time, the benefits of all of these kicked in, India launched a vaccine drive, and everyone thought the battle was won. States and UTs went easy on testing, tracing, and isolating; the Union government as well as the states relaxed restrictions on movement and activities, and stopped monitoring compliance with other NPIs; and, driven by a potent mix of complacence and Covid-fatigue, people let their guards down. As I first wrote on June 21 last year (#87 of my first wave of columns): “So, bored, tired, lonely perhaps, and physically, mentally, and emotionally weary, we let things slip. And the virus wins.”Which is exactly what is playing out now. Based on health ministry’s data, India registered more than 200,000 daily new cases in the 24 hours to Thursday morning, with the actual number likely to be 10 times as high. Some worthies would like people to take comfort in the fewer deaths this time around, but as Jamie Mullick, who has probably done the best data journalism around the pandemic, wrote in HT, assuming a steady case fatality rate of 1.1%, it is clear that the death rate is inching up. This is best illustrated in his chart mapping the trajectory of cases (blue) and deaths (red). Reports coming in from some parts of India seem to suggest that the actual number of deaths could be higher. That’s entirely possible. Assuming that India was reporting deaths accurately in the first wave, and an infection fatality rate (deaths as a proportion of infections) of 0.1% (Dispatch 152 , published on September 8, explains how I arrived at this number), 2 million cases a day translates to 2,000 deaths. If all cases of Covid-19 are not being recorded, it stands to reason that all deaths on account of Covid-19 are also not being counted. Most states and UTs have also been quite brazen in their violation of an Indian Council of Medical Research guideline from last year requiring that a test be conducted on those suspected to have died from Covid-19.The big gap in our knowledge is whether the sudden surge in cases is being caused only by the factors discussed above, or if mutant strains of the virus (the co-called variants of concern) are at play. That is something only genome sequencing can tell us, and we are not doing enough of it. Still, NPIs will clearly work even when the infections are being caused by VOCs. So, what should India do now?One, everyone, governments, political leaders (if a private car can be considered a public space, what can be said of the stage for a political rally?), and all of us, need to get serious about NPIs.Two, governments need to accelerate testing (there’s simply nothing to be gained if the waiting time for a result is 2-3 days), tracing, and isolating.Three, the vaccine drive needs to be expanded and accelerated, which would entail ensuring more supplies, and dynamically redefining eligibility criteria.And four, India, which is one of the world’s leaders in the manufacture of small molecule drugs (even more than it is in vaccines), should start working with companies on some very promising lines of therapy. More on this in the next instalment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618541908213.html

16-04-2021||India||Delhi HC denies bail to Shahrukh Pathan, who pointed gun at cop during riots||The Delhi high court on Thursday dismissed a bail plea by Shahrukh Pathan, who allegedly pointed a pistol at a police head constable during the riots that broke out in north-east Delhi in February last year, saying “the video clips have shaken the court’s conscience”.Justice Suresh Kait said Pathan was not just part of a mob of rioters but he was leading the crowd. “It is hard to believe that the accused had no knowledge that his act may harm anyone present at the spot. The role attributed to the petitioner is not confined to participation in the mob of rioters but of heading the large crowd, holding a pistol in hand and releasing open fire shots,” the judge said.“...In the opinion of this court, the learned trial court has rightly held that the petitioner is alleged to have participated in riots and his picture speaks a volume about his involvement. Keeping in mind the gravity of offence committed by the petitioner as also the facts of the present case, I am not inclined to grant bail to the petitioner (Pathan),” said the judge.A picture of Pathan, 24, showing him pointing a pistol at an unarmed Delhi Police head constable, Deepak Dahiya, during the communal violence last year in Seelampur, went viral on social media. He was arrested on March 3 last year from Uttar Pradesh’s Shamli district.The police registered a case against him alleging that on February 24 last year, Pathan was party to the huge crowd which had pelted stones, petrol bombs and fired gunshots on the road between Jafrabad Metro station and Maujpur Chowk.The court also took strong note of some of the contents mentioned in the petition, which it said are not worth disclosing.Pathan sought bail on grounds that there was a 50-hour delay in lodging the case against him as the alleged incident took place on February 24, 2020, and the FIR was registered on February 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-denies-bail-to-shahrukh-pathan-who-pointed-gun-at-cop-during-riots-101618540381294.html

16-04-2021||India||CBI to probe conspiracy against ex-Isro scientist||The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered a probe by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the conspiracy behind framing former Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) scientist Nambi Narayanan in a spy case in 1994.The bench, headed by justice AM Khanwilkar, termed the matter “serious”, and required “deeper investigation” into the role of the officers responsible for the false implication of the former space scientist.Accepting the report by a committee appointed by the court in 2018, the bench said that CBI will be at liberty to use the contents of the report for registration of a preliminary enquiry (PE) to carry out further investigation.Former Supreme Court judge DK Jain was entrusted with the task of holding an inquiry into the circumstances that led to framing of Narayanan, now 79, and his arrest by the Kerala police in 1994 in an espionage case in which he was exonerated two years later following a closure report by CBI.Referring to the report, the bench, which also included justices Dinesh Maheshwari and Krishna Murari, said that the report did reveal that “everything was not hunky dory” and that the facts disclosed “acts of omission and commission by some officers of the state”.The bench added that the report has recommended that CBI should register a PE and conduct a thorough investigation so that criminal liability could be fastened on some officers identified by the committee who were “responsible for the situation”.The bench then recorded in its order that CBI will proceed in accordance with the law, and is at liberty to treat the report as a preliminary report. It said that CBI shall submit an action taken report in the court within three months to apprise the bench of the progress in the case.Narayanan welcomed the court order. “I welcome the verdict. I would like to know who all played behind the conspiracy that delayed our cryogenic project. The technology should have been in use by 1999, but it was delayed by 15 years. Let the truth come out,” he said in Thiruvananthapuram.During the proceedings, Sibi Mathews, former director general of the police of Kerala, who was identified by CBI as one of the officers responsible for concocting the case, complained that justice Jain did not hear his side of the story even though he heard Narayanan’s.Advocate Amit Sharma, representing Mathews, also said that the committee should have heard him if any aspersion was cast on him in the report. But the bench replied that the purpose of the committee was not to adjudicate, but to make recommendations. It added that an accused was not supposed to be heard before the registration of a case, which was yet to happen. The bench, however, accepted Sharma’s request that the report should be kept confidential and be not be leaked to the press.On his part, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union government, requested the bench to direct CBI to register a regular case (RC) straightaway in spite of first conducting a preliminary enquiry but the court said that CBI will have the freedom to choose its course of action.The case against Narayanan was filed by the state’s Congress government in 1994. The government handed over the probe to CBI, which cleared Narayanan of all charges and blamed some police officials and then Intelligence Bureau (IB) deputy director RB Shreekumar of implicating the space scientist. After a trial court accepted CBI’s closure report, the state government tried to revive the investigation but the apex court rebuffed this endeavour.In 2018, the SC also directed the state government to award Rs.50 lakh in compensation to Narayanan for his wrongful incarceration, malicious prosecution, and humiliation for being dragged in a false case. It had also observed that Narayanan deserved more, and that he could approach a lower court in Kerala for proper compensation. In August 2020, the Kerala government handed over an additional compensation of Rs.1.3 crore to Narayanan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbito-probe-conspiracy-against-ex-isro-scientist-101618533627534.html

He, however, did not name the countries.Afghanistan is a nation which is rich in resources and there are nations which tend to exploit resources for their own benefit...If that happens, it should be prevented. The international community must step in to ensure that Afghanistan is for the Afghans," he said.There have been renewed global efforts to bring lasting peace to Afghanistan.Russia recently organised a conference in Moscow where all major stakeholders were invited to brainstorm over ways to move forward in the peace process.India has been a major stakeholder in the peace and stability of Afghanistan.It has already invested USD two billion in aid and reconstruction activities in the country.India has been supporting a national peace and reconciliation process which is Afghan-led, Afghan-owned and Afghan-controlled.Last month, Afghan foreign minister Mohammad Haneef Atmar visited India during which External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar conveyed to him New Delhi's long-term commitment towards a peaceful, sovereign and stable Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/troops-withdrawal-from-afghanistan-shouldn-t-create-vacuum-for-disruptors-in-afghanistan-bipin-rawat-101618533217752.html

Later, Abhimanyu’s father A Kumar claimed that he was not so active in politics but his elder brother was a regular worker of the party. Police said they had identified two assailants and they would be arrested soon.“It is fact all our family members are Communists. He may be an SFI activist at school but he was not at all active. My second son, he was about to write the SSLC examination. I have no idea why he was killed like this,” his father said.But CPI(M) Alappuzha district secretary R Nazar said he was an active worker of the SFI and RSS workers were behind the murder. “It was a clear political murder,” he said adding assailants came in search of his elder brother but when they failed to get him they took revenge on his brother.But both the RSS and BJP distanced themselves from the incident saying the CPI(M) was desperate to make all murders political killings to mask the murder of a Muslim League activist in Kannur on the polling day-- April 6. Three days after the Kannur murder, one of the accused in the case was found hanging and his autopsy report claimed that he was attacked before suicide.“Police officials and the father of the victim said politics was not involved in the incident. CPI(M) is desperate to make it a political murder to get some sympathy as the party was exposed in some of the recent political clashes,” said BJP district president A V Gopakumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cpim-bjp-lock-horns-over-15-year-old-boy-s-murder-in-kerala-101618515134236.html

These 10 districts account for more than 51 per cent of the 13,784 active cases in the state.“The night curfew has been clamped to restrict the movement of people. There will be no restrictions on the vehicles carrying goods within the state and outside. No religious, social, cultural, academic and political gathering or procession will be allowed in Odisha, starting from Friday. The restrictions will be there till further orders,” said Mohapatra.While night curfew in the 10 districts close to Chhattisgarh would be between 6 pm and 5 am, for the rest of the state the timing is 9 pm- 5 am.The Odisha government also said inter-state bus operations would be suspended from April 19 while intra-state bus services will continue with limited capacity only. Only 2 passengers would be allowed in an auto and taxi while government offices will function with 50% staff.The Covid-19 surge in Odisha has been among the highest in eastern states this month. From 394 new cases on April 1 to 2989 cases now, infections have shot through the roof primarily due to R0 of 2.14, said epidemiologists. They said if the current surge continues, then by the mid-May, Odisha would see more than 10,000 cases daily.While the resurgence has been led by growth in districts like Sundargarh and Kalahandi, districts like Khurda and Cuttack are also fuelling the numbers. The holy town of Puri also witnessed a sudden spike registering 112 positive cases in a single day. Many servitors and their family members have tested positive for Covid-19..With Covid-19 cases exploding in Odisha, the state government on Thursday postponed the Class 10 and 12 board examinations while the Biju Patnaik University of Technology rescheduled the semester (regular/back) examinations for the academic session 2020-21.The Steel Authority of India Limited announced that its newly-opened Super Specialty Hospital at Rourkela with 60 ICU beds would be utilised as a Covid Care Hospital.

16-04-2021||India||Slugest as Oppn accuses Vijayan of protocol breach||Thiruvananthapuram: Amid the surging second wave of the coronavirus disease in Kerala, the opposition Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday sought action against chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan, claiming he flouted Covid-19 protocols and hid his illness so as to participate in a road show ahead of and voting during the assembly election on April 6, thereby endangering others. The chief minister tested positive for Covid-19 on April 8 and was admitted to the Government Medical College in Kozhikode the same day. He was discharged on Wednesday, six days after being hospitalised. When a controversy erupted over his early discharge, hospital authorities said he might have contracted the infection days before he got admitted. They added that when he was infected severely when admitted, but asymptomatic. According to Covid-19 protocol, patients have to be in quarantine for at least a week after testing negative -- usually two weeks in quarantine is prescribed. Hospital authorities said the CM would isolate in his home for a week. Union minister of state for external affairs V Muraleedharan said, “Hospital records show he was infected much earlier. On the polling day (April 6) his daughter Veena Vjayan, who was staying with him, came in a PPE suit to cast her vote. He should have gone on quarantine immediately. But on polling day, he came in a large group to the polling booth in Pinarayi village.” Muraleedharan asked the police to register a case against Vijayan. “Two days before the polling, the CM carried out a mega road show in his constituency.” “He gives big lessons to all on quarantine and post-quarantine norms. But it seems he is beyond these restrictions. He flouted all norms brazenly,” said Muraleedharan. The Kerala Youth Congress said it will petition Governor Arif Mohamad Khan against the CM. “If I would have violated Covid norms like this and stood in the long queue to exercise my franchise, my house would have been destroyed the same day,” Kerala Youth Congress leader Veena Nair, who is a candidate from Vattiyoorkavu, posted on social media. However, state health minister K K Shailaja said the whole controversy was unwarranted . She said the CM was discharged after testing negative, adding that he was in home quarantine for a week. “How can you say he was infected two days before the election? His daughter was infected on polling day (April 6) and got herself isolated in her house. There is no room for any controversy,” she said. But opposition parties said the minister was forced to defend the CM and some of her observations were “ill-founded”. As cases rise alarmingly in the state, the CM has convened a virtual meeting on Thursday to assess the situation.  Kerala logged 8,778 new Covid-19 cases and 22 related fatalities on Wednesday, taking the caseload to 1.18 million and the toll to 4,836, according to state government data. Among the districts, Ernakulam reported the highest number of 1,226 cases, followed by Kozhikode with 1,098 and Malappuram with 888.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/slugest-as-oppn-accuses-vijayan-of-protocol-breach-101618512971079.html
16-04-2021||India||80-90% decline in water birds’ count in last 2-3 decades in B’luru||Bengaluru Deteriorating ecology of lakes, the presence of untreated sewage, and concrete embankments that claim to help waterbody rejuvenation have led to a steady decline in the number of water birds found in Bengaluru, according to experts and environmentalists.Bird watchers and ornithologists say the decline could be anywhere between 80% to 90% over the last two to three decades. According to ornithologist and scientist S Subramanya, the use of civil engineering techniques for lake development has a profound impact on the water birds. “The lakes used to be shallow water basins with varying water depths and different birds would occupy different depths of water. Now, the lakes are usually desilted uniformly and only a small section of birds benefit from that,” he explained. For instance, deep water of uniform depth discourages waders, diverse populations of which migrate to India, including the southern peninsula in winter. Subramanya added that the lakes, which used to be seasonal have turned perennial due to the inflow of sewage water. “The structure and ecology of these lakes have changed and as a consequence, the water bird population has nosedived,” he added. Bird watchers who update lists of various species on online platforms also noticed higher presence of birds of a single species rather than diverse ones. According to a joint report by Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and National Environmental Research Institute (NEERI), 19 of the 205 extant lakes (out of an earlier estimate of 250) in and around the city are completely encroached. And only 21 have water that’s fit to drink. A report by the Karnataka State Pollution Control Board (KSPCB) in 2020 suggested that not even one lake had water fit for drinking. Between 2008 and 2020, the BBMP claimed to have developed around 80 out of 205 lakes with another 20 under various stages of completion, but this development often refers to the building of concrete structures around the lake rather than any focus on the ecology itself. According to State of India’s Birds 2020 , a report on the distribution and conservation of birds, there has been a “gradual decline” in the population of birds in the metro cities of Bengaluru, Chennai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Kolkata and Mumbai.Birders and environmentalists also referred to “man-made problems” such as rapid and unplanned urbanisation that is replacing the habitats of these winged creatures. Moreover, conservation efforts by the government often refers to the legal protection of animals, they added. The most noticeable change in Bengaluru is the disappearance and an explosion in the number of pigeons and barn owls, experts said. “Pigeons are traditionally known to lay eggs based on the availability of food. But they breed all year now since there is feeding by humans that has altered the very nature of their reproductive structures and caused an explosion in their numbers,” Chandrakanth, formerly with the University of Agricultural Sciences (UAS) in Bengaluru, said.Pigeons now tend to nest in every possible concrete structure, including apartments and other buildings to avoid threats from other predators as well, experts said. Studies showed that their excreta is capable of causing multiple diseases and is extremely acidic that can cause long-term damage to structures and humans and spread salmonella germs .  Similarly, Barn Owls which were a rare species of bird in the city, also nest in apartment complexes as open garbage attracts rats which are easy prey for these nocturnal birds, experts added. The sight of walkers and joggers feeding birds with all kinds of food such as biscuits, grains, puffed rice and even bread is a common sight in areas such as Cubbon Park and Lal Bagh . The use of chemicals and pesticides has also impacted the health of these birds who feed on seeds and insects in these areas. The trouble in assessing the actual impact is the lack of proper studies to determine the rise in population of a few birds and disappearance of others, birders and ornithologists said.“Of the 261 species for which long-term trends could be determined (i.e. not uncertain or data deficient), 52% have declined since 2000. In all, 43% of species showed a long-term trend that was stable and 5% showed an increasing trend,” according to the report by CSIR and NEERI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8090-decline-in-water-birds-count-in-last-2-3-decades-in-bluru-101618512911783.html

State capital Patna, the worst affected, with a cumulative death toll of 486 and case load of 66,913 out of Bihar’s 3.01 lakh cases and 1,675 deaths so far, breached all previous records, when it reported 2,105 cases, the highest in a day so far. Patna contributed to 10,068 active cases in Bihar’s 29,078 on Thursday. All 50 beds, which the AIIMS-Patna increased during the day, were filled up in a couple of hours. The AIIMS has now increased its bed capacity to 200, with the state government pushing it to scale it up to 250. Similarly, the 50 ICU beds, which were made operational at the Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), were also filled up in quick time. The Bihar government had earlier decided to convert its 750-bed Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH) in Patna into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital. It was declared a Covid-19 dedicated hospital, along with AIIMS-Patna, last year too. “We have decided to convert the NMCH into a dedicated Covid-19 hospital,” said state health minister Mangal Pandey. He said the IGIMS would add another 100 beds for Covid-19 patients in the next three days. Pandey had also instructed the department’s principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit to ensure that there was no shortage of oxygen, amid reports of shortage of oxygen at some private nursing homes and clinics. Amrit held discussions with the industries department in this connection. Some private facilities like Sai Hospital and Satyabrat Hospital at Kankerbagh locality in Patna reported shortage of oxygen on Wednesday. According to people familiar with the development, the crisis had arisen as one of the three suppliers in Patna had shut its unit for two days due to maintenance.Patna district magistrate Chandrashekhar Singh, who held a meeting with oxygen suppliers and hospital representatives, had instructed suppliers to make available 90% of their supply to hospitals. He asked the three suppliers — Usha Air Products Ltd, Bypass Road Sipara; Patliputra Industrial Gases Private Limited, Sabalpur, Deedarganj; and Banshi Air Gas Private Ltd at Fatuha — to ensure regular supply of oxygen so that there was no scarcity. Singh also advised all hospitals and nursing homes not to hoard any oxygen cylinders and take them as per their daily requirement to ensure seamless supply as demand had peaked with a spike in Covid-19 cases in the last couple of days. He also deputed a magistrate at each of the three supply centres to monitor supply to hospitals and ensure there was no hoarding and black marketing. The district administration also sealed a private engineering coaching institute at Kankerbagh, which was functioning despite the government’s instructions to keep them closed and was also not conforming to Covid-19 norms. Around 200 students were crammed in two rooms when the raiding party visited the institute on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-high-for-covid-19-cases-in-bihar-as-state-adds-6-133-fresh-infections-101618512672340.html
16-04-2021||India||Family of four found dead in Vizag flat||Hyderabad A family of four was found charred to death under mysterious circumstances at a flat in Andhra Pradesh’s Visakhapatnam early on Thursday, police said. The burnt bodies of Sunkara Bangaru Naidu (50), his wife Nirmala (44), and their children Deepak (22) and Kashyap (19) were found in their flat at Aditya Fortune Towers apartment in the upscale Madhurawada area in the city, police added. Visakhapatnam commissioner of police Manish Kumar Sinha, who visited the spot, told reporters that the incident came to light when one of the residents noticed smoke billowing out of Naidu’s flat at around 4 am and informed the local fire station. “The fire staff, who rushed to the spot, found the apartment locked from inside. They broke open the lock only to find all the four members of the family burnt,” Sinha said. Residents informed P M Palem police station about the incident. “While a short circuit was initially suspected as the reason behind the deaths, as the air conditioner and other electric appliances in the room were also found burnt, police turned wary after they found blood stains in the room,” the police commissioner said.A senior police official probing the case said on condition of anonymity that the bodies of Naidu, Nirmala and Kashyap were found with severe stab injuries near the main door, hall and bed room, respectively. The body of Deepak, was found in the bathroom of one of the rooms. “No injuries were found on his (Deepak’s) body and he was clad in a suit and tie. The dog squad and forensic team of the city police have visited the crime scene and collected evidence,” the official said. “Prima facie, it appeared there was an argument between Deepak and other members of the family over some issue. This may have gotten out of hand . It appears that the elder son later tried to set the place ablaze and escape but in the process, he too was caught in the fire,” the official added. The official also said that neighbours told the police that they heard screams around 2 am. “The forensic team is collecting all evidence from the spot. The visuals obtained from closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras showed Naidu was the last one who entered the flat at around 8.56 pm on Wednesday night. After that, there is no information on what happened inside,” Sinha said. The police commissioner said the family, from Gantwada village of Vizianagaram district, lived in Bahrain for four years before returning to Visakhapatnam eight months ago. “The family was constructing a new house nearby and had taken the flat on rent ,” Sinha said. During the course of the probe, police learnt that Naidu worked with a firm in Bahrain for about two decades. His wife Nirmala was a homeopathic doctor. “Deepak completed his engineering from National Institute of Techonology (NIT), Warangal, and was believed to be preparing for Civil Services Examination.The younger son was a student of Class 12,” Sinha said. “The family has no relatives and acquaintances in the area, so we couldn’t gather much information on Naidu. More details will be available after a thorough probe,” he added. A case has been registered under Sections 302 (murder) and 201 (hiding of evidence) of the Indian Penal Code.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/family-of-four-found-dead-in-vizag-flat-101618512672872.html

Darbar Move deferred because of Covid. Secretariat to function in both #Srinagar & #Jammu. Office functioning not to be affected because of eOffice,” Sinha tweeted on Thursday.Jammu & Kashmir recorded 1,141 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, taking the infection count to 142,877, while four more deaths raised the toll to 2,046. The practice of Darbar Move, under which the administration functions for six months from Jammu and six months from Srinagar, was started by Maharaja Gulab Singh in 1872 to escape the extreme weather conditions in the two regions.Since Jammu & Kashmir is witnessing a surge in the number of Covid-19 cases, the threat it poses to people and the staff on the move, it has been decided to defer the Darbar Move this time, the lieutenant governor said.“However, Secretariat will function in both Srinagar & Jammu with staff equitably split between two Secretaries will function from both locations in an equitable manner,” he said.He said the government’s functioning will not be affected as files will move electronically between the secretariats using the e-Office software.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jk-l-g-defers-darbar-move-secretariat-to-run-from-both-jammu-srinagar-101618512551832.html
16-04-2021||India||Set up control rooms for smooth oxygen supply, states told||New Delhi The Centre on Thursday directed states to set up control rooms to ensure smooth supply of medical oxygen to districts, and to review requirement of cylinders and tankers on a regular basis, with reports coming in of shortages in various parts of the country. In a meeting later on Thursday, the government decided to import 50,000 metric tonne of medical oxygen as a matter of precaution. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting of the empowered group 2 (EG2) that looks after the availability of essential medical equipment including medical oxygen. The officials also decided to map 12 high disease burden states to oxygen sources so that these states don’t face any shortage.Government data showed about 50% of the country’s supplies were available.“There has been increasing demand for medical oxygen, especially from the 12 states with high burden of active COVID cases… To give clarity and assurance to the states on oxygen supplied over the next few weeks of surge in cases, a mapping exercise was undertaken… as per the directions of EG2. Sources of medical oxygen and their production capacity was mapped to match the requirement of states and an indicative framework has been developed to guide the states on the sources of medical oxygen,” said Union health ministry in a statement. The high burden states are Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Punjab, Haryana and Rajasthan. While the demand in Maharashtra expected to go beyond available production capacity of the state, states like Madhya Pradesh do not have any production capacity to meet demand for medical oxygen. Besides, there is a trend of increasing demand in other oxygen producing states such as Gujarat, Karnataka, Rajasthan, according to the health ministry. Accordingly, the health ministry has indicated 4,880 metric tonne, 5,619 metric tonne and 6,593 metric tonne to these 12 states for meeting their projected demand as on April 20, April 25, and April 30, respectively.“There is no shortage of medical oxygen in the country; in fact, there is more than what we currently need, and the supplies are being further ramped up as a measure of abundant precaution,” said a senior government official aware of the matter, who did not wish to be identified. On Wednesday, the medical oxygen consumption in the country was 3,842 metric tons, which is about 54% of the daily production capacity.The health ministry reiterated in a statement that there is sufficient production capacity of around 7,127 MT for oxygen in the country, and as per need, the surplus oxygen available with the steel plants is also being utilized. On Thursday, Reliance Industries’ Mukesh Ambani started supplying oxygen from the company’s refinery in Jamnagar to Mumbai, which is among the biggest hotspots of Covid-19 in the country. The problem may not be in the cities as much as it is outside them, said one expert. “In cities, oxygen shortage is not usually a problem; it is the smaller towns that may face a supply crunch if hospitalizations increase in a big way. Oxygen therapy is critical in saving lives, and it is not just about giving oxygen but also how it is given that makes a huge difference in treatment outcome. The need is to keep the wastage minimal,” said a senior critical care specialist, in a prominent government-run hospital, who asked not to be named....||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/set-up-control-rooms-for-smooth-oxygen-supply-states-told-101618512431640.html

All social, religious, political, or weddings of over 200 people were barred and all cinema halls, restaurants, bars and gyms were asked to operate at 50 % capacity. All educational coaching institutes and swimming pools will be closed, said the government.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageThe order came hours after the state reported its highest one-day spike of Covid infections, posting 2,220 cases.But the order said in case of the Mahakumbh – which is ongoing in Haridwar --- the standard operating procedure (SOP) issued by Centre in January and the state government in February will remain in effect. The standard operating procedure does not place any restrictions on the gathering of people and only seeks social distancing and Covid negative test report to enter the Kumbh area.Activists said the decision was inexplicable. “It is a strange decision at a time when the state has reported the highest daily spike...exempting Mahakumbh area from these restrictions will make it difficult to check Covid in the state in particular and in India in general. Just on Wednesday, Haridwar witnessed pilgrim rush of over 1.3 million people at a time when we are witnessing a sharp surge in Covid cases,” said Anoop Nautiyal, from Social Development for Communities Foundation, a non-governmental organisation.Hundreds of thousands of people have violated the government’s Covid-19 guidelines since the Mahakumbh began on April 1. On the third “shahi snan” on Wednesday, 1.35 million devotees took a dip in the Ganga,. In the previous “shahi snan” (royal bath) on April 12, 3.1million people participated.Security personnel handed out challans to some people in the crowd over violations of the Covid-19 norms, but visuals showed that a majority of seers gathered to bathe in the Ganga were in violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour.After the capital Dehradun (37,743 cases), Haridwar is the worst-hit district in the state with 19575 infections. On Thursday, Haridwar posted 613 cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfew-in-u-khand-but-not-at-kumbh-mela-101618512430986.html
16-04-2021||India||Gujarat is facing tsunami of cases: HC pulls up state govt||AhmedabadThe Gujarat high court on Thursday pulled up the state government for alleged discrepancies in the number of coronavirus disease cases and said that the state is facing a “Tsunami” of infections.The court was hearing a suo moto petition into the state’s response to the pandemic. “The figures given by the state are not matching with the actual number of positive cases,” a division bench led by Chief Justice Vikram Nath said. Gujarat on Thursday reported 8,152 fresh infections and 81 new fatalities, taking the state’s tally to 375,768 cases and 5,089 deaths. “We told you to get ready with more COVID-designated hospitals; sufficient beds should be available; testing should be increased; make sure people wear masks; and (maintain) strict vigilance at public places,” the bench said.“But, it seems that the state government did not give due consideration to our suggestions. That is why we are seeing a Tsunami of corona at present,” the bench said.In his response, Advocate General Kamal Trivedi assured the court that the state government was “serious” and doing everything possible to fight the pandemic.The bench also raised doubts over the Bharatiya Janata Party government’s claims about the availability of beds, testing facilities, medical oxygen and Remdesivir injections.“Doctors are administering it (Remdesivir) indiscriminately,” Trivedi claimed, adding that the situation would improve after the Centre, banned the export of the drug at the request of the Gujarat government.An unimpressed bench, also comprising Justice Bhargav D Karia, asked, “Do you mean to say that the hype behind Remdisivir is being created by doctors? Do you have an idea of what is the requirement of Remdevisir?” According to the national treatment protocol, Remdesvir is one of the investigational drugs approved for use in treating hospitalized Covid-19 patients. With the rising cases, the demand for the drug has also shot up. To be sure, most studies have shown the drug has no real effect and it has been removed from the treatment protocol in many countries. According to a status report filed by Trivedi, 71,021 beds are available in over 1,000 facilities across the state and Covid-19 patients occupy only 53% of beds as on April 12.Questioning these numbers, the bench said, “We have serious doubts about this figure. You are saying only 53% are occupied. Yet patients are not being admitted. In that case, how can this figure be true?” The high court also appeared unconvinced about the government’s claim that it is doing its best to meet the demand of medical oxygen. “Hospitals are not admitting patients who require oxygen. We have learned that oxygen is being black-marketed. Hospitals are misusing their quota. Oxygen is being siphoned off after getting approval for beds while patients are turned away claiming that it is not available,” the bench said.(With PTI inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-is-facing-tsunami-of-cases-hc-pulls-up-state-govt-101618512371023.html
16-04-2021||India||EC bars Bengal BJP chief for 24 hours for ‘inciteful remarks’||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Thursday banned Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s West Bengal chief Dilip Ghosh from campaigning in the state for 24 hours for his “highly provocative and inciteful remarks” on the Sitalkuchi firing incident, in which four people were killed as polling was underway last week. A day after violence broke out during fourth phase of polling in Cooch Behar district on April 10, Ghosh had said at a rally in Baranagar in North 24 Parganas that “there will be Sitalkuchi in several places”. Four people were killed in firing by Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) personnel in Sitalkuchi. While the ruling Trinamool Congress (TMC) alleged the firing was unprovoked, the poll watchdog and central forces said it was in “self-defence” as the security personnel at the polling booth were under attack by a mob. On Sunday, the TMC filed a complaint against Ghosh for his statement, prompting the ECI to seek his response. “The commission sternly warns Dilip Ghosh and advises him to desist from using such statement while making public utterances during the period when Model Code of Conduct is in force and imposes a ban of 24 hours...,” the ECI order said, adding that the “highly provocative and inciteful remarks” can “adversely impact law and order thereby adversely affecting the election process”.The ban for violating the Model Code of Conduct is applicable from 7pm Thursday till 7pm Friday, April 16, the order stated. Ghosh, when asked about the ban, said on Thursday he will take the time off campaigning to rest. “The ECI ordered whatever it thought was right. I will stay at home and take rest. I was not getting proper sleep and time to have a proper meal because of the campaigning,” he said. The TMC, however, said that Ghosh should have been banned for at least 72 hours. “Today (Thursday) was a holiday. He will eat sweets. He should have been banned for 72 hours,” said chief minister Mamata Banerjee in an interview to ABP Ananda on Thursday evening.Ghosh isn’t the only leader to have been banned from campaigning by the poll panel as the state began voting in eight phases on March 27. On Monday, Banerjee too was barred from campaigning for 24 hours by the ECI for allegedly appealing to Muslim voters to unite and urging local women to surround central forces if they create disturbances. The TMC called the decision unfair and Banerjee protested in Kolkata on Tuesday.BJP leader Rahul Sinha had been banned earlier this week from canvassing for the party after he said “not just four, but eight people should have been killed by central forces in Sitalkuchi”. TMC defector and Banerjee’s rival in Nandigram constituency Suvendu Adhikari was, too, warned by the ECI to desist from making communally charged statements. Forty-five constituencies will vote in the fifth phase of polling in Bengal on April 17. Voting will end on April 29, and results counted on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-bars-bengal-bjp-chief-for-24-hours-for-inciteful-remarks-101618512251016.html
16-04-2021||India||Railways adds more special trains as Covid-19 curbs return||The Indian Railways is adding special trains to cater to the rush of migrant workers heading back to their home states from the big cities, taking current operations to nearly 70% of pre-Covid levels, as the country’s mass transport lifeline seeks to avoid a rerun of last summer’s situation where thousands of people were forced to walk hundreds of miles in the absence of rail services.Over the past week, the railways planned 69 additional “summer special trains” to cater to the rush being reported across stations. By April 30, the national transporter has planned 133 additional trains with 88 “summer special”’ and 45 “festival special” trains.According to railway ministry data till Wednesday, the national carrier has approved a total of 9,622 special trains and is currently running an average of 7,745 trains as against 11,283 during pre-Covid times. Of these, a total of 5,387 suburban trains are currently deployed, nearly 92% of pre-Covid capacity, with the most services operating in the central railway zone that caters to Maharashtra’s highly populated cities, including Mumbai and Pune.“We have told zones to add special trains wherever the demand is coming. We are ready to deploy more trains. This is regular summer rush that the railways witnesses. As per the demand we are adding these summer special trains,” a senior ministry official said.According to the railways, these additional trains are for high-demand destinations such as Gorakhpur, Patna, Darbhanga, Varanasi, Guwahati, Barauni, Prayagraj, Bokaro, Ranchi and Lucknow.Amid lockdown curbs being announced by states with heavy migrant populations, such as Maharashtra, several cities have reported an unusual rush of people across interstate bus stations and railway stations though the railway ministry has maintained that this is the regular summer festival rush.On May 1 last year, the Centre began operating Shramik Special trains to ferry hundreds of thousands of stranded migrants back to their home states. The national carrier last year deployed a total of 4,621 special trains and carried 6.31 million migrant workers. The trains ferried the highest number of migrants back to Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, the country’s most populous states, followed by Jharkhand, Odisha and West Bengal.Last week railway board chairman Suneet Sharma clarified there were no plans to curtail passenger trains services. He added that the railways will continue to run trains as per the demand amid reports of migrant labourers rushing to stations due to fears of another hard lockdown.“There is no plan to curtail or stop train services. We will run as many services as required. There is no cause for alarm…Wherever there is a surge in demand we will increase trains. There is no shortage of trains for those who want to travel. I assure everyone that trains will be provided on demand wherever the need arises,” Sharma said at a press conference.The railways last year in March suspended regular train services during the nationwide lockdown to curb the spread of Covid while regular freight train movement continued. At present, it is running special passenger trains while regular operations have still not resumed. The ministry is restoring passenger train operations in a phased manner. It has planned more trains during April-May to clear the rush.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rlys-adds-more-migrant-trains-as-curbs-return-101618512131589.html
16-04-2021||India||Conduct remaining phases of polls in one go: Mamata to EC||Kolkata With West Bengal registering an alarming spike in the daily count of Covid-19 cases, chief minister Mamata Banerjee urged the Election Commission of India on Thursday to hold the remaining phases of the state assembly elections in one go. On Friday, the state’s chief electoral officer will meet representatives of all the 10 recognised political parties in the state to ensure that Covid-19 protocols are followed during election campaigns. “Amid an ongoing pandemic, we firmly opposed ‪@ECISVEEP’s decision to conduct WB polls in 8 phases. Now, in view of the huge surge in #COVID19 cases, I urge the ECI to consider holding the remaining phases in ONE go. This will protect the people from further exposure to #COVID19,” Banerjee tweeted on Thursday evening. On Wednesday, the Calcutta high court ordered the state’s chief election officer and all district magistrates to ensure strict implementation of coronavirus-related protocols in political campaigns for the remaining four phases of polling. “Four phases have been completed while the fifth phase is scheduled on Saturday. The ECI can hold the remaining three phases in one go. After the fifth phase ends around 114 seats will remain. They can give us (political parties) some time for campaigning and conduct the polls in one phase around April 26,” Banerjee said in an interview to a vernacular media channel on Thursday evening. A senior official of the poll panel has said that there are no plans at present to hold the remaining phases in one go. West Bengal reported 6,769 new cases on Thursday, which was more than 31 times the daily count on February 26, when the ECI had announced the poll dates. This is also the highest daily count of Covid-19 the state has registered since the disease broke out in 2020. “The election is being conducted by the ECI. Every political party has to have deep faith in the poll panel’s ability and neutrality,” said Jay Prakash Majumdar, vice-president of the BJP’s state unit. While a Congress candidate from Murshidabad district, who was Covid-positive, died on Thursday, at least five other candidates of various political parties have been diagnosed with the virus. “If the ECI decides to postpone or conduct the election (remaining phases) before the scheduled dates the Congress has no objection. The Congress party and the Sanjukta Morcha don’t play with the life of the common people,” Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, president of the Congress party in West Bengal, told the media in Murshidabad. The TMC chief slammed the BJP and held it responsible for the spike in Covid cases, alleging that the party is bringing in hundreds of men from outside the state for election campaigns. “They (BJP) are bringing in hundreds of men from outside. All their top leaders, including the Prime Minister, Union home minister, other central ministers and chief ministers of all BJP-ruled states are coming every day and holding rallies. Can we test each and every one of them?” said Banerjee. Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath tested positive for Covid-19 and is isolating himself, he tweeted on Wednesday. He held three rallies in south Bengal on April 8. “The ECI should complete the poll process at the earliest. The more it lingers, the higher would be the spike. We need to focus on Covid-19 at the moment. Else the situation would aggravate further. Mass gatherings where people hardly follow the safety protocols act as superspreaders. The HC order is welcome and should be strictly implemented. All safety protocols have taken a back seat in the elections rallies as a result of which, the cases are rising,” said Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state. While the BJP earlier on Thursday alleged that the same group of miscreants who shot an 18-year-old first-time voter at Sitalkuchi in Cooch Behar on April 10 attacked central forces in a planned manner, Banerjee said later the entire sequence of events in which four people were shot dead by central forces was planned by a BJP MP along with central agencies. Meanwhile, an FIR was lodged against Banerjee in Cooch Behar alleging that she instigated voters to gherao central forces which led to the firing incident in which four persons were killed. Banerjee had earlier been banned for 24 hours from canvassing for allegedly making statements against central forces.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/conduct-remaining-phases-of-polls-in-one-go-mamata-to-ec-101618512130981.html
16-04-2021||India||Centre simplifies re-issue process for OCI cardholders||The Centre said on Thursday that the Overseas Citizen of India (OCI) cardholders will now be required to get their document re-issued only once at the age of 20 instead of multiple times needed currently.According to a Press Information Bureau statement, a person who has got registration as OCI cardholder prior to attaining the age of 20 years will have to get the card re-issued only once when a new passport is issued after his or her completing 20 years of age, so as to capture his or her facial features on attaining adulthood.If a person has obtained registration as OCI cardholder after attaining the age of 20 years, there will be no requirement of re-issue of OCI card, it said.Currently, the OCI card is required to be re-issued each time a new passport is issued up to 20 years of age and once after completing 50 years of age, in view of biological changes in the face of the applicant. “With a view to facilitate the OCI cardholders, the government has decided to dispense with this requirement,” it added.The decision, officials familiar with the matter said, has been taken on the directions of Union home minister Amit Shah as part of the government’s desire to simplify the process and it is expected to significantly ease the process for re-issue of OCI cards.The OCI card has proved to be very popular among foreigners of Indian origin and spouses of foreign origin of Indian citizens or OCI cardholders, as it helps them in hassle-free entry and unlimited stay in India. So far about 37.72 lakh OCI cards have been issued by the government of India, the statement said.According to the extant law, a foreigner of Indian origin or a foreign spouse of an Indian citizen or foreign spouse of an OCI cardholder, can be registered as an OCI cardholder. The OCI card is a life-long visa for entry into and stay in India with a number of other major benefits attached to it which are not available to other foreigners.The PIB said, “With a view to update the data regarding new passports obtained by the OCI cardholder, it has been decided that he or she shall upload a copy of the new passport containing his or her photo and also a latest photo on the online OCI portal, each time a new passport is issued up to 20 years of age and once after completing 50 years of age. These documents may be uploaded by the OCI cardholder within three months of receipt of the new passport.”However, the spouses of the cardholders will have to upload the copy of their passport along with a declaration that their marriage is still subsisting each time a new passport is issued.The Centre said there will be no restriction on the cardholder to travel to or from India during the period from the date of issue of new passport till the date of final acknowledgement of documents in the web-based system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-simplifies-re-issue-process-for-oci-cardholders-101618511770949.html
16-04-2021||India||India to process Covid vaccine import license in 3 working days post approval||India’s drug controller will process import licenses and registration certificate applications of foreign-made Covid-19 vaccines in three working days after granting the emergency-use approval, according to the Union health ministry’s regulatory pathways announced on Thursday.The government on Tuesday said Covid-19 vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India. The move is expected to potentially boost India’s pandemic response when it has recorded the world’s biggest surge in infections.“Applications for restricted use in emergency situation for such vaccines maybe accompanied by bridging trial protocol, application for import registration certificate and application for import license. Central Drugs Standards Control Organisation (CDSCO) will process applications for registration certificate (registration of overseas manufacturing site and product) and import license, within 3 working days from the date of approval of restricted use in emergency situation,” said Union health ministry in a statement.An application can be made by a foreign manufacturer through its Indian subsidiary. It can also be filed through an authorised agent in India in case a company does not have an Indian subsidiary.“The drugs controller general of India (DCGI) will issue permission for restricted use in emergency situation with, inter-alia, the following conditions: vaccine shall be used as per the guidelines prescribed under National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme. First 100 beneficiaries of such vaccines shall be assessed for 7 days for safety outcomes before it is rolled out for further Vaccination program. Applicant shall initiate conduct of post approval bridging clinical trials within 30 days of such approval,” the Centre’s guidelines said.Foreign-made Covid-19 vaccines were also Tuesday granted exemption from conducting local bridging studies prior to seeking emergency use authorisation provided they have approval from any of the major regulators globally or the World Health Organisation (WHO).Companies have been given the flexibility to perform the bridging studies parallel to administering of the shots to the general population.The Centre has said each vaccine batch will be released by the Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL), Kasauli, before it can be used as per the guidelines prescribed under the National Covid-19 Vaccination Programme.After receiving approval from the CDL, an applicant will use the Covid-19 vaccine only on 100 beneficiaries initially and submit the safety data to the CDSCO. The company concerned will be allowed to use the vaccine only after the safety data of 100 beneficiaries submitted by it is reviewed by the subject experts in CDSCO and found to be satisfactory.The regulator will approve the protocol for the bridging trial in consultation with its subject expert panel within seven days of the receipt of the proposal.The government hopes that this decision will facilitate quicker access to foreign vaccines by India and encourage imports including that of bulk drug material, optimal utilization of domestic fill and finish capacity etc, which will, in turn, provide a flip to vaccine manufacturing capacity and total vaccine availability within the country.Dr V K Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, said there is no compromise on the quality of data. “It has to be robust. India is known to approve quality drugs and vaccines globally, and export in large volumes, and there is no question of diluting that. The regulatory mechanism has been modified to save time in special situations like this pandemic,” he saidCompanies will conduct the bridging trial within the timelines specified under the approved protocol and submit the data. After the receipt of the bridging trial results, the ’ controller will review the permission granted for restricted use in an emergency situation.Also Read | WHO asks researchers to use Covid-19 lessons to battle deadly superbugs“Only the condition of a prior bridging trial has been done away with, and that has been allowed to run in parallel,” said Paul.Paul on Tuesday said they hope to invite vaccine makers such as Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J.The accelerated approval will apply to doses authorised by the US Food and Drug Administration, UK’s Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, European Medicines Agency, Pharmaceuticals, and Medical Devices Agency Japan, or by the World Health Organization.There are vaccines by three companies that are approved by regulators identified by the government and are yet to be authorised in India: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and J&J. A fourth vaccine, made by Novavax, has made progress in clinical trials and sought approval from several of these regulators.Among these, two companies already have tied up with Indian companies for production — Novavax and J&J. Novavax has licensed Serum Institute of India to produce a billion doses and the Pune-based company is also carrying out bridging trials in the country. Similarly, Hyderabad’s Biological E has a deal to produce 600 million doses of the J&J vaccine and was recently poised to begin bridging studies.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were among the first to be approved anywhere in the world last year. Both have an efficacy rate of over 95% and use mRNA technology, which has emerged as a breakthrough platform for coronavirus vaccines.India is the world’s biggest maker of vaccines. It has so far doses of Covishield and Covaxin, the first two shots to be approved in the country. A third, Sputnik V made by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, was approved formally on Tuesday, and doses are expected to be imported at first before a group of five Indian companies that have contracts to begin churning out doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-process-covid-vaccine-import-license-in-3-working-days-post-approval-101618489929093.html
