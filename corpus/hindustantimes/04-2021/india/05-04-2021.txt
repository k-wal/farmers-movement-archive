05-04-2021||India||Maharashtra's daily Covid-19 caseload dips by 10,000, Mumbai's tally down too||Maharashtra on Monday recorded 47,288 new cases of Covid-19 on Monday, according to state department's health bulletin, marking a decrease from the 57,074 cases the state had recorded a day earlier. At 9,879 new cases, its capital Mumbai too reported a dip in the number of cases in the 24-hour span. Dharavi, one of the worst-affected areas in Mumbai during last year's peak, reported 47 new cases on Monday. The state-wide total now stands at 30,57,885.This decrease in daily caseload is due to a dip in the number of samples. On Sunday, 1,96,988 tests were carried out, whereas today, this number dipped to 1,75,682, the health bulletin showed. So far, 2,07,15,793 samples have been tested in Maharashtra.The state reported 155 deaths on Monday, taking the death toll to 56,044. Mumbai reported 21 deaths in the last 24 hours, and the city's death toll now stands at 11,800. The state currently has 4,51,375 active Covid-19 cases.26,252 patients were discharged today, bringing the recovery rate in the state to 83.36%, the health bulletin showed. Till date, a total of 25,49,075 people have been discharged, said the bulletin.Dr Shekhar Mande, director-general of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), told reporters via a video conference on Sunday that a mutant variant of Covid-19 has been a cause of concern in Maharashtra. Mande said the mutant was first observed in the United States and probably reached the state through people who travelled to India from the US. He also urged people to follow Covid-19 preventative behaviour.“We have asked the state government to monitor L452R mutant, which is causing concern. On this, I am in constant touch with the state government,” Mande told reporters.Maharashtra continues to be the worst affected state in the country followed by Punjab. The state has added 426,108 Covid-19 cases to the country's coronavirus tally in the last two weeks as of March 31. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray wrote to the Prime Minister on Monday, urging him to reduce the age limit of vaccine eligibility to 25 years, owing to the rise in the number of daily cases. So far, the Centre has only allowed states to vaccinate those above 45 years of age.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtras-daily-covid-19-caseload-dips-by-10-000-mumbai-s-tally-down-too-101617637218043.html

The bridge runs over Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir’s Reasi district. The bridge, which is 35-metre higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, is expected to be completed within a year, said Northern Railway General Manager Ashutosh Gangal at the work site in Reasi.“It is a historic day for the Northern Railways and a milestone in the completion of the USBRL project, connecting Kashmir with the rest of the country. The project will be completed within two and a half years,” Gangal added.The final metal closure joined the two arms of the arch that currently stretch towards each other from both banks of the Chenab.The construction of the arch of the world’s highest railway bridge, which soars 359 metres above the bed of the Chenab river in Jammu and Kashmir, was completed on Monday.The 1.3 kilometre-long bridge aims to boost connectivity to the Kashmir Valley and is being constructed at a cost of ₹1,486 crore as part of the Udhampur-Srinagar-Baramulla Railway Link (USBRL) project.Railway minister Piyush Goyal watched the lowering of the closure segment of the arch by cable crane through a video link from Delhi. The Arch looms over Chenab, flowing 359 metres below.“This was one of the most difficult parts of the bridge over Chenab. This achievement is a major leap towards the completion of the 111 km-long winding stretch from Katra to Banihal. It is arguably the biggest civil-engineering challenge faced by any railway project in India in recent history,” Gangal said. The 5.6-metre last piece of metal was fitted at the highest point Monday and joined the two arms of the arch that currently stretch towards each other from both the banks of the river. With this, the shape of the arch got completed which will loom over the treacherous Chenab.After the completion of the arch work, removal of the stay cables, filling of the concrete in the arch rib, erection of the steel trestle, launching of the viaduct and track laying work will be taken up.Indian Railways is constructing the iconic Arch Bridge on river Chenab as a part of the USBRL project to connect the Kashmir valley to the rest of the nation. This bridge is about 1,315 meters long. The construction of the bridge involved the fabrication of 28,660 MT steel, 10 lakh cum earthwork, 66,000 cum concrete and 26 km motorable roads.The sophisticated ‘Tekla’ software was used for its structural detailing and the structural steel is suitable for -10 degrees Celsius to 40 degrees Celsius temperature, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unparalleled-feat-indian-railways-completes-arch-of-world-s-highest-rail-bridge-101617640217489.html
05-04-2021||India||Uddhav Thackeray writes to PM Modi, asks for lowering the age bar for Covid-19 vaccine to 25||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Monday urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to widen the ambit of vaccinating people against the Covid-19 disease outbreak and permit the inoculation of people aged 25.In a letter to the Prime Minister, Thackeray reasoned that the move will benefit Maharashtra - the worst-affected state - and those vaccinated by reducing the severity among the young and working population falling in that age bracket."I request you to lower it to 25, as the states facing the surge are having to place curbs to safeguard lives of the population. However, if a larger number of our young and working population is vaccinated, the intensity of the cases would be much lower than the treatment that they need today," Thackeray said in his letter. A copy of the letter was shared by the chief minister's official Twitter account.Underlining that the state has remained at the forefront of vaccination drive by administering the most doses, Thackeray said, "Maharashtra has taken Covid-19 vaccination very seriously and we are the number one state in the country in terms of total number of Covid vaccine doses administered."CM Uddhav Balasaheb Thackeray has written to the Hon’ble Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi to further lower the age group eligible for vaccination to 25years old to curb the intensity of the rising cases in the state. pic.twitter.com/YWwebaYW9X"As of Sunday, we have administered 76.86 lakh doses of Covid vaccine, which is highest in the country. We have recently ramped up our vaccination drive and on April 3, we administered more than 4.62 lakh covid vaccine doses in a single day," the CM said in his letter.Amid the second wave, Thackeray said that the state, with its increased testing and absolute transparent methods of reporting, is reaching out to each and every possible Covid-19 positive person to assist her/ him on the way to recovery.India, currently in its third phase of Covid-19 vaccination, has started vaccinating people above the age of 45. In the first phase, which started on January 16, India vaccinated healthcare workers with two vaccines - Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited). The drive was further opened up to 20 million frontline workers February 1 onwards.In the next phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive, authorities aimed to inoculate people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities against the coronavirus from March 1.The vaccine drive was meant to first immunise 300 million people who belong to three categories: healthcare workers, frontline workers, and those at greater risk from Covid-19 due to their age or existing medical conditions.Thackeray also reminded the PM that the state has also requested for additional vaccine doses so that the six districts "facing the surge of Covid-19 can be covered on priority and in greater speed"."Mumbai, Pune, Thane, Nashik, Nagpur and Aurangabad can be covered in a matter of 3 weeks, for the population above 45, if 1.5 crore doses are made available to the state by the government of India," he said.India recorded the highest single-day rise of 1.03 lakh new Covid-19 cases, prompting PM Modi to convene another round of meetings with chief ministers and state health ministers on Thursday amid growing calls to open up the vaccination drive against the disease to all age groups.Additionally, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan will hold a meeting on Tuesday with health ministers of 11 states that have been witnessing a surge in cases to review the situation there.The 11 states are Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Punjab and Rajasthan.While a few states like Delhi, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu have announced closure of schools for an indefinite period, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan, Bihar and Punjab among others have suspended classes for a brief period. Schools have been directed to impart education through online mode.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uddhav-thackeray-writes-to-pm-modi-asks-for-lowering-the-age-bar-for-covid-19-vaccine-to-25-101617636637958.html

05-04-2021||India||Elections promise no relief for Tiruppur’s stressed textile industry||It’s about 6pm and the workers at SJ International, a textile firm that specialises in embroidery, have just completed their ‘April 1’ prayers to herald in the new financial year. There is an eerie silence in the small factory as the swanky looking machines from Japan, extending from one end of the room to the other, have been switched off since the company has just one order and the machines can only be used when embroidering over 10 pieces of clothing at one go.“There is nothing we can say. Just take a look at the switched off machines and you will understand our position,” said Kumar, the manager of this establishment. Orders have been hard to come by. The company only provides value added services to the larger exports business, but poor order books have cast a shadow of uncertainty in Tiruppur’s once thriving textile business.Five years ago, the cost of embroidery on one piece was ₹40 and the salary of an operator was ₹7000. Now the cost of embroidery is ₹20, but the salary of the operator has more than doubled to ₹15000, Kumar said, listing out one of the many challenges of this textile town.As we walk out, we stumble upon a poll-pamphlet promising ₹1500 per family per month, a washing machine, one government job, a solar stove and other attractive offers if All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) comes to power. Similarly, the loudspeakers used for campaigning by the Communist Party of India candidate, who is in alliance with the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK), can be heard for several hundred meters in the bylanes of the Appaji Nagar, where several small and medium size units operate.Elections in the state have brought with it no hope for an industry that has taken one blow after another since demonetisation in 2016, introduction of goods and services tax (GST) and then the Covid-19 outbreak last year. The latest of the challenges for the industry are the surge in Yarn prices that have gone up by as much as ₹60-70 per kg, hurting orders and margins.“We are just not getting Yarn as suppliers say they do not have any even if we are willing to pay a higher price. The delays add to pressure on delivery targets, and we are forced to shell out more for freight cost,” Ravi Kumar, an entrepreneur who runs a medium size textile unit said.The city of Tiruppur has thousands of small and big textile companies who specialise in knitwear and readymade garments. The first knitwear unit in this parched district was set up in 1925 and by the 1940’s it started to turn into a large hub for textiles. Coimbatore, one of the three centres (including Bombay and Ahmedabad) in India that was referred to as ‘Manchesters’ is just 40 kms away.Though Tiruppur focused on the domestic industry till about the 1980’s, the fortunes of this small town took a turn for the better since then as it began exports, first to Italy.Legend has it that popular Italian brand Verona first came to this town in 1978 through Mumbai (then Bombay) to buy white T-shirts.Today there are hundreds of internationally reputed brands whose base for production is Tirupur like Nike, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, Ralph Lauren, Polo, GAP and Primark among scores of others.In 1984, Tirupur exported 104 lakh pieces of clothing, valued at ₹9.69 crore which has reached ₹22,715 crore till February 2021, data shows. Tiruppur accounts for 52% of India’s knitwear production and earns revenues of around ₹50,000 crore per annum just from textiles (both exports and domestic market).The lockdowns in European countries have also impacted demand as they account for the majority of Tirupur’s exports.The first lockdown in India also saw the departure of around 30% of the nearly 800,000 labourers to their hometowns and majority of whom are yet to return.“We have asked the government to construct permanent housing for migrant workers so that they also have a sense of belonging here. That could help us mitigate our labour crisis,” S Sakthivel of the Tiruppur Exporters Association (TEA) said.Compounding the crisis for the industry, there is uncertainty on the Remission of Duties and Taxes on Exported Products (RoDTEP) scheme since it is a new Financial Year. Under this scheme, duties on taxes levied at the central, state and local levels such as electricity and VAT on fuel will be refunded to exporters.Both the AIADMK and DMK have promised everything from monthly salaries to government jobs and all kinds of freebies but nothing for this industry, which is clearly struggling currently.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/elections-promise-no-relief-for-tiruppur-s-stressed-textile-industry-101617634575006.html
05-04-2021||India||Delhi records 3,548 new Covid-19 cases, over 3,000 containment zones created||Delhi on Monday recorded a slight dip in daily cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) after 3,548 fresh infections were added to its tally, according to health department bulletin. The new cases pushed the total cases to 679,962. The fatality count also rose to 11,096 after 15 new deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours, the bulletin showed.The slight dip in the daily cases, down from 4,033 seen on Sunday, was seen amid reduced testing on Monday as only 64,003 tests were conducted in the last 24 hours, as opposed to 86,899 conducted a day earlier.Out of the 64,003 tests conducted, 43,960 people were tested through RT-PCR tests and 20,043 were tested via rapid antigen testing method.The virality of infection and its spread has also surged in the last 24 hours, as indicated by the positivity rate which has crossed the 5% mark. On Sunday, the positivity rate in Delhi rose to 4.64% from 4.48% a day earlier but on Monday, it reached 5.54% - suggesting that more people are testing positive in the bracket of those being tested.After witnessing a constant surge in cases since March, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal confirmed that the city-state is witnessing the fourth wave of infections, even as the rest of the country is reeling from the second wave.“For the rest of the country, one may call it the second wave. But for Delhi, this is the fourth wave. We are heading towards the fourth peak. This wave is witnessing exponential increase in cases and spreading very fast. It is concerning but there is nothing to panic because this wave is also less severe in terms of number of deaths and cases that require hospitalisation, admission to ICU, etc,” Kejriwal said at a digital news briefing.Delhi reported its first wave in June, the second in September and the third in November, which has been the worst so far, with the highest case tally of 8,593.The rise in cases and deaths comes even as the authorities have ramped up testing and tracing the cases as a strategy to tackle the viral contagion.Recording a further increase, active cases in Delhi were logged at 14,589 on Monday, as opposed to 13,982 from Sunday.As the country finds itself in the grip of second wave, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is set to interact with chief ministers on Thursday to discuss the Covid-19 situation and the ongoing vaccination drive.Modi's last interaction with chief ministers was on March 17 during which he had expressed concern over the rise in cases in parts of the country and called for "quick and decisive" steps to check the "emerging second peak".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-records-3-548-new-covid-19-cases-over-3-000-containment-zones-created-101617632461346.html

We are living through some interesting times," he said."It is the right time for all of us, the military operators, the industry, the think-tanks and all the AI specialists for creating next-generation AI enablers for air war," the IAF chief said.He said it was time to plant a "robust tree" for development of AI in the country.At the same time, he mentioned that different nations with different threat perceptions would have different requirements and this would have evolved over a period of time and experience."We have already embarked on an AI journey and having gone through some of the important automation projects in the recent past, we have started testing AI and AI- based applications on some projects which are in different stages," he added.The air chief marshal elaborated that AI is being developed in multiple areas in the air domain to accrue diverse and asymmetrical operations benefits.Air Chief Marshal Bhadauria added that currently AI has not matured to an extent where completely autonomous missions can be executed."However, there is a need to address some questions to this effect- whether algorithms can be trained to effectively execute mission planning behaviours in unpredictable scenarios; can machines be taught combat strategies; can sufficiently generalised representations be built to capture the richness of the planning problem itself across the threat matrix," he said."The answer to these questions will help us firm up our requirement specifications that will essentially be a starting document vis-a-vis the expected outcomes. If we tend to utilise AI heavily in combat aviation, we may need to redefine or even abandon certain traditional principles," he added.The defence ministry has been focusing on application of AI in the three services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ai-can-bring-enormous-changes-in-way-we-train-and-fight-wars-iaf-chief-101617632946203.html

05-04-2021||India||PM Modi 'mum' on Indira Gandhi's role in creation of Bangladesh: Ashok Gehlot||Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot on Monday accused Prime Minister Narendra Modi of ignoring Indira Gandhi’s role in the creation of Bangladesh, saying he failed to mention her during his visit there to mark the 50th anniversary of its independence.Congress leader Shashi Tharoor had made a similar charge but apologised later, conceding on Twitter that Modi did refer to the former prime minister when he participated in the Golden Jubilee celebrations of Bangladesh’s independence.Indian forces defeated the Pakistan Army in 1971, taking thousands of its soldiers prisoners.Addressing railway workers, Gehlot claimed Modi skipped any reference to Indira Gandhi during the recent Bangladesh visit.“Indira Gandhi did not bow to threats from the US. But it is the misfortune of the country that the prime minister goes to Bangladesh and does not mention how Indira Gandhi contributed and 90,000 soldiers surrendered,” Gehlot said.The Congress leader said the respect Modi has got from foreign governments and Non Resident Indians during his visits abroad is not just for him.It is respect for the journey of 70 years of independent India, the CM added in his video conference address to North Western Railway employees.Now a US paper has written that democracy in India is shrinking, and the country’s system are being criticised, the CM said. He claimed that the nation is heading towards a “dangerous turn”.The BJP is committed to carrying out the agenda of the RSS, Gehlot said, referring also to “love jihad” – the right-wing allegation that Muslim youth are marrying Hindu women to convert them.Gehlot alleged that the judiciary, Election Commission of India, Income Tax Department and other agencies are working under pressure.On Railways, he said it was a priority sector for former prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru.He said the rail network has played an important role in keeping a country of different languages and religions united.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-mum-on-indira-gandhi-s-role-in-creation-of-bangladesh-ashok-gehlot-101617628241991.html

So tum bhi lagwaao so ache ho ja ho. Kuchhu dikkat nainuaan...(I took the vaccine so that I feel better. You also take it so that you feel better. No troubles at all)."According to her Aadhaar card 790309436468, Tulsabai was born on January 1, 1903 and is a resident of Sadarpur area of Sagar, which is part of the Bundelkhand region, news agency PTI reported.Frm April 1, the Centre expanded the nationwide vaccinatin drive to include everyone above thr age of 45. The Centre has warned that the situation is going from "bad to worse" and urged states to achieve 100 per cent vaccination coverage of those above the age of 45 years in surge districts within the next two weeks.India started its second phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive to inoculate people above 60 years and those over 45 with comorbidities against the coronavirus from March 1.The first phase of the world's largest inoculation drive was kicked off on January 16 with two vaccines - Covishield (Oxford-AstraZeneca's vaccine manufactured by Serum Institute of India) and Covaxin (manufactured by Bharat Biotech Limited).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/118yearold-madhya-pradesh-woman-vaccinated-against-covid-19-shows-no-side-effects-officials-101617626437851.html
05-04-2021||India||UK, California, Manaus: What they suggest about the Covid crisis in Maharashtra||In the middle of February, when India recorded its lowest Covid-19 numbers in a year, the state of Maharashtra began bucking the trend. The inflection point appears to be right in the middle of the month – on February 14. In the first 14 days, the state logged an average of roughly 2,500 cases a day. In the latter half, this number swelled more than twice to 5,300.And the rate doubled again over the next fortnight – the first two weeks in March.For the rest of India, the inflection point would not arrive till March 3. By this time, Maharashtra’s trajectory had begun ringing alarm bells.Also Read | Covid-19: India second country after US to record over 1 lakh daily casesImperfect sampling for serological surveys and whole-genome testing has meant that the government has not been able to determine whether this trend is due to a factor beyond simply people being careless, although it has found an increasing number of samples showing two particular mutations: E484Q and L452R.The deviation in Maharashtra’s trajectory (and to some extend Punjab’s) resembles examples from three other regions where mutations have in fact been implicated: United Kingdom (UK)’s London and south-east, Brazil’s Manaus and California in the United States (US). All three are believed to be the ground zero for variants that make the coronavirus spread more readily or cheat immunity from a previous infection (or both).Parallel 1: London and SE England, the UKAll things being equal (in terms of restrictions), Maharashtra’s case trajectory against the backdrop of the rest of the country has a particularly similarity with what happened in the UK at the outset of last winter.Within a fortnight, beginning November 29, London and parts of UK’s south-east turned into new hotbeds of coronavirus infections. This was particularly stark since the country was in the middle of a lockdown (UK’s lockdowns have typically been less stringent than what Indians are used to) to avoid an expected surge during the Christmas holiday season.This surge would eventually be attributed to the variant known as B.1.1.7, or VOC 202012/01 – the first coronavirus variant under investigation. The variant has since been correlated with the virus becoming more infective and slightly more lethal.Parallel 2: California, USA little over halfway into January, the state of California overtook the New York state to become the hardest hit region in terms of fatalities in the US. What would be its fourth wave, infections in California began surging in the run-up to Christmas for a peak that would last roughly three weeks beginning late December.To be sure, California is US’s most populous state, but the December-January wave is unique for its magnitude — at one point it was detecting over four times as many cases in a day in December as its second wave in July.The holiday season has been seen as a clear link. But increasingly, scientists are also suspected a new variant to be causing it. Over five months beginning September, this variant rose to account for more than 50% of all samples subjected to genetic analysis, the LA Times reported.This variant is known as B.1.427 and B.1.429 and scientists believe that it may be drawing its more worrying nature from the particular mutation that has also been detected in Maharashtra: L452R.At least two studies, here and here, find that the L452R mutation in particular was more resistant to antibodies drawn from people who had a previous infection with the globally predominant variant or from those that had taken vaccine doses. Both the studies were lab tests, and how this increased resistance translates needs to be verified.Parallel 3: Manaus, BrazilThe region of Manaus in Brazil has been mysterious for scientists since the end of last year. For roughly seven months from May to November, the city with one of the highest population densities in Brazil reported very few Covid-19 cases, despite considerable relaxation of restrictions.Researchers estimated that roughly three quarters of the population may have been infected, surpassing the theoretical herd immunity threshold. This partly supported the May-November lull in cases — until the outbreak exploded again.Researchers now believe there are four possible explanations for the lull and the resurgence — one, that the initial three-fourths attack rate was exaggerated and the population was never this protected; two, the seven-month period is when immunity from the first infection waned to cause re-infections; three, the new outbreak is triggered by a variant that is resistant to antibodies from previous immunity; and lastly, that a new variant that is more transmissible has taken hold.The strongest suspicion now falls on the variant known as P.1, which has a constellation of mutations including the N501Y from UK’s B.1.1.7 variant and a mutation at the location 484 (known as E484K). N501Y has been linked to the UK variant becoming more infective while E484K has shown to be more resistant to antibodies generated in response to the older virus.The link with Maharashtra Similar trends have also been seen in South Africa, where the variant B.1.351 too has E484K mutation. But the examples of UK, US and Brazil have significant overlaps with what has been observed in Maharashtra and what little is known about the virus there.The London-South-East England and California examples shows a sudden, relentless outbreak can be due to a fitter mutation – the latter case shares a particular mutation that has been found in Maharashtra.The Manaus example too reinforces the risk from mutations, but it also points to the fact that herd immunity may not translate to any sort of protection in a region such as Maharashtra, which has consistently had high levels of outbreak since the pandemic began in India.In all three cases, the outbreaks have spread out – driving new surges as the variants travel beyond states and borders.The lack of data from genomic surveillance means India is unlikely to determine whether Maharashtra’s worsening situation is due to something similar, and the longer that question remains unanswered, the more difficult it becomes to take proactive decisions on measures to tackle it — for Maharashtra itself as well as the rest of the country.India set up a consortium of labs called INSACOG and targeted genome sequencing of at least 5% of all positive. But since January, a little under 11,000 had been done — this number is short of the at least 48,000 it should have been, based on the 966,376 cases recorded in the country between January 1 and March 23.Experts have called on the government to increase the whole genome sequencing volumes. What could also help is if the government releases the timeline of the genomes sequenced till now, which determine how proportion of mutation samples change in a region — helping establish at least one proxy for epidemiological estimation.Determining the threat from variants is key not only to head off the current outbreak, but also to tweak India’s vaccination strategy — including the question whether the government now needs to look at approaching other developers with more immunogenic products.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-california-manaus-what-they-suggest-about-the-covid-crisis-in-maharashtra-101617628516252.html
05-04-2021||India||‘Govt caused her civil death’: AMMK candidate on Sasikala’s name deletion from voters’ list||Expelled AIADMK leader VK Sasikala’s name has been removed from the voter’s list from the Thousand Lights constituency in Chennai and she won’t be able to vote on April 6, claimed Sasikala’s team members on Monday, a day before the state goes to polls.Sasikala’s nephew TTV Dhinakaran’s party Amma Makkal Munnetra Kazhagam (AMMK) said it was a conspiracy by the government. “They have caused a civil death of VK Sasikala,” AMMK’s Thousand Lights candidate N Vaidhyanathan said.“The government has the power to delete the names of people only if they have died or if they apply for a change of address. The state and central government have deliberately done this. We also found that around 19,000 voters’ names, who are AMMK supporters, are missing,” he said. Sasikala’s counsel Raja Senthoor Panidan, who approached the election commission for her name to be included from the new address on March 17, said he came to know about her name deletion on March 16.“The very next day I met with chief election officer Satyabrata Sahoo but he said his powers to make any changes in the electoral rolls was only till March 9,” he added. According to Sasikala’s team members, besides her, names of other family members, including her sister-in-law J Ilavarasi, and workers who were living at late J Jayalalithaa’s Poes Garden residence, Veda Nilayam, have also been deleted after the AIADMK government acquired the residence for it to be converted into a memorial.A total of 19 people who were living in the house, including cook Rajammal who lived there for three decades, are missing from the electoral rolls, Sasikala’s team stated. The case to transform the residence is pending with the Madras High Court as Jayalalithaa’s niece and nephew have claimed the property as her legal heirs.The Chennai election office said that Sasikala’s name was deleted in 2019 itself before the Lok Sabha elections. “Only now it is being made into an issue,” said Thousand Lights’s assistant electoral rolls officer, Ravi Kumar.“We sent a notice to the concerned party asking if they are residing there and gave ample time but since we didn’t get any response, we had to delete the names as per the protocol. I have an election to conduct tomorrow and have given my detailed response to the election commission. They will give a reply to the media,” Kumar added.Sasikala and Ilavarasi were lodged in prison since February 2017 in Bengaluru in the disproportionate assets case and returned to Chennai in February this year after serving a four-year prison term. The two currently live in T Nagar in Chennai which also falls under the Thousand Lights constituency.“Just because the government took over the property, how can they delete the names without issuing any notice to us? As her advocate, we will seek action against the officer who deleted her name without a valid reason because of which she has lost her franchise,” Panidan said.According to the Representation of People’s Act, a person who is residing in a particular area can register for enrollment in electoral rolls by applying with booth level electoral officer with relevant proof of residence documents. While enrollment is a continuous process throughout the year, for election-bound states, the Election Commission has a cut-off date.“This cut-off date is to enable a level-playing field and to prevent last-minute addition to the electoral rolls. Also, most of the personnel engaged in updating electoral rolls are also deployed on election-related duty and therefore, the cut-off date is given. In exceptional cases, where the name of the person has been wrongly removed, the name can be added even after the cut-off date,” a senior election commission official said. He added that Sasikala was not residing at the Chennai address for several years and therefore, the election officers had the right to delete her name. The name could have been added had she applied on time, he added.Meanwhile, the AMMK candidate has written to the ECI for the election in the Thousand Lights constituency to be postponed until Sasikala’s name is included. In his letter, Sasikala is still addressed as the AIADMK’s general secretary. The AIADMK has abated the general secretary post and expelled Sasikala and Dhinakaran in September 2017.While Sasikala was still in jail, Dhinakaran floated the AMMK with a breakaway faction of her supporters. After her release, Sasikala made moves to reclaim the AIADMK but the party, under chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami, decided against taking her back and she decided to ‘step away’ from politics.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-caused-her-civil-death-ammk-candidate-on-sasikala-s-name-deletion-from-voters-list-101617627914699.html

Ram Kumar, an employee of a private oil drilling company was released at a remote location on the Indo-Myanmar border in Nagaland. His colleague, Pranab Kumar Gogoi from Assam, who was also abducted at the same time, was released on Saturday in Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh. “Ram Kumar has been released in a village on the Indian side in Nagaland close to the Indo-Myanmar border. Nagaland Police handed him over to Assam Police,” Shwetank Mishra, superintendent of police, Charaideo district, Assam, said. He added that Kumar, who spent 105 days in custody of ULFA-I, appeared to be healthy. “I would like to thank Paresh Baruah (commander-in-chief of ULFA-I). He had called me over phone during the period in custody and assured me that I would be released as he doesn’t have any personal enmity with me,” Kumar told journalists after his release. Also Read | In Assam, the election is all about the arithmeticGogoi, a drilling superintendent, and Ram Kumar, a radio operator, employed with Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Limited, a Delhi-based company, were abducted on December 21 from a drilling location in Changlang district. Following his release, Gogoi had said that both of them were kept together till March 4 after which they were separated by the banned outfit. On January 12, Paresh Baruah had admitted to abducting the two employees and told TV channels in Assam that Kumar, who hails from Bihar, would become a “victim” if the oil drilling company didn’t pay the outfit it’s “due share” for extracting natural resources from Assam and rest of northeast region. Baruah had said that Gogoi, who is an Assamese, won’t be harmed. Later, ULFA-I set a deadline till February 16 to complete talks and secure the release of the two abducted employees. It also said that chief ministers of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh would be held responsible if the two employees died in an “undesired incident”. In February this year, the outfit threatened to take ”final action” against Gogoi and Kumar in a phased manner since the deadline for talks as well as discussions with the company had failed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-man-abducted-by-ulfa-i-from-arunachal-released-after-105-days-101617627614782.html

As the vaccination drive continuously upscales in India and guided by the learnings of India's successful management of pandemic during its first wave, India is now well armed to combat any downside risk posed by the recent surge in COVID-19 cases,"the report said.With the end of a challenging 2020-21, the crest of a brighter and self-reliant 2021-22 awaits India, the Finance Ministry report said. The fiscal position of the Centre has witnessed improvement in the recent months due to a revival in the economic activities, it said. "During April 2020 to February 2021, the Centre's fiscal deficit stood at ₹14.05 lakh crore, which is 76 per cent of Revised Estimate 2020-21. Net Tax Revenue of the Central Government for 2020-21 is set to overshoot the RE despite 41 per cent higher income tax refunds this year," it said. To share the revenue buoyancy seen in Q4 2020-21 and in the true spirit of fiscal federalism, an amount of ₹45,000 crore has been released as additional devolution to states in 2020-21, an increase of 8.2 per cent over RE, it said. The Centre raised ₹13.7 lakh crore as gross market borrowings during 2020-21 at a weighted average borrowing cost of 5.79 per cent - the lowest in 17 years, it said. The government's capital expenditure sharply turned around to grow at 104.4 per cent during October 2020 to February 2021 (YoY), recovering from a decline of 11.6 per cent in the first half of 2020-21 (YoY), it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-well-prepared-to-combat-second-wave-of-covid-19-finance-ministry-report-101617626644159.html

The top court constituted a committee headed by retired SC judge DK Jain and sought a report on proposed action to be taken against the delinquent official of state police and IB. This committee submitted its report to the SC in a sealed cover recently.

Mehta said the case involves a serious issue as the 79-year old scientist, who is a former Padma Bhushan awardee, was humiliated and tortured in a false case over alleged leak of secret classified information to enemy countries. The CBI, which probed the case, found the allegation false and a trial court acquitted Narayanan of serious charge under Official Secrets Act in 1998.The SC bench said, “We understand the importance of the case but there is no urgency.” The court directed the matter to be listed next week. The urgent mentioning by Centre has evoked some anxiety as Kerala goes to polls on Tuesday. The case against Narayanan was filed by the Congress government in the early 1990s. In its probe, the CBI found that a false case was concocted by the state police and named three officials of Kerala Police -- former DGP Siby Mathews, and retired superintendents of police KK Joshua and S Vijayan. In addition, the court also found fault with then IB deputy director RB Shreekumar. After his acquittal, Narayanan had approached Kerala high court for compensation. The same was denied following which he approached the apex court. The Justice Jain Committee also comprised a representative each of Centre and Kerala government.

This took the number of total cases in the country to 12,589,067.At the last meeting on Sunday, the Prime Minister decided to send officials to Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh - three states which continue to report a surge in the number of daily cases - to address the issues related to the recent spike in infections. PM Modi also instructed officials present in the meeting to ensure strict implementation of the five-fold strategy of - testing, tracing, treatment, and following Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination.Union health minister Harsh Vardhan is also scheduled to meet health ministers of 11 states and union territories on Tuesday to discuss the current spike in the number of daily cases and vaccination-related issues, news agency ANI reported earlier in the day citing people familiar with the developments.India's daily caseload which recorded a gradual decline after September 17 last year witnessed a surge over the past week with over 1 lakh fresh Covid-19 cases being reported on Monday. Maharashtra has reported a continual rise in the number of daily cases and remains one of the main contributors to the daily spike reported across the nation.

They are demanding a repeal of the three laws along with a legal guarantee for Minimum Support Price (MSP) for their produce.The protesting farmers took out a tractor rally in Delhi on January 26."Farmers will conduct an agitation in Gujarat using their tractors. Time has come to gherao Gandhinagar and block roads. If needed, we will have to break barricades too," Tikait said.The BKU leader is on a two-day tour of Gujarat since Sunday to campaign against the Centre's three farm laws.On the second day of his visit, Tikait, accompanied by former Gujarat chief minister Shankersinh Vaghela, paid tributes to Mahatma Gandhi at the Sabarmati Ashram."Farmers are suffering because there is no agitation here. There is no backing from courts also. Farmers are compelled to say they are happy and making profit. Please give us that technology which is helping Gujarat's farmers to reap benefits," said Tikait.He claimed farmers of Banaskantha are compelled to sell potatoes for ₹3 per kilogram."Is that enough to make farmers happy? We have come here to remove fear from the minds of farmers. We will agitate in a peaceful manner," Tikait said, when asked about his future plans for Gujarat.Later, Tikait and Vaghela reached Karamsad town in Anand district and paid tributes to Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel at his native place.Tikait then headed to Bardoli in Surat, where he would address farmers in the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bku-leader-rakesh-tikait-threatens-tractor-agitation-in-gujarat-after-delhi-101617622221251.html
05-04-2021||India||Kejriwal urges PM Modi to expand coverage of Covid-19 vaccination drive||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi seeking speedy vaccination and its increased coverage for citizens in the national capital and the country.In his letter, Kejriwal requested PM Modi to relax conditions for opening new vaccination centres as well as relaxation in the age limit for vaccination and making it available for all.The request for a widespread vaccination plan by Kejriwal for citizens comes on a day when India marked a grim milestone by recording its highest ever single-day spike in the number of Covid-19 cases.India on Monday shattered its previous daily infection rate and recorded 1,03,558 new infections pushing the nationwide Covid-19 tally to 1,25,89,067, according to the Union health ministry data.The single-day rise in cases surpassed the earlier peak of 97,894 infections reported on September 17 last year. The fatalities due to the viral contagion also spiked sharply after 478 new deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours."The increase in the rate of transition of Corona across the country has presented new concerns and challenges. The vaccination campaign needs to move more rapidly in this context," Kejriwal wrote in the letter.If rules for opening new centres are simplified and everyone is allowed to be vaccinated irrespective of age, then the Delhi government can vaccinate all Delhi residents within three months, the Delhi CM reasoned."The rapid spread of infection between immunization campaigns in this way suggests that we must move the vaccination campaign forward in a more swift manner," the letter to the prime minister read.Suggesting a two-pronged approach, Kejriwal said, "First, there is an urgent need to increase the number of vaccination centers. For this, the pre-conditions placed by the Centre regarding vaccination centers need to be relaxed.""Second, it should be made available to everyone by removing the age limit to immunization. Except for those who cannot get vaccinated medically, we should start vaccinating everyone. This will remove the hesitation among people and increase the number of people getting vaccinated. The more people get vaccinated, the more we will be able to reduce the spread of the disease," he added.Kejriwal has told PM Modi that the vaccination drive has to be organised as a "war-level effort" in the fight."I hope the support that the Centre had extended to Delhi would continue and you would respond positively to my request," the CM said.The Covid-19 cases in India have surged at a rate higher than that witnessed last year. It took 76 days for the single-day numbers to reach the then peak of 97,894 (in September 2020) from 20,000. However, this time the daily rise in cases have galloped at a much faster pace taking just 25 days (March 10 to April 4) to cross the grim milestone of one-lakh infections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kejriwal-urges-pm-modi-to-expand-coverage-of-covid-19-vaccination-drive-101617621696600.html

India reported 103,558 fresh infections on Monday, the highest since the beginning of the pandemic, taking the nationwide tally to 12,589,067.Two days ago, Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a review meeting with officials where he discussed measures to reduce the number of cases in badly-hit states like Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh. PM Modi also asked officials to implement the strategy of testing, tracing, treatment, and following Covid-appropriate behaviour and vaccination with seriousness in order to curb the spread of the pandemic.At PM's review meeting, it was pointed out that severe complacency in following Covid-19 preventative measures such as using masks and social distancing coupled with pandemic fatigue and lack of proper implementation of containment measures could have led to this major spike in the number of cases. It was also highlighted that 10 states are contributing more than 90% cases and related fatalities.India’s daily caseload dropped after September 17 last year and the gradual decline continued for five months before the current surge, which experts have described as the ‘second wave’. Maharashtra has contributed to the spike with 57,074 fresh infections along with Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Punjab, all of which reported highest-surge in daily Covid-19 infections. The Maharashtra government on Sunday announced weekend lockdown in the entire state and ordered closure of private offices, asking employees of such firms to work from home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-surge-harsh-vardhan-to-meet-health-ministers-of-11-states-uts-101617621002191.html

The lackadaisical attitude of the state police to arrest anyone and put him in police custody has made the appellant to suffer the ignominy,” the apex court had said in its September 2018 order."The dignity of a person gets shocked when psycho-pathological treatment is meted out to him. A human being cries for justice when he feels that the insensible act has crucified his self-respect," the top court had said.It had accepted Narayanan's plea that the authorities, who were responsible for causing such a "harrowing effect" on his mind, should face "legal consequences".The CBI, while giving clean chit to the scientist, had said that Siby Mathews had left "the entire investigation to IB surrendering his duties" and ordered indiscriminate arrest of the scientist and others without adequate evidence being on record.The case had caught attention in October 1994, when Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan.Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with the then ISRO Deputy Director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-seeks-urgent-hearing-in-isro-espionage-case-sc-to-hear-matter-next-week-101617618395094.html

The party said that instead of sending “64.5 million” doses of Covid-19 vaccines all over the world, the government could have accelerated the nationwide vaccination drive.“The government has exported 64.5 million doses of the vaccine to 84 countries, they haven’t vaccinated these many people in their own country yet,” AAP spokesperson Raghav Chadha while addressing a press conference in the national capital."Where has the Centre's vaccine nationalism gone? The AAP demands an increase in the rate of vaccinations against Covid-19 so that each and every Indian can get vaccinated," Chadha told reporters.“The rate at which we are vaccinating our citizens, it will take 15 years to vaccinate the entire population,” said Chadha.“The ministry of external affairs said a few days ago that India is competing with China in terms of exporting vaccines. Proudly stating that India is ahead of China in terms of vaccine diplomacy. A country which has a total of 90,000 Covid-19 cases is being compared to a country where 90,000 cases are recorded everyday,” Chadha told reporters at the press conference.Chadha read out the names of the countries where vaccines have been exported, jocularly adding that vaccines have been exported to countries whose names he's hearing for the first time.The AAP leader's comments came days after Delhi chief minister and party president Arvind Kejriwal urged the centre to open up vaccination for everyone. The Centre recently allowed all those above the age of 45 to take Covid-19 vaccine. This expanded the scope of the second phase of the drive in which people above the age of 60 and 45+ with comorbidities were being inoculated. From May 1, the drive will open for everyone between the age of 35 and 45.Many experts have been sounding alarm bells over the deteriorating situation in the country in the wake of the rising number of Covid-19 cases. They have urged the Centre to inoculate more people.India has so far administered 7,91,05,163 of the Covid-19 vaccines in 12,31,148 sessions, according to the ministry of health and family welfare’s dashboard. These numbers remain significantly behind the government’s inoculation targets - the Centre has set a target of vaccinating over 300 million people by the end of July.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-exported-64-5-million-covid-19-vaccines-haven-t-inoculated-these-many-here-aap-101617621217334.html

Two Indian warships and a long-range maritime patrol aircraft are taking part in the French Navy-led exercise called La Pérouse for the first time. India, the US, Japan and Australia constitute the Quadrilateral security or Quad. China has been wary of the Quad that was revived in late 2017. And Beijing’s suspicions have increased since the four countries upgraded the forum to the ministerial level in 2019. Indian warships INS Satpura with an embarked helicopter and INS Kiltan, and a Boeing P-8I submarine hunter aircraft are taking part in the three-day exercise being held from April 5 to April 7. The exercise will showcase high levels of synergy, coordination and inter-operability between the friendly navies, an Indian Navy spokesperson said on Monday. “Participation by the Indian Navy in the exercise demonstrates the shared values with friendly navies ensuring freedom of seas and commitment to an open, inclusive Indo-Pacific and a rules-based international order,” Commander Vivek Madhwal said. Also Read | Amid rising Covid cases, Raisina Dialogue to go fully digitalFrance is being represented at the multi-lateral exercise by amphibious assault ship Tonnerre and frigate Surcouf, the US Navy has sent its amphibious transport dock USS Somerset for the drills, Australia has deployed its frigate HMAS Anzac and tanker Sirius, and Japan has sent Akebono, a destroyer, for the drills. “Exercise La Pérouse will witness complex and advanced naval operations including surface warfare, anti-air warfare and air defence exercises, weapon-firing exercises, cross-deck flying operations, tactical manoeuvres and seamanship evolutions such as replenishment at sea,” he said. Last November, navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh said a “great power competition” was playing out vigorously in IOR, where the navy has stepped up surveillance to check China’s ambitions. “IOR is one of the most militarised regions… Also, there are differing interpretations of international laws and there is this fear that ‘Global Commons’ can change to ‘Contested Seas’, threatening free flow of commerce and trade,” the navy chief then said. From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in IOR, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/quad-navies-join-france-led-drills-in-indian-ocean-101617621554810.html

BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that Thackeray has lost the moral right to govern."I find it interesting that Anil Deshmukh has taken moral responsibility. How about responsibility of CM? Uddhav Thackeray has forfeited the moral responsibility to govern," Prasad said.In the resignation letter he posted on Twitter, Anil Deshmukh said that he doesn't find it morally correct to continue as the home minister after the order of Bombay high court, which gave a go-ahead to Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary investigation against the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leader.The allegations were made by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who said in a letter to Thackeray that Deshmukh asked suspended cop Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore per month from hotels and bars in the city. Singh sent the letter to Thackeray after being transferred to Home Guards, a "low-key" post. He was shunted out after mishandling of the Mukesh Ambani bomb scare case.Vaze was arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) in the same case and is also being probed in connection with the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran whose car was found with gelatin sticks near Ambani's residence Antilia in Mumbai.On Monday, Prasad questioned the silence of Maharastra chief minister on the entire issue."When will CM Udhhav Thackeray speak? The consistent, conspicuous silence of Uddhav Thackeray is itself raising a lot of questions. NIA is finding out new details of Sachin Vaze everyday, new details of how many cars he has," said the Union minister."The BJP expects that all the ramifications of this issue ought to be investigated fairly and those who are responsible must be brought to book," he added.Maharashtra BJP leader Devendra Fadnavis too has attacked Thackeray, asking him to sack Deshmukh if he doesn't resign. The Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), which is part of the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) alliance, has been defending Deshmukh but was under pressure, especially after the high court order on Monday.A meeting of NCP leaders took place at party chief Sharad Pawar's residence, and it was expected that he will ask Deshmukh to resign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thackeray-has-lost-moral-responsibility-to-govern-bjp-after-deshmukh-resigns-101617619343011.html

Our Jawans are not cannon fodder to be martyred at will,” Gandhi tweeted.If there was no intelligence failure then a 1:1 death ratio means it was a poorly designed and incompetently executed operation.Our Jawans are not cannon fodder to be martyred at will. pic.twitter.com/JDgVc03QvDThe Congress leader also cited a media report quoting Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) director general Kuldiep Singh as saying there was no intelligence failure in the operation and an equal number of Maoists were killed in Chhattisgarh, which is ruled by his party. "There is no point in saying that there was some kind of intelligence or operational failure. Had it been some intelligence failure, forces would have not gone for the operation. And if there was some operational failure, so many Naxals would have not been killed," Singh, who visited Chhattisgarh following the attack, told news agency ANI on Sunday.Out of the 22 security personnel killed after Saturday’s ambush in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region, CRPF lost eight men, including seven commandos of its elite CoBRA, one jawan was from the Bastariya battalion, eight from the District Reserve Guard (DRG) and five from the Special Task Force. In addition to the fatalities, 30 others were also wounded in a four-hour gun battle with the Maoists. The attack, which took place near the Bijapur-Sukma border, came during a combing operation for wanted Maoist commander Madvi Hidma.Gandhi also said all Indian soldiers should get body armours. “No Indian jawan should face an enemy without body armour in the 21st century. It needs to be made available to every soldier,” tweeted Gandhi.Meanwhile, Union home minister Amit Shah said the government is determined to end the Maoist menace during his visit to Chhattisgarh. Shah also chaired a meeting attended by chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, senior officials of the state police and CRPF, to review the security situation. “I want to assure the country that this fight will not be stopped, rather it will continue with more intensity till the end. In this fight, our victory is definite in the end,” Shah said.The former Congress president took to Twitter to condole the deaths of the personnel on Sunday, calling for decisive action on locating and rescuing the missing jawans, and requesting the state government to ensure a speedy recovery for the injured.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jawans-are-not-cannon-fodder-rahul-gandhi-days-after-chhattisgarh-maoist-attack-101617618822007.html
05-04-2021||India||Over 79 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in India: Health ministry||India has so far administered 79 million doses of the vaccines against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), as the country is grappling with the second wave of the pandemic, the Union ministry of health and family welfare said on Monday. The numbers have gone up days after the government expanded its vaccination drive and allowed the inoculation of those above 45 years of age. India has recorded 12.5 million Covid-19 cases and 165,101 people have succumbed to the viral disease to date.The health ministry said in a release 7,91,05,163 vaccine doses have been administered through 12,31,148 sessions, as per the provisional report till 7am. These include 90,09,353 healthcare workers, who were administered their first dose of the vaccine and 53,43,493 who were administered their second dose. It also said that 97,37,850 frontline workers administered the first dose and 41,33,961 of them were administered the second dose along with 4,99,31,635 of first doses and 9,48,871 of the second to those over 45 years of age.As of day 79 of the vaccination drive till April 4, 16,38,464 vaccine doses were given. Out of which, 15,40,676 people were vaccinated across 21,508 sessions for the first dose and 97,788 received the second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine.The ministry said that eight states account for 60% of the cumulative vaccine doses given so far. Maharashtra, which is India’s worst-affected state, alone accounts for 9.72% of the total doses given in the country, it added.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on April 3 directed all states and Union territories to immediately stop new registrations for Covid shots in the categories of healthcare and frontline workers. Bhushan said that ineligible beneficiaries are getting the Covid-19 vaccine. “Various inputs have been received from different sources that in some of the CVCs (Covid Vaccination Centres) some ineligible beneficiaries are being registered as healthcare workers and frontline workers and are getting vaccinated in complete violation of the prescribed guidelines,” he said in a letter.The vaccination drive that started on January 16 was meant to first immunise 300 million people who belong to three categories-- healthcare workers, frontline workers and those at greater risk from coronavirus disease due to their age or existing medical conditions. The first to receive the shots were 10 million healthcare workers and the drive was opened up to 20 million front line workers from February 1 onwards. On March 1, the government allowed people above the age of 60 and those between the ages of 45 and 59 years with a combination of 20 specified comorbidities to take the jabs. On April 1, the government relaxed it further to allow anyone above the age of 45 to take the dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-79-million-covid-19-vaccine-doses-administered-in-india-health-ministry-101617605223335.html

He also chaired a meeting that was attended by chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, and senior officials of the state police, and the Central Reserve Police Force, to review the security situation arising out of the Maoist attack. In Jagdalpur, Shah paid his last respects at the Police Lines, where the mortal remains of 14 personnel were kept in coffins draped with the national flag.Besides Shah, Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel and other dignitaries were also present for the wreath-laying ceremony. Later, tweeting about it in Hindi, he said, “Paid tributes to the brave security personnel who were martyred while fighting the naxalites at Jagdalpur in Chhattisgarh.” “The country will never forget your bravery and sacrifice. The whole country stands behind the bereaved families. We are determined to take the ongoing fight against the unrest created by the Naxals to its logical conclusion,” he said.After the review meeting at the Police Coordination Centre in Jagdalpur, Shah said that the fight against Maoists will be intensified to end the menace. “I want to assure the country that this fight will not be stopped, rather it will continue with more intensity till the end. In this fight, our victory is definite in the end,” Shah said.Also Read | Maoist attack: How Sikh jawan took off turban to help wounded colleagueSpeaking to journalists after the review meeting, Baghel said the fight against Maoists will continue. “In the last few years, we have managed to establish camps in their core area and more camps will be opened soon. The development works will also be accelerated in the area,” he said. After paying tribute to the security forces personnel in Jagdalpur, the CM said, “I salute their sacrifice and express my condolences to their families. Our forces have fought bravely with courage causing huge damage to the Maoists.” He said that Maoists are rattled because the forces are going to establish a new camp in Tarrem area. “Central and state governments are working together to accelerate the development works in the area. Efforts are being made to provide connectivity with construction of roads and to extend the benefits of the schemes to the interior areas. Meaningful discussions have taken place in the meeting with the home minister and we are hopeful that the Centre will take appropriate steps to fulfil our demands,” said Baghel. During his visit, Shah is also slated to meet some of the injured security personnel in hospital. At least two dozen others were injured in Saturday’s attack.The gunfight also resulted in the death of a suspected Maoist, the police said. Intel inputs suggest that the extremists used grenade launchers in the ambush, according to home ministry and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officials. Surveillance inputs captured by a Heron drone indicated that two tractor-trolleys were used to ferry the dead extremists back into deep forests.Chhattisgarh’s worst Maoist attack in four years also triggered a political slugfest. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi alleged that the anti-Maoist operation was “incompetently” executed and “poorly designed” even as his party’s chief minister Bhupesh Baghel was already under Opposition fire for being away, campaigning in Assam. “Our jawans are not cannon fodder to be martyred at will,” Gandhi tweeted.Citing a media report quoting CRPF Director General Kuldeep Singh as saying there was no intelligence failure in the operation and an equal number of ultras were killed, Gandhi said, “If there was no intelligence failure then a 1:1 death ratio means it was a poorly designed and incompetently executed operation.” The security personnel were ambushed on a combing operation in a forest along the border of the Bijapur and Sukma districts of the state.Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh hit out at Baghel on Sunday, saying, “He is holding rallies there (in Assam), taking out marches ...dancing there ...after such a big incident ...elections have become the chief minister’s first priority...”.While Baghel returned to Chhattisgarh on Sunday evening, his party accused the BJP of politicising the martyrdom of the personnel.“Raman Singh should first answer what Amit Shah was doing? Was he campaigning in Assam or not? There is no need to politicise Maoist violence. We all know that Maoists are a national problem and both the state and Central governments are working on it,” said Congress spokesperson Shailesh Nitin Trivedi.The BJP also demanded fixing of responsibility for the operation that went wrong even as the CRPF ruled out intelligence or operational failure. Leader of the Opposition in the state assembly, Dharamlal Kaushik, said responsibility must be fixed for the operation which went wrong despite the “input of presence of a large number of Maoists”.In the wake of the Maoist ambush, police in neighbouring Telangana has sounded an alert and intensified combing operations and beefed up security in the bordering areas of the state.The Telangana Police have mounted vigil particularly in Bhadradri Kothagudem and Mulugu districts, a senior police official told news agency PTI. “We are alert and regular combing operations are going on. In view of the [Chhattisgarh Maoist attack], combing has been intensified and security has been beefed up in areas (near the Telangana-Chhattisgarh border),” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-will-end-maoist-menace-says-amit-shah-on-chhattisgarh-visit-101617616994252.html

Their leaders say they are fighting on behalf of the poorest, who have not benefited from the economic boom in Asia's third-largest economy.Shah told reporters the government will "not tolerate such bloodshed and a befitting response will be given to put an end to the ongoing battle with Maoists".Security experts said the latest attack by Maoist rebels, considered India's biggest internal security threat, has forced Prime Minister Narendra Modi's right-wing government to re-evaluate counter-insurgency operations against the ultra left-wing fighters, who have been able to increase new followers during the pandemic."In the last few years the Maoists have had opportunity to regroup themselves in their core region of dominance," said Uddipan Mukherjee, a joint director for government agency, the Ordnance Factory Board. He has been researching the Maoist strategy for more than a decade.Mukherjee and others with expert knowledge said the pandemic had allowed the insurgency to recruit more to its cause."We have intelligence reports that the Maoist leaders during the pandemic have managed to recruit hundreds of new foot soldiers, including women, living in the forests who leak details about security force patrols," a New Delhi-based bureaucrat who oversees country's internal security said."The pandemic has made the intra-state movement of Maoist leaders much easier," the senior official said on condition of anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media.Chhattisgarh, one of the fastest-developing states in India, has 28 varieties of major minerals, including diamonds and gold, a government website said.

A three-judge bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde stayed the January 5,2021 order passed by Karnataka high court restoring the criminal case against Yediyurappa and two others. Earlier, the SC had stayed their arrest while taking up Yediyurappa’s appeal against the high court order. On Monday, senior advocate KV Vishwanathan, appearing for the Karnataka CM, said that despite stay of arrest, the trial was proceeding against him and that needs to be stayed. Also Read | ISRO espionage case: SC-appointed probe panel submits reportThe bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramsubramanian, agreed to grant stay as it is examining the legal questions raised in Yediyurappa’s appeal. The allegation was made against Yeddyurappa by public spirited persons led by A Alam Pasha, alleging that during his tenure as CM between 2008-11, he denotified 26 acres land acquired by the government for construction of houses for low income and middle income families. This project was part of an upcoming IT park project at Devanahalli Industrial Park in Bengaluru Rural district. A Bengaluru court had ordered investigation by State Lokayukta in May 2012 on Pasha’s complaint. In June 2013, Yediyurappa, along with former industries minister Murugesh Nirani and two others, was framed for alleged forgery and provisions under Prevention of Corruption Act. He took the matter to Karnataka high court which set aside the criminal case against the accused in October 2013 citing lack of sanction to prosecute Yediyurappa. This led to dismissal of case by the trial judge on August 26, 2016.Pasha later challenged this order, resulting in the order of January 5 this year. The high court held in its order that since Yediyurappa had demitted office in 2011, taking sanction was not necessary. Yediyurappa had challenged this finding of the high court, claiming fresh sanction will be necessary to proceed further.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-trial-proceedings-against-k-taka-cmyediyurappa-101617613093883.html
05-04-2021||India||After French report on Rafale payment, Congress demands independent inquiry||The Congress on Monday demanded an independent inquiry and posed five questions to the Narendra Modi government after a French journal alleged the Rafale deal involved payment of 1.1 million euros to an Indian middleman, and asked if the latest revelation has vitiated India’s biggest defence deal. Referring to the first of a three-part series by Mediapart, Congress chief spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said, “Was the payment of €1.1 million shown by Dassault as ‘gifts to clients’ in reality a commission paid to middleman for the Rafale Deal? How can ‘middleman’ and ‘payment of commission’ be permitted in a ‘government to government defence contract’ or in any defence procurement in India in violation of the mandatory defence procurement procedure?” Arguing that the latest media report vitiated the Rafale deal, Surjewala said the revelation entailed imposition of heavy financial penalties on Dassault, banning of the company, registration of an FIR and other penal consequences.Also Read | 3 more Rafales land in India; IAF thanks UAE for mid-air refueling“Does it now not require a full and independent investigation into India’s biggest defence deal to find out as to how much bribery and commission in reality, if any, was paid and to whom in the Indian government?” the Congress said, asking if Prime Minister Narendra Modi would answer to the nation on this. According to the French report, the country’s anti-corruption agency AFA found the payment was made in October 2018 and questioned Dassault, the manufacturer of Rafale fighter jets. The report said that the jet-makers have not been able to answer the queries. The Congress demanded that the standard procedure—lodging an FIR, independent investigation and related moves—must follow and reminded the government that during the UPA rule, then defence minister AK Antony had followed the stipulated procedure in the case of AgustaWestland. The Opposition party said that defence procurement has an “integrity clause” that says there can be no middleman or payment of commission or bribe. “Any evidence of middleman or commission or bribery has serious penal consequences of banning of the supplier defence company, cancellation of contract, registration of FIR and imposition of heavy financial penalties on the defence supplier company,” said Surjewala. After the report was released, Union minister of law and justice Ravi Shankar Prasad called it baseless and said, “It’s completely baseless. The Supreme Court, CAG found nothing wrong.”The National Democratic Alliance’s decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).The deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL. The NDA has not disclosed details of the price, but the UPA deal, struck in 2012, was not a viable one, former defence minister Manohar Parrikar has previously said, implying that it would have never been closed and that, therefore, any comparison is moot. Indeed, the UPA was not able to close the deal till 2014, largely over discussions related to pricing of items not included in the initial bid.The NDA government has said that it cannot disclose the details of the price on two counts: a confidentiality agreement with France, and the strategic reason of not showing its hand to India’s enemies; however, it said that the current deal also includes customised weaponry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-french-report-on-rafale-payment-congress-demands-independent-inquiry-101617612494051.html

05-04-2021||India||In election season, the raids are back—against Opposition leaders||Four states — West Bengal, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Kerala—and one union territory—Puducherry—are currently in the middle of an intense political campaign for state assembly elections.But what they also have in common are political leaders, primarily those belonging to parties other than the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), who are facing significant raids, summons and arrests by country’s top agencies—the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), the Enforcement Directorate (ED), National Investigation Agency (NIA) and the Income Tax department—over the last few months. Opposition parties have repeatedly alleged that they are being targeted at the behest of Centre, a charge denied by the ruling party and Central agencies. In the south, a string of casesIn its latest action, on Friday, the income tax (I-T) department raided the premises of Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) chief MK Stalin’s son-in-law Sabareesan’s residence as well as the premises of DMK leader Senthil Balaji, claiming the searches were part of unearthing “political cash distribution”.In September 2020, the CBI registered a case against DMK leader Poonjolai Srinivasan in connection with the recovery of ₹11 crore in a raid by the I-T department. The same month, ED issued an order seizing properties worth ₹89 crore of DMK Lok Sabha Member of Parliament S Jagathrakshakan for alleged violation of the foreign exchange management act. Also Read | Tamil Nadu: An election that is Stalin’s to loseCentral agencies, particularly the ED, have also been active in another key poll-bound state – Kerala—with ED itself now facing a state police First Information Report (FIR) for allegedly forcing an accused—Swapna Suresh—in the gold smuggling scam to name chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. The central anti-money laundering agency also arrested suspended IAS officer—M Sivasankar, former principal secretary to Vijayan, in connection with the gold smuggling scam in October 2020, while both NIA and Customs also arrested multiple accused in the case. The ED, last month, also registered a foreign exchange violation case against officials of Kerala Infrastructure Investment Fund Board (KIIFB) for external borrowings through Masala Bonds without the Centre’s nod. Vijayan is Chairman of the Board and the Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), alleges that ED wants to target him. Prior to this, ED arrested Bineesh, son of CPI(M) state secretary Kodiyeri Balakrishnan in a money laundering case in August 2020. Vijayan, while addressing the media last month, targeted the BJP saying, “The Central agencies would have seen people who surrender before them. They would have seen Congress leaders who can be cowed down. But that will not work here. This is Kerala. People will not remain silent when BJP and Congress come together to destroy the state.” Investigations in the eastIn West Bengal, while the main adversaries—Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the BJP—battle it out on the streets, several TMC leaders, and businessmen associated with them, are under the CBI and ED scanners in Ponzi scams (Saradha and Rose Valley chit fund schemes), and for illegal coal mining and cattle smuggling. The CBI, last month, examined Mamata Banerjee’s nephew and TMC’s de facto number 2, Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira, his in-laws Menaka Gambhir and Ankush Arora. The case, registered in November 2020, relates to illegal coal mining operations worth over ₹1200 crore at the Eastern Coalfields Ltd mines in West Bengal’s Kunustoria and Kajora areas. In fact, both CBI and ED have raided over 100 places on different dates in West Bengal and other states in connection with this case. The ED, last week, also arrested Vikas Mishra, the brother of TMC youth leader Vinay Mishra, as part of its money laundering probe in a multi-crore cattle smuggling case, registered first in 2020. The BJP had earlier alleged that kickbacks from the cattle smuggling used to reach Abhishek Banerjee through Vinay Mishra. Also Read | In Bengal, the battle for Mahishya vote and the politics of turning OBCSimilarly, probing Saradha scam, the ED on March 19 questioned two TMC leaders—Madan Mitra, West Bengal’s former transport minister who is contesting from the Kamarhati constituency in North 24 Parganas, and Vivek Gupta, a former TMC MP who has been fielded from the Jorasanko assembly constituency in Kolkata. In the same scam, the ED, on Saturday, attached properties of party spokesperson Kunal Ghosh and its Lok Sabha Member of Parliament Satabdi Roy. Ghosh was questioned last month in the case. On March 15, the CBI also summoned Mamata Banerjee’s close aide, Partha Chatterjee, in connection with its 2014 probe into a ponzi scam pertaining to ICore Group of Companies, which allegedly raised over ₹3,000 crore from people by offering high returns on investments and diverted a portion of these funds. The National Investigation Agency (NIA), last Sunday, also arrested Trinamool Congress leader Chhatradhar Mahato, the poster boy of the Maoist-backed tribal-movement in Lalgarh during 2008-2011, who was inducted into party last year by TMC to woo tribal votes. Mahato was given the responsibility of at least 10 constituencies in three districts by TMC ahead of the first phase of polls. Other than that, several top officials in Bengal have been summoned by ED and CBI—including state security advisor Surajit Kar Purakayastha, principal secretary in the CM’s office, Gautam Sanyal, state additional chief secretary B P Gopalika, and Kolkata additional police commissioner Laxmi Narayan Meena in separate cases. Mamata Banerjee has repeatedly said in the last few weeks, during her public appearances, that BJP’s only allies are now CBI and ED. She wrote to 15 Opposition leaders on March 31 urging them to unite against BJP to defend democracy and claimed that the BJP government at the Centre has been brazenly and vindictively using CBI and ED in the functioning of non-BJP states. In Assam, the NIA arrested peasant leader Akhil Gogoi in December 2019 for anti-national activities. While jailed, he is contesting elections from Sibsagar constituency after launching a party—Raijor Dal—about five months back. The spike in action against Opposition leaders was also visible during the 2019 Lok Sabha elections as well as assembly elections in Maharashtra, Karnataka, Rajasthan and Jammu and Kashmir. For example, the I-T department raided the premises of Karnataka Congress leader DK Shivakumar for several days in August 2017 when he was playing a role in securing Ahmed Patel’s Rajya Sabha re-election by hosting legislators from Gujarat in Karnataka. In July last year, after a rebellion by Sachin Pilot against Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot, multiple raids were carried out by I-T on several politicians and businessmen in the state. Gehlot’s brother, Agrasain Gehlot, immediately faced an ED probe in a fertilisers scam and was even summoned. The politics behind the raids The BJP has denied that the raids have any political subtext and attribute it to the law taking its own course. According to BJP’s Nalin Kohli, “This is best answered by the agencies directly who are constantly criticised when they act or when they don’t.”The Opposition doesn’t buy the government’s version. Congress MP Manish Tewari said, “The National Democratic Alliance-BJP government has four frontal organisations—the IT, ED, CBI and the NIA. They have, over the past seven years, normalised the misuse/abuse of the State. India is now staring at an abyss. And even the shreds of moral or constitutional behaviour lie shattered and ripped by these people.” The Central agencies did not officially comment on the raids and summons to Opposition leaders before elections but several officers HT spoke to deny allegations of “political misuse”. A CBI officer, who didn’t want to be named, said, “The raids and summons are crucial part of process in CBI, and the time is decided only after certain allegations are verified or Investigation Officer feels he/she need clarification.” But others were more candid. A former head of one of the top agencies, requesting anonymity, agreed they face some pressure from dispensation to act against Opposition leaders. “It is true action intensifies around elections, particularly in those cases which were lying unattended for years. But, this happens in all governments.” Political analysts believe the issue reflects a systemic crisis in the political structure and spans across governments, though there have been questions raised about the degree to which such raids and investigations have increased under the current government. Sandeep Shastri, author and political scientist said, “I think this is not a challenge just with the current government. If you look at the last two-three decades, irrespective of which party has been at the Centre, they have tried to use the public institutions to their benefit. There needs to be stronger and vigilant public campaign to ensure autonomy of these agencies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-election-season-the-raids-are-back-against-opposition-leaders-101617609673969.html

The event is scheduled for April 13-15.Also Read | ‘Build on Pangong Lake drawdown, disengage at other points’: India tells China“The organisers of Raisina Dialogue 2021 have decided to host this year’s edition as a fully digital event, instead of the hybrid event planned earlier that envisaged both online as well as in-person speakers and delegates,” external affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said.The decision to move to a fully digital version was made as a “measure of abundant caution, given the Covid-19 situation in various parts of the world”, he said.“It underlines the strong sense of responsibility that the organisers feel towards the safety of all those involved with the dialogue,” he added.India has become only the second country in the world, after the US, to add more than 100,000 Covid-19 cases in a single day at any time during the pandemic. According to data from the health ministry on Monday, the country recorded 103,796 cases in the past 24 hours.The day’s spike pushed India’s infection tally up to 12.5 million, according to the health ministry’s dashboard.Bagchi said the fully digital Raisina Dialogue will use technology to give participants an opportunity to engage and debate on the most pressing issues facing the global community while avoiding any Covid-19-related risk.“The impact of the change in format will be appropriately reflected in our diplomatic engagements,” he added.Jaishankar and his French counterpart Jean-Yves Le Drian were expected to hold separate trilateral meetings with Australian foreign minister Marise Payne and Indonesian foreign minister Retno Marsudi. Jaishankar was also expected to hold bilateral meetings with leaders such as Maldives foreign minister Abdulla Shahid.There were already questions about an in-person visit by Marsudi, given Indonesia’s leading role in efforts by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) to address the situation in Myanmar following the February 1 coup.More than a dozen foreign and defence ministers had been listed among the speakers at the Raisina Dialogue. There is still a possibility that some leaders, who had planned bilateral engagements, will go ahead with their visits and the list is still being worked out, people familiar with developments said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-rising-covid-cases-raisina-dialogue-to-go-fully-digital-101617607574419.html

05-04-2021||India||Explained: African Swine Fever, suspected, after over 80 pigs die in Mizoram||After more than 80 pigs died in south Mizoram's Lunglei district over the last two weeks, the cause of their death has been suspected to be the African Swine Fever (ASF). The first death was reported on March 21, according to officials, after which veterinary officers were sent to the district to ascertain the cause. The confirmatory test for ASF is yet to be done at the National Institute of High Security Animal Diseases (NIHSAD) in Madhya Pradesh, but the deaths have triggered fears in the state government which has already sounded alert for the disease.What is the African Swine Fever?African Swine Fever is a deathly and contagious viral disease which affects both domestic as well as wild pigs of all ages. The disease is not a threat to human health as it cannot be transmitted from pigs to humans. The case fatality ratio (CFR) of the disease is almost 100 per cent and the disease can be transmitted through direct contact with the infected pig (alive or dead) or the wild pig (alive or dead), indirect contact through consumption of contaminated food waste, garbage by the swine.What are the symptoms of the disease?The symptoms of the disease include high fever, loss of appetite, weakness, red skin, skin lesions, diarrhoea, vomiting and difficulty in breathing, among others. The disease can cause sudden death in pigs. The disease has no approved vaccine and therefore culling of animals is required to prevent the spread of the infection.When was the last outbreak of the disease in the world?The disease was reported in China in August 2018 and by September 2018, the country had culled more than 38,000 hogs. By December, the disease spread in at least 23 provinces and municipalities across China. In 2019, the disease was reported in almost all regions of China as well as in southeast Asia which included Cambodia, Laos, Thailand and Vietnam. Due to the disease, the pig population in China declined by almost 100 million in 2019 as compared to the previous year. The disease later spread to the Philippines, South Korea, East Timor and Taiwan within the year 2019.Has the disease ever affected India?The disease was first reported in India in April 2020 in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh. According to the official data available with the veterinary department, over 15,000 pigs died because of the disease in 9 affected districts which were Golaghat, Majuli, Dibrugarh, Kamrup, Dhemaji, Biswanath, North Lakhimpur, Sibsagar and Jorhat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/explained-african-swine-fever-suspected-after-over-80-pigs-die-in-mizoram-101617602884917.html

Also, the drug reduced the duration for supplemental oxygen to 56 hours from 84 hours in moderate Covid-19 patients.“…the interim results indicate that PegIFN, when administered early on, could help patients recover faster avoiding much of the complications seen in the advanced stages of the disease. PegIFN in Covid-19 has several add-on advantages compared to other anti-viral agents. The treatment regimen would be less cumbersome and more affordable for patients as Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b, is a single dose regimen. It would also ensure better compliance,” said the company in a statement.The drug— PegIFN— has well-established safety with multiple doses in chronic hepatitis B and C patients over the years.Aging reduces the body’s ability to produce Interferon Alpha in response to viral infections and may be associated with higher mortality in elderly patients. If given early during infection, the drug can replace this deficiency and aid a faster recovery process.Also Read | India becomes second country after US to record over 100,000 daily Covid casesPatients on Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b during the trial also showed lesser need for supplemental oxygen, indicating that it was able to control respiratory distress and failure that has been one of the major challenges in treating Covid-19.“The findings are in line with recently reported importance of early IFN treatment given in combination with steroids in the treatment of Covid-19 (Lu et al, Signal Transduction and Targeted Therapy (2021) 6:107, a Nature publication. With these positive results, the company has applied for an approval for additional indication with the DCGI for the use of PegIFN in the treatment of Covid-19,” said the company.The Phase 3 trials were conducted on 250 patients across 20-25 centres in India, and the company is in the process of publishing detailed results of the trials in a peer-reviewed scientific journal.“We are encouraged by the results of Phase 3 study of Pegylated Interferon alpha 2b which has confirmed the potential to reduce virus titres when given earlier in the disease. With Indian Innovation at the forefront helping the country fight the pandemic with diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, this marks an important milestone. At Zydus, we stand committed to our endeavour of supporting patients and caregivers with access to treatment options that are affordable and can help in better disease management of Covid-19 at different stages,” said Sharvil Patel, managing director, Cadila Healthcare Ltd.

It would also ensure better compliance," Zydus Cadila said.PegIFN has very well-established safety with multiple doses in chronic Hepatitis B and C patients since many years, it added.Patients on Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b during the trial also showed lesser need for supplemental oxygen, clearly indicating that it was able to control respiratory distress and failure which has been one of the major challenges in treating Covid-19, the statement said."With these positive results, the company has applied for an approval for additional indication with DCGI for the use of PegIFN in the treatment of Covid-19," it added.The phase-III trials were conducted on 250 patients across 20-25 centres in India and the detailed results of this will be published in a peer-reviewed scientific journal, the company said."We are encouraged by the results of phase-III study of Pegylated Interferon Alpha 2b which has confirmed the potential to reduce virus titres when given earlier in the disease," Cadila Healthcare MD Sharvil Patel said.With Indian Innovation at the forefront helping the country fight the pandemic with diagnostics, vaccines and therapeutics, this marks an important milestone, he added.Besides conducting a phase-II trial in Mexico, the company is also working with the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for Pegylated Interferon Alpha-2b in order to initiate appropriate clinical trials in the US, the company said.Shares of Cadila Healthcare, the listed entity of Zydus Group, were trading at ₹438.55 per scrip on BSE, down 0.75 per cent from its previous close.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/zydus-cadila-seeks-dcgi-nod-for-use-of-hepatitis-drug-for-covid-19-treatment-101617601376712.html

While the sky remained overcast in several parts of Kashmir since evening, it started raining at midnight.“A fresh western disturbance, bringing winds from the Mediterranean, will cause light rain and thunder on April 4 and 5 and moderate rain and snow accompanied by thunderstorms and gusty winds on April 6 and 7,” the forecast said.“The system is likely to cause heavy rainfall and snowfall, primarily in the upper reaches of Kashmir such as Gulmarg, Sonamarg, Baramulla, Bandipora, Kupwara , Shopian, Qazigund-Banihal axis, in the Pir Panjal range in Jammu division, and in Dras and Zanskar subdivisions of Ladakh,” meteorologist MH Mir said in a weather advisory to the divisional commissioners of J&K and Ladakh.The fresh precipitation may lead to temporary disruption of surface traffic mainly on the Jammu-Srinagar and Srinagar-Leh national highways, Leh-Manali highway, Mughal Road and Sadhna Pass on April 6 and 7. Mir added that there was a possibility of landslides and shooting stones at vulnerable spots on the Jammu-Srinagar and Srinagar-Leh national highways.The fresh western disturbance comes a week after the UT was affected by two back-to-back weather systems that hit the region in the fourth week of March.After a relatively hot February, March mostly remained cold and wet with intermittent precipitation across Jammu and Kashmir.Although February witnessed a number of snow spells, it also saw an abrupt increase in maximum temperatures.

05-04-2021||India||Central employment scheme figures fudged in Odisha, says CAG, seeks probe||Odisha has been faulted by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India (CAG) for failing to achieve targeted employment of youth and for inflated expenditure under the Deen Dayal Upadhyay Grameen Kaushal Yojana (DDUGKY), run by the ministry of rural development. CAG also underlined massive irregularities in implementation of the scheme, for which the state was earlier adjudged top achiever for two consecutive years.The DDUGKY was started by the Centre in September 2014 for imparting skills to rural youth between the ages of 15 and 35 years and giving them regular jobs and was tied into the National Rural Livelihoods Mission programme. Of the 6.28 lakh rural youths who were employed till December last year, Odisha claimed to have placed the highest number of youth--1,33,853, followed by Andhra Pradesh (67,128) and Jammu and Kashmir (60,433), according to data available on the DDUGKY website.The CAG audited the scheme for the period between 2014 and 2019 and found that 14% training and 77% placements claimed by Odisha Rural Development and Marketing Society (ORMAS), the implementing agency of the scheme, were false and fabricated. ORMAS engaged 95 Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs), mostly private, to provide training in placement-linked skill development courses, but the CAG audit found that many of these agencies were unfit while several of them exaggerated the employment figures.ORMAS received ₹657.90 crore during 2014-19 under DDUGKY and spent ₹568.43 crore as of March 2019 for its target of training 2.02 lakh rural youth. It claimed to have trained 1.31 lakh youth by March 2019 and placed 97,198 of these in jobs.But the CAG audit team found that ORMAS provided undue favour to project implementing agencies by skipping the laid-down appraisal process, a crucial internal control mechanism. The PIAs were selected again and again despite a poor record of placing youth.The audit also found that many of the PIAs, though financially ineligible, were awarded projects in violation of the laid-down procedures due to the intervention of executive director of ORMAS and secretary of panchayati raj department. Four PIAs were sanctioned five projects worth ₹102.13 crore during September 2016 to September 2018 while they were only eligible for projects worth ₹25.20 crore.“The PIAs were selected arbitrarily without conducting mandatory qualitative assessment in terms of their financial strength, commitment to captive placement, parent company structure and core sector presence, etc., which amounted to extension of undue pecuniary benefits to certain PIAs. The PIAs misused the provisions in the DDUGKY reporting system that allowed them to revise MIS figures at their level,” the CAG audit found.One PIA was supposed to provide overseas placements and set up a centre of excellence in Odisha. It continued to get the projects despite failing in both stated objectives. Two PIAs who claimed to have earlier provided placement to 916 and 257 candidates, respectively later revised the figures to 619 and 234 candidates respectively.Claims by PIAs of having provided jobs to the youths also turned out to be exaggerated. CAG audit found that bank statements of several youths did not show any entry, forget salary credit. At least six bank accounts were found to be non-existent and no transactions were seen in 33 accounts. Some of the PIAs even faked ESIC numbers and salary slips of 19 candidates, who they claimed to have provided jobs.The CAG recommended a thorough investigation of all the placement claims. “Ensure that after the verification is conducted, placement percentage is recalculated and any excess money released is recovered with penal interest,” the CAG advised.The CAG report on DDUGKY has come at a time when the state government is under fire from opposition over lack of employment for youths. Recently, leader of opposition Pradipta Naik alleged Odisha has more than 9 lakh registered unemployed youths while thousands of people migrate to other states in search of jobs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/central-employment-scheme-figures-fudged-in-odisha-says-cag-seeks-probe-101617597073700.html

05-04-2021||India||Maoist ambush: Baghel was campaigning in Assam after jawans died, says BJP||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and former Chhattisgarh chief minister Raman Singh hit out at chief minister Bhupesh Baghel on Sunday alleging he was busy campaigning for the Congress in Assam despite the death of 22 security personnel in a Maoist ambush back home on Saturday. Baghel returned from Assam on Sunday evening.“He is holding rallies there (in Assam), taking out marches ...dancing there ...after such a big incident ...elections have become the chief minister’s first priority..,” Raman Singh said.22 police and paramilitary personnel were killed and at least two dozen others were injured in Bastar region as the extremists led by their commander Madvi Hidma ambushed the forces after possibly luring them to a stronghold area near the Bijapur-Sukma border during a combing operation. Deaths of five security personnel were confirmed on Saturday, while 18 more bodies were found on Sunday. One jawan was missing after the attack. This was the worst Maoist attack in the last 4 years.Eight of the deceased were from district reserve guard, six were CoBRA commandos, six others were special task force (STF) members, and one jawan was from the Bastariya battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF). The police suspect about a dozen Maoists were likely killed in the encounter. While CM Bhupesh Baghel ruled out any intelligence failure, Union home minister Amit Shah said that a befitting reply will be given to Maoists at the right time.“The entire state is mourning the death of our jawans but the chief minister is enjoying the festival in Assam. What can be more unfortunate than the fact that Bhupesh Baghel is still busy in Assam electioneering despite such a major incident,” said Dharamlal Kaushik, the leader of opposition in the state assembly.Kaushik said responsibility must be fixed for the operation which went wrong despite the “input of presence of a large number of Maoists”.In response, the Congress accused the BJP of politicising the martyrdom of slain jawans.“Raman Singh should first answer what Amit Shah was doing? Was he campaigning in Assam or not? There is no need to politicize Maoist violence. We all know that Maoists are a national problem and both the state and Central governments are working on it,” said Shailesh Nitin Trivedi, spokesperson of the Congress.Trivedi further alleged that all major attacks in Bastar region took place during the BJP’s rule and the party had no right to sermonise others.“During the BJP rule of 15 years (2003-2018), the state witnessed some of the biggest attacks. The Bhupesh Baghel government has been using the three-pronged strategy of trust, development and security in Maoist-affected areas, and it has resulted in the weakening of Maoists,” said Trivedi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maoist-ambush-bjp-says-baghel-was-campaigning-in-assam-after-jawans-died-101617591014586.html

All you need to know||With the completion of its majestic arches on Monday, the construction of the iconic Chenab Arch Bridge, which will soar 359 metres above the bed of the river and 30 metres higher than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, will reach another milestone. The bridge will provide the much-needed all-weather connectivity between Kashmir and the rest of the county. The bottom ends of the main arch have already been connected, after which the upper arch will now be completed and the two will now be closed. The next step would be the laying of the tracks.Read more: Rail Ministry posts clip about Chenab bridge construction reaching a milestoneHere’s everything you need to know about the Chenab Arch Bridge:1. The bridge is part of an ambitious 272-km rail link project and is being constructed by the Northern Railway at an estimated cost of ₹28,000 crore.2. The bridge will be able to withstand earthquakes with a magnitude of up to eight and high-intensity blasts.3. The bridge, which will include a 14-metre dual carriageway and a 1.2-metre-wide central verge, will have a design speed of around 100 kilometres per hour with a lifespan of 120 years.4. Steel was specifically chosen for the construction of the bridge as it will make the project more economical. The metal will also be able to resist temperatures of minus 20 degree Celsius and wind speeds of above 200 kilometre per hour.5. The preparations of the rail link began in 2002 and the initial plan was to connect Kashmir’s northernmost city Baramulla to New Delhi. The project was given high priority by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led Atal Bihari Vajpayee government but the project suffered several delays owing to the weather conditions and contractual issues, according to officials.6. Work on the bridge started again in July 2017 with the aim of completing the construction by the end of 2019 but due to contractual issues in 2018, it was delayed. The coronavirus pandemic also added to the delay in the construction of the project and the revised guideline for the completion of the project has now been for December 2021.(with agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chenab-arch-bridge-set-to-be-world-s-highest-rail-bridge-all-you-need-to-know-101617586363601.html

However, with the discovery of 18 more bodies on Sunday, the death toll climbed to 22, making it the worst such incident in four years. One jawan was missing after the attack.The police said that out of the 22 jawans killed in the attack, eight were from district reserve guard, six CoBRA commandos, six special task force (STF) members, and one jawan of the “Bastariya” battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).The gunfight also resulted in the death of a suspected Maoist, the police said, adding that about a dozen others were likely killed in the encounter.Inspector general of police, Bastar range, Sunderaj P said 18 jawans were missing after five security personnel were killed and 31 others injured on Saturday in the gunfight. “On Sunday, bodies of 17 missing personnel were recovered during a search operation. With this, a total 22 personnel have been killed in the incident,” he said.A police officer aware of the developments said it was a “U-shaped attack” in which the security personnel were trapped at a lower level and the Maoists fired indiscriminately from two hilltops in Bijapur, about 400km from the state capital, Raipur. The officer said on condition of anonymity that the Maoist operation was led by Hidma, who was waiting for the forces to enter Terrem jungles. There was intelligence input that Hidma was present in the area for the last 17 days, the officer added.On Friday night, about 1,700 security personnel from different camps in Bijapur and Sukma districts began one of the biggest recent combing operations to look for Hidma. On Saturday, a team of about 450 security personnel was in Jeeram Jonaguda and Tekulguda villages at about 11.45am, when it was ambushed. The security personnel were returning to their camp, the police officer quoted above said.Another senior police officer said that the forces were trapped in the “killing area” of the Maoists in the two villages, which were already vacated by the ultras before the ambush. About 350 Maoists fired at the security forces from the two hillocks and later chased the jawans as they ran to take cover inside huts. The encounter went on for almost three hours, the officer said.The combing operation was launched based on the intelligence inputs about the presence of Maoists belonging to the PLGA (Peoples’ Liberation Guerilla Army) battalion number 1, which is led by Hidma. The second officer did not rule out that it was a false input meant to trap the forces.Director general of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Kuldiep Singh, who is in Chhattisgarh to monitor the situation following the Maoist attack, however, said there was no intelligence or operational failure.“There is no point in saying that there was some kind of intelligence or operational failure. Had it been some intelligence failure, forces would have not gone for the operation. And if there was some operational failure, so many Naxals would have not been killed,” the CRPF DG told ANI.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the incident and Union home minister Amit Shah and Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel, who were campaigning for elections in Assam, cut their visits short to review the situation. Shah spoke to Baghel over the incident and said a “befitting response” will be given to the attackers, people aware of the developments said.“My thoughts are with the families of those martyred while fighting Maoists in Chhattisgarh. The sacrifices of the brave martyrs will never be forgotten. May the injured recover at the earliest,” Modi tweeted.Shah said: “Both sides have suffered losses. Our jawans have lost their lives. I pay tributes to them. I want to assure their families that their sacrifice will not go in vain.”Defence minister Rajnath Singh, too, paid tributes to the security personnel. “They fought with utmost courage; their sacrifice will never be forgotten. My deepest condolences to their families,” he said.Congress leader Rahul Gandhi appealed to the state government to help locate the missing soldiers and ensure speedy recoveries for those injured. “My condolences to the families of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in combat in Chhattisgarh. Decisive action needs to be taken to locate and rescue the missing Jawans. I appeal to the state govt to ensure best care for a speedy recovery of the injured,” he tweeted.Of the injured, seven people were admitted to hospitals in Raipur, while 24 were undergoing treatment at the Bijapur district hospital.Chhattisgarh police’s additional director general Ashok Juneja told AFP that a search operation was on till Sunday evening, and the exact figure of deaths and casualties would be known after the operation was over. Another officer said the death toll was likely to rise in the attack.Juneja said the Maoists looted weapons, ammunition, uniforms and shoes from the security forces who were killed. A senior official told PTI that the Maoists used light machine guns and low-intensity improvised explosive devices to mount the attack.The toll was the worst for security forces battling Maoists since 2017, when 25 jawans were killed in an attack. Seventeen personnel from a commando patrol were killed in an attack by more than 300 armed Maoists in Chhattisgarh in March last year.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/22-jawans-killed-in-ambush-in-chhattisgarh-s-bastar-101617563027094.html
05-04-2021||India||Drone shows tractor trolleys used to carry up to 20 dead Maoists: Officials||The number of Maoists killed in an encounter with security forces over the weekend could be between 12 and 20, according to home ministry and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) officials aware of the developments, with intelligence inputs suggesting that the extremists used grenade launchers in the ambush that claimed the lives of at least 22 security personnel.While the body of one Maoist cadre was recovered in a search operation after one of the deadliest attacks in recent years, the casualty figure of the ultras was expected to be much higher, one of the people cited above said.Also Read | The 22 soldiers who were killed in Chhattisgarh Maoists attackThe information on the Maoist deaths was backed by surveillance inputs captured by a Heron drone which indicated that two tractor-trolleys were used to ferry the dead extremists back into deep forests, the person added.“Our estimate is that between 12 and 20 Maoist cadres have been killed or else they would have not asked for two tractor-trolleys. They tried to encircle CoBRA, black panthers and DRG-STF troops but were not successful. We will retaliate on our own terms,” said a senior CRPF official who asked not to be named.The Maoists regrouped and tried to surround another area on Sunday morning after the initial attack, but the attempt was repelled, and security forces reached their base safely, the CRPF official said.The casualty numbers in the ambush on both sides were high as the encounter took place in the nerve centre of the Maoist operations, the Bijapur-Sukma area in the Bastar region, another official said.The official added that the Maoists used barrel grenade launchers in the attack, which resulted in several deaths, many due to splinter injuries. The security forces also retaliated with grenade launchers attached to automatic weapons, the official said.Wireless intercepts indicated that the Maoists managed to track the movement of the security forces, but the Heron drone also picked up movements of multiple Maoist teams, a fourth person said a review of the incident indicated.Around 11.10am on Saturday, a firefight broke out between the forces and the Maoists, with grenade launchers being used by both sides, the person added. The team of the security forces, about 460 of them, later moved towards an open area to facilitate the evacuation of the injured. The troops retrieved the body of a woman from the Maoist group along with an INSAS rifle in an operation later.Also Read | After Maoist attack in Chhattisgarh's Sukma, Amit Shah vows befitting replyUnion home minister Amit Shah on Sunday held a top-level meeting with senior officers in New Delhi on the incident. Home secretary Ajay Bhalla, intelligence bureau director Arvind Kumar and senior CRPF officers were present at the meeting.While CRPF director-general Kuldiep Singh was in Raipur, the home ministry’s adviser on Maoist activities, K Vijay Kumar, was in Jagdalpur to review the situation.Shah, who is scheduled to chair another meeting on the incident on Monday, said a befitting response will be given to those responsible for the Maoist attack.“Our securitymen have lost their lives, we will not tolerate this bloodshed and a befitting reply will be given at an appropriate time,” Shah said. He added that both sides suffered losses and the exact casualty figures were being ascertained.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-to-20-maoists-killed-in-gunbattle-officials-101617577770857.html
05-04-2021||India||Ambulance used to ferry Ansari to Mohali found abandoned in Rupnagar: Police||An ambulance used to ferry gangster-turned-politician Mukhtar Ansari to a Mohali court was found abandoned outside a roadside eatery on the Chandigarh-Nangal highway in Punjab's Rupnagar district, police said on Sunday.The police said they have taken the vehicle in their custody."We have taken the ambulance in our custody," Rupnagar Deputy Superintendent of Police T S Gill said over the phone.The police said they got information that the ambulance bearing a registration number of Uttar Pradesh was lying abandoned on the roadside.Ansari, the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Mau who is wanted in Uttar Pradesh for various cases, was ferried in the ambulance from the Rupnagar jail to a Mohali court in connection with a 2019 case of extortion.Amid tight security arrangements, Ansari was taken to the court on a wheelchair. He was sent back to the Rupnagar jail, where he is lodged since January 2019, in the ambulance after the court appearance.A case was registered in Uttar Pradesh's Barabanki after the documents of the ambulance were found to be fake, the Uttar Pradesh police had said.The FIR was registered under the relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including 420 (forgery), 471 (fraudulently or dishonestly using documents as genuine), 467 (forgery of valuable security) and 468 (forgery for purpose of cheating).Amid a row over the issue, a Punjab police official had clarified that an inmate can be transported in a private ambulance on medical grounds and the cost of conveyance has to be borne by the prisoner.According to the Punjab Prisoners (Attendance in Court) Rules, 1969, police can allow a private vehicle on the request of a prisoner, the official had said.The Supreme Court recently directed the Punjab government to hand over the custody of Ansari to the Uttar Pradesh police, saying it was being denied on trivial grounds under the guise of medical issues.The apex court had also said a convict or an undertrial prisoner, who disobeys the law of the land, cannot oppose his transfer from one prison to another and the courts are not to be helpless bystanders when the rule of law is being challenged with impunity.The court had said Ansari's custody be handed over to the Uttar Pradesh police within two weeks so as to lodge him in the Banda district jail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambulance-used-to-ferry-ansari-to-mohali-found-abandoned-in-rupnagar-police-101617577269664.html
05-04-2021||India||On India visit, Kerry to push for cutting fossil fuel imprint||The United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry, will meet representatives from the Union government, the private sector, and NGOs, during an April 5-8 visit aimed at consultations on increasing climate ambition ahead of President Joe Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate scheduled for April 22-23.Kerry will focus on mitigating fossil fuel use in India and increasing low and zero carbon investments, a US embassy spokesperson said. The embassy has not yet put out Kerry’s schedule.“As one of the world’s largest economies, and a global leader in science and innovation, India is a critical part of the solution to the climate crisis. We see India as an important partner on future clean energy research, development, and deployment, not least because of their successful domestic agenda in this area. A key focus for our Administration is supporting and encouraging India’s decarbonisation efforts through clean, zero, and low-carbon investment, and supporting India in mitigating its fossil energy use,” the spokesperson said on Sunday.Officials in the Union environment ministry said there is a diplomatic push to announce a target of achieving net zero emissions by the mid-century, like 58 other countries have announced.India is the third-largest global emitter of carbon dioxide, after China and the US, despite extremely low per capita CO2 emissions, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). India emits 7.1% of global emissions and its per capita emissions are 60% lower than the global average. It is also among a handful of countries whose nationally determined contributions (NDCs) are compatible with keeping global warming under 2 degrees Celsius, as specified in the 2015 Paris Agreement. Only five other countries—Bhutan, Costa Rica, Ethiopia, Kenya and Philippines—are 2°C compatible.India is also on track to overachieve its NDCs. Emission intensity of India’s GDP has reduced by 24% between 2005 and 2016. Its commitment was to reduce emission intensity of GDP by 20-25% from 2005 levels by 2020. India is implementing one of the largest renewable energy expansion programmes with a target of achieving 175GW of renewable energy capacity by 2022, and later up to 450GW, according to a report submitted in February to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).The report, however, said that coal will remain essential for India’s developmental needs and energy security.Experts said India will have to do a careful balancing act. For example, former climate negotiator and ambassador, Chandrashekhar Dasgupta, said in an interview to HT that achieving net zero emissions by the 2050s would be a challenge. “First, it would require us to immediately scrap all existing coal-based power plants and factories, or alternatively, retrofit them with carbon capture and storage technology. This would entail astronomical costs at a time when the economy is already reeling from the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic. Second, it would hit our ‘Aatmanirbhar Bharat’ (self-reliance) policy. It would necessitate an immediate switchover to imported, existing clean energy technologies at huge cost, denying our own industry the time required for indigenisation or development of affordable indigenous technologies... Third, we need to examine the trade-related implications of surrendering our principled position on common and differentiated responsibilities (CBDR).” He recommended that India should not bind itself to a global date on achieving net zero emissions.CBDR, a principle under the Paris Agreement, requires richer countries to take historical responsibility for emissions caused in the past by them.Responding to a query on whether India has a policy on net zero emissions, a senior environment ministry official last week said: “The world will be better placed to declare any new targets when global stocktaking process concludes in 2023.”Meanwhile, the Climate Action Tracker (CAT) said on March 11 that if the Biden administration wants the US to be consistent with the target of keeping global warming under 1.5°C, its new 2030 Paris Agreement target should aim for emission reductions of at least 57%-63% below 2005 levels.The US’s action on climate change is presently “critically insufficient”, according to CAT."A net-zero target is not a trivial endeavour for any country—especially for a lower-middle income country like India that has the dual challenge of providing modern energy services to millions while protecting the environment. We will need a number of technologies to become better and cheaper—energy storage, faster EV charging, fuel cells, hydrogen electrolysers, agricultural technologies, carbon capture, and direct air capture - which will be absolutely crucial to achieve any net zero target. Public and private partnerships with the US can play a very important role in technological innovation and adaptation to India's needs. The quest for a net-zero emissions future could bring new jobs and better health for Indians. But much depends on infusion of international capital and disruptive technologies,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate at World Resources Institute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-india-visit-kerry-to-push-for-cutting-fossil-fuel-imprint-101617573330831.html
05-04-2021||India||WWII veteran on new mission to motivate others to get vaccinated||Ninety-five-year-old World War II veteran Ramlal Sabharwal is on a special mission — that of motivating others to get vaccinated against Covid-19. The retired army subedar received his first dose of the coronavirus (Covid-19) vaccine on March 16.“I fought in the World War II, the Sino-Indian War, and the India-Pakistan War. I know that even 10% protective shield is enough to increase the survival rate. Here, vaccines are 80% effective,” Sabharwal said.The Indore resident said that the Covid-19 pandemic is one of the longest battles faced by the world, after the two World Wars.“When people ask me about the side effects [of the vaccine], I tell them that in a war even a small stone is enough to save from bullets, the vaccination is like a bulletproof jacket,” said Sabharwal, who suffers from a heart ailment.Sabharwal received his first dose at Apollo Hospital in Indore. He was administered the Covishield vaccine, manufactured by Pune-based Serum Institute of India. “I have seen many tough times — wars, Emergency, communal riots. We always adopted an attacking strategy with weapons to destroy the enemy as we were aware of the power of the enemy. But this time enemy is a small virus and its mutants. We have only one strategy — to fight defensively and the vaccine is the only defensive shield we have,” he said.When the pandemic struck last year, Sabharwal and his family of six devised a protocol of their own to avoid getting infected.“I live with my son, daughter-in-law, grandson, granddaughter-in-law and two great-grandsons, one of whom is a “coronial” baby (born during the pandemic). They used to keep a distance of six feet after coming from outside. They are still extra cautious and come to my room only after taking a bath and sanitising everything,” he said.Sabharwal believes that the government has done a good job in containing the spread of the disease.“When the pandemic broke early in 2020, the whole world was ill-prepared for the situation. There were crises of masks and PPE kits, most important things to save themselves from virus, but we fought bravely…”Now, we have enough masks, PPE kits, and the most important thing, which is vaccines, he said.His son and daughter-in-law, both aged over 60, have also received the first dose of the vaccine. India opened up its vaccination drive to all people above 45 last week. The previous two phases of the drive – the first was aimed at health care and frontline workers and the second at those above 60 and or above 45 with comorbidities – were dogged by a slow roll-out, teething problems, vaccine hesitancy, and misinformation.So far, nearly 2.1 million people have been vaccinated in Madhya Pradesh, said state immunisation officer Santosh Shukla. Of these, 776,112 frontline and health care workers have received the first dose, while 500,917 have received the second dose.MP medical education minister Vishwas Sarang said: “We are happy that people are taking interest and coming out for vaccination. But at the same time, many people are not coming out as they believed the lie which is being spread by some antisocial elements.” “After this second wave of Covid 19, we are hoping that people will understand the seriousness and will come out for vaccination,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wwii-veteran-on-new-mission-to-motivate-others-to-get-vaccinated-101617569283185.html
05-04-2021||India||Poor quality of legal education worrying, says justice Ramana||Chief Justice of India (CJI)-designate NV Ramana said on Sunday that poor quality of legal education, along with other issues, was to be blamed for staggering pendency of cases across courts in the country.“There are many substandard colleges in the country, which is a very worrying trend... One of the consequences of the poor quality of legal education in the country is the exploding pendency in the country. There are nearly 3.8 crore cases pending in all the courts in India despite the large number of advocates in the country,” said justice Ramana, as he addressed the convocation ceremony of Andhra Pradesh-based Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University.According to the National Judicial Data Grid (NJDG), the total number of pending cases in the subordinate judiciary (courts below the level of the high court) was 37.2 million at the end of January 2021. More than 4 million cases were pending in high courts at that time. As on March 1 this year, the Supreme Court had over 66,000 pending cases.The issue was also flagged by government think-tank Niti Aayog. In its 2018 strategy paper, titled “New India @75”, the body underscored that at the current rate of disposal of cases by courts, it would take more than 324 years to clear the backlog. The total number of cases pending at the time was 29 million.Delivering his address virtually, justice Ramana pointed out that although around 150,000 students graduate from law colleges every year, but less than 25% of them are actually ready for the profession.“This is in no way a comment on the graduates themselves, who certainly possess the required attributes to be successful lawyers. Rather, it is a comment on the large number of substandard legal educational institutions in the country, which are colleges merely in name,” he said, adding that the judiciary was also making efforts to improve the situation.Justice Ramana said that legal graduates should be made to understand from the very beginning about the true duty of a lawyer, which was to unite people. He also said they should get practical experience through association with lok adalats, legal aid centres, and arbitration and mediation centres during their studies.“Lawyers can play an important role in reducing the pendency by advising their clients to settle their disputes at the pre-litigation stage itself. They should also give proper advice to their clients as to how to pursue their legal claims without abusing the process. They must keep in mind not only their duty to their clients, but also their duty to the courts, to society and to the law,” he emphasised.Imploring graduates to act as “the conscience bearers of the nation”, justice Ramana said that they had a duty to render voice to the voiceless and make contributions to society.He also lamented that the education system was currently not equipped to build the character of the students, or to develop social consciousness and responsibility.“Students are often caught in the rat race. All of us should therefore make a collective effort to revamp the educational system to ensure that students can have the right outlook to their career and life outside,” said justice Ramana.On March 24, Chief Justice of India SA Bobde designated the second most senior judge, justice Ramana, as his successor. Justice Bobde retires on April 23 and justice Ramana will become the 48th CJI the next day. He will serve till August 26, 2022.Manan Kumar Mishra, senior advocate and Bar Council of India chairman, told HT: “The BCI is taking all possible steps and we now have an advisory committee to prescribe standards of legal education. This committee, incidentally, is headed by justice Ramana.”Mishra added that BCI has also imposed a three-year moratorium in August 2019 for opening of new law colleges as a measure to stop mushrooming of institutions without adequate infrastructure and proper academics.“You must have good law teachers too if you want good lawyers. Be it affiliation of law colleges or having competent teachers, universities have the first and foremost responsibility. BCI’s role is limited to giving approvals once universities grant affiliation. But we are still taking utmost steps to ensure improvement of quality of legal education,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/poor-quality-of-legal-education-worrying-says-justice-ramana-101617564381469.html
05-04-2021||India||Fuel prices may fall further, says oil minister Dharmendra Pradhan||State-run oil marketing companies have recently cut petrol, diesel and cooking gas rates, and fuel prices may fall further in the near future, Union petroleum minister Dharmendra Pradhan on Sunday said in Kolkata ahead of the third-phase polling for the assembly elections in West Bengal.Fuel prices were frozen since February 27 immediately after the Election Commission (EC) announced assembly elections in five states. But public sector retailers have reduced petrol and diesel rates in three small doses -- by 61 paise per litre and 60 paise a litre, respectively -- since March 24. State-run companies cut cooking gas price by ₹10 a cylinder last Thursday.“In last few days, petrol and diesel rates have started falling. We had said earlier that when crude oil prices will fall in the international market, we will pass on the benefit to the consumer... Price of LPG (liquefied petroleum gas or cooking gas) has also started falling. It will fall further in coming days,” Pradhan told reporters.Politically sensitive fuel prices will fall further in coming days, a senior government official with direct knowledge of the matter said on Sunday, requesting anonymity. The cut in diesel prices are expected to be steeper compared to petrol, the official said. HT reported on April 1 that a fall in fuel rates was imminent.According to state-run Indian Oil Corporation (IOC), the country’s largest fuel refiner and retailer, prices of crude oil and petroleum product in the international market softened in the second fortnight of March due to growing worries about rising Covid-19 cases in Europe and Asia, and some concerns over side effects of vaccines.“We are hoping international prices would remain stable and would not go up so that the benefit can be passed on to the consumer,” petroleum secretary Tarun Kapoor was quoted as saying in an HT report last week as prices of crude and petroleum products softened from a peak of nearly $70 a barrel.Brent crude, which was below $60 a barrel until February 5, 2021, saw a strong rally for over a month to peak at $69.63 per barrel on March 11 because of supply squeeze by the oil producers’ cartel, the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies, including Russia (together known as OPEC+). Its latest rate, before the weekend’s close, was around $64 a barrel.The cartel resorted to cut about one-tenth of global output in April 2020 after Brent crude plunged below $20 per barrel due to weak demand because of lockdowns in global economies. Also, Saudi Arabia cut additional output by 1 million barrels per day since February this year. The cartel is reluctant to raise output matching the spurt in demand.An official working with a state-run refiner said on condition of anonymity that public sector oil marketing companies (OMCs) will be asked to absorb some price volatility to keep petrol, diesel and cooking gas prices stable since the firms have made decent profits this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fuel-prices-may-fall-further-says-oil-minister-dharmendra-pradhan-101617563906163.html

Sodhi was among the 22 security personnel killed in the attack in which around 31 others sustained injuries.“We were five brothers and out of that four are serving as policemen -- fighting against Maoists. We are saddened and mourning the loss of my brother but we are not afraid...The locals and villagers are very angry after the attack as many young tribals from the village have joined the security forces in last few years,” Bheema said. The brothers hailed from Kunnur village in Bijapur district.Narayan is survived by his wife and four children.On Saturday, five security personnel were said to have been killed shortly after about 1,700 men launched a combing operation for Maoist commander Madvi Hidma. However, with the discovery of 17 more bodies on Sunday, the death toll climbed to 22, making it the worst such incident in four years. One jawan was missing after the attack.The police said that out of the 22 jawans killed in the attack, eight were from district reserve guard, six CoBRA commandos, six special task force (STF) members, and one jawan of the “Bastariya” battalion of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF).A soldier from the CRPF’s newly formed Bastariya Battalion, Somiaya Mandavi, was also killed in the ambush. Mandavi, a native of Awaapalli village, joined the CRPF five years ago. “He got married three years ago and had a 10-month-old son. Somiaya recently built a house and was planning a house warming party after his return,” said his brother Shankar Mandavi.“After joining the force, he changed the fortune of our family. We don’t know what would happen to us now,” he said.Residents of Assam, Uttar Pradesh, Jammu and Kashmir, and Andhra Pradesh were also among the security personnel killed in the attack. Chief ministers of several states including UP’s Yogi Adityanath and Assam’s Sarbanda Sonowal mourned the deaths of the soldiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-are-saddened-but-not-afraid-say-families-of-slain-jawans-101617563591467.html
05-04-2021||India||Daily cases may double in 15 days if norms flouted: Expert||The daily cases in Bengaluru are likely to double by April 20 if people continue to neglect maintaining social distancing and do not adhere to Covid-19 protocols , a member of the expert panel constituted by the state government said on Sunday. Girdhara R Babu, epidemiologist and professor at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and a member of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19 said that most of the congregations are preventable and measures that could have been taken at a local level is fast evolving and necessitating national level mitigation. “At this rate, #Bengaluru will have about 6,500 daily cases by April 20. Even if 10% of them require hospitalisation, the health system will run out of capacity in (a) few days. We need action now, not tomorrow. Stay home people, wear masks if going out and get (a) vaccine when eligible,” Babu said in a Twitter post on Sunday. Bengaluru reported 2,787 new infections in the 24 hours on Saturday that takes its active case count to 28,098. The active case count in Karnataka approached the 40,000 mark as 4,553 more infections were reported across the state. Babu said that this was a “conservative estimate” and not a pessimistic approach. He said that even if 10% of those testing positive each day require hospitalisation, the system will collapse. The predictions come at a time when Bengaluru and several other districts of Karnataka have seen a sharp spike in cases, indicating that the second wave of infections were spreading faster than what was seen the first time around since last March. “While the lockdown in 2020 was mostly unavoidable, the impending one in 2021 is mostly preventable,” Babu added.The area of concern remains the rapidly surging positivity rate in the state. In the 24 hours on Saturday, the positivity rate remained at 3.79% and 331 persons were in the intensive care units of various hospitals in the state including 158 in Bengaluru alone. Mysuru, about 125 kms from Bengaluru reported 260 new cases while the situation in Bidar, Kalaburagi, Tumakuru, Bengaluru Rural, Hassan and Dharwad among other places also deteriorated steadily, shows official data. There were 93 new infections in Ballari, 147 in Bidar, 155 in Bengaluru Rural, 83 in Dakshina Kannada, 100 in Dharwad, 104 in Hassan, 170 in Kalaburagi and 107 in Tumakuru, data shows. The state government is hoping that the vaccination will help contain the spread of the virus. However, Babu said that the vaccination can prevent Covid-19 from turning serious or fatal but does not provide immunity from the virus. Those who have got both doses of the virus should continue to wear masks as they are not immune from the virus and can spread it further, he added The Karnataka government has so far vaccinated 4,355,893 persons in all categories that include both the first and second doses.In a brief statement on Sunday, the Chief Minister’s Office (CMO) said that on request from Karnataka, the government of India is making an emergency supply of 15.25 lakh doses to the state. The statement added that the state has 7 lakh vaccines and that the state inoculated 2.5 lakh people in one day on Saturday. “Karnataka will receive 15,25,500 doses of Covid-19 vaccine tomorrow in two consignments. One consignment of 5,25,500 doses will arrive at Belagavi by road and another consignment of 10,00,000 doses will arrive at Bengaluru by air through a late evening flight,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health, family welfare and medical education minister said on Sunday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-cases-may-double-in-15-days-if-norms-floutedexpert-101617563531571.html
05-04-2021||India||BJP releases clip to mount attack on Abhishek over coal case||Kolkata: The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday released an audio clip claiming that Trinamool Congress youth wing president and chief minister Mamata Banerjee’s nephew Abhishek Banerjee received ₹900 crore from corruption.BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari, who contested against the CM on the East Midnapore district’s Nandigram assembly seat on April 1, released the audio clip at a press conference and claimed that Abhishek Banerjee received ₹900 crore from rackets that smuggled cow, coal and sand. The purported audio clip, he said, allegedly contains conversation that took place between Kolkata-based businessman Ganesh Bagaria and the absconding general secretary of the youth wing of the TMC, Vinay Mishra, both of whom are suspects in the coal smuggling scam that the CBI and ED are probing. In the audio clip, the veracity of which was not independently verified by HT, one man could be heard telling the other that money from the coal scam went to Abhishek Banerjee. The BJP released the clip a few hours after the Enforcement Directorate (ED) arrested Ashok Mishra, an inspector of the West Bengal police who was posted in Bankura district in the coal pilferage case. “He has more evidence, which will be released later,” said Adhikari. Dismissing the fresh allegations made on Sunday, Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister Tapas Roy said, “Why is the BJP making these allegations in the middle of the elections? They brought similar charges in the past as well. It had no effect. This, too, will prove to be a futile attempt.” The CBI and ED officials did not comment on the audio clip on Sunday.In February, the CBI questioned Abhishek Banerjee’s wife Rujira Naroola and her sister Maneka Gambhir, the latter’s husband Ankush Arora and his father Pawan Arora in the coal smuggling case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-releases-clip-to-mount-attack-on-abhishek-over-coal-case-101617563171509.html
05-04-2021||India||Maharashtra steps up restrictions as cases continue to surge||The state of Maharashtra returned to near-lockdown levels of curbs on Sunday with authorities imposing a night and weekend curfew, ordering non-essentials businesses shut, and requiring most offices to switch to remote working as the relentless surge in Covid-19 continued, reinforcing fears that the state could soon see a shortage of hospital beds, doctors and medical oxygen supply.On Sunday, Maharashtra recorded 57,074 – by far the highest number for a single day yet – while the state’s capital became the first Indian city to add new infections in the five digits with over 11,206 new infections. The new infections in the state account for 54% of the cases recorded countrywide, with Maharashtra’s count being close to ten times of the state with the next highest number.According to the government’s “break the chain” order, there will be a complete lockdown on weekends and for 11 hours – from 8pm to 7am – on the other days. People will only be allowed outside for essential services such as to buy groceries or to go to a hospital.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageAt no point can more than five people gather outdoors, and places of worship, malls, theatres, swimming pools and gyms will be closed. Restaurants and eateries will be allowed to serve only take-out food, the order added.The decisions were taken after chief minister Uddhav Thackeray convened an urgent meeting of council of ministers on Sunday to deliberate on the stricter curbs in the state. The partial lockdown was allowed after the cabinet meeting and the detailed SOP was issued later in the day.Before the cabinet meeting, Thackeray spoke with leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis and Maharashtra Navnirman Sena chief Raj Thackeray, held meetings with key industrialists and producers of TV serials and films.Thackeray, in his address to the people of Maharashtra on Friday, hinted at the stricter curbs by weekend. On Saturday, he said if the choice had to be made between saving lives or saving jobs, it would have to be lives.The surge in cases has resulted in shortage of the beds and oxygen in several cities and districts, forcing the state government to shut industrial units grazing oxygen in large quantities.Now, private offices have been instructed to switch to remote working while government offices are allowed to work at 50% strength. Private offices in essential services, including banking, insurance, pharmaceuticals and those involved in water or power supply, have been allowed to operate as usual.“We are not touching the industrial sector as it directly linked with the financial health of the state. The industrial units, construction sites are allowed to operate, while the shooting of films and TV serials can go on by adhering to the Covid-19 protocol,” Nawab Malik, minority affairs minister, said after the cabinet meeting.The government has not reduced the timings of commuting in the local trains for the general public in Mumbai Metropolitan Region. The state expects the crowding to reduce as private offices, shops, establishments in non essential services are not allowed to operate.Similarly e-commerce sector has been allowed to operate with home delivery allowed between 7am and 8pm. The vaccination of the delivery boys has been made mandatory though the notification is silent how they will be vaccinated if they are below 45 years of age.Housing societies with more than 5 active patients will now be declared as mini containment zones, with no outsiders allowed to visit the premises, the statement issued by publicity department has stated.Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis supported the decisions. “We are going through a very scary stage of second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. The transmission of the virus is faster and proving fatal leading to rise in the mortality rate. We have appealed BJP workers and leaders to cooperate with the state authorities and actively participate in the vaccination drive. But at the same time, the state government should undertake awareness drive to apprise people with the fatality of the new strain,” he said.State health minister Rajesh Tope said that besides stepping up of the health care infrastructure, the state government is aiming at ramping up the vaccination drive. “After vaccinating 462,000 citizens on Saturday we are now aiming to increase the daily number to more than 6 lakh people per day by increasing vaccination centers and operating them 24X7. Our entire focus will be breaking the chain of transmission. Similarly, districts administrations have also been directed to increase the number of beds. To overcome the shortage of oxygen supply which we have been facing even after reserving 90% of the production for medical purposes, we have decided to shut down the industrial unit gazing oxygen in large quantity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-steps-up-restrictions-as-cases-continue-to-surge-101617562932554.html
05-04-2021||India||U’khand sounds alarm over forest fires, govt sends NDRF||Several new forest fires flared in the hills of Uttarakhand over the weekend, triggering alarm in the state as well as the central government, which has decided to rush teams of the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and deployed helicopters to airdrop water over what at present are 45 blazing clusters of woodlands spread over 68 acres. Unusually dry and warm weather has ignited one of the worst episodes of forest fires in Uttarakhand this year, claiming the lives of four people and numerous animals, in addition to damaging 1,359 hectares of land. Since January 1, 1,028 fires have been recorded with Pauri-Garhwal region hit the hardest.“I have spoken to Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat to get an update on forest fires in the state. Instructions have been issued to send helicopters and National Disaster Response Force teams to the state to minimise loss of lives and property due to the wildfires,” Shah said in a tweet. The NDRF team was likely to arrive by Monday.Rawat called an emergency meeting of senior officials of the forest and disaster management departments and all district magistrates to assess the situation and discuss ways to effectively control it, state government officials said.The worst affected districts also include Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Tehri. In Nainital, Oak forests, which typically have higher water content than Pine trees and are comparatively resistant to forest fires, are ablaze.Experts said the lack of rains this year has contributed to the problem of wildfires, which typically peak in the month of May. Man Singh, nodal officer for forest fires in the state forest department said that this year, there has been 65 % less rainfall while temperatures have been higher. “We are taking a lot of measures to contain the alarming situation. It seems that 2021 could be a repeat of 2016 when over 4,400 hectares of forest land was damaged in forest fires. We will make all possible efforts to reduce forest fires and seek the help of locals in this regard,” he said. Rohit Thapliyal, scientist at Indian Meteorological Centre, Dehradun, said this year, Uttarakhand reported below normal rainfall. “The rainfall was below normal by around 30% in January, by around 50 % in February and by around 70 % in March. Besides, on many days, the maximum daily temperature was above the normal in the state, creating dry conditions, a cause for forest fires,” he said. With over 71% of its total geographical area under forests, human habitation in Uttarakhand is often adjacent to heavily wooded areas, which increases the chances of forest fire. In Uttarakhand, 0.17% of total forest cover comes under the extremely fire-prone category, while 1.60% is very highly fire-prone, 9.32% highly fire-prone, 21.66% moderately fire-prone and 67.25% under what is known as the less fire-prone category. Wildfires are ignited in several ways: they can either by manmade or sparked by lightning, the friction from falling rocks and even from sparks caused by rocks dislodged by monkeys. Hemant Gauniya, who had filed RTI on forest fires in the state in the past, said despite spending money on fire control, large chunks of forests are hit every year. “Why have we not been able to come out with an effective mechanism to reduce these forest fires that damage so much of our biodiversity over the years”, he asked, questioning the efforts. Typically, a triad of factors is required for wildfires to rage: dry air, high temperature and fuel load. Fuel load refers to combustibles in the forest, which typically are the pine needles that blanket the forest floor this time of the year. Experts believe if one of the factors are removed from the equation, the problem may not be as severe. Since temperature and air can’t be controlled, the best strategy would be to manage the fuel load by removing pine needles, experts have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ukhand-sounds-alarm-over-forest-fires-govt-sends-ndrf-101617562631506.html
05-04-2021||India||Forces lured into a ‘U-shaped’ attack in Chhattisgarh||Maoists carried out a “U-type” ambush in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district after luring security personnel into a trap with the input of the possible presence of a top Maoist commander, officials familiar with the matter said on Sunday.Also Read | Up to 20 Maoists killed in gunbattle: OfficialsThe Maoist operation was led by commander of battalion number-1 Madvi Hidma — forces have been looking for him for years — who gathered at least 300 armed cadres in a fortnight and vacated the three villages that were the site of the gunfight, officials aware of the details of the encounter said, adding that Hidma was trying to lure the forces into the Terrem jungle area for 17 days.“The security personnel were caught unawares and were at a disadvantageous position. The Maoists planned a U-type ambush. At a particular area, there were hills on two sides and when Maoists started firing, the security forces tried to return. The Maoists encircled them,” said one of the officials quoted above.In a “U-shaped ambush”, there is only one escape route which is also the entry point, an official explained. The Jeeragaon village is surrounded with hills on three sides and as soon as the security forces entered the villages, the rebels started firing at them, forcing the security personnel to run further ahead, and thereby getting trapped in a U-shaped encounter, the officer said.Also Read | ‘He recently built a house...’: Kin of soldier who died in Chhattisgarh encounter“Hidma called over 300 armed cadres from different parts of Bastar and they gathered close to the encounter spot,” a police officer said on condition of anonymity.“His plan was to lure security forces but for 15 days the security forces did not reach the area. He was getting desperate because the arrangements of 350 people were costing a lot,” another official said.Director general of the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF), Kuldiep Singh, who is in Chhattisgarh to monitor the situation following the Maoist attack, however, said there was no intelligence or operational failure.“There is no point in saying that there was some kind of intelligence or operational failure. Had it been some intelligence failure, forces would have not gone for the operation. And if there was some operational failure, so many Naxals would have not been killed,” the CRPF DG told ANI.Following a specific input that Hidma was hiding in the area, the Chhattisgarh police decided to enter the forest as the elimination of the top commander would have been a major setback for the Maoist forces, officials said.On Friday, at around 11pm, nearly 1,700 security personnel from different camps in Bijapur and Sukma districts began a combing operation.The following morning, around 11.45am, a team of about 450 security personnel was returning to their camp through the Jonaguda , Jeeragaon and Tekalgudum villages when it was attacked, the officials said. The three villages were vacated by the Maoists prior to the attack.The Maoists ambushed the forces in the area, which is a stronghold of the rebels due to difficult terrain, large tracts of forests and a smaller number of security forces’ camps.A senior Chhattisgarh police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, said that the forces “underestimated the efficiency of the Maoists”. “We had information about the Maoist strength but somewhere there was lack of strategic planning. We have also underestimated the efficiency of Maoists. It seems that they had practised everything earlier in the terrains,” the officer said.A local intelligence officer said that the personnel tried to take refuge in the vacant huts in the villages. “But the Maoists tactically targeted the commanders of security forces who were leading the team,” the officer said, asking not to be named.Another senior police officer said: “The reason behind high casualty was that the field commanders of security forces were targeted by Maoists. Bullet injuries to CRPF CoBRA and District Reserve Guard (DRG) field commanders led to disarray in command and control,” said the official.One apparent reason for the attack was the Chhattisgarh police’s plan to set up a security camp in Silger village, near Terrem, another police officer said. The camp would have interrupted the Maoist corridor connecting Bijapur to Sukma and the rebels would have lost control over the core area, the officer said.The attack has come amid the annual tactical counteroffensive campaign, from March to July, during which rebels carry out maximum attacks against security forces and attempt to increase their cadre strength.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/forces-lured-into-a-u-shaped-attack-101617562571434.html
05-04-2021||India||Centre sends NDRF, choppers to douse raging forest fires in Uttarakhand||The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) on Sunday decided to deploy the National Disaster Relief Force (NDRF) and choppers to control Uttarakhand's raging forest fires. Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat has already directed the forest department to deploy all resources to control the fires which have wreaked havoc in six districts due to continuing dry conditions and hot weather.According to the forest department, since January 1, the state has reported 1,028 forest fire incidents in which 1,359 hectares of forest land has been damaged. Currently, over 45 forest fires are raging in hill districts, which have damaged over 68 acres of forest land in the past 24 hours. The worst-affected districts include Pauri, Almora, Nainital, Pithoragarh and Tehri. In Nainital, even Oak forests, which have high water content and are comparatively resistant to forest fires, have been caught in raging fires.This year till April 4, of 1,028 forest fire incidents, the maximum incidents of fires (254) have been reported in Pauri Garhwal, followed by 94 in Pithoragarh, 94 in Bageshwar, 91 in Nainital, 88 in Tehri, 71 in Uttarkashi and so on, data provided by the state forest department stated. Even plain districts like Haridwar and Uddam Singh (US) Nagar reported forest fires this year. Four people were killed in these fires this year, compared to one last year.The officials said that this year's alarming forest fires are a grim reminder of 2016 when over 4,400 hectares of forests were damaged in fires during the summer months.The official forest fire season starts in February and ends in June with the arrival of the monsoon.Given the alarming forest fire situation, CM Rawat convened an emergency meeting of the senior officials on Sunday through videoconferencing and directed them to reduce the response time to forest fires.Rawat also cancelled the leaves of all forest officials and directed the forest watchers to keep a tab on fire incidents. He directed officials to seek the help of van (forest) panchayats and local people in checking forest fires. He also ordered officials to chalk out a long-term plan to reduce forest fire incidents to a minimum and set up fire control rooms and fire stations at tehsil and block level.Rawat spoke to home minister Amit Shah regarding the situation in the state. Shah told Rawat about the two choppers being sent by the Centre. While one chopper will be stationed at Gochar and draw water from Srinagar, the other one will be stationed at Haldwani and will draw water from Bhimtal lake for dousing the fires.Also Read | 964 locations, 40 active spots: All you need to know about Uttarakhand forest fire“I spoke with Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat and sought information about the forest fires in the state. The Central government has given orders to deploy NDRF teams and provide helicopters to the Uttarakhand government to control the forest fires,” the home minister tweeted on Sunday.Man Singh, nodal officer for forest fires in the state forest department, said that this year there has been 65% less rainfall which, coupled with a rise in temperatures, led to a spike in forest fires. “We are taking many measures to contain the alarming situation. It seems that 2021 could be a repeat of 2016 when over 4,400 hectares of forest land was damaged in forest fires. We will make all possible efforts to reduce forest fires and seek the help of locals in this regard,” he said.Rohit Thapliyal, scientist at Indian Meteorological Centre Dehradun, said this year Uttarakhand reported below normal rainfall. “The rainfall was below normal by around 30% in January, by around 50% in February and by around 70% in March. Besides, on many days the maximum daily temperature was above normal in the state, creating dry conditions - a cause for forest fires,” he said.Why Uttarakhand reports so many forest firesUttarakhand has a rich forest area of over 38,000 sq km which constitutes 71% of the total geographical area of the state. More area under forests with neighbouring human habitations means more chances of forest fires. Given the diversity of forests in the state, Uttarakhand forests are prone to fires. About 0.17% of the total forest cover of the state comes under the extremely fire-prone category, 1.60% under very highly fire-prone, 9.32% under highly fire-prone, 21.66% under moderately fire-prone and 67.25% under less fire-prone category.Forest fire activity is generally reported from February to June, with a peak in fire incidence in May and June. Three types of forest fires are reported in the state including ground fires, surface fire and crown fires. Besides man-made, other reasons for forest fires in the state include lightning, friction of falling rocks and monkeys accidentally throwing stones that create sparks leading to forest fires.Over the years, many activists, experts and even courts have raised questions over the forests fires in the hill state. Last year, 172 hectares of jungles were affected by forest fires. The forest area affected due to fires in 2019 was 2,981 hectares. The corresponding figure was 4,480 hectares in 2018, 1,228 hectares in 2017, 4,433 hectares in 2016 and 701 hectares in 2015.Hemant Gauniya, who had filed an RTI on forest fires in the state in the past, said despite spending so much money on fire control, large chunks of forests get damaged every year. “Why have we not able to come out with an effective mechanism to reduce these forest fires that damage so much of our biodiversity?” he question.In May 2018, the Uttarakhand High Court, while taking suo moto cognisance of the forest fires in the state, directed the state government to submit the details of the forest fires, the kind of damage caused and what steps the government was taking to prevent them. The state government in its response informed the HC that 90% of the forest fires in the state were “man-made”. The HC remarked, “We were very shocked to hear the reply of the government. How is it possible when people have migrated from thousands of villages, they have a role in 90% of the forest fires in the state”.In June 2019, a public interest litigation (PIL) on forest fires in Uttarakhand, filed in the Supreme Court by a Tehri Garhwal-based advocate, highlighted that forest fires were wiping out entire species of birds, small insects and animals. It said that carbon dioxide emitted from the fires was causing temperature rise in the hills resulting in a faster meltdown of glaciers, besides causing pollution and ecological imbalance.The PIL sought urgent steps to be taken to protect/safeguard the forests, wildlife and birds from the forest fires in Uttarakhand and also ensure the right to a healthy environment.According to forest experts, for forest fire incidents to occur, a fire triangle of air, temperature and fuel load is needed. If even one of the factors from this triangle is removed, then fire cases will automatically drop. As temperature and air can’t be controlled, the best strategy is to manage the fuel load. When the fuel load (pine needles) from the forest floor is removed, cases of forest fires can be reduced.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-sends-ndrf-choppers-to-douse-raging-forest-fires-in-uttarakhand-101617561765179.html
05-04-2021||India||Need to strike a balance while imposing lockdown, says CSIR's Dr Mande||Lockdown helps in containing the spread of coronavirus, but affects the economy adversely and hence there is a need to strike a balance while imposing it, Director-General of the CSIR, Dr Shekhar Mande, said on Sunday.While speaking to reporters virtually, he also said that the L452R mutant of coronavirus that was detected in California in the USA, is causing concern in Maharashtra right now.Dr Mande said there is very little evidence that the vaccine would not work on the virus mutant and added that vaccination reduces the intensity of the disease."Lockdown will help in containing the spread as people stay indoors. Even if the virus spreads, it will only affect the family members and it will not spread outside. If you see the last year's lockdown in India, the spread of the disease was quite slow in the country as compared to other countries, including Italy which witnessed an explosion of Covid-19," he said.But in India, it did not happen because lockdown had been imposed in the country in March, the DG of the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research said."But there are side-effects of the lockdown as it affects the economy adversely which leads to job losses. So, we need to look for the balance while imposing lockdowns. Possibilities need to be seen whether full or partial lockdown can be imposed," he said.His remarks come on the day the Maharashtra government announced a weekend lockdown and a slew of restrictions in the state to curb the spread of the virus.Speaking about mutations of the virus, Dr Mande said, "L452R mutant of the virus detected in California, is causing concern in Maharashtra right now. At this moment, we can only hypothesise and as per the hypothesis. it is possible that some people might have carried this mutant from California to other destinations and that is spreading wildly."He added that as far as sequencing is concerned, a lot of samples have been sequenced from different districts of Maharashtra and many of them actually fell in the category of this L452R mutation and its other combinations are E484Q and E687.Dr Mande said that the Scientific Advisory Group of the Indian SARS CoV 2 Genomics Consortium (INSACOG) has completed more than 10,000 sequences till now."In Maharashtra, National Institute of Virology and National Centre of Cell Science are currently sequencing. To step up sequencing, we are also roping in National Chemical Laboratory in Pune," he said.He said that since it has been revealed that L452R is spreading in Maharashtra rapidly, the government has been asked to keep a close watch on those whose samples had this mutant."If today one person tests positive and it comes to light that the sample of the person has this particular mutant, then it is the responsibility of the authorities to inform the person and get him quarantined," he said."We are keeping a close watch on those who have this particular mutant in their samples," he added.He said that he and others from INSACOGare in constant touch with the Maharashtra government and members of the task force."We have already sent them a format on how to do the sampling (for sequencing) and it has been communicated to all the district administrations that how we have to do the sampling in every district," he added.Speaking about the vaccines and mutations of the virus, Dr Mande added that there is very little evidence that the vaccine would not work on the mutants."There are two divergent views that have emerged in the scientific literature in the last one or two months that some vaccines are less effective on mutants. But these views are challenged by others, who say that the vaccines are equally effective on mutants."So, the debate is on in the scientific world at this stage about the definite benefit of the vaccines that have been found. But one thing is sure that vaccination reduces the intensity of the disease," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-strike-a-balance-while-imposing-lockdown-says-csir-s-dr-mande-101617560738046.html
