The companies say they comply with all laws.A Reuters special report published in February revealed Amazon has for years given preferential treatment to a small group of sellers on its Indian platform and used them to circumvent the country's strict foreign investment regulations. Amazon has said it "does not give preferential treatment to any seller on its marketplace".The Smbhav event will include more than 70 speakers and aims to allow small businesses to learn how to grow their businesses in India - a key growth market for Amazon.The event "puts forth how Amazon and our partners leverage digitisation, technology & our ecosystem to drive infinite possibilities for a Digital India", its website said.In a statement, trader groups including the All India Mobile Retailers Association said the Amazon event was positioning it as a friend and guide to small sellers, but argued small traders had been harmed by discriminatory practices of foreign e-commerce firms.The latest dispute comes as India also considers revising foreign investment rules for e-commerce which could force companies like Amazon to rework the relationships it has with big sellers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asmbhav-enraged-traders-to-counter-amazon-s-smbhav-2021-101618420796066.html

He said their social network can help ensure an increase in the capacity of ambulances, ventilators and oxygen in hospitals. Along with spreading the message about vaccination and treatment, governors can also spread awareness about AYUSH-related remedies," an official statement said.Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, Union home minister Amit Shah and health minister Harsh Vardhan were present at the video interaction.With 1,84,372 new Covid-19 infections, India on Wednesday smashed all its past records of daily rises and proved the second wave of the pandemic more dangerous than the first wave.Reiterating what the Prime Minister has already told chief ministers in the previous meetings, PM Modi on Wednesday said the feeling of janbhagidari needs to be encouraged more and governors have a crucial role to play in it."Governors are an important pillar of janbhagidari in this battle and their coordination with state governments and guidance to the institutions of state will further strengthen the nation's resolve," he said adding that the Central government is committed to ensuring adequate availability of vaccines. He also mentioned how the Tika Utsav has expanded the inoculation drive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/engage-actively-pm-modi-s-message-to-governors-amid-highest-covid-19-spike-101618420925227.html

If you want development of the constituency, you have to think wisely and vote for the TRS,” KCR said, addressing a rally at Halia town, which is part of the Nagarjunasagar assembly constituency, headed for a by-poll on April 17. The by-election was needed with the death of sitting TRS legislator Nomula Narasimhaiah due to ill-health in January. He cautioned the people against getting carried away by the promises and false propaganda of the opposition parties. “You don’t have to vote going by even my promises. But I request you to judge the performance of the TRS government in the last six years,” he said. Recalling the struggle waged by the TRS to achieve statehood for the Telangana region, KCR said, Telangana was like an orphan before the formation of TRS. “The Congress leaders from Telangana were responsible for the sorry state of affairs in Telangana, when the state was part of combined Andhra Pradesh. Had they worked with commitment for the region, the TRS would not have been born,” he said. He lashed out at veteran Congress leader and former minister K Jana Reddy, who represented Nagarjunasagar constituency in the past and was contesting the elections again. “In his three-decades of experience as a legislator, he could not bring even a degree college to this constituency,” he criticised. The chief minister vowed to complete all the pending lift irrigation schemes, particularly the Nellikal Lift Irrigation Scheme, that would create irrigation facility for a major portion of Nagarjunasagar within the next one and a half year. He also promised to provide Godavari River water to irrigate the ayacut under Nagarjunasagar. He declared that he would not seek votes in the next elections without completing the lift irrigation schemes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/if-you-want-development-vote-for-trs-kcr-tells-voters-in-telangana-101618420612694.html

In 2020, the highest daily cases the capital recorded was around 9,000. Far from that mark, Delhi's situation on April 1 seemed under control. On April 1, there were 2,790 fresh infections.> On April 2, Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, in a press meet, said the situation was concerning but not as serious as it was before (in 2020).> From April 2 to April 14, daily cases increased without any dip and increased by a thousand every day. On April 2, there were 3,594 cases, which on April 4 breached the 4,000-mark and on April 6, crossed 5,000.> On April 11, the Capital recorded 10,774 fresh infections, crossing the 10,000-mark for the first time ever.> On April 12, there were over 11,000 cases.

During his almost 11-hour long questioning, Deshmukh refuted the charges and said those were an attempt to malign the image of the Maha Vikas Aghadi government of the state.The questioning began at around 10am at the defence research and development organisation (DRDO) guest house in Santacruz (East) where he was summoned by the CBI. At around 9.30pm, Deshmukh left the guest house.Deshmukh denied the allegations raised against him by Singh during questioning and told the officers that they were an attempt to malign the image of the state government, news agency PTI reported, quoting sources. It is not yet known whether he will be interrogated against tomorrow, the news agency reported.Deshmukh resigned from his position on April 5 after the Bombay high court directed CBI to probe into the allegations against him. The CBI has questioned Deshmukh’s two personal assistants (PAs) Sanjeev Palande, Kundan Shinde, former commissioner Param Bir Singh, deputy commissioner police Raju Bhujbal, assistant commissioner of police, Sanjay Patil, former assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze and his two drivers till now.Former top cop Singh and suspended police officer Sachin Waze alleged that Deshmukh had asked them to collect ₹100 crore per month from bars and restaurants, an allegation which the former minister has already denied.The allegations against Deshmukh were raised after after Waze was linked with the security breach near Antilia where an explosive-laden SUV was found on February 25. Waze is also an accused in the death of Mansukh Hiran, the businessman, who apparently owned the SUV. Waze is currently in judicial custody till April 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/anil-deshmukh-interrogated-for-8-hours-says-charges-aimed-at-maligning-uddhav-thackeray-govt-101618414827825.html

Kejriwal also said that a lockdown to curb the spread of the disease was not an option but warned of stricter restrictions.Earlier today, health minister Satyendar Jain said that the Covid-19 cases are rising very rapidly every single day and "there is no slow down" in the spread of the pandemic in the national capital.The minister, however, reiterated that lockdown was not a solution to the situation, and advised people to step out only if needed, avoid gatherings, wear masks and follow Covid-19-appropriate behaviour to combat the disease.The minister said the number of beds has been increased in various hospitals, while adding that the city government has again requested the Centre to scale up the number of beds in its hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-17-282-fresh-infections-delhi-records-highest-ever-covid-19-cases-101618413630800.html

14-04-2021||India||ISRO espionage case: SC to hear Centre's plea, report on Thursday||The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear on Thursday, the Centre’s plea seeking consideration of the report filed by a high-level committee regarding the role of erring police officials in the 1994 espionage case relating to ISRO scientist Nambi Narayanan who had been acquitted and was eventually awarded ₹50 lakh compensation by the top court.A bench headed by Justice A M Khanwilkar will consider the Centre's application and the report filed by the three-member panel, headed by former top court judge Justice (retd) D K Jain.On April 5, the Centre moved the top court seeking urgent hearing and consideration of the panel's report terming it as a “national issue”.The apex court had appointed the panel on September 14, 2018 while directing the Kerala government to cough up ₹50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo "immense humiliation".It had ordered setting up of the committee to take appropriate steps against the erring officials for causing "tremendous harassment" and "immeasurable anguish" to Narayanan and had directed the Centre and state government to nominate one officer each in the panel.Terming the police action against the ex-scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) as a "psycho-pathological treatment", the apex court had in September 2018 said that his "liberty and dignity", basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face "cynical abhorrence".The espionage case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India's space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women The scientist was arrested when the Congress was heading the government in Kerala.The three-member investigation panel submitted its report in a sealed cover to the apex court recently.The CBI, in its probe, had held that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan's illegal arrest.The case also had its political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then Chief Minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation.Over a period of almost two-and-a-half years, the panel headed by Justice Jain examined the circumstances leading to the arrest.The 79-year-old former scientist, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, had earlier said that the Kerala police had "fabricated" the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time.Narayanan had approached the apex court against a Kerala High Court judgement that said no action needed to be taken against former DGP Siby Mathews, who was then heading the SIT probe team, and two retired superintendents of police K K Joshua and S Vijayan, who were later held responsible by the CBI for the scientist's illegal arrest."There can be no scintilla of doubt that the appellant, a successful scientist having national reputation, has been compelled to undergo immense humiliation. The lackadaisical attitude of the state police to arrest anyone and put him in police custody has made the appellant to suffer the ignominy,” the apex court had said in its September 2018 order."The dignity of a person gets shocked when psycho-pathological treatment is meted out to him. A human being cries for justice when he feels that the insensible act has crucified his self-respect," the top court had said.It had accepted Narayanan's plea that the authorities, who were responsible for causing such a "harrowing effect" on his mind, should face "legal consequences".The CBI, while giving clean chit to the scientist, had said that Siby Mathews had left "the entire investigation to IB surrendering his duties" and ordered indiscriminate arrest of the scientist and others without adequate evidence being on record.The case had caught attention in October 1994, when Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan.Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with the then ISRO Deputy Director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/isro-espionage-case-sc-to-hear-centre-s-plea-report-on-thursday-101618410805497.html

Belagavi reported 107 new infections that took the active case count in the border district to 661.

14-04-2021||India||Maharashtra janta curfew: Will you require a movement pass? DGP answers||As Maharashtra is all set to embrace a lockdown-like situation for the coming fortnight till May 1, Maharashtra director-general of police Sanjay Pandey on Wednesday said unlike the lockdown of the last year, this time there will be no provision of movement passes. The state police has also been asked to not use force when citizens are following the guidelines. Movement restriction will be imposed with utmost restraint, the DGP said.Starting from Wednesday 8pm, only essential services will be allowed to function in the state, which will come under Section 144 or CrPC prohibiting the assembly of five or more people at one spot.Essential services, public transport, banking and financial services etc., will be allowed to function.This is the first time after the national lockdown of 2020 that a state is going under restrictions of this level.The coming back of restrictions in Maharashtra has met criticism as traders are opposing the government's decision to shut all shops, dealing with non-essential products and services, in the state, while public transport will remain available. Roadside eateries have been allowed to function only for takeaway services. Saloons, spas, schools, colleges, private coaching classes, beaches, clubs, swimming pools, gyms, drama theatres and cinema halls will remain close during the next 15 days. Shooting for films, television serials, advertisements will also remain halted during this period.The state government has also announced a financial package to cushion the impact of the second lockdown in the state.The curfew in the state comes after days of deliberations on whether restriction can be imposed at this point of time.

You should start preparing to save economy, migrant labourers and small-scale industry," Gandhi was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.He added that he was mocked and was seen as a "fear-mongerer"."Narendra Modi said beat thaali, corona will go. He said bang bells and thaalis. After that, he asked people to take out their mobile phones and switch on flashlights," Gandhi charged at PM Modi.Also read | ‘A tsunami is coming’: Rahul Gandhi warns Centre over coronavirus, economyGandhi said that rather than helping labourers, PM Modi asked them to ring bells.The former Congress chief has maintained that he warned Centre against Covid-19 but “they kept rubbishing it”. Gandhi said, as a result, “disaster followed”. When India had reported 126 infections in total in March last year, Gandhi had said that India should be preparing itself not just for the novel coronavirus but for the economic devastation, which he said is coming as he compared it to a tsunami.“The Indian economy is going to be devastated. You have no idea the painful thing the country has suffered and it is coming. It is like a tsunami is coming,” Rahul Gandhi had said while speaking to reporters.The Congress leader also termed BJP's claims to build "Sonar Bangla" (golden Bengal) as a "mirage" and said the saffron party has nothing to offer except for hatred, violence and dividing people on the basis of language, religion, caste and creed.Gandhi's remarks come in the wake of coronavirus crisis in India which has torpedoed the economy, forced governments to curb public movement by bringing in curfews and brought the daily life to a grinding halt across the country.Also read | ‘Disaster followed’: Rahul Gandhi says he kept warning Centre on Covid-19, economyIndia on Wednesday broke all its previous grim records of coronavirus cases and recorded close to 2 lakh fresh infections.

BJP leader and Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had then accused Gandhi of lobbying for pharma companies by asking for arbitrary approval for foreign vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-mocked-rahul-gandhi-on-warning-pm-modi-about-covid-19-crisis-in-2020-101618403544021.html

He also said that India would like to work in close cooperation with all countries.Shringla made these comments at a session, ‘Plurilateralism Inc: The future of global governance, at the ongoing Raisina Dialogue 2021 to a panel which had former Prime Minister of Sweden Carl Bildt and OECD Sherpa to the G20 and G7 summits Nicolaus Pinaud.“The Covid crisis has global dimensions, so cooperation is widely needed. The Saarc Summit initiated by PM Modi was a great example of regional cooperation, even if they did not meet eye to eye on political issues,” Shringla said while commenting on the impact of plurilateralism on global cooperation.Also read | India has walked the talk during pandemic: PM Modi at Raisina DialogueMentioning the Quad vaccine collaboration initiative, Shringla said, “More recently, the first Quad Summit announced a vaccine initiative, whereby vaccines manufactured in India, financed by the United States and Japan, would be supplied across the Indo-Pacific with Australian last-mile logistical support.”“The Quad, too, came up with a vaccine diplomacy initiative. India is a part of multiple groupings, including plurilateral, trilateral and so on. The aim is to use these to the maximum effect. As far as we are concerned, we would like to work in close cooperation with all,” Shringla was quoted by news agency ANI as saying.Earlier in the day, India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar, too, highlighted that the Covid-19 vaccine is one of the 10 areas of focus for the Quad. “On the Quad, we have focused on 10 areas -- vaccine collaboration, higher education, student mobility, climate action, emerging technology, resilient supply-chains, semiconductors, countering disinformation, counter-terrorism and maritime security,” he said.The foreign secretary also said that there is a need for reformed multilateralism and India’s multilateralism gives a voice to more countries. “India has come up with reformed multilateralism, granting a voice to more countries. It is not a rigid system where the status quo persists. Countries form effective mechanisms to find solutions to global problems and issues,” Shringla said.“There is a need for reformed multilateralism. Where it is convenient for India to engage, we will engage, be it in the multilateral or plurilateral format,” he further added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the sixth edition of the Raisina Dialogue, India’s premier conference on geopolitics and geoeconomics, on April 13 (Tuesday).

They want to replicate US Navy carrier battle groups but developing carrier air wing will take time,” Singh said, responding to a question on China deploying aircraft carriers. China currently operates two aircraft carriers --- CV-16 Liaoning and CV-17 Shandong. It is building a third carrier. The US believes that the Chinese footprint in the IOR will grow in the coming years. China is building a third aircraft carrier with a flat deck and its navy will be operating in the Indian Ocean in the coming years, said Admiral Phil Davidson, commander of the US Indo-Pacific Command. India is keeping tabs on China’s aggressive moves in the South China Sea and taking steps to ensure that the Chinese navy doesn’t muscle its way into the Indian Ocean where combat-ready Indian warships are carrying out round-the-clock surveillance for any unusual activity. The Chinese are undoubtedly in the IOR already, said maritime affairs expert Rear Admiral Sudarshan Shrikhande (retd). “They have come here (IOR) to stay, play and have a say. Through sustained and overlapping deployments, potentially more bases and partners; China’s multi- dimensional military power with sea power in the lead is something to think about carefully,” Shrikhande said. Aggressive Chinese naval actions and asymmetric activities undermine the rules- based order and constitute a major challenge, Davidson said. “The Indo-Pacific region is in competition between a closed and authoritarian Beijing vision and the idea of a free and open Indo-Pacific,” the US commander said. Davidson said China sought to exploit the current pandemic with increased military aggression throughout the Indo-Pacific and its intent was to undermine international law and norms.From carrying out naval drills with like-minded countries to reaching out to states in the IOR, the Indian Navy is focusing on checking China’s rising ambitions in the region and sending out a strong message that Beijing’s power play in South China Sea cannot be replicated in the Indian Ocean. The navies of India and the US recently concluded multilateral drills in the eastern IOR. France along with the Quad navies of India, the US, Japan and Australia carried out complex maritime drills to enhance interoperability among their navies from April 5 to April 7. Singh said the Quad started as a consultative grouping and has evolved and grown organically. He said India has a high degree of engagement and interoperability with the navies of the Quad countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/flag-follows-trade-navy-chief-on-china-operating-in-indian-ocean-101618406205791.html

The development comes amid an acute shortage of the drug in the wake of the increased number of Covid-19 cases in the country. At present, there is no uniform price of Remdesivir, as it ranges between ₹900 and ₹5,000 per vial.The demand for Remdesivir has gone up in the past week with a sharp increase in the number of infections. The minister said the government has given an approval for seven additional sites with a production capacity of 10 lakh vials per month. This will add to the present capacity of producing 38.80 lakh vials per month. As another 30 lakh vial per month production is lined up, the present capacity will soon be doubled to 78 lakh vials per month.On April 11, the government banned the export of Remdesivir and about 4 lakh vials were immediately diverted for domestic requirement."The current spike in Covid-19 cases has led to a higher demand of Remdesivir. We are currently producing Remdesivir at three of our facilities. To cater to the demand we have ramped up our production from the earlier 5-6 lakh vials a month to 10-12 lakh vials a month, which we will scale towards 20 lakh vials a month.” a Zydus Cadila spokesperson told PTI.Dr Reddy's too said it has slashed the price by 50 per cent to make it accessible to all.Apart from the export ban and ramping up the production, the government on Tuesday ordered that Remsesivir should not be used indiscriminately by patients who are being treated at home, and whose condition is not serious. Only those who are on oxygen support should take Remdesivir.The government has also asked Remdesivir manufacturers to display on their website the details of their stockists/distributors. Several blackmarketing rackets of Remdesivir have been busted in the past few days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remdesivir-will-cost-less-than-rs-3-500-assures-minister-amid-increased-demand-101618404655769.html

On Wednesday, the nation also recorded 1,027 deaths taking the death toll to 172,085.Arora pointed out that mass agitations and religious events need to be curbed. Terming the ongoing farmer’s agitation unfortunate, he said that fear in people’s minds regarding the pandemic has disappeared. “Non-essential things need to be halted. Religious, cultural and political events including the farmers' agitation are being held which is unfortunate. It is necessary to curb these. One of the primary reasons behind the spread is that the fear of Covid-19 among people has disappeared,” NK Arora was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Arora also said that imposition of lockdown at micro-levels is necessary to strengthen the health facilities in order to cope with rising cases. “We need to focus on how the virus is spreading big cities as well as Tier II and III cities as well. When we impose lockdown at a micro-level we also should strengthen our facilities and extend the lockdown if facilities are collapsing,” he further added.Arora highlighted that there is no need for a national lockdown but there is a need for a reduction of contact between people. He further added that lockdowns can be restricted to small areas. “We need to impose lockdown measures in a selective region like a part of a district. We have experienced a lockdown and since daily cases are touching almost 2 lakhs per day we need to bank on the experience of our past,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/national-lockdown-not-needed-but-nk-arora-on-containing-covid19-101618404464858.html

The single bench then had held under no circumstances, a Muslim marriage can be dissolved at the instance of the wife, except in accordance with the provisions of the Act. In its judgment, the division bench of Justices A Muhamed Mustaque and C S Dias analysed four major forms of dissolution of marriages as recognised under Islamic Law and protected under the Shariat Act at the instance of the wife.This includes Talaq-e-tafwiz, Khula, Mubara'at and Faskh."On an overall analysis of the scheme of the Shariat Act as well as the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act as above, we are of the considered view that the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act restrict Muslim women to annul their marriage invoking Faskh except through the intervention of the Court.""All other forms of extra-judicial divorce as referred in Section 2 of the Shariat Act are thus available to a Muslim women. We, therefore, hold that the law declared in K C Moyin's case (supra) is not good law," the court said in its judgment on April 9.While Talaq-e-tafwiz allows the wife to dissolve the marriage if her husband fails to keep his end of the marriage contract, - Khula allows her to unilaterally divorce her husband by returning his dower.Mubara'at deals with dissolution by mutual consent while Faskh allows dissolution with the intervention of a third person such as a qazi.On the jurisdiction of family court in matters related to extra-judicial divorce, the division bench noted that Explanation (b) of Section 7(1) of the Family Courts Act, confers the family court with the jurisdiction to declare the matrimonial status of any person. It said there is no difficulty for the family court to endorse an extra-judicial divorce to declare the matrimonial status of a person.The division bench said in the matter of talaq, khula, mubara'at, talaq-e-tafwiz, the family courts shall entertain such applications moved by either of the parties or both parties to declare the marital status of such parties.It said in the matter of unilateral dissolution of marriage, invoking khula and talaq, the scope of inquiry before the family courts is limited."In such proceedings, the court shall record the khula or talaq to declare the marital status of the parties after due notice to other parties. If any person wants to contest the effectiveness of khula or talaq, it is open for such aggrieved persons to contest the same in appropriate manner known under law," it said.The court said in the matter of mubara'at and talaq-e-tafwiz, on being satisfied that the dissolution is being effected on mutual consent, the family court without further inquiry shall declare the marital status."We notice family courts are overburdened with a large number of cases. The family court therefore, shall restrain from adjudicating upon such extra-judicial divorce unless it is called upon to decide its validity in appropriate manner.""The family court in such matters shall endeavour to dispose of the cases treating it as uncontested matter, without any delay by passing a formal order declaring the marital status," the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-women-have-right-to-invoke-extra-judical-divorce-rules-kerala-hc-as-it-overturns-1972-judgment-101618404114394.html

Police have so far arrested nine persons in 24 cases registered across the state.“No one can take law in their hands. Violence cannot continue in a civilized society. I have directed the police to take action and arrest the culprits involved in violence without consideration of their political affiliations. I appeal to people to maintain peace and tranquility,” Deb told reporters over the phone from his residence, where he has been isolated since April 9 after testing Covid-19 positive. Over two dozen incidents of violence reported in the last four days from three districts. State police have registered FIRs in 24 cases so far. After the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC) poll results were declared on April 10, prohibitory orders were issued in Mohanpur and Jirania of West District, Tulashikhar RD block, Padmabil RD block, Uttar Maharani, Laksha Chandra Para and Duski areas in Khowai district and entire area of Gomati district following reports of violence. A special team of Tripura State Rifles (TSR) and Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) personnel was formed on the day of the results to maintain law and order. Pradyot Kishore Debbarma’s TIPRA Motha party swept the council polls by winning 18 of the 28 TTAADC seats. BJP won 9 seats and one seat was won by an independent candidate. The Communist Party of India (Marxist) or CPM, which ruled the council for three straight terms, returned a blank. The remaining two seats in the 30-member council will be nominated by the governor. Right after winning the polls, Pradyot Kishore suspended victory rallies and urged his supporters to maintain peace. BJP spokesperson Nabendu Bhattacharya accused TIPRA Motha of attacking saffron activists, ransacking their offices, forcing party workers to seek shelter somewhere else. “At least 25 cases related to post-poll violence were lodged in different police stations of the state. Of the total, 23 are against TIPRA Motha, one against CPM and one against the BJP,” said Bhattacharya. Police said that they were probing 24 post-poll violence-related cases and nine people had been arrested so far. “Most of the cases were lodged against TIPRA Motha. We have arrested nine people including seven prime accused persons,” said assistant inspector general of police (IGP) Subrata Chakraborty.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-9-held-in-24-post-poll-violence-cases-cm-calls-for-sparing-none-101618404106877.html

It is the job of states to provide vaccine doses at the vaccination centres in a time-bound manner with meticulous planning," Harsh Vardhan said, reported news agency ANI.In the last few days, several states have reached out to the Centre for assistance as many claimed that their stocks will not last for long. Responding to the requests and concerns, the Union health minister previously said the country has enough doses and urged state governments to put an end to “fear-mongering”.The list of states which have flagged the shortage and sought re-stocking from the Centre includes Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh, Punjab, Delhi, Rajasthan, Jharkhand, Uttarakhand and Assam.While Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Odisha, Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand complained that they are facing a shortage of vaccines last week, reports emerged from several other states that vaccine centres were shutting early or turning people away due to supplies running out.The reports of shortage come amid mass Covid-19 vaccination drive ‘Tika Utsav’ launch by Prime Minister Narendra Modi which began on Sunday across the country.Officials said that in places such as Nainital and Tehri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, Rajsamand and Pratapgarh in Rajasthan, Sitara and Panvel in Maharashtra and Morena in Madhya Pradesh, the drive had to be stopped midway as centres ran out of stock.Also read: 10 states face severe Covid-19 vaccine shortage. Here's a listShortages were also reported from other places such Punjab, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar, forcing state governments to scale down their daily vaccination targets.The health minister said that the country is facing a shortage of key drug remdesivir in its fight against the virus but the manufacturers have been asked to amp up the production."The shortage of remdesivir happened because its production was reduced as Covid-19 cases were decreasing. Our drug controller and ministry held a meeting with stakeholders and asked manufacturers to strengthen the production," Harsh Vardhan was quoted as saying by ANI.On reports of black-marketing of the drug, the Union minister said action will be taken against those indulging in exploitation, black marketing and creating an artificial shortage of remdesivir."The Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) has directed for strict action into any complaint of black marketing of remdesivir. Those who are exploiting people and creating an artificial shortage of medicine, strict action should be taken against them," he said, reported ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-again-denies-vaccine-shortage-as-indian-states-stare-at-stock-crisis-101618399219452.html

I can say that after the elections are over, BJP will not even get 70 out of total of 294 seats", she said.The Trinamool Congress leader charged that the BJP was spreading falsehood by telling different things at different places on the same issue.Banerjee said home minister Amit Shah had said in Lebong in Darjeeling that there will be no NRC. However she pointed out that 14 lakh people have been identified and sent to detention camps based on a process to find illegal migrants under the National Register of Citizens.14 lakh people have been asked to go to the detention camps", she pointed out.Banerjee said if TMC is voted to power once again, it would not allow the controversial National Register of Citizens(NRC) to be implemented in West Bengal. All of you are citizens. My only request to people is that they cast their votes, she said.The Trinamool Congress leader claimed that BJP is bringing in people from other states where the pandemic was raging and this was helping spread Coronavirus. "These people will spread Covid in the state and then go away last year when Covid was in spate, none of the BJP leaders cared to the come to the state", she said.Banerjee also criticised the saffron party for its 'anti-people and anti-poor stance allowing prices of fuel including cooking gas to skyrocket.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/west-bengal-assembly-elections-mamata-banerjee-says-bjp-will-not-win-even-70-seats-101618396712228.html
14-04-2021||India||Ambedkar had proposed Sanskrit as official language: CJI Sharad Bobde||Chief Justice of India Sharad Bobde on Wednesday said B R Ambedkar had proposed Sanskrit as the "official national language" of India as he understood the political and social issues well and knew what the people wanted.The CJI also said the ancient Indian text "Nyayshastra" is "not a bit" inferior to Aristotle and the Persian system of logic, and "there is no reason why we should forsake, overlook, and not benefit from the geniuses of our ancestors".CJI Bobde was speaking at the inauguration of the academic building of the Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU) here in Maharashtra.Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackrey, Union minister and Nagpur MP Nitin Gadkari and others participated in this event virtually.Remembering B R Ambedkar on his 130th birth anniversary, the CJI said, "Today morning, I was in a fix about which language should I deliver this speech. Today is the birth anniversary of Dr Ambedkar which reminds me that the conflict between the language to be used while speaking and the language to be used during work is very old".He said the Supreme Court gets many representations on what should be the language of subordinate courts, but I feel this subject is not being looked into."But Dr Ambedkar had anticipated this aspect and he had mooted a proposal saying that the official language of the Union of India should be Sanskrit," the CJI said.The CJI said he cannot recall whether that proposal, which had signatures of some Maulvis, pandits, priests and Ambdekar, was tabled (in the constituent Assembly)."It was Ambedkar's opinion that since Tamil is not acceptable in north India it might be opposed there and likewise Hindi will be opposed in south India. But, there is less possibility of opposition to Sanskrit in north India or south India and hence he had mooted that proposal, but it did not succeed," CJI Bobde said.The chief justice of India said Ambedkar possessed knowledge of not only about the law but he also knew social and political issues very well."He knew what the people, the poor of the country wanted. He had full knowledge about all these aspects and I feel that is why he thought of putting up this proposal," the CJI said.He said the law school is a nursery of the legal profession."Law school is the nursery from which springs forth the harvest of our legal profession as well as judges. Dreams of many people have come true with the Maharashtra National Law University (MNLU)," the CJI said.He further said the MNLU intended to "impart a national outlook to students and faculty who are drawn from all over the country"."There is no regionalism and no narrow-mindedness and this distinguishes a national law university from any other kind," he said.CJI Bobde said two unique courses are taught at the MNLU including a course that will produce judges much on the lines of the National Defence Academy (NDA) which not only produces soldiers but officers, and the other course is on 'Nyayshastra'."The Indian judicial system was inherited from the British which uses logic and the origin of logic is Aristotle. But the 'Nyayshastra' which was developed in India is not the least bit inferior to Aristotle or the Persian system of logic."I see no reason why we should forsake, overlook and not benefit from the geniuses of our ancestors and that is how this course began which is unique," CJI Bobde said.The CJI is set to retire on April 23. He will be succeeded by Justice NV Ramana as his successor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ambedkar-had-proposed-sanskrit-as-official-language-cji-sharad-bobde-101618396287344.html

It is because of that strong belief that so many people have come here to take a dip in Ganga," Siddharth Chakrapani, a member of one of the Kumbh Mela organising committees, told AFP."They believe that Maa (mother) Ganga will save them from this pandemic."Of some 50,000 samples taken from people in Haridwar, 408 tested positive on Monday and 594 on Tuesday, the Uttarakhand state government said.The latest figures came as Yogi Adityanath, the chief minister of neighbouring state of Uttar Pradesh, tweeted on Wednesday that he had tested positive for Covid-19.India overtook Brazil this week to become the country with the second-highest number of Covid-19 cases in the world.The vast nation of 1.3 billion people on Wednesday reported more than 184,000 infections in the past 24 hours -- the biggest single-day rise since the start of the pandemic -- to take the total to almost 13.9 million cases.India's daily death toll passed 1,000 on Wednesday for the first time since mid-October.Local authorities have imposed night curfews and clamped down on movement and activities.In India's financial capital Mumbai, where the Maharashtra state government has imposed tougher lockdown measures, migrant workers at a train station said they were leaving for their homes in other states after the tighter restrictions were announced."Since I don't have any work, I am not able to pay my rent," migrant worker Imraan Khan told AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-1-000-test-positive-for-covid-19-at-india-s-religious-festival-kumbh-101618395394758.html

The curfew, which exempts essential services, will come into effect from 8 pm on Wednesday."We would continue to remain engaged with the central and the Maharashtra governments, in our efforts to mitigate the economic impact of the 15-day Jantata Curfew in the state."We have also urged the federal and states to reach out to the most vulnerable sections of the industry, particularly in the informal sectors, with the best possible relief," industry body Assocham said in a statement.Assocham said it has approached all the states and the Centre to provide liberal regulatory and financial forbearances for compliances.Fixed charges like electricity dues, lease rentals, licence fees and other levies should be waived, to help businesses maintain continuity, it suggested. Restaurants, hotels, small eateries should be given financial support for retaining the manpower, while the formal sectors of the economy should be engaged for regulatory forbearances, Assocham added.Sebi and other regulators should speed up clearances for those seeking to strengthen their balance sheets by fundraising from the financial markets, it added."With stringent restrictions not only by Maharashtra but several other states, the economic impact is imperative."Ironically, the outbreak of the second wave of the pandemic has come about when the economy was all set for a smart recovery.

We had managed to get hold of the Covid situation, they made it complicated," she said at the public meeting.Speaking on the Election Commission's decision to prohibit her from campaigning for 24 hours, she said, "Is it a fault to ask Hindus, Muslims and others to vote together? What about Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is mocking me at every election meeting? Why is he not banned from campaigning?" she asked.The Election Commission had barred Banerjee from campaigning for 24 hours from Monday 8 pm for her remarks against the central forces and a statement that had alleged religious overtones.Accusing the prime minister and Amit Shah of peddling lies at poll rallies, the TMC supremo said, "The Centre has kept the NRC and the NPR bills alive, but the home minister had claimed at a meeting at Lebong in the hills that he had no plans to enforce the National Register of Citizens.""Don't trust them. If they come to power, you may face the same experience like the 14 lakh Bengalis in Assam (referring to the final NRC in the northeastern state).

Stressing that India has the right to develop, and its poor have the right to grow, Javadekar said India will walk the talk on climate change as it has already been and raise its ambition based on national circumstances.Javadekar was speaking at a panel organised at the Embassy of France to mark the Official Visit to India of Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France, Jean-Yves Le Drian, to reinforce Indo-French strategic, cultural and economic ties.“You are aware that the objective of the Paris Agreement is to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius or even 1.5 degrees Celsius by the end of this period compared to pre-industrial levels. If we do not succeed in doing so, the consequences will be disastrous…That’s why it is absolutely indispensable that all countries increase their climate commitments by the time the COP26 [2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference] takes place in Glasgow, as required by the Paris Agreement,” Le Drian said in his address, underlining “This increase in ambition must include setting new nationally determined contributions by 2030 and also long-term strategies to achieve carbon neutrality. We must stop building new coal-based power plants and it is essential that we progressively stop this mode of electricity production at a global level.”Also Read | Russia has independent ties with India and Pakistan, say top Russian diplomatsUnited States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry also met Javadekar and Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week regarding increasing climate ambition ahead of COP26 in Glasgow this November.“Let me today give some context. Yes, we are suffering. We are seeing higher temperatures, unusual rain, hurricanes, frequency of such abnormal events has increased. But let us not forget that this is not a new phenomenon that has arisen in the past few decades. For 150 years this has been happening, because carbon emissions remain in the atmosphere for more than 150 years, so what we are suffering today was caused 150 years ago. The countries EU, US and in the last 30 to 40 years China, they emitted and therefore the world is suffering, India is suffering,” Javadekar said in his speech following Drian’s address.“In climate debate historic responsibility is a very important aspect. We cannot just forget and we will not allow anybody to forget it. The historical emissions responsibility today of is China 28%, USA 40%; Europe 10% and India is only 3%. We are not responsible for the climate change that is happening but India is a responsible nation. It will do the right thing to deal with climate change. Principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR, a principle under the Paris Agreement requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them.) is important. Yes, as we are facing a grave common threat we all will have to act but those who have polluted will have to act more,” Javadekar added.He said that the commitment of 100 billion dollars per year by 2020, which now adds up to 1.1 trillion dollars has not come through. “Where is the money? There is no money in sight. You have polluted, destroyed the world and brought climate change. And now you are saying don’t use coal. The alternative technology has to be much cheaper than coal only then people will do away with coal. India is not a major emitter. People say in sequence that we are the fourth largest emitter. How? Coal consumption of China is 4 billion tonnes this year. Ours is not even 1 billion tonne. How are we comparing apples with oranges?” he asked.Javadekar urged developed countries to deliver on finance commitments. “They should make technology at an affordable cost. Climate change is not a business. Fighting climate change is our duty. World has agreed to supply anti-AIDS drugs at a lower cost because AIDS is a disaster. We should not profit from a disaster…therefore, we will walk the talk, raise our ambition but not at the behest or pressure from other countries.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-won-t-raise-its-climate-ambition-at-the-behest-of-developed-nations-javadekar-101618390905298.html

The party has, over the years, alleged that the mainstream media is biased against the Opposition, and the YouTube channel will allow it to convey its message directly to the public.The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party already has a YouTube channel with 3.67 million followers. At the launch event at Congress headquarters, party spokesperson Randeep Surjewala said that INC TV will start airing shows from April 24 which marks the National Panchayati Raj Day, and would be live for at least 8 hours every day. Leader of Opposition in Rajya Sabha and All India Congress Committee general secretary Mallikarjun Kharge, NSUI president Neeraj Kundan and Mahila Congress president Sushmita Dev were also present at the launch.Also Read | Rahul Gandhi to begin Bengal campaign today, 3 days ahead of phase 5 votingSpeaking at the press conference, Kharge said that even Ambedkar believed that journalism had become a trade in India and it was the BJP that was proving him right today.He added that Dalits were suffering under BJP and every 11 minutes, there was an attack on a Dalit in India. “This truth of our country has been long concealed. Our nation has the right to hear the truth. Through INC TV, we aim to bring it out” Kharge added.The Congress has, over the years, been severely criticised for not upping its social media engagement with the young. In February, the party launched its ‘Join Congress Social media’ campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-launches-inc-tv-its-own-digital-media-platform-101618390485264.html

A notice of at least 15 days will be given to the students before the start of the examinations so that there is no inconvenience to the students, the minister said. In this case, the exams will not be conducted before June 15, the Centre has indicated.In a crucial decision taken at a meeting, attended by Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the education minister, the government on Wednesday cancelled CBSE class 10 exams 2021 and decided that the result of CBSE class 10 students will be prepared on the basis of an internal assessment which will be devised by the Board. If a candidate is not satisfied with that evaluation, they will be given an opportunity to sit in an exam, if and when exams are held.But for class 12 exams, the situation is trickier as admission to colleges outside India will be partially depending on that. Hence, the government has decided to review the situation once again on June 1, and the new dates will be announced 15 days after the government decides to go ahead with the exams.The situation will be reviewed on 1st June 2021 by the Board, and details will be shared subsequently. A notice of at least 15 days will be given before the start of the examinations.As fresh Covid-19 infections are on the rise, several states are either postponing or cancelling their state board exams. The impact of the second wave of the pandemic is not uniform in the states, but since CBSE is an all-India Board exam, it has to be held simultaneously; the Board can't conduct exams in some states now and in others later.In February, the Central Board of Secondary Education announced the exam dates giving three months time to the students for preparation. The Board also kept the entire date sheet shorter this time — for 39 days. Two-shift exams were also planned.However, with the cases rising sharply, state chief ministers urged Prime Minister Narendra Modi to review the situation and find an alternative to conducting exams as that would put students' lives in danger.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbse-12th-board-exam-2021-when-will-new-dates-be-announced-101618389765862.html

Then you win’: Rahul Gandhi on nod to foreign vaccines||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi took a jibe at the Narendra Modi government on Wednesday for its decision to fast-track the approval of vaccines already authorised for use in the US, UK, EU, and Japan.Gandhi had earlier faced severe criticism from many Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders over the same issue, when he urged the Centre to fast-track the approval of vaccines made outside India.Reacting to the government’s move, Gandhi posted on Twitter, “First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.” India has been witnessing the highest surge of cases with 184,000 cases recorded in the last 24 hours.Earlier, Gandhi had written to PM Modi, criticising him for creating a “vaccine starvation” in the country by exporting to other countries. Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad had then accused Gandhi of lobbying for pharmaceutical companies by seeking “arbitrary approvals” for foreign vaccines.Meanwhile, the Congress has called for a meeting of its central working committee on April 17 to discuss the Covid-19 situation in the country.

He wrote to Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal requesting the cancellation of these exams. The CBSE board are scheduled to be held from May 4 onward.In the letter to Pokhriyal, Singh spoke about the prevailing situation related to the coronavirus infection and stressed, “It would only be appropriate that a decision is taken forthwith to postpone the Class 10 and 12 Board examinations”. He added that this step would also allow the Centre and states to prepare a more robust plan for conducting these exams once the situation normalises.The Punjab chief minister, while seeking the Union education minister’s early intervention into this matter, pointed out that it will be difficult to predict when the surge in infection will see a declining trend, according to a statement. Singh wrote that different states are on different levels of the second wave of the pandemic, with some likely to see a peak a little earlier compared to those where the surge started later.The chief minister also referred to the national Covid-19 figures and said, “The steady increase in Covid-19 cases in most states of the country has created a sense of great apprehension and anguish among the students and their parents alike regarding the board examinations for classes 10 and 12.”In Punjab itself, Singh said the Congress-led state government has been receiving requests from several quarters to postpone board exams for CBSE, ICSE as well as the state board.Singh’s request to the Centre comes a day after his Delhi counterpart Arvind Kejriwal requested the government to cancel board exams over fear that examination centres can turn into Covid-19 hotspots. Addressing a press briefing on Tuesday, Kejriwal said some alternate provisions could be implemented. “Children can be promoted this time based on either an online method or internal assessment.

The alleged kingpin of the gang, Firoz Alam, who allegedly instigated the mob, has since been arrested. Kumar was killed as his seven colleagues fled. The Bengal police allegedly did not accompany the raiding team despite several requests. They have rejected the claim saying the team was advised to wait since the local police were busy with the assembly elections.Singh, who met Kumar’s family in Bihar’s Purnia district along with his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) colleague and deputy chief minister Tarkishore Prasad, said the CBI probe will ensure justice. Prasad echoed Singh. “We will discuss the demand for a CBI probe raised by the family [of Ashwini Kumar]... with chief minister Nitish Kumar,” Prasad said. “If voted to power in Bengal, it would be easier for us to recommend...[the] CBI [probe] as...Bengal government’s recommendation is needed for [it]....”The BJP hopes to wrest power from the Trinamool Congress (TMC) in West Bengal after emerging as the second biggest party in the state in the 2019 national polls. The fifth of the eight-phase polling in the state will be held on Saturday before the results are declared on May 2.There was no immediate response from the TMC.Singh said Ashwini Kumar’s seven colleagues, who have been suspended over dereliction of duty pending a probe, will not be spared for abandoning him.Singh and Prasad said they assured Ashwini Kumar’s family of full assistance including funding of the education of his three children.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-minister-blames-mamata-for-patronising-goons-says-bjp-to-order-cbi-probe-into-officer-s-lynching-if-vote-to-power-in-bengal-101618381544169.html

14-04-2021||India||PM Modi discusses CBSE board exams with education minister, top officials||Prime Minister Narendra Modi is meeting education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal 'Nishank' and other top officials to discuss Central Board of Secondary Education(CBSE) board examinations scheduled for May and June this year, people familiar with the matter said on Wednesday.The meeting comes against the backdrop of vociferous demands from students to postpone the Class 10 and 12 exams slated to begin on May 4 due to the rapid spread of the coronavirus disease. Several opposition parties including the Congress and Arvind Kejriwal’s Aam Aadmi Party have also nudged the central government to defer the exams.In December, the CBSE had deferred the board examinations by a few months to May 2021, insisting that it might not be possible to push the dates any further since the delayed annual examination would have a bearing on college admission dates.But the second wave of the coronavirus infections could cast a shadow on this plan as the country recorded a single-day increase of 184,372 cases on Wednesday while the daily toll surged past 1,000 for the first time in over five months.The continuous surge in Covid-19 cases this week forced the Maharashtra government to postpone Class 10 and 12 exams to be held by the state's examination body. The exams were slated to begin this month.CBSE officials had earlier indicated that they too had an open mind on rescheduling the dates. A senior official told Hindustan Times earlier this week that many state boards had postponed their exams and the CBSE was discussing the situation with the Union ministries concerned. “(We)... will soon take a call if the exams need to be postponed or not,” the official said.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, who supported the demand from students to postpone the examinations, on Tuesday said the exam centres could turn into Covid-19 hot spots.“CBSE board exams are approaching. In Delhi, there are 600,000 students who are scheduled to appear for the examinations this year. In addition to that, there are 100,000 teachers who will be involved in conducting these exams,” the chief minister said at a digital news briefing.“Several countries which are witnessing a second wave have also cancelled such examinations. Several state governments in our country also have done the same in their respective state boards,” Kejriwal added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-to-discuss-cbse-board-exams-with-education-minister-top-officials-at-12-101618379310123.html

India's National Education Policy is futuristic and as per world standards."He further urged teachers to explore three questions while teaching students: "what they're capable of, what can they achieve with more support and what they want to do". "What students can achieve depends on inner strength. If institutional strength is provided too, they can accomplish what they aspire," he also said."We have to give opportunities to the youth according to their potential. Our efforts towards this is the only tribute to Baba Sahab Ambedkar," PM Modi also said addressing the virtual event.The event was hosted by Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University, Ahmedabad.

Alarmed over 23 people on its premises, including a 13-year-old girl from Surat, testing positive for Covid-19 recently, temple authorities may also restrict the visit of devotees from other states.Ajay Jena, administrator (development) of Shree Jagannath Temple administration, said 7 servitors and three of their family members, 8 workers engaged at the shoe-stand at the main gate of the temple, a security personnel of Jagannath Temple Police, and a gardener were among those who tested positive.The 13-year-old girl, whose antigen test report came positive, will undergo an RT-PCR test for further confirmation. “All the persons who have tested positive for Covid-19 have been asked to remain in home isolation for 10 days,” said Jena.Though the temple doors are closed for devotees on Sunday, temple authorities are mulling Saturday closure too.“We would take a decision on this on Thursday. Besides, we are going to demand negative RT-PCR report for people coming from other states before allowing them inside,” said an official.Also Read | Union minister proposes collection drive for beautification of Jagannath TempleMeanwhile, Odisha saw 2,267 new cases and a total positivity rate rising from 6.36 to 6.81 on Tuesday.

The new cases, detected from all 30 districts, is the highest single-day spike recorded in the state in the last five and half months.Former director of Bhubaneswar AIIMS, Dr. Ashok Mohapatra said if appropriate protocols are not followed, daily cases would rise beyond 10,000. “Though the fatality rate in the second wave of the virus pandemic is comparatively lower from the first phase, the rate of positivity is certainly higher...Right now, the surge is limited to a handful of states. Once the outbreak spreads to other states, the spike will be huge,” he said.Meanwhile, Ganjam district administration shut all religious institutions in the district for the next seven days, beginning April 14. Ganjam district collector Vijaya Amrita Kulange said apart from religious institutions, all public places, such as parks, play grounds, sea beach and lake, would be closed for till April 21 for sanitisation.

People also visit their local temples, light up diya at their home as they welcome a new year.This year, the festival is being celebrated amid a raging second wave of Covid-19, hence festivities have been curbed.Puthandu is widely celebrated in the Tamilian diaspora outside the country as well.On Tuesday, President Ram Nath Kovind took to Twitter to extend his wishes on the occasion. "On the auspicious occasion of Puthandu Pirappu, Rongali Bihu, Naba Barsha and Vaisakhadi, I extend my heartiest congratulations and best wishes to all Indians living in India and abroad,” he wrote on Twitter.Prime Minister Narendra Modi also posted wishes on the micro-blogging site.

14-04-2021||India||CBI looking at not calling witnesses repeatedly to agency office for questioning||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) is working on a mechanism which will ensure that the witnesses associated with its investigations aren’t summoned repeatedly to the agency office(s) for questioning, people familiar with the development said.The move will help CBI avoid facing allegations of ‘unnecessary harassment’, they said.Witnesses and suspects are called repeatedly, sometimes for consecutive days and weeks, by the investigation officers to seek clarification on a particular case or new developments. Some cases wherein witnesses were called repeatedly include 2G spectrum scam, coal scam cases and other high-profile cases like AgustaWestland scandal, corruption probe against former union minister P Chidambaram, Punjab National Bank scam involving Nirav Modi and Mehul Choksi etc.Without naming the case, an officer cited above said an employee of a public sector bank was called for questioning at least two dozen times in 2018 in a bank fraud case.As part of the new strategy, which is a brainchild of the interim CBI director Praveen Sinha, the CBI will ask its investigating officers (IOs) to do their homework by studying the case thoroughly, collect relevant documentary evidence and analyse it in consultation with the law officers and branch heads before summoning any person, said the first officer cited above.Also Read | CBI to question Anil Deshmukh today over corruption allegationsThe IOs will have to prepare detailed questionnaire covering all aspects that need to be covered during interrogation/examination of a particular witness, and if required, send a questionnaire to the witness in advance as well, said another officer, who also didn’t want to be named.“Obviously, the witnesses can be called as and when there is new evidence in a case but at the beginning of the probe, we should avoid calling people every day to seek clarification on small issues. It should be covered during couple of rounds (of questioning). Calling a person again and again shows poor preparation by the IO and the concerned branch,” said the second officer.Such an exercise, third officer said, will not only help in removing contradictions in the testimony of same person during the trial but also help keep in check any effort by CBI officers to coerce people from giving statements to suit a narrative or extort them.A senior Indian Police Service (IPS) officer had proposed several years ago that CBI should video-record all the statements in every case but the plan never took off as it requires lot of resources and funding.“Video recording is done in certain testimonies but recording every statement is not feasible,” said the third officer.Former CBI joint director Neeraj Kumar said, “Be it CBI, Enforcement Directorate or any other investigation agency, this idea of calling people again and again for questioning should anyway be shunned. This mechanism is in order and there is no debate about it that IOs should do their work in advance before summoning anyone. It’s a welcome step by CBI interim chief”.Advocate Vijay Aggarwal, who is defending several accused in CBI cases including 2G scam, coal scam, former ICICI Bank CEO Chanda Kochhar and others, said - “It is a step in the right direction as in 2G case one of the reasons for acquittal was also delay in recording statement of witnesses as well as multiple statement of the same witnesses. In that case, before the arrest of (former telecom minister) A Raja, witnesses gave one statement, and after the arrest, the same witnesses took a contradictory stand”.“Multiple statements of the same witness give the defence a chance to point out contradictions. In the Akshardham temple attack case of Gujarat, Supreme Court ordered acquittal because of the delay in recording the statement of witnesses. Also, CBI manual 2005 contemplates concept of plan of investigation in Para 14.18. So, if you have a plan then such multiple statements and delay is not required. Though on a lighter note, it would make our (defence counsels’) job a little more difficult,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-not-to-call-witnesses-repeatedly-for-questioning-101618373744859.html

14-04-2021||India||Covid-19: The state of R in India||Every two people in India infected with the SARS-CoV-2 virus, on average, pass on the coronavirus (Covid-19) to at least three more people. This estimation is based on an epidemiological parameter known as the effective reproduction number, or R(t), which for India at the moment is estimated to be around 1.5-1.6.The effective R number takes into account factors relating to how the virus jumps from person to person (for instance, the basic infectivity of the virus, the probability of an actual infection during contact, and the duration of contagiousness.) How this number varies across states not only reflects how serious an outbreak may have become but it can also help predict emerging hot spots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-the-state-of-r-in-india-101618368862415.html

14-04-2021||India||On Ambedkar Jayanti, PM Modi bows to Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar, hails his struggle||On account of Ambedkar Jayanti, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Wednesday remembered Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and hailed his contributions in uplifting the backward sections of the society.“Bowing before Bharat Ratna Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on his birth anniversary. Their struggle to bring the deprived sections of society into the mainstream will continue to be an example for every generation. I bow to the great Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar on #AmbedkarJayanti,” PM Modi tweeted in Hindi.Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Indian Constitution, was born on April 14, 1891, in Madhya Pradesh’s Mhow. He was appointed as the chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee for the constitution of independent India on August 29, 1947, and after Independence, Ambedkar was appointed as the law minister of the country.On Tuesday, President Ram Nath Kovind urged citizens to imbibe Dr BR Ambedkar’s ideals in their lives and contribute towards building a strong and prosperous India. “All through his inspiring life, Dr. Ambedkar charted his unique path in the midst of extreme adversity and earned commendations for his extraordinary and multi-faceted achievements,” he said.Kovind hailed Ambedkar as an ardent advocate of human rights, who set up the ‘Bahishkrit Hitakarini Sabha’ with the aim of improving the socio-economic status of the people of deprived communities of India and for the spread of education amongst them. “Dr. Ambedkar envisioned a better and just society and fought for it throughout his life. He wanted to create a modern India where there would be no prejudice on the basis of caste or any other reason; where women and communities subjected to backwardness for centuries would enjoy equity of economic and social rights,” the President said, according to a statement released by his office.Later in the day, PM Modi will virtually address an event hosted by Ahmedabad’s Dr Babasaheb Ambedkar Open University. The Prime Minister will also release four books—Dr. Ambedkar Jivan Darshan, Dr. Ambedkar Vyakti Darshan, Dr Ambedkar Rashtra Darshan, and Dr. Ambedkar Aayam Darshan— based on Baba Saheb Bhimrao Ambedkar's life, written by Shri Kishor Makwana.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-ambedkar-jayanti-pm-modi-bows-to-dr-babasaheb-ambedkar-hails-his-struggle-101618367397313.html
14-04-2021||India||Vice President Venkaiah Naidu, PM Modi to interact with governors over Covid-19 surge||Vice President Venkaiah Naidu and Prime Minister Narendra Modi will on Wednesday interact with governors and Lieutenant governors of all states and union territories to review the Covid-19 situation in the country. This is the first meeting of this kind during the coronavirus disease pandemic and has been convened amid the Centre looking to push for stronger adherence to the pandemic protocols among citizens across the country.The meeting which comes amid the spurt in daily cases in India, is the first direct interaction between the governors and the Prime Minister. Before this, PM Modi has held a meeting with chief ministers of various states and UTs on April 8 over the resurgence of Covid-19 in the country and to discuss vaccination strategy.In the March 8 meeting, PM Modi asked the chief ministers to make the "maximum use" of the offices of governors, saying the move will send a positive message and help bring people from different walks of life together. "Under the leadership of the governor and under the guidance of the chief minister, all states should at least hold all-party meetings and firm up actionable points. This is my request that the governor and the chief ministers should together hold virtual webinars with all the elected representatives," said PM Modi during his virtual interaction with chief ministers."It should start with urban bodies and then rural bodies. The webinars should be with all the elected people. It will send a positive message that it should not be politicised and all of us have to do it together," he added.Last year, in March, President Ram Nath Kovind interacted with governors soon after the Covid-19 breakout in the country. He had asked governors to mobilise voluntary and religious organisations to aid the effort to contain the spread of coronavirus.Meanwhile, the Covid-19 caseload in the country climbed to 13,689,453 as the country continues to record cases in never seen before numbers. On Tuesday, 161,736 people found to be positive of Covid-19 in a span of 24 hours.In the wake of the Covid-19 surge, several states have brought back stringent restrictions in the states to check the spread. On Tuesday, Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered a partial lockdown in the state under which all non-essential activities has been curbed. He also ordered imposition of Section 144 which restricts the movement of people in groups.National capital Delhi is also under night curfew along with various other curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vice-president-venkaiah-naidu-pm-modi-to-interact-with-governors-over-covid-19-surge-101618365961142.html

We don't want to totally arrest the economy. The local level isolation of patients, or households which have people in quarantines are the methods through which the crisis will be handled, the second wave will be handled. There shall not be lockdown," she said.She also shared other measures taken by government including distribution of LED bulbs, ethanol blending programme under National Bio Fuel Policy, voluntary vehicle scrapping policy, incentivisation of electric vehicles to achieve green, resilient and inclusive development.Daily average cases across the country crossed 1.5 lakh last week. As per the latest health ministry data, 1,61,736 new coronavirus infections have been reported in a day pushing India's total caseload to 1,36,89,453, while the national Covid-19 recovery rate has dropped further to 89.51 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-not-going-for-lockdowns-in-big-way-nirmala-sitharaman-101618365441503.html
14-04-2021||India||'Tika Utsav' ends today, over 25 lakh doses administered on day 3||The four-day-long 'Tika Utsav', started on the suggestion of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will end on Wednesday. It was started on April 11 to speed up the nationwide vaccination drive and check a resurgent coronavirus disease (Covid-19).More than 25 lakh vaccine doses were administered on the third day of the 'Tika Utsav' on Tuesday, taking the cumulative number of vaccines given in the country so far to 11,10,33,925, the Union health ministry said. On Monday, the second day of the vaccination festival, more than 37 lakh Covid-19 doses were administered to eligible beneficiaries, the health ministry's data showed.On the first day of 'Tika Utsav', nearly 30 lakh vaccine doses were administered and the Covid Vaccination Centres (CVCs) also saw an increase of 18,800.PM Modi called 'Tika Utsav' the beginning of the second big war against the coronavirus pandemic and urged for maximum inoculations among eligible age groups.“We have to move towards optimum utilisation of the country’s vaccination capacity. This is a way to augment our capacity,” he said in a blog post addressed to the citizens.Inoculating as many people as possible is one of the effective ways to counter the spread of Covid-19, according to health experts and the government. On Tuesday, the Centre approved fast-tracking of approvals to vaccines which have already been cleared for emergency use by major health bodies in other countries.This step will give a boost to the ongoing vaccination drive by bringing in more vaccines to the country. Currently, Covaxin and Covishield are being used at different CVCs and India's drugs regulator has also given a nod to Russia's Sputnik V for emergency use.PM Modi, in his interaction with chief ministers last week over Covid-19 situation, proposed a four-day 'Tika Utsav' to ensure maximum participants in the vaccination drive. At present, those above 45 years of age are eligible to get the anti-Covid shot.The countrywide vaccination drive was rolled out on January 16 with healthcare workers (HCWs) getting inoculated and the vaccination of frontline workers (FLWs) started on February 2.The next phase of Covid-19 vaccination commenced on March 1 for those over 60 years of age and for people aged 45 and above with specified co-morbid conditions.India launched vaccination for all people aged more than 45 years from April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tika-utsav-ends-today-over-25-lakh-doses-administered-on-day-3-101618365167180.html
14-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Tuesday, April 13, may well mark an important milestone in India’s fight against the coronavirus disease.First, the country’s drugs regulator, Drugs Controller General of India, granted emergency use authorisation (EUA) to Sputnik V, the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, and which will be marketed in India by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories. This was expected, after the Subject Expert Committee of India’s Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation recommended the emergency use approval of the vaccine on Monday.Shortly after, the government announced that it has accepted a recommendation from the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (Negvac), to grant emergency use authorisation to vaccines that already have similar approvals from the US Food & Drug Administration, the UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, the EU’s European Medicines Agency, Japan’s Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency, or those listed for emergency use by the World health Organization.Sputnik V was approved in a hurry, with Russian President Vladimir Putin himself announcing the world’s first “registered” vaccine, and adding that his daughter was among those inoculated. At the time, there wasn’t enough data (there was some) to justify the approval, and the vaccine was eyed with distrust, not just by regulators in western nations, but also anyone who believed in science and data. Subsequent studies showed that the vaccine was hugely (92%) effective – not surprising, because the Russians do have a history of making effective vaccines.Dr Reddy’s applied for an emergency approval in India on the basis of the final data, but India insisted on a bridging study. The insistence seemed strange (although it is understandable because it is good scientific practice), when seen in the context of the approval of the locally made Covaxin, which was granted an unprecedented and never-heard-of-before emergency use authorisation “in clinical trial mode” by India’s drugs regulator on January 3. There was no way that those approving Covaxin could have known about its efficacy because there was no data at the time – not even interim. Efficacy is the most important criterion for a vaccine’s approval; a safe vaccine, which provokes an immune reaction (the first two are the result of safety and immunogenicity tests), but which isn’t effective, will achieve nothing. That Covaxin eventually proved to be as effective (81%) as the interim data showed was providential – and, also, at a personal level, deeply satisfying because Bharat Biotech, its developer, is a company this writer put on a “companies to watch for” list in a magazine in the early 2000s, and it is always a good feeling to be vindicated. Much like Sputnik V, Covaxin got a bad rap only because its approval was rushed through. As HT has reported, Russia’s sovereign wealth fund, which is managing the commercial aspects of Sputnik V, has already struck deals to make almost 700-800 million doses locally (it has struck deals with five Indian firms), with some of these becoming available in second and third quarters of 2021-22. These companies do not have to separately apply for approval. In addition, there’s the 100 million doses Dr Reddy’s will import and market.The decision to grant EUA to vaccines approved elsewhere – in the interests of safety, the government has mandated that the first 100 recipients of these in India will be tracked for a week before a wider roll-out – will immediately benefit Johnson & Johnson (its vaccine is approved by FDA, EMA, and WHO), Moderna (FDA, MHRA, EMA, and WHO), and Pfizer-BioNTech (FDA, MHRA, EMA, JPMA and WHO), although the last two will still face significant logistical issues given the very low temperatures at which their vaccines have to be stored and transported. It may also benefit Novavax, which has applied for approval of its vaccine to FDA, MHRA, and EMA. Serum Institute of India has a manufacturing deal with Novavax; the firm will start making its version of it later this year, and hopes to launch it by September. The launch has been delayed by the US government’s decision to restrict the export of raw material.Last week, Reuters reported that Johnson & Johnson would begin a bridging trial for its single-shot vaccine in India (it has an efficacy of 66.3% overall, but like the Moderna, Pfizer, and AstraZeneca vaccines, it offers 100% protection against severe infection and death). That trial will now not be required; Johnson & Johnson already has a manufacturing partnership with Biological E Ltd, a Hyderabad company that plans to make 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines (not all are J&J ones) by the end of next year.It’s still important for the government to work with Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech (the makers of the first two Covid-19 vaccines approved by India) on expanding their capacities – both sought aid last week – and it’s even more important for it to come up with a long-term vaccine strategy that covers everything from research to manufacturing to the government’s own sourcing requirements (and commitments) to pricing to post-vaccine tracking and monitoring. The first generation of Covid-19 vaccines was initially expected to give people protection from severe disease for a couple of years, but there is no data supporting this. A report last week in the New England Journal of Medicine, and a statement from Pfizer said that the Moderna and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines were still effective after six months. But no one is, as yet, clear how long this protection will last. What is clear is the need for a vaccine plan: people may need to take a vaccine every few years, or, at the least, take booster shots that can protect them from variants of the Sars-CoV-2 virus. Much depends on the virus itself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618363475603.html

14-04-2021||India||State Covid fatality rate lowest this month: Govt||Bengaluru Even as Karnataka recorded a 100% increase in the weekly number of deaths due to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) last week, government data suggests that the state’s Case Fatality Rate (CFR) this month was the lowest since the outbreak of the pandemic. CFR refers to the number of deaths reported per 100 cases. In April so far, Karnataka’s CFR is 0.45%. In comparison, in April 2020, the CFR in Karnataka was 4.09%. According to government data, between April 6 and April 12, as many as 284 patients died due to Covid-19 in the state, including 188 in Bengaluru. In comparison, between March 30 and April 5, the state reported 137 Covid-19 deaths, including 77 in Bengaluru.“There has been over a 100% increase in the number of deaths in the state over the last week and in Bengaluru, percentage (increase in Covid-19 deaths) is around 150%. What is even more worrying is that young people are also losing their lives. If you look at the number of deaths reported on April 11 (Sunday), there are 33-year-old and two 38-year-olds. This is a matter of concern,” a member of the state’s Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) on Covid-19, said on the condition of anonymity.He added that the matter was taken up with state health minister K Sudhakar during a review meeting on Sunday. A senior Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) official, meanwhile, pointed out that a large number of patients died soon after getting hospitalised. Out of the 54 deaths reported on Monday in the state, 27 were those who died within 24 hours of getting admitted to the hospital. “This means that most of the cases are coming to the hospital after their situation get worse. In most cases, by the time a patient reached the hospital, there is very little that doctors can do. We have informed the authorities about the same,” the BBMP official said.People need to get tested quickly and not wait for symptoms to become worse, said experts. “The government has opened several fever clinics across the city and across the state. People should make use of them. We have asked the employees there to check all parameters of patients coming for a check-up and admit those who require insensitive treatment,” Sudhakar told HT on Tuesday.He added that the government will focus on accelerating the vaccination drive in the state. “We have already launched awareness campaigns to get more people vaccinate themselves. At the same time, we are aware of the increasing cases in the state, and we have ensured that 50% of beds in hospitals are made available for Covid-19,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/state-covid-fatality-rate-lowest-this-month-govt-101618340862785.html
14-04-2021||India||VK Paul recommends chyawanprash, ayurveda; experts criticise remarks||A senior government official at the forefront of India’s Covid response recommended that people consult ayurveda practitioners if they have mild or asymptomatic Covid-19 and consume chyawanprash and kadha (a brew of herbs and spices) to improve their immunity, triggering criticism from doctors who said such ideas could encourage people to try untested therapies and wait too long to seek medical help.The comments were made on Tuesday by Niti Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul at the government’s weekly briefing on Covid-19, when he appealed for people to adhere to appropriate practices in order to help contain what is at present the worst outbreak the country has witnessed so far. “If you get Covid-19, consult ayurveda practitioners for treatment if symptoms are mild or asymptomatic. Take what they give after proper consultation to fight the disease. It is a treatment modality in itself so this also needs to be adopted.”“To boost immunity to deal with this pandemic, there are guidelines from the government that include adopting ayurveda and Ayush (Ayurveda, Yoga & Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homoeopathy) products. Specific recommendations tell us to consume chyawanprash twice a day; have turmeric milk at least once in a day; it is extremely popular among masses we have found in our surveys; and a warm drink made from basil, cinnamon, and black pepper concoction should also be had, along with doing yoga to boost your immunity,” said Paul, who added that yoga also helps strengthen lung capacity for those suffering from long Covid.“These will help; in fact, these have helped... We request on behalf of the government, the health ministry to adopt these measures,” Paul added.Doctors criticised Paul’s remarks. “This obviously does not make any sense; they are fooling the nation. If you have Covid-19, take chyawanprash or drink kadha but not go to a hospital? Where do you think you will land up? If it will help boost immunity; what is the need to take the vaccine?” said Dr Rajan Sharma, ex-national president, Indian Medical Association.“After listening to this, many will be encouraged to sit at home, drinking kadha and haldi doodh, and by the time they reach hospital, it will be too late,” he said, while adding that ultimately, the deaths of such people are often blamed on treating doctors.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/paul-recommends-chyawanprash-ayurveda-experts-criticise-remarks-101618340743478.html
14-04-2021||India||Few hospital beds, delay in test results key challenges for Bengaluru||Around this time last year, Bengaluru, like other cities, was under a lockdown and the Covid-19 caseload was under better control as against the sharp spike it is witnessing in the ongoing second wave of infections this year, officials and medical practitioners have said. Since March, the IT capital has registered a spurt in cases and in April, it noted a record-breaking surge thrice in around a week’s time. The sudden spike in cases has added to the pressure on the requirement of hospital beds in a city that accounts for almost 70% of the cases in Karnataka, making it difficult for authorities to find solutions amid the second wave of the pandemic. From around 6,813 infections in February, the Covid tally in the state capital rose to 31,886 in March, according to data released by Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). What’s worse is that in just the first 12 days of April, Bengaluru recorded 50,636 cases indicating the rapid spread of the disease. Karnataka health commissioner K V Trilok Chandra, however, claimed that the government is better prepared to tackle the situation this time. “We are definitely better prepared than the last time,” he told HT.The city on Tuesday recorded 5,500 cases and 55 fatalitieswithin a span of 24 hours. According to the civic body, at present, there are around 3,750 beds in the city, of which over 70% are occupied. Additionally, there are 600 beds in Covid care centres (CCC) for asymptomatic persons who may not be able to isolate themselves well in their homes. “During its (Covid) peak last year (around September), we had around 11,000 beds and we are trying to have the same number this time around as well,” a senior BBMP official who did not wish to be named said. With the positivity rate going up to around 7% in Karnataka and Bengaluru, the numbers of people requiring hospitalisation has also increased, data released by the civic body showed. Data also showed that nearly 4,000 people have been shifted to hospitals and CCCs in the city while around 20 infected individuals are untraceable. The percentage of patients in hospitals and CCCs is as low as 8.72% in Bommanahalli zone and 15.26% in R R Nagar, indicating that an average 13% require some sort of medical assistance in the city. Dr Prasanna H M, president-elect of Private Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said the government has sought 50% of the beds from all private medical institutions. He also said that at present, a significant portion of the beds were occupied in private hospitals due to admission of both Covid and non-Covid persons and that the beds will be made available as and when they turn empty. The doctor also pegged that there are around 6,000 to 7,000 beds in private hospitals and other institutions and that half of these would be made available to the government. The PHANA president-elect also said that private hospitals are working on setting up a toll-free number to provide information to persons requiring hospitalisation and prevent them from moving from place to place in search of beds. The unavailability of hospital beds and spike in mortality rate, experts said, are the two reasons why the state should observe a lockdown. Karnataka has resisted a shutdown on the grounds that the government has made better preparations compared to last year and to prevent any impact on the economy. The B S Yediyurappa-led government has refused to impose any lockdown-like measures but conceded to announcing a 10-day night curfew from April 10 to 20 in seven districts, including Bengaluru, after a meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on April 8. “We have conducted 2.2 crore Covid tests out of which 85% are RT-PCR, he said. People should cooperate in controlling the pandemic. We have not said that lock down will be imposed. But we are appealing to the public not to make lock down inevitable,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health minister said on Monday. The district administration of Bengaluru aims to conduct around 100,000 tests per day to contain the surge. Besides this, the state government hopes that the ongoing vaccination drive across large apartment complexes and offices will reduce the number of persons requiring hospitalisation.However, increased testing has made it difficult for laboratories to collect samples from home, forcing people to physically visit medical facilities for the same. Besides, the sudden rush has made it difficult for authorities to provide results of Covid tests on time. According to officials, the average delivery of test results for RT-PCR now stood at around 48 hours in most places in the state capital. “Most of the districts are delivering within a day. There have been a few isolated instances where people have not provided their contact number correctly or were not reachable. Otherwise, in most places, the results are being delivered within a day,” Chandra clarified.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/few-hospital-beds-delay-in-test-results-key-challenges-for-bengaluru-101618340742334.html
14-04-2021||India||Mahakumbh: Uttarakhand braces for another Shahi Snan||Authorities in Haridwar said they were preparing for a massive surge of devotees for a “Shahi Snan” on Wednesday, which is likely to be one of the busiest days of the Mahakumbh, which has turned into major Covid outbreak concern as millions gather at the city’s ghats for a holy dip in the Ganga.The last such Shahi Snan on Monday was marked by widespread violation of Covid-appropriate behaviour with most people not wearing masks and bunching close together. The Kumbh administration expects a crowd of at least 2.5 million on Wednesday, and has claimed all required arrangements have been made.The Haridwar district police on Tuesday reported that it recorded only about 86,247 people who came with proper prior registration as required under Covid protocol, although the Mela administration said 3.1 million attended the event.“On Monday during the second Shahi Snan, about 31 lakh people took the holy bath at Ganga ghat amid all our arrangements in place. We are expecting a crowd of at least 25 lakh (2.5 million) on Wednesday for the third Shahi Snan which would be most significant day in the month long Mahakumbh,” said state director general of police Ashok Kumar.At least 184 people tested positive at the shahi snan on Monday.“During the shahi snan, the health staffers tested 30,685 people by taking random samples... during which 184 tested positive. We are taking the required action as per the Covid-19 protocol,” said Haridwar chief medical officer Dr SK Jha.On Tuesday, Uttarakhand recorded 1,925 new Covid-19 cases and 13 deaths, according to the HT dashboard. The state has, so far, recorded a total of 112,071 cases and 1,780 deaths.National vice president of Indian Medical Association (IMA) Dr DD Chowdhury, who had termed the congregation of three million people in Monday’s Shahi Snan as the “greatest disaster” for the country on curbing the pandemic, said: “In order to do that, the Mela administration should at least ensure that all are wearing masks.”Chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Tuesday said the government successfully organised a “safe and successful second shahi snan and will do same on Wednesday too”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mahakumbh-haridwar-braces-for-another-shahi-snan-101618340622249.html
14-04-2021||India||PM Modi’s meetings with dignitaries to be scaled down amid Covid spike||The government plans to scale down Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s meetings with visiting dignitaries in the wake of a surge in Covid-19 cases within the country and abroad, people familiar with developments said on Tuesday.This was cited as the reason for the cancellation of a meeting between the PM and visiting French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and his delegation on Tuesday, the people said on condition of anonymity.The development came close on the heels of foreign secretary Harsh Shringla’s periodic Covid-19 test producing an “inconclusive” result sometime after a meeting between the delegations led by external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Le Drian at Hyderabad House, the people said. Another test was conducted, and its outcome would be known by Wednesday, the people said.The foreign secretary has already received both doses of the vaccine and has tested negative in periodic tests conducted over the past few weeks, the people added. There was no word from the French side on whether there would be any change in Le Drian’s itinerary. The French minister participated in a meeting with adequate social distancing at the French embassy, and he is scheduled to travel to Bengaluru on Wednesday.There was also no word on whether the meeting between Le Drian and the prime minister would be re-scheduled.The spike in Covid-19 cases in several parts of the world has affected the travel schedules of ministers from several countries. More than a dozen foreign and defence ministers had been expected to participate in-person in this year’s Raisina Dialogue, the flagship event of the external affairs ministry, before it was recently declared a fully digital affair.Le Drian was one of the few ministers who went ahead with plans to visit India for the Dialogue and bilateral meetings.Australian foreign minister Marise Payne, who was to have participated in a trilateral meeting with Jaishankar and Le Drian on the margins of the Dialogue, called off her visit to New Delhi over the weekend as it would have entailed a lengthy quarantine on returning home.There is also no confirmation on whether Japanese foreign minister Yoshihide Suga will go ahead with a planned visit to India in late April or early May.The second wave of Covid-19 in India has crossed the previous highest surge and the upward trend of infections is a cause of concern, officials have said.The country recorded 185,287 new cases and 1,026 deaths on Tuesday according to the HT dashboard. It has so far seen 13,871,325 cases and 172,134 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modis-meetings-with-dignitaries-to-be-scaled-down-amid-covid-spike-101618340504074.html
14-04-2021||India||Government calls for rational remdesivir application||There is no shortage of remdesivir, a key antiviral drug used to treat Covid-19 patients, Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul said on Tuesday, even as he urged people to use the drug rationally.“There were reports of shortages in some states but overall there is no shortage of the drug. There are plenty of stocks available,” he added.“There is no question of using remdesvir in home settings for Covid-19 patients. The patient has to be on oxygen therapy, and the drug is supposed to be supplied only to hospitals and not to be sold in retail. I urge people for rational use of the drug. It is not meant for everyone,” said Paul, while addressing the Union health ministry’s weekly briefing on Covid-19.Remdesivir, an injection, continues to be used in India despite WHO recommending against its use, on the grounds that there is no evidence that it works.However, the drug continues to be on India’s National Clinical Management Protocol for Covid-19, and with active cases crossing a million, and hospitalisations soaring, many Indians have begun seeing the drug as a lifesaver, causing demand to spike. There is also believed to be black-marketing of the drug, several generic versions of which are being made in India, including one for less than ₹1,000.India has banned the export of remdesivir and its ingredients in an attempt to address the shortage — brought about, in part, by hoarding and indiscriminate use.Cipla, one of the local manufacturers of the drug said it was working with the regulatory authorities to restrict supply of the drug only to hospital channels, and especially those regions with high burden of severe Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-calls-for-rational-remdesivir-application-101618340383434.html
14-04-2021||India||Maharashtra: 15-day partial lockdown from today as Covid-19 cases rise||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on Tuesday announced a partial lockdown across the state for 15 days starting 8 pm on Wednesday that included an order under Section 144 restricting movement of people — a desperate attempt to slow the surge of the raging second wave of the coronavirus disease. On Tuesday, Maharashtra recorded 60,212 cases, 32% of India’s total of 185,287. It also saw 281 deaths.Thackeray, in an address on Tuesday evening, also announced a package of Rs.5,476 crore to help the marginalised, including daily wagers, rickshaw drivers, domestic helps, and construction workers. With the imposition of Section 144, people will not be able to travel far from home for non-essential activities. However, essential services have been exempted from the restrictions between 7 am and 8 pm.Thackeray avoided using the term lockdown, instead terming the measures a janta curfew, borrowing the term from Prime Minister Narendra Modi who used it to describe a day-long lockdown on March 22, two days before India went into a 68-day long lockdown.The impact of that lockdown — a 24.4% contraction in the economy in the first quarter which bore the brunt, and untold suffering for migrant workers left without food, shelter, and a safe way to return home — may have prevented Thackeray from announcing even a partial lockdown in the face of a second wave that has overwhelmed Maharashtra’s health infrastructure, even though experts have been calling for stronger restrictions for weeks.Thackeray admitted that rising cases have overloaded the state’s health infrastructure.He added, “We had two laboratories, now it has gone to 523 but the load on them has increased. We used to test around 85,000 samples, now it has gone to 250,000 [daily]. The last time we had 2,665 Covid Care Centres, which has been increased to nearly 4000. All types of hospital beds, including isolation, oxygenated, ICU, etc, have increased from 325,000 to 350,000. But now these facilities are overloaded.”The CM said that the health infrastructure is being further enhanced.Unlike last year’s hard lockdown, the next 15 days will see many establishments remaining open and many activities continuing. For instance, all public transport will continue to ply, and pre-monsoon work (important, especially in Mumbai ) will continue. And, much like the first lockdown, vegetable and grocery shops will remain open.However, shopping centres, beaches and malls will be shut. Home delivery and take away will be allowed. Theatres, auditoriums, amusement parks, water parks, gymnasiums, swimming pools, clubs, and places of worship will also remain closed, as will, barber shops, spas, beauty parlours and salons. Shopkeepers and others in essential services will be fined if they do not follow Covid rules.Public transport, too, will operate with some restrictions. Autos will be allowed to have two passengers only excluding the driver, taxis will be allowed to operate with 50% of vehicle capacity, while public buses will not be allowed to ferry any standees. E-commerce will be allowed for the delivery of essential goods and services. Milk and newspapers will be allowed to be delivered at home.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maha-15-day-partial-lockdown-from-today-as-covid-cases-rise-101618340262196.html

PM Modi is among those invited.“We actually entered into a partnership there, where we will assist, along with other nations, to help bring finance — and when I say finance, I’m not talking about taxpayer dollar, I’m talking about the private sector investing in this deployment — which will require some changes by India (in) certain parts of what it does,” Kerry said in an interview to CNN Tuesday when asked if he got any commitments from India during the visit.The investment will be “a huge amount”, he said, which “would allow India to keep track with 1.5 degrees centigrade limitation on the increase of the Earth’s temperature”.Kerry did not specify which countries are likely to join the US and India and what will be that “huge amount”. Crucially, he also did not specify the changes that India will be required to make in its mitigation efforts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-vows-to-help-bring-investment-to-assist-india-s-mitigation-efforts-101618339962173.html
14-04-2021||India||Apex court warns HCs over granting ‘blanket orders’ against arrests||The Supreme Court on Tuesday cautioned the high courts against granting “blanket orders” staying investigations or preventing arrests in criminal cases, underscoring such orders affect the right of the police to probe under the law.Laying down a set of 18 parameters, the bench, headed by justice Dhananjay Y Chandrachud, held that orders of “no coercive step” against accused, or staying arrests, could not be issued “routinely, casually or mechanically”, without specifying extraordinary reasons and circumstances that necessitated such orders.The bench, which included justices MR Shah and Sanjiv Khanna, regretted that despite some judgments by the top court in the past, it was regularly coming across many orders by the high courts staying arrests or directing ‘no coercive steps against the accused’ without assigning any reasons.“Granting of such blanket order would not only adversely affect the investigation but would have far-reaching implications for maintaining the Rule of Law. Where the investigation is stayed for a long time, even if the stay is ultimately vacated, the subsequent investigation may not be very fruitful for the simple reason that the evidence may no longer be available,” stated the judgment, authored by justice Shah.The bench laid down the guidelines while setting aside the September 2020 order of the Bombay high court, protecting a director of a real-estate development company and his business partners in a case of cheating and forgery against them. The accused had moved a writ petition before the high court, which passed the interim order of ‘no coercive measures’ in their favour while adjourning the matter to a future date.The complainant company, Neeharika Infrastructure Pvt Ltd, challenged the interim order in the top court. The bench said that such orders were “not justified at all”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-warns-hcs-over-granting-blanket-orders-against-arrests-101618339903272.html
14-04-2021||India||Kashi Vishwanath-Gyanvapi mosque case: Sunni board moves HC over trial court order||The Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board (UPSCWB) on Tuesday approached the Allahabad high court seeking temporary suspension of a Varanasi local court verdict that ordered an archaeological survey of the Gyanvapi mosque to determine if it was built after demolishing a Hindu shrine.The move came a day after the management committee of the 17th-century mosque, which abuts the Kashi Vishwanath Temple, also filed an urgent petition in the high court against the Varanasi court order.The religious dispute – similar to the one in Ayodhya – is decades old and first reached the courts in 1991, when local Hindu priests sought permission to worship in the mosque area. In 1998 the matter reached the Allahabad HC, which on March 15 this year reserved its judgment on various pleas challenging the maintainability of the 1991 suit.But on April 8, a Varanasi local court asked the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) to conduct a “comprehensive physical survey” of the mosque premises. The order came on a separate petition filed on December 2019 by Vijay Shankar Rastogi, who demanded the mosque area be surveyed to prove Mughal rulers demolished a part of the temple and illegally built a mosque.UPSCWB argued that the Varanasi court order was illegal because proceedings on the same matter were pending before the Allahabad HC.“The urgent application is filed seeking a stay on the lower court proceedings during pendency of petition in high court on maintainability of 1991 suit, while a separate revision petition will be filed in district court challenging the order of archaeological survey of the Masjid complex,” said UPSCWB counsel Puneet Kumar Gupta. “Since justice Prakash Padiya of the Allahabad HC reserved the judgment on March 15, 2021, how can the lower court hear the matter and pass the order?” he asked.On Monday, the Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, which runs the Gyanvapi mosque, filed an urgent petition before the high court , and said the trial court order was passed illegally and without jurisdiction.“The HC had reserved verdict on issue of maintainability of the suit. The court below should not have passed any order in the suit till the issue of maintainability of suit was decided by the high court,” said senior counsel SFA Naqvi, who appeared on behalf of the Masjid committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kashi-vishwanath-gyanvapi-mosque-case-sunni-board-moves-hc-over-trial-court-order-101618339842208.html
14-04-2021||India||Sputnik V vaccine gets DCGI nod for emergency use||The drugs controller general of India (DCGI), VG Somani, on Tuesday approved the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, Sputnik V, for emergency use in India, a day after the regulator’s subject expert committee (SEC) recommended that there was enough data to grant the vaccine emergency use authorisation.India is the 60th country to approve the vaccine.The vaccine will initially be imported and marketed by Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, a process that is expected to start within weeks. The first local supplies are expected by July. The imports, it is expected, will strengthen India’s supply pipeline.During the weekly Covid-19 briefing on Tuesday, Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, said the approval for Sputnik V was a significant step. “This vaccine approval has been a result of a collaborative effort between the two governments, and is a significant step,” he said.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said it was too early to comment on procurement, distribution and pricing. HT learns that Dr Reddy’s will start suppling imported Sputnik doses to the government by April-end.“We are looking at producing 50 million doses or more a month of Sputnik V by this summer, or end of summer, in India. India has a significant production capacity; we have already announced tie ups with five local companies for mass production of Sputnik V, and we intend to have several more tie-ups that will announce soon,” said Kirill Dmitriev, CEO, Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), Russia’s sovereign wealth fund that is marketing the vaccine globally.Dr Reddy’s, which is conducting clinical trials in India on behalf of the makers of Sputnik V and has the distribution right for the vaccine in India, released a statement on Tuesday stating that it has received the national regulator’s emergency use approval.“We are very pleased to obtain the emergency use authorisation for Sputnik V in India. With the rising cases in India, vaccination is the most effective tool in our battle against Covid-19. This will enable us to contribute to our nation’s effort of vaccinating a significant proportion of our population,” said GV Prasad, managing director and co-chairman, Dr Reddy’s.In September 2020, Dr Reddy’s partnered with RDIF to conduct the bridging trial of Sputnik V and distribute the vaccine in India. Sputnik V uses two different vectors for the two shots in a course of vaccination. The efficacy of Sputnik V was determined to be 91.6%, as per a published article in the Lancet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sputnik-v-vaccine-gets-dcgi-nod-for-emergency-use-101618339663524.html
14-04-2021||India||Medical infra stressed amid Covid surge||Prashant Kumar, a student of veterinary sciences in Ranchi, visited 10 hospitals in five hours on April 11 to find a bed for his 60-year-old uncle who is Covid-positive with severe symptoms. Unsuccessful, the 30-year-old finally took his uncle, a retired veterinary doctor, to Jamshedpur, around 125km away, where he was admitted to a private hospital. “My uncle’s condition was serious, so I booked an oxygen-supported ambulance. I started searching for a bed from 8.30pm. I visited several hospitals till 1.30am, but none could admit him,” Kumar said.Officials said all the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) beds in Ranchi’s two public-run hospitals are occupied, and only 24 are free in the 22 private Covid-designated hospitals. The district is also facing an acute shortage of oxygen-supported beds — only 89 of the 784 beds are free, while 73 out of the city’s 194 ventilators are available.Nearly 1,000 kilometres away, in Madhya Pradesh, Deepmala was unable to find a bed for her 48-year-old husband, an additional postmaster at a railway station in Chhindwara. Vikas Kumar began to feel breathless on Sunday, but couldn’t be admitted in Junardeo, the small town where they live. She rushed him to Bhopal, 273km away, only to be turned away by three private hospitals that cited 100% occupancy as the reason. Two days later, Kumar finally got admission in a government-run hospital. “For 48 hours, I went through trauma. My husband was feeling breathlessness and I was unable to help him,” Deepmala said.Across India, a surge in infections is driving huge numbers of patients to hospitals which is stretching the limits of health care infrastructure in several cities.Urban centres hitIf Maharashtra is driving India’s second wave, Pune, Mumbai, Thane and Nagpur are the four big urban centres driving Maharashtra’s daily caseload; in the first four days of April, they accounted for 59% of the state’s cases.In Pune district, where 10,019 new Covid cases were reported on Tuesday (driving the total up to 671,426 of which 118,168 are active cases), patients are being turned away due to bed shortage. Most major hospitals in Pune city have run out of ventilators and ICU beds; only 23 ICU beds with ventilators were free (out of 1,142 in the district), while 753 isolation beds with oxygen were free (out of 9,942). The demand for oxygen in the district has gone up by over 350% in the first four months of 2021 and, in all only 4,120 beds out of 23,156 were vacant on April 13 in Pune.The situation in Mumbai is only slightly better. As of April 13, as many as 15,451 beds were occupied out of the 19,329 Covid-19 beds under the BMC’s command (13,512 in public hospitals and 5,817 in private hospitals). The city has 89 ICU beds available (out of a total of 2,529) and 32 ventilators available (out of a total of 1,302).Thane and Nagpur fare no better, as patients are being discharged early to make space for other Covid-positive admissions. Sunil Madavi, 26, an attendant at a city cancer hospital, was admitted to the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMHC) in Nagpur last month but discharged within nine days. “After reaching home, he was disoriented, did not recognise family or friends and spoke incoherently. We got him admitted to a private hospital,” a colleague said.GMCH superintendent Dr Avinash Gawande said that the hospital had only 900 Covid-19 beds. “It’s really very difficult to accommodate everyone as hardly 18-20 patients get discharged as against 70-80 new admissions daily.”The situation in other cities is fast turning dire.A long queue of ambulances was seen on Monday night outside Ahmedabad’s Civil Hospital amid the deteriorating situation of COVID-19 in the state, news agency ANI reported. “Our occupancy right now is 90-95 per cent,” said JV Modi, Superintendent, Civil Hospital, adding that all patients were admitted.In Bengaluru, the case count shot up to 31,886 in March from around 6,813 daily infections in February. However, in just the first 12 days of April, Bengaluru has registered 50,636 cases (till Monday), indicating the rapid spread of the disease in India’s IT capital.There are currently around 3,750 beds in the city, of which over 70% are already occupied, officials said, adding to the pressure on existing infrastructure. Dr Prasanna HM of the Private Hospitals & Nursing Homes Association, Bengaluru said that the government has sought 50% of the bed strength from all private medical institutions.In Chandigarh, nearly half the 500 beds reserved for Covid patients is occupied, and in poll-bound Kolkata, nine out of the 45 private Covid hospitals are full, and taking no more admissions. Another 17 designated Covid hospitals have less than 10 beds left in them. In the state-run ID&BG Hospital, the nodal hospital for Covid-related cases, which has 14 ICU beds and 17 High Dependency Unit (HDU) beds reserved for Covid patients, there are no vacancies.“In Kolkata beds are fast running out and the occupancy rate is around 75% - 80%. We are augmenting our infrastructure,” a health department official said.In Bhopal, all 200 ventilators were in use as of Tuesday. Of the 1,202 ICU beds, 921 were occupied.In Thiruvananthapuram, district medical officer K S Shinu said that of the 141 ICU beds earmarked for Covid patients in government hospitals and first line treatment centres in the city, 55 were vacant. Among private hospitals, 494 of the 795 ICU beds were vacant.As many as 83 out of 112 beds were occupied at the Patna Medical College Hospital, on Tuesday. At AIIMS, 106 of the 115 beds were occupied, while only 12 of the 100 beds at the Nalanda Medical College Hospital were available.“I feel helpless when I have to refuse patients because of unavailability of beds. Yesterday, one patient brought to our facility died because we could not provide ICU bed as all 26 are occupied. We have a waitlist, which has now shot up to 18 as on Tuesday. We are admitting Covid-19 patients through the waitlist,” said Dr Satyajit Singh, director, Ruban hospital, an NABH-accredited hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/medical-infra-stressed-amid-covid-surge-101618339602373.html
14-04-2021||India||A tale of two visits and a shift in Indian foreign policy||Diplomatic visits, more often than not, are routine, more a function of bureaucratic necessities than of any real strategic significance. Most visits of foreign dignitaries to India or elsewhere hardly transform the underlying dynamic of the bilateral relationship. But sometimes, the tone and tenor of the engagement manages to convey more than either side perhaps intends to, thereby hinting at a fundamental transformation.Last week India hosted two important visitors – Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, and the United States (US) special presidential envoy for climate John Kerry. They did not come to sign any major documents or make dramatic declarations. These were routine visits, one to lay the groundwork for a potential Russian presidential visit to India and the other to assess Indian intentions on climate. But these short visits revealed much more about the state of play in India-Russia and India-US ties than any formal policy document.While Lavrov asserted that India and Russia “are tied through a strategic partnership and at the heart of our partnership is the long-lived friendship between our nations and proximity of our stance on relevant international issues and our friendship,” it was evident that the partnership is drifting away from its strategic orientation.Differences have mounted, as the prism of the two nations to view the changing world order are substantively different. For a partnership that claims to be historical, Russia’s decision to speak on behalf of China on matters from the Indo-Pacific to the Quad underscores for India a sad reality of a partner that is in terminal decline requiring the crutches of China to showcase its viability as a global power. While, in the past, Lavrov had commented on how Indian foreign policy decisions are being shaped by other powers, this visit saw him attempting to shore up Pakistan as the central pillar of Russian South Asia policy. From trying to ensure that New Delhi is kept out of the Afghan peace process to reportedly offering a blank cheque to Pakistan, Russian foreign policy has indeed come a long way.Kerry, on the other hand, was in India to engage the country’s leadership on increasing climate ambition ahead of Joe Biden’s Leaders’ Summit on Climate to be held later this month and the COP26 meet scheduled for later this year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is part of the 40 world leaders Biden has invited to a virtual summit on climate, aimed at underlining the urgency and the economic benefits of stronger climate action.Soon after taking office, Biden led the US back into the Paris climate accord. India’s role is critical in ensuring that global targets are achieved. From being on the opposite sides of the ideological divide, the two democracies are now working more closely than ever on climate action — notwithstanding differences on issues such as a timeline for net zero emission goal.Also Read | India-Russia relations not influenced by ties with other countries: MEAThese two visits firmly underscore the new operational realities of Indian foreign policy. There is no denying the fact that in an ideal world India would like to have excellent ties with both Russia and the US. In fact, for New Delhi, there is much to be gained by strengthening its ties with Moscow, something that Indian diplomacy has been trying hard to do over the last few years.Finding new areas of cooperation, moving the relationship away from its unidimensional nature of excessive dependence on defence ties, boosting energy and trade ties, keeping high levels of communication open — all of this has been done. Yet, the relationship has failed to improve significantly. In an ideal world, Russia would have great ties with the West and it would be engaged in the Indo-Pacific, giving the region greater heft vis-à-vis China. But that’s what India would like to see happen, not Russia.For Russia, its primary preoccupation is its growing rivalry with the West and if China helps it in pushing back against the West, then it is all for the best. Sentimentality in foreign policy is the worst possible response. While it is true that India needs Russia for its defence needs and for managing various regional issues, foreign policy is not a one-way street. India cannot keep on hoping for outcomes that Russia is not willing to deliver.Also Read | India, US to work closely on clean energy: US envoy John KerryAs the recent episode of the US 7th Fleet asserting navigational rights inside India’s EEZ without requesting India’s prior consent underlined, New Delhi and Washington too continue to have differences on a range of issues.

Something that was true of the Indo-Soviet partnership in the 20th century.It’s a different world out there today and there is no use complaining about change.

14-04-2021||India||HT insight: Decoding India’s second wave and vaccine strategy||India reported 63,689 Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the tally of active cases to 1,264,698 as infections continued to surge months after the country was thought to have brought the situation under control. With record cases reported almost daily, the second wave of Covid-19 is surging at a much faster rate than the first. At least 60,000 daily cases have been reported since April 8.Hindustan Times has been covering the pandemic and its escalation through a series of reportage, data, commentary, and analysis-driven pieces. As the numbers surge, here are some of the pieces covering myriad aspects of the pandemic:What is driving India’s second Covid-19 wave? Why did this happen now? Why did the numbers escalate beyond what India had at its peak the first time? And what’s the way out? Gagandeep Kang, professor, Christian Medical College, Vellore, discusses how the lack of appropriate behaviour that could prevent the virus’ spread has increased, and potentially been amplified, because of viruses that are more transmissible than the ancestral version of the virus that we had last year.The future is here The patterns have been predictable for a while. In any susceptible population that is not making strong efforts to reduce transmission,  Sars-CoV-2 will rapidly transmit with exponential growth until a combination of recovered people with immunity and heightened precautions slow the spread, says director, Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (CSIR) Anurag Agrawal.How India can overcome the Covid-19 surge While India has to successfully battle the second wave, it is important not to create panic, but to stay calm. The surge will settle soon—but for that, a mix of scientific, administrative and behavioural changes  are essential. According to the honorary emeritus scientist of ICMR and former Dean of AIIMS, New Delhi, Narinder Kumar Mehra, it is important to identify reasons associated with the unprecedented rise in numbers and examine measures that must be taken to halt the upsurge.Five questions about vaccination Facile comments about making the Covid-19 vaccine available to those who need it, rather than those who want it, hide the fact that India’s vaccine strategy needs an urgent reboot, one that requires honest answers to five questions. Last week, in an editorial, HT asked five questions—Is India staring at a vaccine supply crunch? Why, if there was going to be an imminent supply crunch, did the government engage in vaccine diplomacy? Why are other vaccines not being approved? Is an age-based criterion the best way to determine priority for vaccination? How serious is India’s political leadership about the Covid-safety protocol?India’s vaccine strategy is based on science In less than three months, we have managed to provide more than 100 million doses across the country, which is more than the population of Germany. The country has already achieved one of the highest daily vaccinations per day across the globe with 4.3 million vaccinations, which is close to the population of New Zealand. India has also achieved the fastest rate of reaching the 100 million vaccination milestone, ahead of the US and China. Our daily vaccination rates are also among the highest in the world, says Vijay Chauthaiwale, in-charge, foreign affairs department, BJP, and a senior scientist, in a response to the HT editorial.As vaccination drive picks up pace, challenges remain As India crossed the milestone of 100 million doses on Saturday, data indicated that it would take some doing to maintain a pace that could help India turn the tide against the surging second wave of infections. The case trajectory of the second wave has long surpassed the first wave peak both nationally and in at least six states, according to HT’s dashboard. However, the best news for India right now is that the country-wide pace of administering doses is the fastest it has ever been recorded—Jamie Mullick analyses.Exclude Maharashtra, and India’s second Covid wave is still frightening The outbreak in the western state, which is by a far margin the worst-hit in the country, has (rightfully) dominated headlines over the past month-and-a-half. But is the outbreak in Maharashtra magnifying the severity of India’s second wave? Do India’s current Covid numbers look better if we remove Maharashtra’s numbers from the national tally? The answer to both is: not really. Indeed, the magnitude of the outbreak in Maharashtra may have actually masked the march of the viral disease in other states—Jamie Mullick looks at the figures.How bad is the current wave of Covid in India? The story of India’s Covid-19 battle has changed (for the worse) in the past month. For almost eight months after September, when India’s first wave peaked, the country saw a steady decline in daily cases and deaths -- but a second wave that started mid-February is now undoing months of progress made against the outbreak. How bad is the second wave? Are things as bad as fast as they were during the rise of the first wave? As India races to vaccinate enough people amid fears of mutant strains of the virus, here’s a quick look at how the second wave of infections is playing out—Jamie Mullick writes.UK, California, Manaus: What they suggest about the Covid crisis in Maharashtra The deviation in Maharashtra’s trajectory (and to some extend Punjab’s) resembles examples from three other regions where mutations have in fact been implicated: United Kingdom (UK)’s London and south-east, Brazil’s Manaus, and California in the United States (US). All three are believed to be the ground zero for variants that make the coronavirus spread more readily or cheat immunity from a previous infection (or both)—Binayak Dasgupta analyses.In Maharashtra, mutation raises infectivity concerns One of the two mutations feared to have spread rapidly in Maharashtra may have the ability to make the Sars-Cov-2 more adept at infecting humans, improve its ability to multiply within a host, and possibly escape a more complex part of the human immune response, a new study awaiting peer review suggests. The findings relate to the mutation known as L452R, which is one of the two “double mutations” the Indian government said was detected in large numbers in parts of Maharashtra. The state is by far the worst-hit region in India, with an exponential rise in infections that has forced authorities to bring back lockdown-like curbs, writes Binayak Dasgupta.One year of Covid-19: How India fought the virus There are several ways to look at India’s Covid-19 year. On the face of it, it’s the story of a country battered by the world’s second-highest number of infections. But it is also a story of intrigue and, often, surprise. It has one of the lowest deaths rates seen in any large country and, leaving out trends that have become visible only in the latest fortnight, gone through only a single, gigantic wave of infections that appeared to be well-controlled by the country’s precarious health infrastructure. Binayak Dasgupta and Anonna Dutt analyse.Covid-19: What you need to know today In the seven days to Sunday night, India added an average of 133,918 coronavirus disease cases a day. India has overtaken Brazil to the second spot in terms of overall cases (since the start of the pandemic) and is surging ahead. It is also the country that’s adding the most cases a day right now. The current weekly average national positivity rate (based on Sunday’s number) is 9.9% and rising—far higher than the 5% (and declining) level which indicates that things are getting better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ht-insight-decoding-india-s-second-wave-and-vaccine-strategy-101618313921701.html
14-04-2021||India||Equitable access to vaccines critical: S Jaishankar||Equitable distribution of Covid-19 vaccines can be achieved only with the creation of additional manufacturing capabilities in countries such as India, external affairs minister S Jaishankar said on Tuesday.Participating in a session at the Raisina Dialogue that focused on vaccines and global expectations, Jaishankar held up India’s ability to manufacture a range of Covid-19 vaccines as an example of global cooperation and said this couldn’t be seen as a “one-way street”.“Equitable access [to vaccines] is critically important in this [fight against the pandemic], because we all know that no one will be safe till everyone is safe,” he said during the virtual session moderated by Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman.There is a need for additional production capabilities for vaccines, and without it, “distributive justice by itself will not be adequate”, he added.Jaishankar said he could understand a country’s decision to focus on protecting its own people when it comes under stress because of rising infections and noted that the number of Covid-19 cases in India is going up too and the government chose to deal with the immediate challenge. “To the extent that you have margins and the ability and the obligation to help others, I think it’s the decent thing to do. Doing good is also doing smart,” he said.Noting that India’s ability to make vaccines is a result of international cooperation, he added: “International cooperation is not a one-way street where we are giving things to other people and somewhere short-changing ourselves.”Jaishankar’s comments came against the backdrop of the Indian government’s decision to exercise greater control over vaccine exports following a sudden spike in Covid-19 infections.The country recorded 185,287 new cases and 1,026 deaths on Tuesday according to the HT dashboard. It has so far seen 13,871,325 cases and 172,134 deaths.So far, India has provided 65.1 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 90 countries, including 10.6 million doses supplied as grants. India’s deliveries of vaccines to other countries followed on from its work in providing humanitarian aid to numerous countries after natural disasters and its actions to address climate crisis, Jaishankar said.The Indian government’s partnership with the Gates Foundation is a “global fairness coalition” aimed at ensuring that weaker and vulnerable people in some countries don’t get left behind, he said. The work done by Indian vaccine manufacturer with the WHO-backed COVAX facility is ensuring that African and Caribbean countries which don’t have wherewithal to access the market get timely assistance, he added.Part of India’s rise would be to demonstrate that its additional capabilities are in the “hands of a country which embraces the world”, said Jaishankar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/raisina-dialogue-jaishankar-roots-for-more-vaccine-production-facilities-in-india-101618311401500.html
14-04-2021||India||Approval for jabs cleared in other countries fast-tracked||Coronavirus vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India, the Union government said on Tuesday, potentially boosting the country’s pandemic response through possible imports of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) products.Coming at a time when India records the world’s biggest surge in infections, the decision removes a significant barrier for vaccine makers, although questions remain on whether these firms will bring their products, if they have the capacity to, if they will tie up with Indian companies, and how soon these shots will be available.“Vaccines made outside of India, if approved by authorities in the US, UK, European Union, Japan, or under the WHO’s emergency use listing, are approved for use in India. The condition of clinical trials won’t apply, they can continue trials after approval,” said VK Paul, member (Health) Niti Aayog.“We hope, and we invite vaccines makers such as Pfizer, Moderna and J&J or any other vaccines that get approvals from these authorities to bring their products to India,” he added at a government briefing.Paul later told HT that as per emergency-use licensing norms, the distribution and procurement process will remain under government control as it is at present. “It is not a regular marketing licensure, it is EUA and all vaccines are governed by EUA laws where government controls procurement and distribution to ensure those who need the vaccine get it on priority. All countries are procuring and distributing Covid-19 vaccines under EUA currently,” he said, adding that since it will be under EUA, the government will monitor side-effects.Private hospitals and clinics are allowed to administer the vaccines but the process is monitored by the government, which uses the Co-WIN platform to track the factory-to-injection process.Paul said the move was meant to encourage these companies to use India’s pharma companies for production and “fill and finish” deals, and said that while there was no discussion yet on pricing, improved supplies in the long run will help bring prices down.Experts welcomed the government’s decision but said it remains to be seen whether the current procurement and distribution model will need to be tweaked, and if continuing with it will yield any gains.“If there are more vaccines available in market, people will have a choice and there will be healthy competition. How they get it in market will either be by importing these vaccines, or by these companies going in for a joint venture locally, which seems unlikely. It should not be the responsibility of the government to give these vaccines free; they may put a price tag to it but people should have a choice. At this point we don’t know how they will go about it,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan, at the ministry briefing, described the step as a “significant streamlining and fast-tracking of the regulatory system” which now “opens doors for import of bulk or finished vaccines or import leading to fill and finish”.In a statement issued earlier in the day, the Union health ministry said the step was recommended by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) after a meeting on April 11.The accelerated approval will apply to doses authorised by US’s food and drug administration (FDA), UK’s Medicines and Health care products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), European Medicines Agency (EMA), Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency (PMDA) Japan, or by the World Health Organization.Instead of requiring them to conduct a “bridging trial” prior to seeking approval, the government will allow them to roll out these coronavirus vaccines and conduct “parallel bridging clinical trial” after they get the authorisation. “Further, the first 100 beneficiaries of such foreign vaccines shall be assessed for seven days for safety outcomes before it is rolled out for further immunisation programme within the country,” the statement said.At present, there are vaccines by three companies that are approved by regulators identified by the government and are yet to be authorised in India: Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and J&J. A fourth vaccine, made by Novavax, has made progress in clinical trials and sought approval from several of these regulators.Among these, two companies already have tied up with Indian companies for production — Novavax and J&J. Novavax has licensed Serum Institute of India (SII) to produce a billion doses and the Pune-based company is also carrying out bridging trials in the country. Similarly, Hyderabad’s Biological E has a deal to produce 600 million doses of the J&J vaccine and was recently poised to begin bridging studies.The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines were among the first to be approved anywhere in the world last year. Both have an efficacy rate of over 95% and use mRNA technology, which has emerged as a breakthrough platform for coronavirus vaccines.India, the world’s biggest maker of vaccines, has so far administered a little over 108 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin – the first two shots to be approved in the country. A third, Sputnik V made by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, was approved formally on Tuesday and doses are expected to be imported at first before a group of five Indian companies that have contracts to begin churning out doses. Dr Reddy’s has the rights for distribution of the first 100 million doses in India, which will be a combination of Indian and Russian made vaccines, the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) said on Tuesday.“We appreciate the decision of India’s regulatory bodies to grant authorisation for Sputnik V. Approval of the vaccine is a major milestone as Russia and India have been developing an extensive cooperation on clinical trials of Sputnik V in India and its local production,” said RDIF CEO Kirill Dmitriev. Since March, the developers have stitched up more agreements to ramp up the production of the vaccine in India.Though India was the fastest among all countries to vaccine 100 million people, concerns have been mounting in some states about whether there are adequate supplies. According to production capacities declared by SII (which makes Covishield – the Indian version of the Oxford-AstraZeneca dose) and Bharat Biotech, the average production capacity at present comes to about 2.5 million doses a day.Over the past week, India has administered 4.1 million doses a day on average.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-to-fast-track-emergency-use-approval-for-foreign-produced-covid-vaccines-101618302160979.html
14-04-2021||India||On the election trail, the politics of the wild||It is not very common for wildlife to feature in the heat of political campaigns and, yet, the Greater One Horned Rhino or the Indian Rhinoceros as it is also called was recently invoked in a campaign speech in Assam by no less than the Prime Minister.Speaking at an election rally in Bokakhat not too far away from the Kaziranga National Park on March 21, Prime Minister Narendra Modi, among other things, said that the Bharatiya Janata Party-led state government in Assam has ensured that those involved in rhino poaching are behind bars and accused the Opposition of being soft on poachers, when the latter was in power in the state.Irrespective of the political hue of those in power, the story of rhino conservation in Assam is one of resounding success. From an estimated 12 individuals in 1908, numbers have grown close to 3,000 in the Kaziranga National Park presently. Undoubtedly, political commitment backed by the provision of required resources is key to the success of any public cause, including that of wildlife conservation.Also Read | 1 more Cong ally moves candidates out of Assam over poaching fearsIt was another Prime Minister’s actions that laid the foundation for many of the country’s greatest conservation successes. Project Tiger was launched in 1973 during the tenure of the then Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. Over 900 Protected Areas in India extending over a diverse range of habitats and ecosystems and covering 165,000 sq. km. (approx. 5% of the country’s total geographic area) owe their continued existence to the Wildlife (Protection) Act, 1972 also passed during her tenure.That era was different and current political leaders may find it much more difficult to balance the demands of competing constituencies when it comes to the conservation of wildlife and their habitat. A case in point being a recent submission made by the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI), subsequently withdrawn, to the Karnataka high court that the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, which was passed by the Indian Parliament “not only for the protection of the environment but also at the instance of foreign powers”.Fortunately, calls for increased protection of the Indian Rhinoceros find great resonance with the people of Assam, most of whom see the rhino as a symbolic representation of themselves, an essence of what it means to be Assamese. Poll rhetoric that seeks to suggest that a section of the populace may be “outsiders”, and, by extension, against the rhino or worse still are poachers or support poaching, is unfortunate.Elephants too have featured as a poll issue in the keenly contested assembly elections in West Bengal. News reports speak of harassed residents of villages spread over 12 assembly seats in Bankura district in south Bengal seeking a permanent solution to the problems caused by the pachyderms. Six months ago, the state government announced an increase in the ex-gratia payment to the kin of those deceased in an elephant attack from ₹250,000 to ₹400,000 and a job for a member of the family in the Home Guard.While welcome, such measures fall short as the underlying causes of human-elephant conflict remains unaddressed. The elephants in Bankura too could be labelled “outsiders”, having come into Bengal from Dalma in Jharkhand nearly 35 years ago. While some animals spend up to six months in Bengal before returning to Jharkhand, many have chosen to stay on, feeding on crops while sheltering in the plantation forests.Experts list several reasons for this movement including drought, loss of habitat and disruption of migratory routes within existing home ranges (around 1000 sq. km. for female led herds) due to linear infrastructure projects, large scale mining and urban expansion.Also Read | Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, Assam issues guidelines to celebrate Rongali BihuDisplaced elephants have not just been migrating from Jharkhand to Bengal but also from Odisha and Jharkhand further west to Chhattisgarh and Madhya Pradesh. In the Lok Sabha elections of 2019, many villagers in Chhattisgarh’s Surguja constituency chose not to vote to express their anger and dismay at the lack of action on the part of state authorities to address the conflict effectively.Wildlife then, it would appear, features in poll campaigns as an emotive issue where a threat to the species as is the case with the Indian Rhinoceros, seen as emblematic of Assamese identity, can be (and is) projected as a threat to the indigenous culture. Wildlife or issues related to wildlife also seem to matter at the hustings when political suitors are compelled to respond to the voters’ distress and anger such as in Bankura.For real conservation gains to be made and for far-reaching and permanent solutions for hundreds of communities across the country that suffer losses due to human-wildlife conflict, our politicians need to display a maturity that goes beyond deploying wildlife as just another stratagem to score over opponents during election times. Issues of wildlife conservation need to be embedded within a larger framework and narrative to secure India’s ecological security. India’s political class has displayed such foresight in the past and will need to do so now more than ever.Yash Shethia is Director, Wildlife Landscape and Wildlife & Habitats Programme, WWF IndiaThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-the-election-trail-the-politics-of-the-wild-101618298200766.html

14-04-2021||India||The Number Theory: Where is the second Covid-19 wave bigger than the first?||With new cases hitting a fresh high almost every day, India is currently climbing the second wave of Covid-19 infections at a much faster rate than the first. The second wave is also much taller than the first wave at the nationwide level. The seven-day average of new cases was 133,918 on April 11. This is 1.4 times the weekly average of 93,617 India hit on September 16 last year at the peak of the first wave. Is the second wave larger than the first everywhere? Are the states testing enough?Second wave bigger than first in nine states/UTsBy April 11, the second wave was bigger than the first in eight states – Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, Rajasthan, and Haryana – and the Union territory of Chandigarh. In the first four states, the current seven-day-average of cases is 1.8 to 3.2 times their peak seven-day averages. This is 1.4 times for India as a whole. The current rising wave of cases in Jharkhand, Delhi, Goa and Telangana (especially the first two) means that these too might soon overtake their previous peaks. In these states, the current average is 80% of their earlier peaks.Low testing hiding the true scale of the second waveThe weekly average of positivity rate of Covid-19 testing in India reached an all-time low of 1.47% on February 13. It has climbed steeply since. The average was 10.7% on April 11. It has been higher than this only on 13 days prior to April 11: from July 19 to July 29, and on August 2 and August 3, when testing was yet to reach its fullest capacity in the country. The World Health Organization (WHO) considers a positivity rate of 5% to be the threshold for considering the Covid-19 epidemic as under control. One of the reasons for this is that a low positivity rate of tests implies that most infected people have been identified and isolated, and cannot spread the infection further. India’s high positivity rate of tests underlines the severity of the second wave in India. It also suggests that there might be several more Covid-19 cases that have not been identified.Eighteen states/UTs that need to ramp up testingThe scale of the second wave compared to the first is not a sufficient metric to measure how bad the current surge is; for that, positivity rates need also be considered. At the state level, for instance, of the nine states and UTs where the second wave has overtaken the first one, only Gujarat and Uttar Pradesh registered an average positivity rate lower than 5% in the week ending April 11. Of the remaining 25 states and UTs for which testing numbers are available (numbers not available only for Ladakh, Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu), almost half (11 states/UTs) have a positivity rate greater than 5%. Clearly, these 11 regions also cannot be complacent just because their second wave is so far smaller than the first one – they need to increase testing.In six of the nine states/UTs with a second wave bigger than the first (the exclusions are Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, and Haryana), the average number of tests in the week ending April 11 was the highest ever, suggesting that there has been an effort to increase testing. Among the 11 states, where the current average of cases is still lower than their previous peak, only Delhi has increased testing (to its highest level).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-number-theory-where-is-the-second-covid-19-wave-bigger-than-the-first-101618246805157.html
