21-04-2021||India||Hospitals face oxygen shortage, Centre increases states' quota||As India saw another record high of 2,95,041 new Covid cases and 2,023 deaths, the oxygen crisis precipitated by the second wave appeared to intensify with complaints of shortage from several states, including Maharashtra where tragedy struck when 24 patients on ventilator support suffocated to death due to leakage in an oxygen storage tank.The Centre announced on Wednesday evening that it was increasing the quota of oxygen in eight states, including Delhi, in view of the sudden spike in demand due to an exponential rise in the number of Covid patients admitted in hospitals.On the vaccination front, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh were the latest to announce free jabs for all aged above 18 years, after Uttar Pradesh and Assam made a similar decision, and officials presented data to assert that the vaccines reduce the risk of infection and prevent death and severe infection.At a press conference, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul appealed to the states, hospitals and nursing homes to ensure rational use of oxygen as it was "life-saving" drug for the coronavirus infected patients.Noting that 7,500 MT of oxygen was being produced in the country per day and 6,600 MT is being allocated to states for medical purposes, the Centre said the Union government and state governments need to work together and respond promptly to the challenges posed by the pandemic.The central government announced that the quota of Maharashtra has been increased from 1,646 to 1,661 MT, from 445 to 543 MT in Madhya Pradesh, from 156 to 162 MT in Haryana, from 751 MT to 753 MT in UP and from 126 MT to 136 MT in Punjab.The allocation has been raised from 360 MT to 440 MT in Andhra Pradesh, from 83 MT to 103 MT in Uttarakhand and from 378 MT to 480 MT in Delhi.The Centre's response came as Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Maharashtra indulged in a blame game and squabbled over oxygen supply and distribution while demanding an increase in their quota.On Wednesday, several hospitals in the national capital like Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital, St Stephen's Hospital and Holy Family Hospital in Okhla said they only had oxygen for two to five hours. Other hospitals too had been facing a depleting stock for the last few days.Later in the evening, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had claimed a "serious oxygen crisis", said that Delhi's oxygen quota has been increased and thanked the Centre.Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia accused the Haryana government of blocking medical oxygen supply to Delhi, but the Haryana government vehemently refuted the allegations.Haryana health minister Anil Vij said given the increased demand for oxygen due to a surge in coronavirus cases, his state can spare the supply for others only after meeting its demand.He alleged that a tanker carrying medical oxygen for COVID patients in hospitals, which was going from Panipat to Faridabad, was ''looted'' by the Delhi government and said all oxygen tankers will now move with a police escort.In Maharashtra, which has the highest number of cases, 24 patients on ventilator support at the Dr Zakir Husain Hospital in Nashik suffocated to death when their oxygen supply stopped suddenly because of a malfunction in the main storage.The government will probe if the tragedy was due to negligence, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.Nashik was the worst-hit city in the country in terms of cases per million residents, according to the Union health ministry's data compiled between March 16 and April 15 from major cities.Tope had on Tuesday said the state was "managing with 1,550 metric tonnes of oxygen" per day at present and is going to buy oxygen generators, besides using thermal power plants for oxygen production.In Latur, relatives of Covid-19 patients took to the streets on after a private hospital claimed a shortage of oxygen.Last week, at least six Covid-19 patients died in the ICU of a government hospital in Madhya Pradesh's Shahdol allegedly due to low pressure in the medical oxygen supply.Expressing concern over the situation, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said, "India is among the largest producing countries in the field of oxygen, medicine and vaccine production. Yet deaths are occurring due to lack of oxygen and medicines in the country, which is unfortunate."Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh wrote to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, seeking a daily allocation of at least 120 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen for the state.The Tamil Nadu government said it would take up with the Centre, diversion of about 45 metric tonnes of medical oxygen from a city plant to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, even as it asserted that the state had adequate stocks of oxygen.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed the officials to install GPS devices on oxygen tankers and provide adequate security to oxygen plants.The country was struggling to sustain the medical oxygen supply lines as the active cases crossed the 21-lakh mark with the 2,95,041 fresh infections in a span of 24 hours, pushing India's total tally of Covid-19 cases to 1,56,16,130.The death toll increased to 1,82,553 as daily fatalities crossed 2,000 for the first time, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday morning.Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Rajasthan are among 10 states that account for over 76 per cent of the new cases registered in the country.Assuring that the government was working with speed and sensitivity to meet the increasing demand of oxygen, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in his address to the nation on Tuesday night called upon all stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, to deal collectively with the immediate challenge of the shortage of oxygen cylinders.The railways said on Wednesday it will run its second Oxygen Express to Uttar Pradesh after a request was received from the state government.The railways also said that it had received a similar request from Madhya Pradesh.The Maharashtra government too had written to the railways to explore whether liquid medical oxygen tankers could be moved by the rail network.In Delhi, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, "We are producing 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen per day of which 6,600 metric tonnes is being allocated to the states for medical purposes.""Presently, we have issued instructions that, leaving a few industries, the supply of industries will be restricted so that more and more oxygen can be made available for medical use," he said.Bhushan said that a 24x7 control room has been set up where the state governments can tell the problems they are facing if their truck is stuck or the movement is getting hindered."When you deal with such a huge challenge, such a big pandemic and multiple stakeholders, then at times there is panic and confusion and the onus and responsibility is on the Union government and state governments to work together and respond promptly so these challenges are addressed," Bhushan said.The officials said they are also evaluating applications from suppliers abroad for import of oxygen.The Centre has floated a tender for import of 50,000 MT of medical oxygen and a pre-bidding meeting was held yesterday, according to official sources.Also on Wednesday, the Delhi High Court directed the Centre to supply oxygen to hospitals for Covid-19 patients by whatever means required, saying if necessary, the entire production of oxygen from industries including steel and petroleum should be diverted for medical usage.Addressing a press conference, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said 0.04 per cent of 17,37,178 individuals, who received the second dose of Covaxin, were positive for Covid-19, while 0.03 per cent of 1,57,32,754 people, who took the second dose of Covishield, contracted the infection.Bhargava who presented the data said vaccines reduce the risk of infection and prevent death and severe infection.The Centre has opened up Covid-19 vaccination to all citizens over 18 years of age from May 1.Meanwhile, the Goa government announced a 10-day-long night curfew in the state effective from Wednesday and imposed curbs on restaurants, cinema halls and casinos in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases.Several other states have already imposed lockdown-like restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hospitals-face-oxygen-shortage-centre-increases-states-quota-101619028627243.html
21-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Govt releases data showing severity, virulence in second wave similar to first||Amid a staggering surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, the Centre on Wednesday sought to quell the panic by presenting a slew of statistics to show the severity and virulence in the ongoing second wave of the contagion are about the same as the first one.The government, however, cautioned that there is no clear sign of any downtrend in the Covid graph yet.Also, 21,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 after taking the first dose of either Covishield or Covaxin vaccines, while nearly 5,700 contracted the infection after taking both the doses, government data revealed.At a press conference on Wednesday, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the Covid-19 positivity rate in 146 districts was more than 15 per cent, while it was between five and 15 per cent in 274 districts."We are in the midst of the second wave of the pandemic and we are still seeing an upsurge. We cannot comment when the numbers will come down," ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said.Presenting data from both the waves of the pandemic, he said 8.07 per cent of cases reported in the first wave were between the age group of 10-20 years, while in this time it is 8.50 per cent."In the age group 20-30 years, 20.41 per cent cases were reported in the first wave, while in the second it was 19.35 per cent."The data was released amid a growing panic that the second wave is somehow more powerful and could cause greater havoc. India is already grappling with a shortage of oxygen and other medical supplies as its health infrastructure is stretched to the limits due to spiralling Covid-19 cases.Asked how did the second wave catch the country unawares, Bhushan said, "Today is not the time to go into why did we miss or did we miss or did we prepare. It is time to jointly face the pandemic. Once we emerge from it successfully, then probably... we would be able to deliberate on this.""All the energies of the Centre and states are focused in a collaborative manner to tackle this, save lives and to ensure our health system is strengthened," he stressed.The health secretary referred to the data to show that 67.5 per cent of those affected in the first wave were aged 30 and above, it was 69.18 per cent this time.In the age group 30-40 years, 21.05 per cent Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave and 21.15 per cent in the. For the age group 40-50 years, the percentage of cases in the first wave was 17.16 per cent and in the second it is 17.50 per cent.During the first wave, in the age group 50-60 years, 14.80 per cent cases were reported in the second wave it was 15.07 per cent. Between 60 and 70 years, 9.01 per cent cases were reported in the last wave and 9.99 per cent now.Age-wise comparison of fatalities in 2020 and 2021 showed that 0.27 per cent of deaths reported in the first wave were below 10 years, while in the second it was 0.34 per cent. Between 10 and 20 years, 0.53 per cent deaths were reported in the first wave and 0.31 per cent in the second, the data showed.In the age group of 40-50 years, 11.98 per cent of deaths were reported in the first wave, while 10.82 per cent of fatalities were registered in the second.  About those getting infected even after inoculation, Bhargava said it included 0.04 per cent of the 17,37,178 people who received both doses of Covaxin and 0.03 per cent of 1,57,32,754 who took the second dose of Covishield.Vaccines reduce the risk and severity of infection, and prevent death, he said, adding if one gets infected even after immunisation then it is called breakthrough infection.So far, 1.1 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered out of which 93 lakh received the first dose. Among them, 4,208 people got infected. About 17,37,178 people received the second dose of which only 695 tested positive for Covid-19, the ICM DG said.About Covishield, 11.6 crore doses have been administered of which 10 crore received the first dose and 17,145 contracted the infection, he said, adding 1,57,32,754 people took the second dose and of that 5,014 got infected."Two to four per 10,000 breakthrough infections have occurred, a very small number. They were mainly healthcare workers prone to occupational hazards. This is a very small number and not at all worrisome."Also, the highly transmissible second wave also contributes minuscule to the percentage so this could have been even zero per cent," the ICMR DG said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul noted that there is a risk of infection even after vaccination. "So, we stress on people following Covid-appropriate behaviour even after taking the jabs."  Amid reports of oxygen shortage in the country, the Centre said of the total 7500 metric tonnes of oxygen being produced in India daily, as on date 6,600 metric tonne is being allocated to states for medical use and efforts are being made to increase supplies in the coming days.Paul appealed to the states, hospitals and nursing homes to ensure rational use of oxygen.The health secretary said, "We have issued instructions that keeping aside a few industries, the supply to industries will be restricted so that more oxygen can be made available for medical use."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-govt-releases-data-showing-severity-virulence-in-second-wave-similar-to-first-101619024647051.html
21-04-2021||India||Maharashtra government announces strict curbs in state after surge in Covid-19 cases||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday night announced stringent restrictions in the state due to a huge surge in the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The state government has also issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the curbs.The restrictions will come into effect from 8pm on Thursday and will be in place till 7am on May 1, according to state government's order."The state government is satisfied that the state of Maharashtra is threatened with the spread of Covid-19 virus, and therefore it is imperative to take certain emergency measures to prevent and contain the spread of virus," the Maharashtra government order said.🚨New strict restrictions under #BreakTheChain🚨To be implemented from 22nd April 2021, 8pm onwards pic.twitter.com/ifyrcQCbnHThe state government's SOPs say that no travel will be allowed by public or private transport unless it is for essential services, medical reasons or vaccination.The number of guests at weddings have been capped at 25 and the function must not go on beyond two hours, according to the government order. The families who are found flouting the order, will be fined ₹50,000 and the "misused" location shall be closed till promulgation of Covid-19 as a disaster remains in force.The government and private offices have been asked to allow only15 per cent staff. The SOPs also say that only those private offices which provide essential services or are in exempted categories can function.This comes on a day when Maharashtra recorded 568 deaths due to Covid-19 - its highest ever since the beginning of the pandemic - and 67,468 fresh cases. This pushed the statewide tally to 40,27,827 and death toll to 61,911, according to the bulletin of Maharashtra government's health department.The highest statewide daily count so far - 68,631 - was reported on April 18.Out of the 568 fatalities, 303 occurred in the last 48 hours, the health department said.The ministers in Maharashtra confirmed earlier on Wednesday that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will announce a stringent lockdown. On Tuesday, the issue of a stricter lockdown was discussed in a cabinet meeting where the majority was in favour of a long lockdown in the state, instead of present restrictions which they said have not been able to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state.“There is no alternative, but to go for a strict lockdown," Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said after Tuesday's meeting.Maharashtra has already been under restrictions such as night curfew and district lockdowns due to rising number of Covid-19 cases, which have shown a sharp surge since February. Last week, Section 144, which bars the gathering of more than four people, was also imposed.There have been concerns in Maharashtra over the deteriorating Covid-19 situation. The state health department has projected that there would be a shortage of beds in nearly all districts by May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-surge-maharashtra-government-announces-complete-lockdown-in-state-101619023118489.html

21-04-2021||India||In a first, 303 kg Colombian cocaine worth ₹2000 crore seized by DRI||In the largest ever seizure of cocaine in India, the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) has recovered 303 kgs of pure cocaine from a container in Tuticorin, which officials suspected was produced in Colombia and smuggled to India by one of the cartels there. The value of the seized high-purity cocaine is estimated to be ₹2,000 crore in the international market, with the potential to provide over 3 lakh individual street deals of cocaine per gram. The cocaine, officials cited above said, was concealed in a consignment imported in a container declared to be containing wooden logs. It was wrapped in multiple layers of packing material having been compressed as bricks. The container originated from Panama, transited through the ports of Antwerp and Colombo, before reaching India but an officer said that 302 bricks or blocks of cocaine, which is of pure quality, weighing 303 kgs have markings from Colombia. Multiple agencies are trying to identify the cartel behind smuggling such large quantity of cocaine to India and those involved here in buying such a huge consignment. Drug enforcement experts said this kind of modus operandi for smuggling cocaine in India has never been witnessed earlier. “Two similar consignments having cocaine bricks/blocks were unearthed abroad in last couple of years – one by UK authorities in July last year and another by Australian Federal Police in 2019. But never have we come across such a huge consignment of cocaine in India,” said an officer who didn’t want to be named. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the highest amount of cocaine seized by all agencies combined was 34 kg in 2019. The powerful addictive stimulant drug is made from the leaves of coca plant native to South America and its primary markets are North America and Europe. There is no cultivation of coca plant in India and smaller amounts smuggled here are for urban centres like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and are brought by suspects from West African drug syndicates. “Very few instances of smaller quantities of smuggling of cocaine from Argentina and Brazil have come to our notice in the past but such a huge consignment of Colombian cocaine is a shocker,” said a second officer who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-303-kg-colombian-cocaine-worth-rs-2000-crore-seized-by-dri-101619017904681.html

The incident happened in the morning when one of the tankers supplying oxygen to patients receiving treatment for the coronavirus disease at Dr Zakir Naik Municipal Hospital malfunctioned.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that among those who lost their lives, 11 were women and 11 men. He also said that a probe has been ordered.As the news of disruption of oxygen supply due to leakage in storage tank spread, family members rushed to the ward where Covid-19 patients on ventilator were undergoing treatment.There were heart-wrenching scenes as patients' condition became critical and doctors and nurses could not do anything in the absence of oxygen supply, news agency PTI reported quoting a witness."My brother was about to get discharge in the next two days as his condition was improving. Today when I brought him tiffin, he said he would eat later. Immediately after our conversation the hospital ran out of oxygen and within two hours my brother was dead," 42-year-old Pramod Walukar told PTI.Another woman, who also lost her mother, said her condition was improving. "But the oxygen supply got disrupted and she died gasping for breath," she said.A total of 150 Covid-19 patients were admitted to the hospital of which 23 were on ventilator support, the district’s municipal authorities said.The hospital authorities have asked the police to restrict the entry into the Covid-19 ward after which the security in the hospital has been beefed up.The Maharashtra government has announced an ex-gratia of ₹5 lakh to the families of the the patients who lost their lives. "No one should politicise this unfortunate incident. This is an attack on Maharashtra," a statement from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray's office (CMO) said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nashik-hospital-oxygen-leak-my-mother-died-gasping-for-breath-says-woman-as-toll-rises-to-24-101619016876549.html
21-04-2021||India||Four farmers trampled to death by elephant in western Odisha||Four farmers in western Odisha districts of Bargarh and Balangir were trampled to death by one wild elephant in two separate incidents on Wednesday morning, said forest officials.In Balangir district, farmer Biranchi Sahu (55) was attacked by an elephant at Darlipali under Loisingha Forest range when he was collecting mangoes.Another tusker that had strayed from a herd had killed three farmers in Gaisilet Range of Bargarh district a few hours ago. Farmers Mala Seth (54) and Biranchi Kumbhar (56) of Umrad village and Siba Seth (60) of Nathpali village were out of their home to relieve themselves when attacked by the elephant, claimed a forest official. Tension gripped the area following the incident.Forest department officials said the same tusker, part of a herd, had trampled a farmer in Bargarh district five days ago.Wild elephants in Odisha have killed 633 people in the last seven years between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2021. The state has already reported 12 human deaths this month alone.In October last year, the state forest and wildlife department formed a taskforce and asked it to prepare a master plan to reduce man-animal conflict over the next three years. The idea was to have a long-term plan instead of a knee-jerk reaction every time such a conflict occurs and to prioritise the resources adequately. The taskforce was supposed to give its suggestion within six weeks of its formation. However, the forest secretary did not respond to the queries whether the task force had submitted its recommendations.Wildlife activists said deforestation, large-scale mining and quarrying, industrialisation, destructions of elephant corridors and irrigation canals have led to the increasing number of encounters with humans.“Odisha’s forest department has done little to stem the rise in conflict. They are clueless... All mitigation plans provided by experts over the last two decades remain largely on paper,” alleged Biswajit Mohanty, a wildlife expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-farmers-trampled-to-death-by-elephant-in-western-odisha-101619015023977.html
21-04-2021||India||Goa Congress chief claims MLAs used forged document to win disqualification case||Goa Congress chief Girish Chodankar filed a police complaint on Wednesday alleging 10 ex-party MLAs gave fake documents to the assembly speaker to save themselves against disqualification and to prove that the group had lawfully merged with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019. Chodankar’s claim comes a day after the speaker dismissed the disqualification petition he filed against the MLAs.In his complaint, Chodankar said that the MLAs produced what was purported to be a resolution of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee agreeing to merge with the BJP, which he said was completely fabricated, as no such resolution was taken.“[They] have conspired together and created a false document claiming it to be a resolution of Goa Pradesh Congress Committee... held on 10.07.2019... wherein a resolution was passed to merge the party in Goa Legislative Assembly into Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The aforesaid document is created illegally using counterfeit letterhead and counterfeit seal of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee,” Chodankar said in his complaint.10 of the Congress’ 15 MLAs joined the BJP in September 2019. The Congress alleged that their switch amounted to defection under the 10th schedule of the Constitution and sought their disqualification from the assembly. The MLAs on their part claimed 2/3rd of the Congress legislature party had lawfully merged with the BJP. As per the anti-defection law, two-thirds of the strength of a legislative party is allowed to merge with another, without inviting disqualification. The speaker Rajesh Patnekar dismissed the disqualification plea filed by Chodankar on Tuesday. He also dismissed another disqualification plea filed by Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) against two of the three party MLAs who joined the BJP nearly six months earlier on March 27, 2019.Chodankar’s complaint attempts to challenge the MLAs claim that they duly merged with the BJP. “Firstly, no such meeting of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee was called for and/or took place on 10.07.2019 and therefore the question of passing of any resolution as claimed in the said documents does not even arise,” the complaint says. It adds that no record of such a meeting was found in the register books maintained by the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee Committee. “As per the minutes book, there is record of meeting of office bearers of Pradesh Congress committee held on 29.05.2019 and 24.07.2019 and there is no other meeting in between the said meetings and certainly not of any meeting on 10.07.2019,” Chodankar said.Chodankar has requested for registering a case of forgery, cheating, using a forged document as genuine, of giving false evidence and of possessing and using a counterfeit seal against the ten MLAs.Responding to the allegation of forgery, Isidore Fernandes, who was one among the ten MLAs to switch to the BJP, accused the Congress of “forum hunting” to save face after the party’s case was dismissed by the speaker yesterday.“The Speaker has dismissed the case. They are now filing complaints, cases and petitions in various fora. The law will take its own course,” Fernandes said.Speaker Rajesh Patnekar said he couldn’t comment on the authenticity of the documents before him. “I cannot comment on whether it (the many documents in his file) is genuine or not.

They have asked for commercial & unloading point details. Reply for the same is being given today itself. Thereafter, planning of movement shall be done. The second Oxygen Special carrying around 7-8 empty tankers to Bokaro and back will start tonight from Lucknow. Many more are planned in the coming days,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Indian Railways will deploy first-of-a-kind ‘Oxygen Express’ trains over the next few days to transport Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) and Oxygen cylinders in bulk along key corridors amid high demand from states grappling with the second wave of the Covid 19 infection.With several states reporting a shortage of oxygen, the government on Friday directed them to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders and said they must not impose any curbs on production and supply of the essential public health commodity anywhere.The first Oxygen Express with seven tankers loaded on a Roll on Roll off train left Kalamboli Goods Yard in Navi Mumbai on Monday for Vizag where it will be loaded with liquid medical oxygen for Maharashtra. The train is scheduled to reach Vizag on Wednesday night before taking off for Mumbai, officials said.A meeting was held between Railway Board officials and state transport commissioners and representatives of the industry on April 17 on issues related to the transportation of liquid medical oxygen.The railway ministry on Friday approved the transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers under its Roll on-Roll off model as a special case following a request from the Maharashtra government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-a-request-from-up-govt-second-oxygen-express-to-run-to-lucknow-101619014303951.html

The move will come as a shot in the arm for Delhi where several top hospitals have reported depleting oxygen reserves."Central govt has increased Delhi’s quota of oxygen. We r very grateful to centre for this," Kejriwal said in a tweet.Central govt has increased Delhi’s quota of oxygen. We r very grateful to centre for this.Sisodia earlier said at a press conference that many people from neighbouring states are coming to Delhi for Covid-19 treatment and demanded that the Centre should increase the national capital's quota from the present 370 metric tonne (MT) to 700 MT.Also Watch: ‘Delhi govt looted our oxygen tanker’, says Haryana ministerHe also talked about the oxygen crisis being faced by many city hospitals. The Delhi deputy chief minister called for Centre's intervention to sort out issues of oxygen supply between different states, saying "only Centre decides the oxygen quota".India's top private hospital in the national capital Sir Ganga Ram had earlier announced oxygen shortage with 58 patients awaiting treatment and 35 waiting outside the hospital for admission.The crisis is compounded by similar reports emerging from other parts of the national capital where hospitals are racing against time with their oxygen quota.Sisodia said that the Delhi government has talked to the Centre to get the oxygen tanker which was stuck at a plant in Faridabad.Later in the day, news agency ANI reported that Sir Ganga Ram hospital received 45 cylinders at 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-grateful-says-kejriwal-as-govt-increases-delhi-s-oxygen-quota-amid-shortage-101619012804001.html
21-04-2021||India||'Very small number': Govt on those testing Covid +ve after taking vaccine dose||More than 21,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 after taking the first dose of either Covishield or Covaxin, while over 5,500 contracted the infection after taking the second dose, the Centre said on Wednesday.Addressing a press conference, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said 0.04 per cent of 17,37,178 individuals, who received the second dose of Covaxin, were positive for Covid-19, while 0.03 per cent of 1,57,32,754 people, who took the second dose of Covishield, contracted the infection.Bhargava who presented the data said vaccines reduce the risk of infection and prevent death and severe infection."After vaccination if one gets infection then it is known as breakthrough infection," he said.So far, 1.1 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered. Out of which 93 lakh received the first dose and out of that 4,208 (0.04 per cent) people got the infection which is four per 10,000 individuals. About 17,37,178 people received the second dose of which only 695 (0.04 per cent) tested positive for Covid-19, Bhargava said.Of Covishield, 11.6 crore doses have been given. Ten crore received the first dose and 17,145 i.e. 2 per 10,000 people contracted the infection. About 1,57,32,754 individuals took the second dose of covishield and of that 5,014 (0.03 per cent) got infected. Two to four per 10,000 breakthrough infections have occurred, a very small number. This was mainly healthcare workers prone to more occupational hazards, he said.According to the data, 5,709 people contracted the infection after the second dose of either of the two vaccines."This is a very small number and not at all worrisome. Secondly, the highly transmissable second wave also contribute miniscule to the percentage so this could have been even zero per cent," he said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul noted that there is a risk even after taking vaccination so "we stress people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour even after taking the vaccination".Amid oxygen shortage in the country, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen is being produced in the country per day and 6,600 metric tonnes is being supplied to the states for medical use."Presently, we have issued instructions that, leaving a few industries, the supply of industries will be restricted so that more and more oxygen can be made available for medical use. We have allocated 6600 MT out of 7500 MT to states," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-small-number-govt-on-those-testing-covid-ve-after-taking-vaccine-dose-101619012335544.html

Thanks France esp FASF (French Air and Space Force) & French Industry for timely delivery & pilot training on schedule despite Covid-19,” the Indian embassy in France said on Twitter. Bhadauria reached France on a five-day official visit on Monday. The fighters landed at an Indian airbase late on Wednesday night.India ordered 36 warplanes from France (equivalent of two squadrons) in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal. The arrival of four jets will enable the completion of the first squadron of these fighters in Ambala and set the stage for raising the second squadron at Hasimara in West Bengal. All the 36 planes are likely to join the IAF’s fighter fleet by the year-end.Bhadauria, who visited the Rafale conversion training centre in France on Wednesday, said, “The Centre has provided world-class training and it is because of the level and quality of training that we were able to operationalise the aircraft quickly. It is to the credit of the French industry that despite the Covid-19 restrictions, they were able to meet the training requirements in time, and deliver all the aircraft so far more or less in time.” He said some planes had been delivered ahead of time.“This has really contributed to the overall combat potential of the IAF. I would like to thank the French government, French air force and the industry,” he said.The IAF has operated the fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert amid a border standoff with China and where both sides are negotiating disengagement of troops at friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).India’s Rafale jets are equipped with modern weapons such as the Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles, Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles and the Hammer smart weapon.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases such as Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions - ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry more than nine tonnes of weapons on as many as 14 hard points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-flags-off-4-rafale-fighter-jets-from-france-s-merignac-bordeaux-airbase-101619010703907.html
21-04-2021||India||IIT Kharagpur launches COVIRAP diagnostic technology||IIT Kharagpur has successfully commercialised its flagship healthcare product COVIRAP the novel diagnostic technology to zero on infectious diseases including Covid-19, the institute said Wednesday.The product, developed by lead researchers Professor Suman Chakraborty, Dr Arindam Mondal and their research group, has been licensed for commercialisation to the Rapid Diagnostic Group of Companies, India and Bramerton Holdings LLC, USA.A virtual press meet was organised on Wednesday by the institute in which the researchers were present along with institute director to make the announcement."The above move has taken place at a critical juncture when the recent spurt in Covid-19 infection, commonly known as the second wave, has been threatening to spread more rapidly than ever before," IIT Kharagpur Director Prof V K Tewari said."Moreover, the commercialisation of COVIRAP will initiate complete indigenisation and availability of a large range of affordable healthcare products in the Indian market as well as deep trenches of a large global market that is literally starving for the need of such technology," Tewari said.Bramerton Holdings has signed a record deal for securing global rights for commercially disseminating the COVIRAP technology developed at IIT Kharagpur in various geographical locations outside the territory of the Indian subcontinent, an institute spokesperson informed.Rapid Diagnostic has also initiated adapting the COVIRAP technology platform for Covid-19 and tuberculosis, in collaboration with IIT Kharagpur, the spokesperson said.The research team has now developed a more advanced version of COVIRAP using a step-wise isothermal nucleic acid testing technology for the rapid diagnostics of pathogenic infections including SARS-CoV-2 in individuals, Chakraborty said.The Covid-19 diagnostic test can be conducted directly from human swab samples in the portable device developed by the team, without requiring any separate facility for RNA extraction.The results can be made available within 45 minutes of obtaining the patient sample, he said.The kit has also been also supplemented with a free smartphone app to facilitate unambiguous results interpretation and automated dissemination to the patients.For use of the test, the nasal, as well as oral swab samples, are diluted in a solution and tested in the portable device by mixing with reagents that are supplied in a pre- mixed form, Chakraborty said, adding the test runs automatically in the device without intermediate manual intervention."We have conducted field trials for running the tests with the help of unskilled personnel outside controlled laboratory ambience, with no compromise in quality of the test outcome. The entire sample-to-result procedure may be conducted in the portable device, virtually anywhere and with minimal training thus making the process of testing more effective for community-level screening and early detection of any emerging infection outbreak."This may act as a key to arrest community level spreading of the infection," Chakraborty hoped.COVIRAP promises its reach to the grassroots level in catering to the needs of the last person of the society, he added.The researchers claimed COVIRAP test overcomes several potential bottlenecks faced by similar other tests in the past, for instance, poor performance outside highly controlled laboratory and lack of simple, affordable, yet generic and universal instrument that may be used for home-based testing and community healthcare for a wide variety of infectious and non-infectious diseases.Recognising the impact of the COVIRAP technology in meeting the long-standing demands of high-quality community- level testing, IIT Kharagpur has further initiated the procedure of deploying this product for on-campus use to detect possible novel coronavirus infection, the institute spokesperson said.Patents centred around this innovation have been filed in the India, USA, several other countries, in the name of IIT Kharagpur.The foreign filing license has been granted recently.Commercialisation and use in the USA and Europe under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) process are currently underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-kharagpur-launches-covirap-diagnostic-technology-101619009375246.html

Also, 695 people tested positive after taking the second dose of the vaccine, which is again 0.04 per cent of the 1,737,178 beneficiaries of the second jab.While 100,302,745 beneficiaries have received the first dose of the Covishield vaccine, 17,145 have tested positive after that, which is 0.02 per cent. Also, 15,732,754 people have been jabbed with a second dose of the vaccine, of whom, 5,014 have been retested positive for the infection, which is 0.03 per cent, the data showed.Also read | In second wave, India has twice the number of 2020's active Covid-19 cases: GovtWhat is breakthrough infection?Dr Balram Bharaghava, Director-General of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), who was also present at the press briefing, said, “After vaccination, if we get infection, it is known as breakthrough infection.”He pointed out the ministry’s data and said that the breakthrough infection rate for both the vaccines is “a very small number.”For Covishield, after the first dose two per 10,000 people get reinfected and after the second dose, three per 10,000 people get reinfected and for Covaxin, four per 10,000 people get reinfected after taking the first dose and the number remains the same for the second dose too, Dr Bhargava explained.Reasons for re-infectionExplaining the possible reasons behind the breakthrough infections, Dr Bhargava said that India’s healthcare and frontline workers, who were the priority list for vaccination during the first phase, were prone to more occupational exposure to the coronavirus disease.He also suggested that “the current highly transmissible” second wave of Covid-19 might also have contributed to the breakthrough infection rates.According to the Union health ministry, more than 130 million doses of the Covid-19 vaccine have been administered in the country as of 8am on the day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-is-breakthrough-infection-and-how-does-covid-19-vaccines-fare-against-it-101619009023994.html
21-04-2021||India||Oxygen reallocation to impact small business in some sectors: Crisil Ratings||Reallocating oxygen for medical purposes to take care of the rising Covid cases will have an adverse impact on small businesses in some sectors, domestic rating agency Crisil said on Wednesday.It said the "hiccup" seems temporary for now, and it is unlikely to impact the credit quality of the affected businesses.The impact will be greater for companies in Maharashtra, New Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, where medical oxygen demand has increased multiple times due to high Covid-19 caseloads, the agency added.The central government has barred industrial use of oxygen except in nine designated sectors from Thursday onwards to divert the available stocks for life-saving medicinal use.Demand for medical oxygen is estimated to have rocketed five-fold in the second week of April versus pre-pandemic levels as Covid-19 infections took off, Crisil Ratings said."The disruption in the supply of oxygen for industrial use would temporarily impact the revenues of small and mid-sized companies into metal fabrication, automotive components, shipbreaking, paper, and engineering," its director Gautam Shahi said.These sectors typically do not have captive oxygen plants and source their requirement through merchant suppliers for operations such as welding, cutting, cleaning and chemical processes, he added.Setting up an air-separation plant or importing oxygen is not a viable option because it requires significant lead time and involves relatively prohibitive costs, the agency said.Oxygen is consumed by industry in two ways – on-site and merchant sales. On-site is through captive plants for process-driven industries (including the nine sectors exempted by the government), which account for 75-80 per cent of oxygen manufactured in India, the rating agency said.The balance 20-25 per cent is supplied through merchant sales (called liquid oxygen) through cryogenic tanks and cylinders, it said, adding the healthcare sector consumes only 10 per cent of merchant sales.Its associate director Sushant Sarode said the disruption in oxygen supplies for industrial use will last for six to eight weeks as of now."Affected sectors can partly manage their oxygen requirements with the inventory. Therefore, we expect only a limited decline in revenue for them," Sarode added.However, a prolonged and intense second wave that curtails oxygen supply to industries for a longer period than expected will exacerbate the downside risk in affected sectors, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-reallocation-to-impact-small-business-in-some-sectors-crisil-ratings-101618998772797.html

The pandemic has accelerated the global demand for it. The need for oxygen has increased to 1.1 million cylinders in low to middle-income countries alone, according to the World Health Organisation.The officials said the diversion of oxygen from Tamil Nadu has affected the state’s plans to ensure a specified supply of oxygen as Covid-19 cases have been on a rise. On Tuesday, Tamil Nadu reported 10,986 cases, including 3,711 in Chennai.

He added the TNMSC has increased oxygen storage capacity and there was no shortage of drugs such as Remdesivir and vaccines.The state received 60,00,00 doses of Covishield, one of the two Covid-19 vaccines being used in India, on Tuesday and another 50,00,00 were expected shortly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-to-take-up-with-centre-the-issue-of-diversion-of-oxygen-101619006203382.html
21-04-2021||India||Delhi government gets Centre to intervene as oxygen levels plunge to critical level||Amid a depleting level of medical oxygen in various hospitals of Delhi, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government urged other state governments to not delay or obstruct the supply. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia held a press conference on the issue where he talked about how severe the crisis is and how the government is coordinating with the Centre to ensure availability of oxygen.Delhi's health infrastructure faces a severe hit as top hospitals continue to report depleting oxygen supply.India's top private hospital in the national capital, Sir Ganga Ram is the latest in the queue to announce oxygen shortage with 58 patients awaiting treatment and 35 waiting outside the hospital for admission, reported news agency ANI.The crisis is compounded by similar reports emerging from other parts of the national capital where hospitals are racing against time with their oxygen quota.St Stephen's Hospital in the Tis Hazari area is under acute shortage of oxygen with supply left for only two hours, an official from the hospital told ANI."There are around 300 Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. There is a limit of only two hours of oxygen supply. We are struggling and seek immediate help. Oxygen supplier Linde India has stopped our supply," a hospital official told ANI on Wednesday.Shortly after, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia confirmed that the oxygen supply stopped from a plant in Faridabad by a Haryana government official was restored. "Today, the central government intervened and after that, the oxygen meant for Delhi was released from a plant in Faridabad. Yesterday too, the oxygen meant for Delhi was not released from Modinagar plant. We ultimately had to call a very senior minister in the Centre late at the night and get it released," Sisodia said at a press conference.Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij, who also holds the portfolio of state’s home affairs, reiterated that his state has a sufficient supply of oxygen and it is willing to send it to Delhi but only after meeting their own demand. “We are being forced to give our oxygen to Delhi,” he alleged.On Tuesday, hospitals in Delhi said they had enough oxygen left for another eight to 24 hours, while some private institutions had enough to cater for only four or five hours.Television channels showed images of people with empty oxygen cylinders crowding refilling facilities as they scrambled to save stricken relatives in hospital."We were completely blocked out of supplies yesterday, but by the end of the day we received some and it is helping us today," said Charu Sachdeva, an official at the state-run Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre.Delhi, a city of 20 million people, recorded 28,395 new cases and 277 deaths on Tuesday, its highest tally since the pandemic began. Every third person tested for coronavirus proved positive.About 80 of 142 hospitals in Delhi had no beds left for virus patients, government figures showed.On Wednesday, India witnessed a jump of 295,041 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 2,023 deaths in the last 24 hours, both figures are the highest ever since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the latest data released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-5-hours-of-oxygen-left-at-delhi-s-ganga-ram-hospital-as-covid-19-crisis-grows-101619004402004.html

Maken sought a monthly cash transfer of ₹6,000 into the accounts of the poor, adequate food supply to the urban poor during the lockdown and dignified arrangements for the migrant workers returning to their home states.There was no immediate response from the Bharatiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-attacks-govt-for-failing-to-anticipate-second-covid-wave-101619003683661.html

"There are 21,57,000 active cases in India currently i.e. twice the number of maximum active 19 Covid-19 cases last year," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a press conference. The government, Bhushan said, plans to increase supplies of medical oxygen in the coming days even as a nationwide surge in coronavirus cases soaks up supplies. The government was also evaluating applications from suppliers overseas for oxygen imports, Bhushan said, adding that state leaders in the country should plan its use.On Wednesday, India witnessed a jump of 295,041 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 2,023 deaths in the last 24 hours, both figures are the highest ever since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the latest data released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.Comparing both waves, the health ministry officials said that the severity, virulence and demography of the victims in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 are about the same as the first wave.A total of 146 districts reported Covid-19 positivity rate of more than 15%, while 274 districts reported case positivity between 5 and 15%, Bhushan said.According to the figures shared by Bhushan, 4.03 per cent Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave in those below 10 years, while 2.97 per cent cases were registered in the second wave."In the age group 10-20 years, 8.07% Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 8.50% cases were registered in the second wave. In the age group 20-30 years, 20.41% cases were reported in the first wave, while 19.35% cases were registered in the second wave," he said.Bhushan further shared data which showed that in those aged 30 and above, 67.5% Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 69.18% Covid-19 cases registered in second wave.The officials explained the breakthrough infection, where a person tests positive for Covid-19 after taking the vaccine doses, and said that it is not worrisome. More than 21,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 after taking the first dose of either Covishield or Covaxin, while over 5,500 contracted the infection after taking the second dose, the officials said.ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said 0.04% of 17,37,178 individuals, who received the second dose of Covaxin, were positive for Covid-19, while 0.03% of 1,57,32,754 people, who took the second dose of Covishield, contracted the infection."After vaccination, if one gets infection then it is known as breakthrough infection," he said. According to the data, 5,709 people contracted the infection after the second dose of either of the two vaccines."This is a very small number and not at all worrisome. Secondly, the highly transmissible second wave also contributes minuscule to the percentage so this could have been even zero percent," he said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-second-wave-india-has-twice-the-number-of-2020-s-active-covid-19-cases-govt-101619002150831.html

The patient found a bed and was soon showing signs of recovery."Finally, it was help online that worked as people responded with information," Shiv said.India is reporting more than 250,000 new Covid-19 cases a day in its worst phase of the pandemic. Hospitals are turning away patients and supplies of oxygen and medication are running short.In response, people are bypassing the conventional lines of communication and turning to Twitter to crowdsource help for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds and other requirements.People in need and those with information or resources share telephone numbers of volunteers, vendors who have oxygen cylinders or drugs, and details of which medical facility can take patients using hashtags like #COVIDSOS.Some users have offered to help with home-cooked meals for Covid patients quarantining at home and to meet a host of other needs like arranging to feed pets."Twitter is having to do what the government helpline numbers should be doing," wrote Twitter user Karanbir Singh."We are on our own folks."Twitter is not as widely used in India as Facebook or WhatsApp but it is proving a more valuable tool to get pleas for help out in the coronavirus crisis, largely because of its "re-tweet" function that can quickly amplify a message through users' networks of contacts.A Google spreadsheet drawn up by a volunteer group that collates information on hospital beds, oxygen supplies, blood plasma and ambulance helplines in various states is being rapidly shared on Twitter and runs into dozens of pages.Bengaluru-based software developer Umang Galaiya, 25, has created a website that allows users to select the name of the city and the requirement - be it oxygen or the antiviral drug remdesivir - and then directs them to results on Twitter using its advance search feature.His website has received more than 110,000 hits."Every other tweet on my feed has been about Covid," Galaiya said."I'm glad people are finding this helpful."But for some, help comes too late.On Monday, journalist Sweta Dash posted a plea for help on Twitter to find bed with a ventilator for a pregnant woman in New Delhi. Her message spread quickly through more than 100 retweets and a Delhi government official soon suggested a hospital.But a few hours later, Dash posted another message."The patient passed away".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-becomes-platform-of-hope-amid-the-despair-of-india-s-covid-19-crisis-101618999539917.html

He added the journey normally costs ₹1,500. “Thousands of migrant workers are at bus terminals and railway junctions, and they all want to return home at the earliest.”Migrant workers began pouring into interstate bus terminals and private bus depots as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced a six-day lockdown until April 26 citing a surge in Covid-19 infections. The Covid-19 cases have risen by close to 600% in the last two weeks and inundated hospitals and triggered a shortage in critical medical supplies in Delhi.Kejriwal requested migrant workers to stay put as this was a small lockdown and promised to take care of them as part of efforts to avoid their mass exodus like during the nationwide lockdown last year.Prem Lal Rishi, 35, a daily wager migrant worker from Bihar, said he is stuck in Delhi along with his 12 colleagues. “The bus fare has increased to ₹3,000,” he said over the phone. “We are left here jobless, and the situation is more frightening than the last year.”Another migrant worker, Munna Kumar, from Purnia said they can neither eat nor sleep. “We are living here under constant fear and just want to return home,” Kumar said over the phone.Scores of migrant workers died in road accidents during the lockdown last year as tens of thousands of them walked and cycled home from big cities after losing their jobs until special buses and trains were arranged for them.At least three people in their 20s were killed and five injured after an overcrowded bus returning from Delhi with over 100 migrant labourers and students overturned in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior on Tuesday.Also Read | Delhi govt offers financial aid, free shelter and food to prevent exodusKulanand Mishra, 55, who returned home in Purnia district on Sunday, said he left Mumbai, where he works at a hotel, along with his wife and two children by a train in panic. “At Katihar junction, we had to undergo a rapid antigen test and luckily were tested negative,” he said. “We saw people falling prey to the pandemic and no help was coming from anywhere.”About 2.5 million migrant workers returned to Bihar when the national lockdown was imposed to check the Covid-19 spread in March last year, according to government data.Officials said migrant workers have again started returning also from places such as Bengaluru by trains and buses increasing the risk of transmission of the virus. Tests are mostly being conducted of those coming on trains. But hundreds coming by buses go unchecked, a district officer in Katihar said, requesting anonymityBihar on Tuesday reported 10, 455 cases and 98 deaths. The active cases in the state have gone up to 57,000 and the recovery rate has decreased to 82.99%. Minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said the state government is now better equipped and prepared for the challenge of providing jobs to the migrant workers returning home. “All the DMs [district magistrates] have been directed to provide jobs to migrants as per their skills under various government schemes... The preparedness at the district level of giving jobs is much more robust and systematic than last year,” he said. He added chief minister Nitish Kumar has urged people working in other states to return and assured them jobs would be provided.Chaudhary said the government learnt from last year’s lockdown when there was a huge inflow of migrants. “We have a database of skills of migrants who returned last year and skill mapping was done. This is being put to use for providing jobs.”The state government last year drew flak for its failure in making proper arrangements of transportation of migrant workers and for failing check migration over the last few decades.Social activist Vijay Kumar Shreevasatava said last year the return of migrant led to a huge spike in Covid-19 cases particularly in Seemanchal. “The situation this time is more frightening and the government must act as migrant workers have started returning en masse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-steps-up-surveillance-as-migrant-workers-begin-returning-101618998763623.html

21-04-2021||India||Goa healthcare under severe stress amid record Covid-19 numbers||Goa’s healthcare infrastructure was under severe stress amid a record rise in Covid-19 cases on Tuesday when infections crossed one thousand mark for the first time and 26 deaths were recorded-- the highest since the pandemic outbreak. Official data showed the positivity rate on Tuesday touched 32% -- meaning one among every three persons tested, was found positive.As it made a grim record with 1,160 infections on Tuesday, the state also witnessed a shortage of oxygen beds in government-run hospitals and a three-day backlog in releasing RT-PCR test results. Under severe stress, the government roped in the private sector to provide at least another 250 beds within a week and ordered cancellation of all non-Covid elective surgeries for a month, barely a day after the chief minister assured residents that there was no “shortage of medical facilities and expertise”.“In most cases it has been observed that the deaths occurred due to late admissions to the hospitals. Therefore, I humbly request everyone to take symptoms seriously, and if observed, to immediately rush to the nearest hospital. There is no shortage of medical facilities and expertise. Delaying medical care will only decrease chances of recovery,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday when 17 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours-- the highest daily count, before it was overtaken on Tuesday with 26 deaths. A reality check shows that while non-oxygen beds were available in Covid-care centres, oxygen beds in government-run establishments had run out. The Goa Medical College, which set aside 185 non-ICU (intensive care unit) beds for Covid care, was dealing with a patient load of 242. At the ICU, only five of the 20 beds were available as of Monday night.“[I] Couldn’t arrange a bed with oxygen for someone tonight in Goa. The patient has passed away, his wife is wailing. Young couple. In tomorrow’s health bulletin, he will be a statistic,” Shruti Chaturvedi, who has been volunteering to help patients in Goa find beds, tweeted on Tuesday.The situation on Tuesday made the CM accept that the situation was “worrisome”.“Today (Tuesday) we had 26 unfortunate deaths caused by #COVID19. The rise in cases is worrisome. A High Level meeting will be held along with the State Disaster Management Authority tomorrow (Wednesday) at the Ministerial Block, Porvorim to discuss the further plan of action to contain COVID,” Sawant said. Some new measures were expected after the meeting on Wednesday, said officials.In the interim, the private hospitals have been requested for additional beds since official records showed that several patients at the overstretched premier Goa Medical College and Hospital were left lying on stretchers.State health minister Vishwajit Rane said Goa’s private hospitals agreed to help when approached on Tuesday.“The representatives (of private hospitals) have voluntarily decided to increase their bed capacity... by reserving 250 additional beds in their respective facilities. My sincere gratitude to them for this gesture,” Rane said on Tuesday.Speaking to HT, a leading doctor at Goa’s Manipal Hospital said, over the next week, around 300 additional beds will be made available by private hospitals.“If there is coordination between hospitals then the capacity can be increased even further... some small hospitals can dedicate themselves entirely to Covid management and others can deal with others like cancer and heart patients,” said the doctor. He added that managing two categories of patients requires separate staffing, which adds avoidable stress to the system. “The government can coordinate this and have a single point of contact for those requiring hospitalisation,” he said. Rane said a nodal officer will be appointed to ensure seamless coordination.Rane also instructed the heads of departments in the state health facilities to cancel all planned non-emergency, non-Covid surgeries till 15th May, allowing only scheduled chemotherapy and dialysis.CM Sawant’s handling of the Covid-19 resurgence has been criticised, specially his persistent refusal to screen tourists. Sawant claims screening will affect tourist arrivals-- bad news for a state dependent on tourism for economic survival. His government has also not heeded to demands to postpone or cancel school examinations for class 9th and 10th.“It’s high time people impose a self-lockdown, this government just wants to fill up its pockets claiming the economy will collapse if they imposed a lockdown. Economy can never be above life,” Manthan Laad, a resident of the state, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-healthcare-under-severe-stress-amid-record-covid-19-numbers-101618997863619.html

From now, I've ordered police protection for all tankers,” the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. He adding that if state governments engage in this kind of activity, the health infrastructure will suffer.Anil Vij, who also holds the portfolio of state’s home affairs, reiterated that Haryana has a sufficient supply of oxygen and it is willing to send it to Delhi but only after meeting the state’s own demand. “We are being forced to give our oxygen to Delhi,” he alleged. There has been no reaction so far to Vij's allegations from the Delhi government of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).The allegations come against the backdrop of a shortage of oxygen reported from several states. Delhi government on Tuesday evening stated the city was facing an emergency situation and that their supply of oxygen for Covid-19 patients will last only for a few hours. However, several oxygen cylinders were supplied to hospitals in Delhi.Since Tuesday, Delhi's Ganga Ram hospital has received 4500 cubic metres of oxygen and Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) Hospital has received 10 tons of oxygen, news agency ANI reported. "This supply is sufficient for the current situation," LNJP hospital officials were quoted as saying.Haryana’s Anil Vij also spoke about the status of Remdesivir in the state and said there are two depots of the antiviral drug that is used in Covid-19 treatment. “I have deployed drug dept officials there. The movement of every vial will be recorded. Chemists have been informed to check the Aadhaar card before giving Remdesivir injections. We have already arrested four people,” he told news agency ANI.As the availability of oxygen has become crucial during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the central government has sped up efforts to meet the increasing demand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his address to the nation on Tuesday. “Centre, state governments and private sector are trying that every needy person gets oxygen. Efforts to increase oxygen production and supply are on at various levels. Measures like installing new oxygen plants, providing one lakh new cylinders, diverting oxygen from the industrial use, Oxygen Rail are being undertaken,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-haryana-oxygen-tanker-looted-by-delhi-government-alleges-minister-anil-vij-101618995594010.html

21-04-2021||India||HC verdict likely on Thursday on WhatsApp, Facebook pleas against CCI order||The Delhi High Court is likely to pronounce verdict on Thursday on pleas by social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp challenging competition regulator CCI's order directing a probe into the latter's new privacy policy.Justice Navin Chawla had on April 13 reserved judgement on the two separate petitions by Facebook and WhatsApp.While reserving its decision, the court had observed that the order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) does not reflect an investigation into abuse of dominant position and rather appears to be concerned with privacy issues of consumers.The observation came in response to CCI's stand that it was not examining the alleged violation of individuals' privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court.CCI had argued before the court that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and "stalking" of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is therefore an alleged abuse of dominant position."There is no question of jurisdictional error," it had contended and added that WhatsApp and Facebook's pleas challenging its decision were "incompetent and misconceived".  WhatsApp and Facebook have challenged the CCI's March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy.CCI had also told the court that only after the investigation can it be determined whether the data collection by WhatsApp and sharing it with Facebook would amount to an anti-competitive practice or abuse of dominant position.CCI had also contended that the data collected, which would include an individual's location, the kind of device used, their internet service provider and whom they are conversing with, would lead to creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised by way of targeted advertising and all this amounts to "stalking".The two social media platforms, on the other hand, had contended that when the top court and the Delhi High Court were looking into the privacy policy, then CCI ought not to have "jumped the gun" and intervened in the issue.They had also said that CCI's decision was an abuse of the commission's suo motu jurisdiction.They claimed that the CCI in the instant case has "drifted far away" from the competition aspect and was looking into the privacy issue which was already being looked into by the apex court and the Delhi High Court.The two social media platforms had also told the court that private conversations continued to be protected by end to end encryption and WhatsApp cannot read what people message each other.They had also contended that the most of the data generated belonged to WhatsApp as the only data provided by customers was their phone number which is required to register on the messaging platform.In January, the CCI on its own decided to look into WhatsApp's new privacy policy on the basis of news reports regarding the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-verdict-likely-on-thursday-on-whatsapp-facebook-pleas-against-cci-order-101618991792375.html

While one dose of this two-dose vaccine will cost ₹600 for private facilities, it will cost ₹400 for the state governments."For the next two months, we will address the limited capacity by scaling up the vaccine production. Going ahead, 50 per cent of our capacities will be served to the government of India's vaccination programme, and the remaining 50% of the capacity will be for the state governments and private hospitals," the world's largest vaccine maker, by the number of doses produced, said.This comes after the Centre decided to decentralise vaccine purchase and procurement while allowing everyone above the age of 18 years to get inoculated against the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.Watch: Serum Institute announces Covishield prices for state govts & private hospitalsOn Covaxin open market price, Bharat Biotech says 'never took money from govt'Announcing its decision, the government said vaccine makers — as of now Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotch — will be given the freedom to sell 50 per cent of their monthly doses in the open market, which state governments and private hospitals can buy. Without mentioning any upper ceiling of the price, the Centre said manufacturers will have to make an advance declaration of the price before May 1. "Based on this price, state governments, private hospitals, industrial establishments etc., would be able to procure vaccine doses from the manufacturers. Private Hospitals would have to procure their supplies of Covid-19 vaccine exclusively from the 50% supply earmarked for other than Govt of India channel. Private vaccination providers shall transparently declare their self-set vaccination price. The eligibility through this channel would be opened up to all adults, i.e. everyone above the age of 18," the Centre said.Covishield for corporatesAs of now, it will be challenging for SII to supply vaccine doses independently to corporate entities, CEO Adar Poonawalla said. "We would urge all corporate and private individuals to access the vaccines through the state-facilitated machinery and private health systems," Poonawalla said, adding that after four to five months when the initial surge of the demand is met, vaccines will be made available in retail and free trade.Is ₹600 costlier than private markets in other countries?Serum Institute of India has said that even at the open market, it is offering Covuishield at a comparatively affordable rate than other vaccines in the world. For example, it said American vaccines cost over ₹1,500 per dose at the private market, while the per-dose price of Russian vaccines is more than ₹750. The price of Chinese vaccines is also around ₹750 in private markets, Serum Institute said.What changes from May 1 in Covid-19 vaccination drive? FAQs answeredHere's how much you will have to pay for SII's Covishield from May 1The price will depend on where you are getting inoculated. As the Centre has notified, vaccination will continue as before in government of India vaccination centre, free of cost, to eligible population, which includes healthcare workers, frontline workers and all above the age of 45 yearsState government hospitals: ₹400 plus hospital charge, if anyPrivate hospitals:  ₹600 plus hospital charge, if any.Uttar Pradesh and Assam have announced free vaccination for people above the age of 18 years.Covishield versus CovaxinIn the first phase of vaccination which catered to healthcare and frontline workers, both the vaccines were free. In the second phase, as the drive was expanded to include senior citizens and people above 45 years of age, in a gradual manner, private hospitals were allowed to charge ₹250 per dose of either of the vaccines. In the third phase, which will begin from May 1, vaccination at the government of India centres will remain free, while private hospitals and state government hospitals will charge, according to their procurement price. So at private facilities, the price per dose may exceed ₹600 if the hospitals levy charge for administering the vaccines.Bharat Biotech has not yet announced its open market, per-dose price, but its chairman Dr Krishna Ella reportedly said he would like to get the maximum price to cover all costs, including the ₹350 crore that the company spent on clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-will-cost-rs-600-per-dose-at-private-hospitals-rs-400-at-govt-101618989125065.html
21-04-2021||India||'For a few industrialists': Rahul Gandhi compares vaccine policy with note ban||Drawing a parallel between the Modi government's decision of demonetisation and making Covid-19 vaccine available in the open market with 'liberalised' pricing, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi on Wednesday said that both the decisions are alike as they both benefit a few industrialists.Though the Congress leader, who has recently tested covid positive, has been pitching for allowing the vaccine to all those who need it, instead of limiting it to a specific age group, Rahul Gandhi criticised the decision of letting vaccine makers declare their price as it would affect the poor, he said.केंद्र सरकार की वैक्सीन रणनीति नोटबंदी से कम नहीं- * आम जन लाइनों में लगेंगे* धन, स्वास्थ्य व जान का नुक़सान झेलेंगे * और अंत में सिर्फ़ कुछ उद्योगपतियों का फ़ायदा होगा।The common man will have to stand in a queue, which will cause more suffering both health- and money-wise, Rahul Gandhi said, like what happened during demonetisation when people queued up in front of banks to get their old notes of ₹500, and ₹1,000 get exchanged.Vaccination has taken a 'divisive' turn after opposition or Congress-ruled states complained of a vaccine shortage. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan dismissed the complaints and said those were efforts to cover up the inefficiency of the state governments. In a reply to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's letter to PM Modi on vaccination, Vardhan slammed Congress members and accused them of fuelling "vaccine hesitancy".Slamming the Gandhi family for its politicisation of the vaccination, BJP leader Sambit Patra on Wednesday said, the nation is watching how the Gandhis are criticising an issue that should not be politicised. "When things shouldn't be politicised, Congress, especially Gandhi family is doing politics. Priyanka Gandhi gave an interview and Rahul Gandhi tweeted. The nation is watching how they're criticising and it will reply. Gandhi family's arrogance is being reflected," the BJP leader said.The Gandhis are not the first to criticise the government's open vaccine policy, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday questioned the Centre's decision to make vaccine available in open market at a time when states are complaining of shortage. "Yesterday the PM said the medicine (vaccine) will be available in open market. Where is the open market, where is the availability? You have already shipped out the majority of stock to foreign destinations," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-a-few-industrialists-rahul-gandhi-compares-vaccine-policy-with-note-ban-101618988744580.html

The commission could not find any evidence to the contrary, he added. One of the members of the enquiry commission said that the enquiry report was submitted to Uttar Pradesh’s home department and the Supreme Court on Monday after distilling the facts of the case for around eight-nine months since the enquiry commission was set-up. He refused to get into the details of the findings.A UP home department official confirmed that the commission found no evidence against the state police. He added that the commission noted in the report that no one from the public, media or Dubey’s family came forward to present any proof against the police or to challenge their claim. He said the commission probed the matter nearly for around nine months before submitting its report.The Uttar Pradesh police had claimed that it shot down notorious gangster Vikas Dubey in a genuine encounter after he tried to escape from police custody during the transit following his arrest in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain. Dubey and his gang members had earlier killed eight policemen including deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Devendra Mishra in Kanpur’s Bikru village on the intervening night of July 2 and 3, 2020.The incident led to an uproar over the law and order situation in the state and allegations that Dubey was under political patronage and his arrest could spill the beans on the alleged deep nexus between criminals, politicians and the police.UP police formed several teams to catch Dubey, who was finally arrested outside the famous Mahakal temple in Ujjain on July 10 last year. He was gunned down while being brought back to Kanpur by UP police. The police claimed that Dubey tried to escape from police custody after snatching a pistol from one of the police personnel, when a SUV carrying him met an accident and flipped on the outskirts of Kanpur. Dubey’s five associates were also killed by UP police in encounters between July 3 and 10, 2020.It led to widespread allegations that the encounters were staged, following which, the three-member enquiry commission, comprising justice BS Chauhan, retired Allahabad high court judge SK Agarwal and retired UP director general of police (DGP) KL Gupta, was formed in the last week of July 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vikas-dubey-encounter-judicial-commission-gives-clean-chit-to-up-police-101618986222242.html

21-04-2021||India||On Covaxin open market price, Bharat Biotech says 'never took money from govt'||As the Centre has now 'liberalised vaccine pricing so that vaccine manufacturers can sell 50 per cent of their v in the open market— keeping the other 50 per cent for Centre — the pricing remains a contentious issue. Dr Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech which made Covaxin has said he would like to get the maximum price to cover all costs, including the ₹350 crore that the company spent on clinical trials, Mint reported.Speaking at the 6th National Leadership of All India Management Association, Dr Ella said Bharat Biotech had not asked the government for any money for the clinical trials or any advance money for increasing the capacity of vaccine manufacturing. To meet the demand of phase 3 of the vaccine drive, which will begin from May 1, Bharat Biotech is setting a target of producing 30 million doses, which will soon be accelerated to 70 to 75 million doses per month.The Centre has approved a payment of about ₹4,500 crore as advance to Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech — the two vaccine makers of the country, for ramping up their supplies. Out of this ₹4,500 crore, Serum will get ₹3,000 crore and Bharat Biotech will get ₹1,500 crore.Though Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla and Bharat Biotech MD Dr Krishna Ella have not anything explicitly on the pricing, reports suggest that the price of Covaxin and Covishield in the open market can be around ₹1,000 per dose, while in government facilities, vaccines will remain free. Both the companies supplied vaccines at a subsidies rate of around ₹200, which was later negotiated to ₹150, to the Centre for the first and second phase of vaccinations in which healthcare workers, frontline workers, people above the age of 45 years were inoculated. For people above 45 years, the government allowed private facilities to charge a maximum of ₹250 for each dose of the vaccine, which includes ₹150 for the vaccine and ₹100 as the service charge.For the open market, the Centre has not fixed any upper limit. What it has said is that the makers will have to announce a transparent price before May 1, while it will set aside the other 50 per cent for the Centre. Serum Institute will supply 200 million doses and Bharat Biotech will supply another 90 million doses to the government by July at the pre-agreed rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-covaxin-open-market-price-bharat-biotech-says-never-took-money-from-govt-101618982372146.html

A decision is likely to be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray by Wednesday evening, said state health minister Rajesh Tope after the meeting.Currently, the state has 782,953 isolation beds, 72,869 oxygen beds, 24,986 ICU beds, 10,629 ventilators. In terms of district-wise health facilities, Thane, Pune, Raigad, Ahmednagar, Jalna, Beed, Latur, Parbhani, Hingoli, Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia and Chandrapur will have no facility for any new patient by May 2. On the contrary, everyone will require additional isolation beds, oxygen beds, ICU beds and ventilators, according to the projection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-519-deaths-maharashtra-records-highest-single-day-covid-toll-101618975061758.html
21-04-2021||India||Daily deaths cross 2k for the first time, new cases near 300,000||For the first time, more than 2,000 people lost their lives to Covid-19 in a single day across India, even as daily infections neared 300,000 on Tuesday, as the country struggled against a second wave that has sparked shortages of hospital beds, oxygen, and medicines.India reported 294,284 new cases on Tuesday, taking the total number of infections to 15.6 million. A total of 2,020 new deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Tuesday, the highest ever, pushing the total number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 182,591, according to HT’s dashboard.India’s daily death count has exceeded 2,000 once before on July 16 last year, when there were 2,006 deaths lodged, but that number was inflated due to Delhi and Maharashtra adding around 1,500 deaths that had previously gone unreported.Tuesday was the fifth day in a row that the single-day fatalities in the country have broken all previous records. The seven-day average of daily deaths now stands at 1,490, and has surpassed the peak seen during the first wave of the outbreak – on average, 1,169 people died for the week ending September 16.The average positivity rate – the proportion of tests that return positive for Covid-19 – has now soared to 16% in the past week, the highest ever recorded in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-deaths-cross-2k-for-the-first-time-new-cases-near-300000-101618973588521.html

But in this phase vaccine manufacturers will be allowed to provide 50 per cent of their production to the open market after declaring a fair price.Uttar Pradesh and Assam have already announced that vaccination in these states will be free of cost — irrespective of whether it's a private facility or a government facility."Corona will be decimated, India will win," Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is under Covid-19 treatment at present, tweeted on Tuesday, announcing the Cabinet's decision to make vaccination free in the state.प्यारे प्रदेशवासियों, आज मंत्रिपरिषद की बैठक में यह निर्णय लिया गया है कि उत्तर प्रदेश में 18 वर्ष से अधिक आयु के सभी प्रदेशवासियों का कोरोना टीकाकरण @UPGovt द्वारा निःशुल्क कराया जाएगा।कोरोना हारेगा, भारत जीतेगा...Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that the state will utilise the funds collected in Assam Arogya Nidhi and will provide vaccines free to everyone above the age of 18 years. The state has already placed an order of one crore doses of Bharat Biotech's Covaxin, the minister said.Assam will give FREE vaccines to everyone from 18-45 years. GOI is giving free vaccines for 45 +. Funds collected in Assam Arogya Nidhi last year shall be utilized for procurement of vaccines. Today itself, we’ve placed orders for 1 cr doses with @BharatBiotech.@PMOIndia pic.twitter.com/U6hutOEOhgThe Maharashtra government has decided to import vaccines from other countries and, for this, funds allocated to other departments will be diverted, the government of the worst-hit state by the pandemic has decided."We have decided to cut the expenses of all the departments and divert the funds for vaccine procurement. We will not limit our plans only to the two vaccines that are manufactured in the country (Covishield and Covaxin)," Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said. The state is planning to bid for Sputnik V, Pfizer and Moderna if they are available.In the first phase of vaccination, which began on January 16, the Centre provided free vaccines to healthcare workers and frontline workers. In the second phase of vaccination, senior citizens and people with co-morbidities above the age of 45 years were made eligible for vaccination that remained free at government facilities and was charged ₹250 per dose at private facilities. The phase from April 1 was extended to everyone above the age of 45. Till then, vaccine procurement was being done centrally. But as states are accelerating the pace of vaccination to keep up with the rapid spread of the infection, the Centre's supply to the states is depleting fast and vaccine centres are facing temporary closure.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-for-all-above-18-what-up-assam-maharashtra-plan-for-phase-3-from-may-1-101618972601313.html

Expert answers||As India reels under the second wave of Covid-19 infections, many people who have tested positive for the coronavirus disease are isolating themselves at home. With the states trying to ramp up testing and hospital infrastructure, patients who are asymptomatic or are not very critical have been advised to quarantine and take precautions at home.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereIndia’s total infection tally has surpassed 15.5 million and the active caseload stands at 2,031,977. On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of those who died due to the virus and said, “The challenge is huge, we have to overcome it collectively with determination, courage and preparation.”While the government has decided to widen its immunisation programme and vaccinate all citizens above 18 years of age, it shared the suggestions of Dr CS Pramesh, director Tata Memorial Hospital, on what medicines to take if someone has tested Covid-19 positive.Here’s a look at Dr CS Pramesh’s adviceWhat medicines definitely help in Covid-19?Unfortunately, very few. What definitely works is proning and oxygen (when saturation is low), and steroids (Dexamethasone) for moderate to severe diseaseWhat medicines should you take if you have Covid-19?*If your oxygen saturation is fine and you have no symptoms other than fever, all you need is Paracetamol*There is some data that inhaling Budesonide helps you recover faster, but no hard endpoints like reduced mortality*There is no evidence to suggest that anything helps - including Favipiravir/Ivermectin. Don't waste your time desperately trying to procure themWhat about Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma?*Remdesivir doesn't work in all patients, probably a small subgroup of those requiring oxygen, but not sick enough that they require ventilation. And even here, it doesn't reduce mortality, probably helps early recoveryWhat medicines should you take if you have #COVID19? How much do Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma help? Take a look at the key information around #COVIDVaccines by @cspramesh you MUST know! #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/RU2xJ6VfaY*Tocilizumab also helps only in very specic subgroups - those requiring rapidly increasing levels of oxygen or rapidly deteriorating respiratory parameters,*There is even less evidence to support the use of Convalescent Plasma for Covid-19. Almost all studies done so far have shown that it is of no benefit*Please allow your physician to decide when Remdesivir/Tocilizumab is required. There are very limited situations when they are beneficial and please don't pressurise the physicians to prescribe it - much of the shortage today is because of unnecessary prescriptions||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-medicines-should-you-take-if-you-have-covid-19-expert-answers-101618972562236.html

She will be handed over to the Delhi Police when they arrive here. More facts about the girl are being gathered,” said Chhavi Singh, Inspector at the local women police station.According to the girl’s brother, she is around 15-year-old, police said.Meanwhile, the Bajrang Dal activists claimed that the girl was introduced to the 24-year-old man, a resident of Bareilly’s Fatehganj area, almost a year ago. Today, the man, along with his parents, was trying for a court marriage using forged papers, they alleged, adding that they got information about it on Monday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ruckus-outside-bareilly-court-over-love-jihad-101618971621654.html

21-04-2021||India||Maharashtra lockdown? Uddhav Thackeray likely to announce decision today||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to announce whether the state needs to be placed under a strict lockdown — in his address scheduled after 8pm on Wednesday, Maharashtra ministers have confirmed. On Tuesday, the issue of a stricter lockdown was discussed in the Cabinet where the majority was in favour of a long lockdown in the state, extending for a week or two, instead of night curfew or the imposition of Section 144."Tomorrow after 8 pm, the Chief Minister will announce the decision on lockdown in the state. We have requested the CM to announce a complete lockdown in the state from tomorrow at 8 pm. This was the request of all ministers to the chief minister. Now it is his decision," Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said.Maharashtra urban development minister Eknath Shinde said there is no way out other than a complete lockdown as the health infrastructure of the state is under severe strain. "We have demanded complete lockdown in today's cabinet meeting. The cases are increasing. There is a scarcity of oxygen. There is no way out other than a complete lockdown," Shinde said.Food and civil supplied minister Chhagan Bhujbal said, "We have made all the efforts to minimise the Covid-19 figures. He will announce the decision (to impose lockdown) tomorrow after finalising a detailed Standard Operating Procedure."Covid-19 situation in MaharashtraOn Tuesday, Maharashtra reported 62,907 fresh Covid-19 cases and 519 deaths. Out of 519 deaths, over 200 were from last week and before, but was added to the toll on Tuesday, the health department clarified. The number of active cases in the state stands at 6,83,856.Why stricter lockdown?Since February, the state is seeing a sharp spike in the number of fresh cases. Restrictions in the forms of district lockdown, local lockdown, night curfew, were put in place since the last week of February. In April, the state has been brought under Section 144, which bars the gathering of more than four people. All shops except those dealing with essential items have also been closed. But an official lockdown has not been announced in the state. The need for an official lockdown is being felt as people are still flouting the existing restrictions.The state cabinet has also cancelled class 10 exams.Lockdown last resort?Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Tuesday said lockdown should be the last resort to combat the present situation and more focus should be given to creating micro-containment zones.Since February, Maharashtra has been averting a complete lockdown but, as Cabinet ministers have emphasised, stricter restrictions seem to be the need of the hour in the state.What will a stricter lockdown be like?In the set of curbs that have been announced in March and April, public transport has not been curtailed. This time if the state goes for a full lockdown, public transport services, including that of Mumbai locals, may strictly be brought down. The government has already revised the timing of essential shops and allowed them to function between 7am and 11pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-lockdown-uddhav-thackeray-likely-to-announce-decision-today-101618969523556.html
21-04-2021||India||US 'very closely' tracking course of Covid-19 outbreak in India||United States is "very closely" tracking the course of the Covid-19 outbreak in India, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price has said.The statement from Price comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday and discussed US-India cooperation on climate change, Covid-19, and other global challenges and pledged to remain in close contact on these and other issues of mutual concern."There are protocols in place, requiring testing for international travel. What is true is that we are tracking the course of the COVID outbreak in India very closely as I mentioned before, Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Jaishankar did discuss it yesterday," Price said in a statement on Tuesday."We are committed to doing what we can both at the present. And going forward, to see to it that this virus is brought under control and I spoke again of our engagement with the who are funding to COVAX, the Quad arrangement that of course implicates. What we're seeing in India," he added.Price further said that Secretary Blinken consistently makes the point that as long as the virus is out of control and is uncontained anywhere around the world, it continues to present a risk to the American people.On the Covid-19 vaccine, Price said, "Our priority is ensuring the distribution of a safe and effective vaccine to millions of Americans to all Americans who are able to take advantage of it. But we also know that we need to continue to demonstrate that leadership.""When it comes to countries beyond our borders and that's precisely what we've done, as I mentioned before, we've re-engaged. The who we've committed USD 2 billion to Kovacs another USD 2 billion over time, we've spoken to our partnership with Canada and Mexico," he added.Price further stated that it is not only in US' interest to ensure that the American people are vaccinated, the "only other point I would make is that the rest of the world also has an interest in seeing to it that the American people are vaccinated and that the virus is brought under control"."US has more deaths than any other country around the world. More than 550,000 at this point 10s of millions of cases. So, again, as long as the virus is uncontrolled anywhere, it is a threat to people everywhere. That is true in the United States. That is true in countries around the world. And it's precisely why we are taking this, this approach," he said.US' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has already advised its citizens to avoid travelling to India amid a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in the country.In a statement, the CDC on Monday said: "Because of the current situation in India even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants and should avoid all travel to India. If you must travel to India, get fully vaccinated before travel. All travellers should wear a mask, stay 6 feet from others, avoid crowds, and wash their hands."The Covid-19 situation in India has been deteriorating amid the second wave of coronavirus infections. For the past four days, the country has been reporting in excess of two lakh coronavirus infections and over 1,000 related deaths on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-very-closely-tracking-course-of-covid-19-outbreak-in-india-101618966441770.html
21-04-2021||India||Kerala health minister denies allegations CM Vijayan flouted Covid-19 norms||Kerala health minister KK Shailaja on Thursday denied allegations that state chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan has violated Covid-19 protocols. She was reacting to Union minister V Muraleedharan's 'Covidiot' remark."I do not know he made the allegations on what basis. Kerala CM has not violated any Covid-19 protocol. People holding positions should not make such remarks," Shailaja said.Upon his discharge, Muraleedharan had slammed Vijayan by calling him 'Covidiot'. "Covidiot, you know what it means. There is no other word that can be used for a chief minister who continuously violates Covid-19 protocols. As per doctors of Calicut Medical College, the Kerala CM tested positive on April 4 and on April 6 he voted without following the protocols," the minister said.The health minister further said as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Centre's guidelines, asymptomatic patients can be discharged after three to four days and can be treated at home. "But in Kerala, we are following a 10-day discharge policy to make sure everyone is safe," Shailaja added.She further said the Kerala chief minister was asymptomatic and was shifted to the hospital to carry out tests. "He was shifted to carry out tests, before which he was in home quarantine. During the process of the test, he turned Covid negative and is now in home quarantine. Where is any Covid-19 protocol violation in all this?" she asked.Vijayan was on Wednesday discharged from Kozhikode Medical College after treatment. He was admitted to medical college on April 8 after being diagnosed with coronavirus disease (Covid-19). After seven days, he got tested negative and was subsequently discharged.Opposition parties, Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have sought action against him for allegedly flouting Covid-19 protocols.On Wednesday, Kerala reported 8778 new Covid-19 infection cases, 2,642 recoveries and 26 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-health-minister-denies-allegations-cm-vijayan-flouted-covid-19-norms-101618486210685.html

Kumbh is held periodically at four different locations in India -- Nashik, Haridwar, Prayagraj, and Ujjain. In normal circumstances, Kumbh continues for nearly four months but this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the duration of the congregation has been curtailed to one month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nsa-doval-never-wrote-any-letter-praising-kumbh-conduct-report-101618962274228.html
21-04-2021||India||Second wave may derail economic gains: Analysts||The raging second wave of Covid-19 infections in India is threatening to derail the gradual recovery the economy has achieved in the last one year, the trajectory of the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) indicates.It took almost a year for NIBRI to reach close to 100, which captures the pre-pandemic levels of activity. It reached 99.3 in the week ending February 21. In the eight weeks since then -- latest data is available for the week ending April 18 -- it has fallen continuously and come down to 83.8.NIBRI was lower than 83.8 in the week ending October 25, 2020. It was 83.3 that week. The disruptive effect of the second wave can be understood from these numbers. It took seventeen weeks for NIBRI to reach from 83.3 to 99.3. But it has just taken eight weeks for it to undo those gains.Experts believe that the worst is yet to come as more states resort to restrictions to prevent the surge in infections from overwhelming medical infrastructure. “While lockdown stringency has not increased since last week, this may be temporary, as states could impose stricter restrictions in response to the burdening of hospital infrastructure,” said a note by Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi. “This suggests the economic impact of the second wave could intensify in coming weeks, particularly through the mobility route, with the downside risk of spreading to the wider economy, even as power demand and labour participation rate so far remain largely unaffected,” the note added.While the note believes that “business resumption index (NIBRI)... probably has yet to bottom”, it sees the economic impact as “short-term (one-three months) and less severe (than in Q2 2020), due to a more pandemic-adept economy”.“Overall, we expect a loss of sequential momentum in Q2 2021, but once the second wave passes (we assume July-September), it should result in a release of pent-up demand in the subsequent quarters. In addition, the economy should benefit from faster vaccinations after June, the lagged impact of easy financial conditions, front-loaded fiscal activism and strong global growth. We expect GDP growth at 11.5% y-o-y in 2021, up from - 6.9% in 2020, with downside risk,” Varma and Nandi said.Also read: Maharashtra warns of strict lockdown as curbs roll out elsewhereOther experts believe the pace of vaccinations will be critical to minimising the damage to the economy. A research note by Pranjul Bhandari at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Private Limited said that “the growth cost of these (Maharashtra and Delhi) lockdowns could be 1% of the country’s GVA in the June quarter and could rise further, if they are extended or replicated by other states”. The key to economic recovery would be the pace of vaccinations, Bhandari argued.“A scenario analysis suggests that, if India manages to gradually ramp up vaccine supply and the vaccination rate rises from 3m doses/day now to about 5m doses/day by August, it could cover about 50% of the population (two doses/person) by the end-2021,” her note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-may-derail-economic-gainsanalysts-101618957694367.html

Now when the number of cases in the second wave of Covid is spiralling like anything, the Centre has chosen to tactically indulge in empty rhetoric and shy away from its responsibility for making available vaccines to the people of the country,” Banerjee wrote.She pointed out that the announcement made on Monday did not address major issues like ensuring quality, efficacy and stable flow of supply of required number of doses by the manufacturers. “It is apprehended that the announced policy might lead to unscrupulous mechanisms in the market, including pricing of vaccines as it appears to be based on market prices which may put the common people under huge financial burden,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-vaccine-policy-hollow-mamata-to-pm-101618953799911.html

21-04-2021||India||ICSE cancels Class 10 examinations||The Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) late on Monday withdrew its previous decision to postpone Class 10 exams and announced it was cancelling the tests to ensure the safety of students at a time when the Covid-19 outbreak in the country is “worsening”. Class 12 tests will, however, be held at a later date.The board said earlier it will defer both Class 10 (ICSE) and Class 12 (ISC) exams, initially scheduled from the first month of May. It gave Class 10 students the option to either write the exams later, or get evaluated on the basis of an alternative criteria.“Given the present worsening situation of Covid-19 pandemic in the country, the CISCE has decided to cancel the ICSE (Class 10) 2021 examination... The safety and well-being of our students is our topmost priority and of paramount interest,” CISCE chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon said in a statement on Tuesday.With Monday’s decision, Class 10 students no longer have the option to appear for the exams. They will, instead, be evaluated on a “fair and unbiased” criteria for evaluation. “The criteria on which basis the results will be declared for the ICSE (Class 10) students and the date of result declaration will be announced by CICSE later,” Arathoon added.The board’s announcement also comes days after the central government directed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to cancel the Class 10 board exams and postpone the Class 12 tests.The Class 12 (ISC) tests still stand postponed, as per the notification issued by the board on April 16, and a decision on the new dates will be taken in June. In 2020, over 200,000 students appeared for the ICSE Class 10 exams and over 88,000 students for Class 12 exams across the country.This is also the second year in a row that students will not appear for the Class 10 exams. The CISCE exams were cancelled in 2020 shortly after the pandemic took hold in India. Students were then evaluated on the basis of internal assessment. Students of both classes 10 and 12 were assessed based on the best three percentage marks obtained in subjects for which board exams had already been conducted and the marks of their internal assessment as well as their projects were taken into account.Parents said that they were relieved. “With the rising infections, it is best not to have exams altogether. The previous circular would have led to confusion and two students from the same class would be evaluated on different marking criteria,” said the parent of an ICSE-affiliated school in Goregaon near Mumbai.Kavita Sanghvi, principal of Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School, in Mumbai’s Vile Parle said, “Students are happy and parents are concerned about the internal marking, report cards and the desire to know how the board plans to work out the logistics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/icse-cancels-class-10-examinations-101618945838692.html
21-04-2021||India||Use lockdowns only as last resort: PM to states||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday asked state governments to consider lockdowns as the last resort in the fight against coronavirus, urging people to adhere to Covid-19 protocols and maintain discipline to help the government save both lives and livelihoods.Modi’s televised address to the nation came at a time when most states have imposed night curfews and restrictions on assembly and movement of people. Several big states, such as Maharashtra, have shut down commercial establishments and curbed attendance in office and some, like the national capital, have imposed lockdowns to arrest the second wave of infections.But the Prime Minister asked the states to focus on micro-containment zones instead. “We have to save the country from lockdown. States should consider using lockdown as the last resort…if we all follow Covid-19 norms, there will be no need for a lockdown,” he said.In his 20-minute speech, Modi empathised with the pain of those who lost loved ones to the virus, sought the help of children to publicise Covid-19 norms, asked states to look after migrant workers and hailed the country’s scientists and health care professionals. He also said the government was committed to increasing the country’s hospital beds and oxygen supply. The country posted 294,284 new cases on Tuesday, taking the total number of infections to 15.6 million. A total of 2,020 deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Tuesday, the highest ever, pushing the total number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 182,591, according to HT’s dashboard.The Opposition blamed Modi for not taking specific steps to arrest the second wave of infections. “Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the nation was again today nothing but empty talk,” said Congress general secretary Ajay Maken.Also read | UP to administer Covid-19 vaccines to beneficiaries free of cost: CM AdityanathA day after opening up the vaccine drive to all adults, the PM spoke at length about the research and development of indigenous vaccines and pointed out that the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive started with two made-in-India vaccines. “Today, the cheapest vaccines are available in India,” he said.Modi also touched upon the exodus of migrant workers from major cities to the countryside – a sample of which was seen in Delhi this week after the government announced a weeklong lockdown – and urged state governments to take migrant workers into confidence. “States should ask migrants to stay put. This will help gain their trust that they will get the vaccine and not be forced to stop their work,” he said.For the first time, the Prime Minister also turned to children—who played a major role in making Swachh Bharat a success—and sought their help in curbing transmission of Covid-19 disease. “I want to say one thing specifically to my child friends. They played an important role in Swachh Bharat. Now you should create such an atmosphere at home that people do not leave the house unnecessarily without work or any reason. Your determination can bring big results,” the PM said.He also asked young people to make small committees in residential societies, apartments and neighbourhoods to help bring Covid-19 discipline. “If we do this then governments will not need to impose curfew or lockdown,” he said.The PM narrated how India improved its health and medical infrastructure to combat the pandemic last year. Acknowledging that demand for oxygen was very high in some areas, Modi said, the Centre, states and the private sector are all working to ensure enhance oxygen supply. “As soon as Covid cases increased, our pharma sector also increased production of drugs. Our drug production is higher than what it was available in January-February. Now production will increase even more. We are taking help from everyone to increase production. We are lucky that we have such a big pharma sector,” Modi said.In recent days, several states have flagged a critical shortage of medicines, oxygen and hospital beds as a spike in Covid cases has overwhelmed the medical infrastructure. Modi said that oxygen plants in states, diversion of industrial oxygen supply, 100,000 cylinders and oxygen trains were being used to augment supply.The PM tried to address public concerns over shortage and said efforts are on to quickly increase hospital beds. He said people shouldn’t give in to fear or misinformation and emphasised that India can defeat the Covid storm. He appealed to people to help the needy. “As a member of the family, I share your pain. The challenge is great but with preparation, commitment and courage, we can overcome this,” he said.The Congress criticized the speech. “The Prime Minister addressed the nation in the middle of a full-blown catastrophe….however, he chose to relinquish all his responsibilities and put the onus of saving India on NGOs, youth and bal mitras. He put the onus of doing whatever little possible on state governments,” said Maken.“Sub text of @PMOIndia‘s speech. Guys you are on your kind of on your own . If you are able to finally make it to the other side we will definitely meet again in some Utsav or Mahatsov. Until then all the best. May God be with you,” tweeted senior leader Manish Tewari.“PM Modi’s address reads as an admission that Covid wave 1 centralised response, including national lockdown, didn’t work. Wave 2 response is now a state problem further decentralised to mohala committees. What a difference a year makes,” said National Conference leader Omar Abdullah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-lockdowns-only-as-last-resort-pm-to-states-101618945213238.html
21-04-2021||India||Kerala HC dismissesex-minister Jaleel’s plea against verdict of Lokayukta||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala High Court on Tuesday rejected a writ petition filed by former state higher education minister KT Jaleel questioning the verdict of Lokayukta that found him guilty of nepotism and misuse of official position. Following the verdict, Jaleel had to resign from the Pinarayi Vijayan cabinet last week. Later, he moved the high court saying he was not heard properly, and natural justice was denied to him. But a division bench comprising Justices P B Suresh Kumar and K Babu refused to intervene and dismissed his writ. Jaleel, who is considered close to the chief minister Vijayan, landed in trouble in 2018 after he appointed his second cousin KT Adeeb as the general manager of the Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation Limited flouting all norms. Adeeb was forced to resign after a big uproar. Later, VK Mohammad Shafi, a supporter of the Muslim League, field a compliant with the Lokayukta, which found that the minister had violated all rules to appoint his relative and he was not fit to continue as a minister. After his exit, Jaleel on April 13 filed a writ petition in the HC to set aside the Lokayukta verdict on the ground that procedures were not complied with in the case. The advocate general also said the verdict was not as per rules and can be challenged. Even though the appointment was made on the direction of the minister, relaxation on eligibility condition was approved by the chief minister, according to details of the leaked files, seen by HT. But the high court refused to entertain his contention, observing that it lacked any merit and upheld findings of the anti-corruption body. The court found that the Lokayukta was acting within the scope of its powers while arriving at the conclusion. “We are of the view that the petitioner has not made out any ground for the inference in the final opinion formulated by the Lokayukta under Article 226 of the constitution,” the court observed while rejecting his plea. With the high court rejecting his writ, opposition parties stepped up pressure for the resignation of the CM. “The CM was a party to the whole crime. Relative’s qualification relaxations and appointment were approved by CM Pinarayi Vijayan. If he has some decency and propriety left in him, then CM should quit,” opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. However, the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) kept away from the latest verdict, saying Jaleel moved the court in his individual capacity. “Jaleel has already resigned from the ministry. As an individual he has every right to question the verdict against him,” said party acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. Earlier, Jaleel was questioned by officials of customs and Enforcement Directorate on several occasions in connection with the gold and dollar smuggling cases. His phone number was found in the call list of Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the gold smuggling case. Jaleel later admitted that he called Suresh as an employee of the consulate in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate last year.But his clarification invited more trouble, with experts saying he was not supposed to accept any fund or freebies without the consent of the ministry of external affairs. They added that it was a clear violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). During the investigation in the gold smuggling case, customs officials found that a heavy consignment came on March 4, 2020, in 31 bags, weighing more than 4,000 kg, which were taken to Malappuram. The minister later admitted that he took those packets to his constituency, claiming they carried religious books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-dismissesex-minister-jaleel-s-plea-against-verdict-of-lokayukta-101618945180316.html
21-04-2021||India||Congress: modified vaccine policy ‘regressive, inequitable’||A day after the Centre modified the vaccination policy, the Congress on Tuesday alleged it will overburden the states, encourage profiteering, and worsen inequality as people below 45 years will only get Covid-19 doses through private sales. The party also said the modified policy might lead to unhealthy price bidding in the absence of a price ceiling for vaccine doses.In a press conference, senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and Ajay Maken said the details of the modified vaccine policy show it was “regressive and inequitable” as states with limited resources will be at a “considerable disadvantage” to fund the vaccines for those under 45.“States that are already weighed down by shrinking GST revenues, lower tax devolution, reduced grants-in-aid and increased borrowing would have to bear this additional burden. Meanwhile, nobody knows where the thousands of crores of rupees collected under PM-CARES are being deployed,” Chidambaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-modified-vaccine-policy-regressive-inequitable-101618945060834.html
21-04-2021||India||‘We’re doomed’: Delhi high court slams central govt on supplies||In a slew of directions to the Centre on Tuesday amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi high court on Tuesday directed immediate implementation of an order to stop oxygen for industrial use to meet the demand by hospitals, ramping up of medicine supplies and vaccinating more people.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said that economic interests cannot override human lives and in wake of the hospitals running low on oxygen. The bench directed the Centre to “forthwith” implement its order, which was to come into force from April 22, to prohibit the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except for those that fall in the exempted category.The court asked the Centre as to why government was waiting till April 22 to implement the order “when the needy are dying due to the shortage of oxygen”.“Economic interest cannot over right the supplies. Otherwise we are heading for a much bigger disaster. The exempted ones can consider on cutting down their supply, maybe shut down a part. A large population is not infected and we have to save it. We may lose a crore people in the country if we don’t act in time,” the high court said.“The need for oxygen is now. Any delay in this regard will lead to loss of precious lives. We direct the Centre to implement this decision forthwith and make oxygen available to needy hospitals which are running out of their supply,” the bench said in its order.Also read | For migrants: ₹5,000 aid to 171,861 registered workers, free food and medicines at 205 sheltersThe court observed that even if some industries have to cut production, they can do so, for saving lives. “Shortage is now. You have to do it (ban) now. Look into taking some oxygen from steel and petroleum industries. They have big pockets and big lobbies, but tell them if they have to cut production, then they can cut production. Lives have to be saved,” the bench said during the 3-hour-long hearing on a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, who sought ramping up of tests in the city.The court asked the Centre to meet the representatives of the steel and petrochemical industries and issue an appropriate order to divert a portion of their oxygen for medical needs for a period to tide over the prevailing pandemic.The petition, which was disposed of already, was revived by the HC on Monday, noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and that the “healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.Ramp up medicine suppliesTaking note of the shortage of various life saving drugs amid the raging pandemic, the court on Tuesday asked the Centre to speak to the drug manufacturing companies and ask them to ramp up their production on “war footing”. It asked the centre to dynamically review the supply of Remdesivir injection and other medicines required.“Centre should dynamically review the needs for the supply of the reserve. This is essential to maximise the life saving drug. … Centre is directed to interact with the license holders and forthwith ramp up the production capacities,” the bench said, adding that action can be taken against the violators under the Drug Control Act.“Ramp up production on war footing….Encourage to grant voluntary licenses. If such efforts do not fructify, the government should not hesitate to invoke the jurisdiction power since the lives of the people which are being lost at a fast rate in the country take priority over everything else. Even as such powers are used, the manufacturers can be compensated by paying fair license fee,” the court said.Representing the Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra said that the hospitals in the capital were facing major shortage of oxygen. Mehra said that despite the court’s direction on Monday to M/s Inox, a private oxygen supplier, for giving 140 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi as agreed, not even a bit of it has been given to the city.The petitioner, Rakesh Malhotra, told the court that Gangaram Hospital, which is a dedicated Covid hospital is reportedly having acute shortage with supplies left for just a few hours.Nipun Vinayak, joint secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, told the court that according to a formula devised by the experts 378 metric tonne oxygen is being given to the Delhi. Mehra said that a law and order situation will be created in Uttar Pradesh if the oxygen is diverted to the national capital.The court, while taking note of this, issued a notice to M/S Inox and directed its MD to appear before the court on the next date of hearing. It also issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and posted the matter for hearing on April 22. Inox is the main supplier of oxygen to Delhi.Stop wastage, vaccinate moreDuring the hearing, the court also expressed serious concerns about wastage of Covid-19 vaccines, and stressed on the need to vaccinate more and more people. It asked the Centre and the Delhi government to see if it is possible for it to devise ways and means to select volunteers below the age of 45, who could be called to take the vaccine from the doses that are left after opening a vial.The court noted that a vial of vaccines have 10 doses and with the current scenario, vaccines are being wasted and not being utilised. Quoting a news report, it said that 44 lakh doses had to be thrown in the dustbin out of the 10 crore allocated to the states.“If we wait for 10 days, the problem may persist. We are losing valuable and young lives. The pandemic does not discriminate. Whosoever needs vaccines, give them. Everyone needs vaccination.”“In our view, wastage of a single vaccine is a criminal waste. The governments would look into the situation for full utilisation of the vaccine. Both governments to see whether it is possible for the governments devise ways and means for selecting volunteers below the age of 45 who could be called to take the vaccine in which the doses are left so they are fully utilised. This facility is available in the US,” Justice Sanghi said.Simplify testingThe bench also said that immediate action needs to be taken by the Centre to ramp up testing by simplifying the process. It said the current practice of mandatory filling a form despite the Aadhaar card of the individual being provided, is a waste of time and should be done away with.It also said that the officers should be sensitised and there should be urgency in completing work and giving clearances for setting up of new lab equipment.“We are informed that the equipment for setting RT-PCR test labs are imported...It is essential that all such medical equipment and other things should be cleared at top priority to the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/divert-all-oxygen-to-hospitals-immediately-hc-tells-centre-101618945060181.html
21-04-2021||India||SC stays court order on lockdown in 5 UP districts||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the Allahabad high court order on virtually imposing a lockdown in the five worst Covid-19 hit districts of the state for at least two to three weeks.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, ordered an interim stay after the state government moved an appeal against the high court order passed a day ago.The development came on a day chief minister Yogi Adityanath imposed a weekend curfew from 8pm on Friday to 7am on Monday in districts with at least 500 active cases. The curfew will not apply to essential services.“Please leave home only if urgently necessary,” he tweeted. The state reported 29,574 cases and 162 deaths on Tuesday.In the apex court, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the UP government, complained that the judicial direction regarding complete lockdown in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Kanpur Nagar, Varanasi and Gorakhpur was not warranted as the state was mindful of the situations and was already taking all possible steps to contain the spread of Covid-19.“Several steps are taken in that direction and we can satisfy the conscience of this court. Some of them, we are already doing and we don’t object to some other. But it may not be the right approach to order lockdown in five cities because there are several other factors that also need to be considered,” argued the S-G.Accepting Mehta’s submission, the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, ordered an interim stay on the high court order, recording Mehta’s statement that the state has issued several directions to contain the spread of the virus and was taking adequate precautions.At the same time, the SC directed that the “state government shall immediately report to the high court about the steps it has taken and proposes to take in the immediate future within a period of one week in view of the current pandemic.”The court, however, decided to keep the matter pending before it and appointed senior advocate PS Narasimha as the amicus curiae (friend of the court) to assist it in the case after two weeks.Also read| Congress: modified vaccine policy ‘regressive, inequitable’On Monday, the Allahabad HC directed the UP government to strictly enforce closure of all establishments (government or private) in Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar and Gorakhpur till April 26The order was passed by a bench of justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar. It noted the recent Covid-19 surge in these cities has ‘virtually incapacitated’ Uttar Pradesh’s entire medical infrastructure.Late on Monday, the state government said there would be no statewide lockdown or any fresh restrictions in the five cities. The state government also rushed to appeal against this order before the SC. Advocate Rajat Nair drafted the appeal overnight and the S-G secured an urgent hearing from the CJI on Tuesday.The state government, in its appeal, said that although the intention behind the HC order was laudable and salutary, the HC has failed to appreciate that it encroached upon the executive domain and has passed a mandamus, which was incapable of being executed at the present stage, and if executed, would result into panic, fear and law and order situation in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-court-order-on-lockdown-in-5-up-dists-101618944998495.html

21-04-2021||India||Countries restrict travel from India as cases spike||The US, the UK, Singapore and New Zealand are among the countries that have imposed fresh restrictions on travellers from India or issued advisories against travelling to India following a massive spike in coronavirus disease cases that could spur similar actions by more nations.On Monday, India recorded nearly 274,000 new infections and the total number of confirmed cases was more than 15 million. Countries around the world have watched warily as the number of cases has grown, especially in the past two weeks, and high-profile visits and summits have been called off.The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), late on Monday, advised Americans to avoid all travel to India even if they are vaccinated. CDC placed India among “level 4” countries, or those with “very high” levels of Covid-19 cases.“Because of the current situation in India even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants and should avoid all travel to India,” CDC said.Also read| ‘We’re doomed’: Delhi high court slams central govt on suppliesSingapore’s health ministry announced on Tuesday that Covid-19 border measures will be tightened for travellers from India, who will have to stay at home for an additional seven days after the mandatory 14-day stay at dedicated facilities. The new rule will come into force from Thursday.New Zealand, which has worked assiduously to keep infection rates low, was the first country to act as cases increased in India. On April 8, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced New Zealand was temporarily suspending the entry of travellers from India, including its own citizens, for two weeks.The move followed New Zealand recording 23 new positive cases at its borders, including 17 from India.Hours after the cancellation of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India on Monday, India became the 40th country to be included in Britain’s travel “red list”. Most travellers, except British and Irish passport-holders, coming from or transiting through India won’t be allowed to enter the UK from April 23.Many experts believe the UK had held off on including India in the red list because Johnson planned to go ahead with his visit on April 25. Britain’s decision also followed the detection of more than 100 cases of the Indian “double mutant” variant of the coronavirus.Pakistan on Monday put a ban on travellers from India for two weeks, citing the spread of the new coronavirus variant. The National Command and Operation Centre placed India in the “list of Category C countries” and said there would “be a ban on inbound passengers coming from India via air and land routes”.Hong Kong suspended flights from India, Pakistan and the Philippines from Tuesday for two weeks after a mutant Covid-19 variant was detected in the financial hub for the first time. The three countries were classified as “extremely high risk” after multiple cases of travellers carrying the strain into Hong Kong in the past fortnight.Authorities in Hong Kong said on Tuesday that 53 passengers on a flight from New Delhi to the city tested positive for Covid-19.Flights from India continue to be Canada’s top source of international passengers testing positive for Covid-19, Toronto Sun reported on Tuesday. Data from Health Canada showed nearly all of the twice-daily flights between Delhi and Toronto carried passengers infected with the Coronavirus. Thirty of the 106 flights carrying infected passengers into Canada since March 4 originated from Delhi, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/countries-restrict-travel-from-india-as-cases-spike-101618944879129.html

The total length of the project is 58.19 km with a total completion cost of the project pegged at around ₹14,888 crore.“The Govt has approved Bangalore Metro Rail Project Phase 2A from Central Silk Board Junction to K.R. Puram and Phase 2B from K.R. Puram to Airport via Hebbal Junction of total length 58 km. The total completion cost of the project is ₹14,788 Crore,” the office of Piyush Goyal, the minister of railways, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday.The proposal to fund the lines was made in the Union budget this year.“Implementation of the project will provide the much-needed additional public transport infrastructure to Bangalore (Bengaluru),” a statement by the Union cabinet said.“The Metro Project in itself is an innovation over the conventional system of urban transport. The project involves integration with other urban transport system in an efficient and effective manner which is possible only by adopting innovative methods of designing, technology and institutional management,” the statement added. The approval of the two lines will breathe life into a project that aims to reduce the commute time for people traveling to the airport from the southern and eastern parts of the city.The metro line between CSB and KR Puram is around 18 km and is expected to be completed by April 2025 and the line between KR Puram to the airport, which is around 38 km, is scheduled to be operational by September 2025, according to the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL).With over 9.4 million vehicles in around 800 sq km, Bengaluru was adjudged to have the world’s worst traffic congestion in a 2019 survey by TomTom, a Netherlands-based global provider of navigation, traffic and map products. According to the ninth edition of TomTom’s Annual Traffic Index, Bengaluru beat 415 other cities across 57 countries to gain the infamous tag in 2019.Successive state governments in Karnataka have continued to feed the metro as a possible solution for the growing congestion in the city, especially during peak hours.However, the delays in completing Metro projects have added to the challenges of the city’s infrastructure and its plans to get more people to use public transport to bring down congestion and rising pollution levels.“The project will streamline the urban transportation system in Bengaluru, which is stressed due to intensive developments, increase in the number of private vehicles and heavy construction in the city putting stress on travel infrastructure and industrial activities and to provide the people a safe, secure, reliable and comfortable public transport,” the Union cabinet note said.The city administration is putting together plans to encourage more non-motorised transport (NMT) and other options to get more people on the public transport system and ditch their dependence on private vehicles.“Union Cabinet approves two crucial Metro Rail routes in Phase 2A & 2B - from Silk Board to K.R. Puram & K.R. Puram to Intl Airport, of total length 58 km. This will boost public transport infra in Bengaluru. Thank you Hon’ble PM @narendramodi Ji,” said a tweet from the official handle of the chief minister.The Covid-19 pandemic has forced more people to switch and depend on private vehicles to commute within the city for fear of contracting the infection in public transport like buses and the Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-clears-14-888-cr-b-luru-metro-project-101618944698390.html
21-04-2021||India||Day after 5 held, efforts to trace 900 patients who took fake remdesivir on||Bengaluru: Mysuru police have started a survey to identify at least 900 patients who were injected with fake remdesivir, said an officer aware of the development. The process began after the police arrested five people, including a nurse at a private hospital in Vidyanagar in Bengaluru, for selling fake remdesivir. A person identified as Girish was arrested by police on Monday following a raid. “We have been receiving information about the sale of Remdesivir in the market and our officers were tracking the lead. One of the leads led to Girish and we arrested him after sending decoy to purchase the vials,” said Mysuru police commissioner Dr Chandragupta. During the investigation, police had a doubt about the quality of the vial. “When we checked for the source of his supply, he was not able to give a proper answer. When we continued to question him on his supply, he claimed that he was selling fake medicine,” the commissioner added. Many vials labelled as remdesivir, but actually filled with paracetamol in liquid form and saline solution, have been seized during the raid, said police. According to the national treatment protocol, remdesivir is one of the investigational drugs approved for use in treating hospitalised Covid-19 patients. The drug has been in huge demand ever since pharmacists ran out of stock and the state government began supplying it directly to hospitals. According to police, Girish has been selling fake remdesivir since last year. He would collect used bottles of the medicine and fill it with cheap antibiotics or just saline solution, police said, adding that he has sold at least 900 to 1,000 vials to customers in Mysuru, Bengaluru and other places. Police have arrested four more people. A couple who was supplying the empty bottles to Girish and two medical representatives who were helping Girish sell the fake medicines. Their identities were withheld since the investigation is still underway. The Mysuru police commissioner admitted that police have a big task to identify those who have taken the medicine. “We are already on it. We are collecting information from the accused and we will be tracking down the patients who have taken medicines. Since he has been doing this for nearly a year now and was selling the fake medicine at MRP, there were a lot of customers,” the commissioner added. Reports of shortage of remdesivir injections increased in Karnataka as the number of Covid-19 cases continued to surge. According to medical practitioners, the anti-viral injection, which costs between ₹1,000 and ₹5,500 depending on the brand, was being sold for ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in the black market. On Thursday, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai warned of action against those spreading rumors about the shortage. Bengaluru police on Sunday arrested at least three persons for allegedly hoarding and black marketing remdesivir. The CCB (central crime branch) conducted a drive across Bengaluru and arrested the three accused who were having illegal stock of the injection and were selling them at ₹10,500 each, which is much higher than the MRP. A total of 11 vials of injections were seized during the raid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-5-held-efforts-to-trace-900-patients-who-took-fake-remdesivir-on-101618944639036.html
21-04-2021||India||Migrants head home amid lockdown fear||Bengaluru: Amid a steep rise in number of Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru, migrant workers are heading back home fearing an impending lockdown in the state even as railway authorities say there have been “no extra demand for trains”. Karnataka recorded 21,794 new infections and 149 fatalities on Tuesday.Jitendra Thakur, a barber from Samastipur Bihar, staying in a shared room in the Bengaluru’s Babusapalya, said his employer has been trying to convince him that there will not be a lockdown in Karnataka but he doesn’t want to take a chance. “Everyone I speak with says there will not be a lockdown, but that’s what they said last time also. There was no warning before they stopped the trains,” he said sitting on the plastic chair, which was to be handed over to his friend. Thakur was among the many migrant workers who left Bengaluru during the exodus in May 2020. He returned to Bengaluru in October after he got a call from his employer. “I was lucky that I got a Shramik train last time, but if that happens again, I’m not sure if I’ll be lucky again,” he added. The availability of transportation is the difference between last year and this said Chandrabhushan Sahani, a carpenter with an online platform and who had hitchhiked to Bihar from Bengaluru during the 2020 lockdown. He said that he had no choice but to return to Bengaluru. “There were not enough jobs back home, so we returned. Now, trains are still running. That is a good sign. We can go anytime we need. But we are unsure if they will shut it down. There is a lot of talk about a lockdown,” he said. A senior office-bearer of the Karnataka Hotels and Restaurants Association, who didn’t want to be named, said that hotel owners have been going the extra mile to convince their employees to stay back. “The news that coming in, may it be the lockdown in Mumbai or speculations over the lockdown in Bengaluru, getting them worked up. We hope there is a firm stand from the government soon. If the employees start to leave, it is going to hurt the business,” the person added. Gayathri Vasudevan, CEO and co-founder of LabourNet, a Bengaluru-based social enterprise working in the unorganised sector said that those who left Bengaluru during the last lockdown are still returning. “Labourers who returned during the last lockdown are returning to Bengaluru. This has been going on for several months. Yes, there are some who are returning to their home state as well, but it is not in a large number like what is happening in New Delhi or Mumbai” she said. She, however, added that the fear of the lockdown could adversely affect this process. “A sense of fear of a lockdown among workers, this could lead to many those who left during Holi and other festivals not returning,” Vasudevan said. The Bengaluru division of the South Western Railway (SWR) said there was no extra demand for the trains until last week, and this week, they added four additional trains due to high demand. A senior SWR official on condition of anonymity said that while two of the trains will be operating to West Bengal, the other two will run till Assam and Bihar. “Naturally, these trains have been added because there is a demand for them. However, I can’t tell if there is an exodus happening from Bengaluru. As far as the department concerned, we have added extra trains due to the demand,” he said. However, over last week, Ashok Kumar Verma, Divisional Railway Manager, Bengaluru Division clarified that there was no rush at the railway station and added that the department is running enough trains to cater to the demand. Last Wednesday, he said, “As per the request from the Karnataka government, we had operated 20 extra trains in the view of Ugadi, festival holidays and strike by State Road Transport Corporation employees. We are ready to run more trains if required. There is no extra demand for trains apart from this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-head-home-amid-lockdown-fear-101618944578409.html
21-04-2021||India||India stays at 142nd position in World Press Freedom index||India remained at the 142nd position among 180 countries in the World Press Freedom index published on Tuesday, with the report saying that the country was among nations where reporting on the Covid-19 pandemic was blocked or seriously impeded.The report, published by the non-profit press freedom organisation Reporters without borders (RSF), classified India among the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists.India was ranked in the “bad” category, along with Brazil, Mexico and Russia. In south Asia, Nepal was placed 106, Sri Lanka 127, Myanmar 140, Pakistan 145 and Bangladesh at the 152nd spot. China was ranked 177, and the US 44.“With four journalists killed in connection with their work in 2020, India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists trying to do their job properly. They are exposed to every kind of attack, including police violence against reporters, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials,” said the report.Norway topped the index for the fifth year in a row.The report labelled 132 countries as “very bad”, “bad” or “problematic”. It stated that the pandemic was used as means to deny journalists this access and promote government sponsored propaganda regarding the Covid-19 outbreak. “Data shows that journalists are finding it increasingly hard to investigate and report sensitive stories, especially in Asia, the Middle East and Europe,” the report stated.India drew flak for “extremely violent social media hate campaigns” against journalists who “dare to criticise” the government. “The coordinated hate campaigns waged on social networks against journalists who dare to speak or write about subjects that annoy Hindutva followers are terrifying and include calls for the journalists concerned to be murdered. The campaigns are particularly violent when the targets are women,” said the report.The report on the Asia-Pacific region said journalists who criticised the government were branded as “anti-state,” “anti-national” or even “pro-terrorist” by supporters of the ruling BJP”.HT reached out to the ministry of information and broadcasting for a response but did not receive one immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-stays-at-142nd-position-in-world-press-freedom-index-101618944218527.html

21-04-2021||India||Election Commission says no proposal to merge last two Bengal election phases||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Wednesday said that it had received no proposal to merge the last two phases of the ongoing assembly election in West Bengal.ECI officials also refuted a report, published in HT on Wednesday, that observers in the state had told the poll watchdog that clubbing the two phases was possible if more security forces were granted.The HT report, citing senior election officials, had said that poll observers -- Ajay Nayak and Vivek Dube -- wrote a letter to ECI late last week, saying that the seventh and eighth phases of the Bengal elections, scheduled on April 26 and 29, could be merged if extra security forces are provided.The report cited a senior election official who said he had reviewed the letter. HT did not independently see the letter.According to the official, the observers told ECI that the last two phases could be merged due to the surge in infections but such a step would need 500 additional companies of security forces. Each company has about 80 personnel."ECI has neither received a letter from observers, nor is ECI mulling over any proposal to club the phases," said an ECI spokesperson.The sixth round of the eight-phase polls, comprising 43 seats, is on April 22.Another EC official said that merging phases was problematic at this stage on several counts. “Extra forces is just one part of it -- they are posted across the country, and sending them to Bengal needs advance notice and that would be ideally three to four months earlier,” said the second official on condition of anonymity. He also added that any changes would violate the candidates’ right under the Representation of the People’s Act 1951.The debate over the final phases of the high-stakes election comes amid a spike in infections in Bengal. The state logged 9819 cases -- its highest -- and 46 cases on Tuesday, according to the HT dashboard.The last two phases of elections comprise 71 seats in central and south Bengal, and parts of the state capital Kolkata.To control rising cases, the commission has extended the silent period for campaigning from 48 to 72 hours, banned public meetings and road shows between 7 pm and 10 am and threatened penal provisions against any political party or candidate found violating Covid-19 protocol at public events.The Bharatiya Janata Party, Trinamool Congress and Congress-Left alliance have all scaled back their campaign and public events. The BJP will limit its rallies to 500 people and focus on digital outreach and chief minister Mamata Banerjee will not campaign in Kolkata, save one symbolic event on April 26. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has cancelled all his rallies in the state and the Left has scrapped all big rallies.Banerjee has repeatedly asked for merging the last few phases of polls, citing rising Covid-19 cases. TMC MP Derek O'Brien said the party reiterated their demand in a letter to ECI on Tuesday.On Monday, Union home minister Amit Shah said that each candidate had to be given a certain number of days to campaign and it was the constitutional duty of the commission to ensure that an appropriate amount of time is provided. “Constitutionally, the EC has no other option but to conduct elections. Mamata ji makes comments without reading the Constitution,” Shah had said.(The story has been changed from its previous version after a more elaborate response from the Election Commission of India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-elections-can-club-two-phases-if-forces-boosted-ec-told-101618943798396.html
21-04-2021||India||New B.1.618 variants now among most sequenced||A previously unknown Sars-Cov-2 variant has now started to emerge in samples analysed in India by scientists to check for mutations, according to experts and new analyses that show one of these changes is the same one found in the Brazilian and South African variants of the coronavirus.This particular change is known as E484K, and it has been strongly linked with the virus becoming more resistant to antibodies created by vaccines or a past infection. It has been found in a variant now labelled as B.1.618, which has been reported in West Bengal, from where some of the highest numbers of sequencing has been carried out.Also read| Boost testing, hospital infrastructure for next 3 weeks: Centre to UTsDetails about its spread come days after genome sequencing data indicated a large presence of another known variant first found in India, the B.1.617, often referred to as the “double mutant”.Both these variants are now considered variants of interests (VOIs), and scientists are studying whether it can make the coronavirus more transmissible, more lethal, or more resistant – clues that are crucial to determine whether the intensity of India’s current wave of infections is because of these.Data submitted from India to the global repository GISAID shows the B.1.618, at 12%, is the third most common variant sequenced in the last 60 days. The B.1.617, at 28%, is the most common among sequences, followed by B.1.1.7 (the UK variant), the India Mutation Report by Scripps Research showed, citing the GISAID data.“The particular variant had appeared some time ago in West Bengal, however we did not study the mutations and its clinical significance in detail as the so-called double mutant variant (B.1.617) out-competed it. The B1.618 variant has plateaued at about 25% of the total mutations reported from Bengal; B1.617 has become predominant. Across the country, there are some districts in states such as Maharashtra where the prevalence of the variant in as many as 80% samples,” said Dr Saumitra Das, director, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, which is one of the 10 laboratories in India’s consortium on Sars-CoV-2 genome sequencing (INSACOG).“What the impact of this variant or B1.617 would be on the vaccine efficacy etc. is all a matter of predictions. It is thought to evade the immune response because it contains the E484K mutation. We will be able to tell the clinical significance of these mutations only when we test it in animal system,” he said.The institute is currently in the process of collecting and growing in laboratory samples of the mutated variants of the virus to establish whether they actually aid the virus in escaping the immune response from vaccines and previous natural infection.A variant can contain multiple mutations, which are not unusual – particularly for RNA viruses such as Sars-Cov-2 – but since late last year, some of them have made the virus “fitter” – particularly the UK variant, which spreads much more readily than its ancestor – and the South African variant, which appears to cause more repeat infections and make vaccines less effective.According to the analysis at outbreak.info, 129 of the 130 B.1.618 sequences in India were in samples from West Bengal. India accounts for 62.5% of the B.1.618 variants reported in the world. The variant was first found in a sample outside of India on April 22, 2020.Experts tracking India’s genomic surveillance said that while specific tests are required to determine the implications of the virus, India needs to sequence and share details of more samples.“India has 8,455 publicly available genomes and around 14 million cases so far. That is 0.06% of cases sequenced. Ideally, we’d want that number to be between 2%-5%, which is in line with successful genomic surveillance programs in other countries,” said G Karthik, researcher at Scripps Research Institute, which has put together the mutations tracker at outbreak.info.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-b-1-618-variant-now-among-most-sequenced-101618943738393.html
21-04-2021||India||SC lays down timeline for HC judicial appointments||The Supreme Court on Tuesday prescribed a judicially mandated timeline for the Union government to make appointment of judges in the high courts, underscoring that “promptness in this process [is] to facilitate the larger cause of dispensation of timely justice”.The court, for the first time, indicated an outer time limit within which the Centre is expected to process the names for appointments of the high court judges, besides notifying appointments once the names are reiterated by its collegium. While the existing Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) that guides judicial appointments has not suggested any period within which the Centre is supposed to forward the recommendations to the Supreme Court collegium, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, set down 18 weeks to complete this process.“The High Courts are in a crisis situation,” said the bench, which also included justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant, as it regretted that the high courts have a shortage of around 40% judges, requiring a “collaborative” exercise involving the judiciary and the government.Breaking down the total time period of 18 weeks, the bench held that after high courts send their recommendations to the Union law ministry, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) should not take more than eight weeks to give its inputs to the ministry regarding the proposed names.Also read: CBI may take few more days over probe against Anil DeshmukhAfter receiving the inputs from the IB and the state government concerned, the Centre should process these names within eight to 12 weeks, and send them to the Supreme Court collegium with their comments for a final approval, taking a maximum 18 weeks in the entire process.As laid down in the MoP, the Supreme Court collegium, led by the CJI, will send its final recommendations in the next four weeks, and these recommendations will preferably be put up before the Prime Minister, who will advise the President in the matter of appointment. The court has said that in case the government has any reservation regarding certain recommendations, those names may be sent back to the Supreme Court collegium with specific reasons.However, the bench held, if the collegium reiterates the recommendations unanimously, “such appointment should be processed and appointment should be made within three to four weeks”. The current MoP does not lay down a timeline also for the cases when collegium reiterates names.The court also emphasised the requirement of the chief justices of the 25 high courts to recommend vacancies as early as possible, and as and when new vacancies arose, irrespective of whether their old recommendations were cleared or not. By prescribing the timeline, the bench dismissed a contention that this subject was beyond the ambit of judicial directives. It noted that the restraint imposed by the Constitution bench in the Third Judge’s Case (1998) related to the judicial review of particular appointments, and not to the aspects of the appointment processes such as delays. The order by the apex court came at a time when high courts in the country have a staggering vacancy of 411 judges -- more than a third of the total positions, as on April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-lays-down-timeline-for-judicial-appointments-in-high-courts-101618943679720.html
21-04-2021||India||CBI may take few more days over probe against Anil Deshmukh||Though 15 days have passed since the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on the orders of Bombay high court to investigate allegations of corruption and extortion, the agency may take few more days to conclude its findings, two people familiar with the development said on Tuesday.The reasons for not concluding the preliminary probe are the complex nature of the investigation, CBI’s internal mechanism of reviewing a case at various levels, and unforeseen delays due to surge in Covid-19 cases, they said, adding that the agency does not want to rush its probe though it has recorded the statements of most of the key people in last two weeks.“The Supreme Court order doesn’t mention that we have to mandatorily finalise the PE in 15 days. It says we must enquire the allegations as soon as possible, preferably in 15 days,” said one of the officers cited above.“As a rule, the 15-day deadline, or any deadline given by courts, to conclude enquiry/investigations begins from the day CBI receives the certified copy of the order of that particular court -- in this case agency received the copy of Bombay high court order on April 12, so we still have 5-6 days,” he added.In the last two weeks, a CBI team led by superintendent of police Abhishek Dular has recorded the statements of Deshmukh; his two personal assistants Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde; former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who levelled the allegation that the former state home minister asked suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from bars, restaurants, hotels,and other sources in Mumbai; deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal; advocate Jayshree Patil, who is a petitioner in the case; assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil; hotel owner Mahesh Shetty; Vaze; several other Mumbai police officers; and some other hotel and bar owners.It has also scrutinised records – financial documents, statements of witnesses and people arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) during its February 25 Antilia bomb scare conspiracy and March 5 Mansukh Hiran murder probes.The agency declined to comment if the investigating officer (IO) has submitted his findings, but a second officer said that there was scrutiny at multiple levels in CBI before the report in finalised.The PE will be converted into a first information report (FIR) only if there is “prime facie” (at first sight) evidence against Deshmukh, and the agency feels there is need to further investigate the allegations, the second officer said.Deshmukh, who resigned at Maharashtra’s home minister hours after a CBI probe into Param Bir Singh’s allegations, has consistently denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-may-take-few-more-days-over-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-101618943618279.html

21-04-2021||India||States plan vaccine expansion, PM asks firms to raise capacity||Maharashtra became the first state on Tuesday to announce that it will directly buy coronavirus vaccines from next month and Prime Minister Narendra Modi met executives from the key manufacturers and promised support as India prepares to massively ramp up the campaign from May 1, when all adults become eligible for doses.Prime Minister Modi asked the executives of six companies during a meeting on Tuesday to “continuously scale up production capacity” in order to deliver doses for all adult Indians “in the shortest possible time”, assuring smooth and quick approvals for their candidates if they are approved elsewhere.“The government ensured that all the vaccine manufacturers not only get all possible help and logistic support, but also the process of vaccine approval is speedy and scientific,” Modi said, according to a government release.On Monday, the government allowed vaccine makers to offer shots via the open market and make direct deals with state governments, a channel that is likely to also be the only option through which people between the age of 18 and 44 may be able to receive the doses. The centrally sponsored drive will continue to be restricted to those above the age of 45, and will remain free of cost.The Uttar Pradesh government decided it will pay for the vaccines of all adults above the age of 18, although it was not immediately clear whether the state will buy doses directly or create a mechanism that could involve reimbursing private hospitals for doses to these groups.Vaccine makers separately confirmed they were ramping up production. The maker of Covaxin, Bharat Biotech, on Tuesday announced they will scale up manufacturing capacity to 700 million doses annually.The company, as well as Serum Institute of India, which makes Covishield (the other vaccine in use in India), were recently given a ₹4,500 cr credit line (of which SII gets ₹3,000 cr) to expand their capacities. SII too has said that it will ramp up production to 100 million doses a month soon from its existing capacity of 60 million doses.Also read: Rahul tests Covid-19 positive, PM wishes quick recoveryA third coronavirus vaccine likely to be available soon is the Russian Sputnik V, which has tied up with India’s Dr Reddy’s for distribution. According to a person aware of the specifics, the first batches of Sputnik V – which was approved by India’s regulators earlier this month -- is likely to be imported by the end of April or early May.“Once more vaccines come into the market, and the existing companies begin scaling up, the supply chain will further strengthen. We should be able to see the difference by June,” said an official aware of the vaccination planning, asking not to be named.Modi’s meeting included executives from SII, Bharat Biotech and DrReddy’s, as well as Biological E, Gennova and Zydus Cadila. Biological E has tied up with two American vaccine developers -- J&J and Biological E -- while Zydus Cadila and Gennova are testing their own candidates.Officials in various states also said they were expecting guidance from states on how to go about sourcing doses. In a special cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Maharashtra government decided it will use the state’s development funds to procure vaccines, including those which may need to be imported, state health minister Rajesh Tope said.“We currently have two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, but if the need arises, we have also decided to import stock of other vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Sputnik from other countries,” Tope said after the meeting.Health department officials said the state will also have to take a call on which section of the 18-44 age group it would bear the vaccination cost for, as well whether it would need to exercise control over how many vaccine doses can private hospitals buy. This will prove vital to ensure equitable vaccination for all, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-plan-vaccine-expansion-pm-asks-firms-to-raise-capacity-101618943378337.html

By doing this, state governments will neither be required to create containment zones nor impose curfews or lockdowns,” PM Modi said in a virtual address to the nation on Tuesday night on the prevailing pandemic situation in the country.Prime Minister Modi made an appeal to children as well, asking them to create such an atmosphere in their homes that their family members don’t go outside without any work or any reason. “Your Zidd (stubbornness) can bring huge results.” he added.India’s Covid-19 disease caseload went over 15.3 million after 259,170 cases and 1,761 deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) dashboard earlier in the day. There are 2,031,977 active cases currently while recoveries stand at 1,3108,582. Death toll, meanwhile, is at 180,530.PM Modi also informed in his virtual address that work was on to increase the number of hospital beds, adding that large Covid dedicated hospitals were being built in some cities. “The Centre, state governments and private sector are trying to make oxygen available to all those who are in need of it. Many steps are being taken in this direction,” he said. The Prime Minister’s assurance came after some states and UTs reported a shortage of beds, oxygen and essential drugs such as Remdesivir to treat the infected patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-in-pm-modi-s-address-to-nation-an-appeal-to-his-young-friends-101618934305248.html
