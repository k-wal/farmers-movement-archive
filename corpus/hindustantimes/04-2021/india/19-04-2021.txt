"Our own region is witness that wars are no longer confined to the customary hard core kinetics but being increasingly contested in the ambiguous grey zone," he said.The Army Chief said India has more than 15,000 kilometers of land borders alone. "We have strong relations with our neighbours based on shared culture, history and people to people linkages. We however have active and unsettled borders to our west with Pakistan and to the north and east with China, and of course, there are associated challenges," he said.He said the country, over time, has developed various mechanisms to address these challenges and move forward."As you would appreciate progress and development of any nation and the well-being of its citizenry are, to a large extent, contingent on peace and tranquillity on the borders. On our western borders, we have recently entered into a ceasefire understanding with Pakistan Army in February this year, and since then there has been no exchange of fire on an otherwise active Line of Control. This bodes well for the future," he said."With China too, there have been positive developments along the Line of Actual Control, an area where both countries have differing perceptions on the alignment of the land borders. This has led to disengagement of troops in Eastern Ladakh," he added.The Army chief said the two countries have recently concluded the 11th round of Corps Commander level talks and "we hope to settle our other border through further negotiations"."The recent comments of Ambassador Sun Weidong, the Chinese Ambassador to New Delhi to avoid relapse and jointly safeguard peace and tranquillity in border areas augers well for the future of India-China relations," General Naravane added.He also talked about 'strong historical and cultural linkages' with Nepal and Bhutan, and said, "the large community of retired soldiers from Indian Army's Gurkha Battalions of Nepal Origin, form a strong connect with the people of Nepal. Similarly, with Bhutan, the Indian Army shares strong institutional linkages, which has stood the test of time."He said India looks to maintain peace and harmony with all its neighbours and in the region.Maintenance of peace and tranquility requires joint efforts. All nations need to come together to uphold Rules Based Order, respect International Laws & norms and develop mutual respect for each other. Legacy issues and differences need to be resolved through mutual consent and dialogue and not by unilateral actions," he said.The Chiefs of Japan Ground Self Defence Forces, Australian Army, Indonesian Army and Singapore Army also took part in the symposium.General Naravane said geo-strategic spaces are being constricted and geostrategic realities are being altered without physical battles."Conflicts are also steadily moving to the new domains of space, cyber and informatics," he said.The Army chief said that the stretching of domains has made the physical boundaries meaningless and leveraging technology has become a key determinant in future wars."Capability development is an ongoing process and the Indian Army is also on the path of modernization towards a 'Technology Oriented Army'. We are conscious that niche technologies including AI, autonomous and unmanned systems, long-range precision technology, Internet of Things, 5G and Quantum Computing, to name a few, need to be acquired to remain and capable to face future threats," he said."However, even as we move to a Technology Empowered Army, the peculiar unsettled nature of our borders means that the requirement of 'Boots on Ground' cannot be simply wished away," he added.Speaking about India's Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative, the Army Chief said for a country like India, self-reliance has become a strategic imperative."We have launched the 'Atmanirbhar Bharat' initiative to achieve self-reliance through Indigenization. But Indigenous production or Make in India does not mean that we close ourselves to others and produce everything. In today's world integrated by technology, this is simply not possible. In our quest for self-sufficiency, we look towards others for support and cooperation," he said.General Naravane said that the nascent but rapidly growing defence sector in India offers new prospects and opportunities to its friends and partners to be part of its growth story."With a strong IT sector and a booming start-up culture, we look at joint ventures and technology cooperation with others. A large number of foreign companies are already moving base to India and setting up new plants. For the Indian Armed Forces, this means better options and customized solutions," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/need-to-resolve-legacy-issues-through-dialogue-not-unilateral-actions-naravane-101618854929347.html
19-04-2021||India||Uttar Pradesh: Simplify hospital admission process of Covid patients, Priyanka tells Adityanath||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Monday slammed “red-tapism” in Uttar Pradesh, alleging that lives were lost because Covid patients needed permission from the district chief medical officers to get admission in hospitals.In a letter to Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, the Congress general secretary urged the creation of a database of available hospitals and beds to that people can seek admission directly.She claimed there are reports from many places in the state that Covid-19 patients require the CMO’s permission for hospital admission.Patients are waiting for hospitalisation for a long time and their families are running around from one place to another, she said citing “information” received by the party.“Many people have lost their lives due to this system," the letter in Hindi alleged.Priyanka Gandhi said she has been told that people who try to get oxygen cylinders face a similar situation as they need permission from the district magistrate.“An unfortunate incident took place outside the oxygen factory in Lucknow's Talkatora Industrial area, when people standing in a line attacked government officials,” she said.Police, however, said nobody was attacked.Priyanka Gandhi asked what should those in home quarantine do if their condition worsens and they need oxygen.The Congress leaders said there is already a terrible crisis of oxygen beds in hospitals and in such a situation, "this step of your administration is fatal for those who are treating Covid-19 at home".She said at a time when families of patients are suffering, such red-tapism is increasing their misery."Please simplify the process of admission of Covid-19 patients in hospitals by considering every life essential,” she said.“Also, release a centralised database of hospitals and available beds, so that people can directly enroll Covid-19 patients in hospitals.""This is the time to help people in distress. In this difficult time, we all need to work above politics. The Congress party is united with the people of the state and is ready to help the government in every way," she said.She wished a speedy recovery to Adityanath who recently tested positive for Covid-19.Earlier on Twitter, she levelled the same charge about the hospital admission system."Information is coming from many places that many serious patients are not being admitted without the letter of the CMO,” she said.“Mr. Chief Minister, people are losing their lives while waiting for the CMO's letter. Please put an end to such rules, save the lives of people," the tweet in Hindi said."Make such a system in which serious patients can be admitted to the hospitals easily," she said.Uttar Pradesh on Monday registered the highest single-day rise in Covid-19 deaths with the disease claiming 167 more lives, while 28,287 fresh cases pushed its tally to 8,79,831.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/simplify-hospital-admission-process-of-covid-patients-priyanka-tells-adityanath-101618854444872.html

The CBI has been without a regular director after Rishi Kumar Shukla demitted office on February 2 after completing his two-year term. Presently, the premier investigating agency is headed by Interim director Pravin Sinha.Under the law, the CBI director has to be appointed on the recommendation of a selection committee comprising the prime minister, the leader of the single largest Opposition Party in the Lok Sabha and the Chief Justice of India or his nominee.Lawyer Prashant Bhushan, who appeared for the petitioner NGO ‘Common Cause’, had claimed during this hearing that the delay in holding the meeting was designed to “bypass” the present Chief Justice of India SA Bobde who is retiring on April 23.The Centre had then rejected this charge and tasked Deepak Khandekar, secretary of the department of personnel and training (DoPT), to explore the possibility of holding a meeting before May 2.In his letter to Attorney General Venugopal on Sunday, Deepak Khandekar said this didn’t work out.“Undersigned Deepak Khandekar has contacted Shri Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury, the Leader of the single largest Opposition party in the House of People (Indian National Congress) and Shri Adhir Ranjan Chowdhury informed that he will not be available till 2nd May 2021. Therefore, a meeting of the above said committee may be feasible to be convened only after 2nd May 2021, keeping in view the convenience of all the members of the aforesaid committee to be available to attend in person,” Khandekar’s April 18 letter said.The letter did not explain why Chowdhury was unavailable. The Congress leader, who heads the West Bengal Congress and is playing a lead role in the Bengal assembly elections, could not be immediately contacted for his comments. Voting for the last of the 8-phase elections is scheduled on April 29; the results will be declared on May 2.The Supreme Court bench comprising Justices L Nageswar Rao and S Ravindra Bhat was scheduled to hear the case on Monday but has put off the hearing to May 13. In its affidavit filed ahead of Monday's hearing, the Centre cited Khandekar's letter to KK Venugopal and underscored that Pravin Sinha, who was appointed interim director, was the senior-most police officer in the agency.The petition filed through advocate Prashant Bhushan sought directions to the Centre to initiate and complete the process of selection of CBI Director and to ensure that such process is initiated at least one month prior to the post falling vacant.The government had earlier told the top court that the meeting could not be held due to the ongoing state elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-to-appoint-cbi-director-can-t-meet-before-may-2-says-govt-then-explains-101618851272398.html

The NCB hasn’t clarified the intended destination of the drug consignment.Officials said the Indian naval ship Suvarna intercepted the Lankan boat “DU Shashila” in the high seas of the Indian Ocean on suspicion of drug trafficking and brought the boat to Kochi's Mattancherry Wharf for an extensive search by the NCB.The preliminary search did not yield anything. But a thorough hunt for the narcotics led investigators to the 340 packets of heroin concealed in ice in the boat’s cargo hold. A senior NCB official said each packet was stamped with a crown symbol with the words “KING 2021”, a practice followed by drug trafficking syndicates to brand their merchandise.According to the NCB, the consignment has a street value of ₹340 crore in India, and ₹1,750 crore in the international market.“This is a major catch not only in terms of the quantity and cost but also from the perspective of disruption of the illegal narcotics smuggling routes, which emanate from the Makran coast and flow towards the Indian, Maldivian and Sri Lankan destinations,” a defence ministry statement said.The NCB said the five Sri Lankan nationals arrested by the NCB were identified as Wimalasiri, 58, Somasiri, 58, Dharmadasa, 55, WP Ajith Ishant Pereira, 49 yrs, and Arya Ratna Pereira, 48.This is the second major drug haul by the NCB off the Kerala coast in three weeks.On 30 March, the NCB announced the seizure of 300 kg heroin from a Sri Lankan fishing vessel that had been intercepted by the Indian coast guard off the coast of Kerala’s Vizhinjam, nearly 200 km from Kochi. The Indian federal drug enforcement agency also seized five AK-47 rifles and 1,000 rounds of 9mm ammunition from the vessel.Investigations by the NCB in this case also indicated an Iranian link to the consignment. The heroin and arms consignment had been handed over to the crew of the Sri Lankan vessel in the high seas near Lakshadweep by an unidentified vessel that had come from Chabahar Port in Iran.In January also, NCB officials linked a multinational crime syndicate that had been smuggling heroin from Pakistan and Iran to a seizure of 100 kg heroin from a Lankan vessel “Shenaya Duwa” intercepted in the high seas south of Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi on 25 November last year. Investigations into this haul had led to the arrest of two Sri Lankan nationals, believed to be kingpins of a drug syndicate, from Chennai. These two - MMM Nawas and Mohamed Afnas - controlled the pickup and delivery of narcotic drugs from Pakistani and Iranian vessels.This international syndicate had its tentacles in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iran, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Australia.Monday’s seizure is in line with the NCB’s assessment that indicated syndicates were increasingly turning to the sea route for smuggling narcotics since the traditional route through India’s north-western borders was becoming tougher to breach.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ncb-seizes-340-kg-heroin-concealed-in-lankan-fishing-boat-5-arrested-in-cochin-101618843351971.html

The vessel was later taken to Kochi and four inmates were detained. “To investigate the vessel, the ships team conducted a boarding and search operation which led to the seizure of more than 300 kilograms of narcotics substances,” he said. However, he did not disclose the exact location from where the seizure was made or the exact time of the seizure.This is the biggest seizure of the narcotic substance in the recent past and the identity of the occupants was not disclosed. The spokesman said naval ship ‘Suvarna’, during its surveillance patrolling in the Arabian Sea, encountered a fishing vessel that was moving around suspiciously and later it was force-searched. “This is a major catch, not only in terms of the quantity and the cost but also from the perspective of disruption of the illegal narcotics smuggling routes which emanate from the Makran coast and flow towards Indian, Maldivian and Sri Lankan destinations,” he said in a statement, adding that a major portion of the proceeds from the thriving drug racket was channelled to extremist and criminal activities. The destination of the contraband was suspected to be India, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Makran is a coastal region in Baluchistan along the coast of the Gulf of Oman and notorious for the narcotic drug trade. Recently, there were intelligence reports that international drug syndicates were eying Kochi, one of the fastest-growing three-tier cities of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/big-narcotic-haul-navy-seizes-drugs-worth-rs-3-000-crore-off-kerala-coast-101618842931988.html

Only 1,000-2,000 seers of the six Bairagi akhadas are still in the mela kshetra waiting for the last shahi snan slated for April 27," Uttarakhand DGP Ashok Kumar said."After the shahi snans of April 12 and 14 several akhadas left and not much is left in the Kumbh area. Practically, the kumbh kshetra is empty now and no one is expected to come from outside," he said.Traditionally, the last shahi snan held on Ram Navami is a main event for the Bairagi sect and not for the others.Altogether, Uttarakhand reported over 2,000 fresh Covid cases during the past four days with Dehradun and Haridwar districts being the largest contributors to the tally.DGP Kumar, however, refused to accept the argument that the kumbh mela is a ‘super-spreader’ of the virus because of the huge gathering, calling the theory "entirely fake"."We have data to prove that it is a complete lie,” he claimed.“The Covid positivity rate in Haridwar is less than two per cent. If 50 out of a total of 10,000 sadhus test positive for Covid, it is 0.5 per cent whereas three lakh people tested positive for Covid in Maharashtra in a span of five days,” he added.But Haridwar's chief medical officer S K Jha said over 150 seers had tested positive for Covid from April 1 to 18.Chief Minister Tirath Singh Rawat on Sunday said the shahi snan at the kumbh has been conducted successfully with everyone’s cooperation. The prime minister’s appeal to seers has also evoked a positive response from the sadhus, he added.Agni Akhada secretary Sampoornanand Brahmachari said the decision on a final kumbh immersion of deities was taken after Modi’s appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-crowds-now-with-akhadas-pulling-out-kumbh-virtually-over-101618840368761.html

Hope the government of Assam will take a considered decision,” national award-winning filmmaker Utpal Borpujari tweeted on Monday. He is one among many who are urging for cancellation of Bihu events through their social media messages.Dr Navanil Barua, a prominent neurosurgeon and columnist said the government shouldn’t have allowed holding of Bihu functions in the first place. “The state government was informed by ICMR in February itself about (the) presence of new strains of Covid in the state. With that in mind, the elections should have been postponed. But nothing of that sort happened. If Bihu was allowed keeping in mind hundreds of artists who rely on these functions for income, it should have been held online, something on the pattern of IPL, without audience at the venues. The government can still do that,” he said.In past weeks, Covid-19 cases in Assam have increased from single digits daily to three digits. On Sunday, the state recorded 639 new cases—including 354 in Kamrup (Metropolitan) district which includes Guwahati-- and 6 deaths, taking the number of active cases to 5,268 with the positivity rate climbing to 2.74%.While the situation in Assam may not look threatening at the moment, the new Covid-19 strain has led to a record surge in infection nationally with several states reporting new daily peaks during the second wave of the disease.Popular singer Angaraag ‘Papon’ Mahanta underlined this point during a Bihu event on Sunday“If you compare with some other parts of India, Assam is still in a better position. But we need to be careful,” he said, adding, “You guys are listening to my songs with your ears. So there’s no harm in covering your faces with masks. We can save ourselves, our homes and Assam if we wear masks.”Earlier on Sunday, health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said if any district had more than 300 active Covid-19 cases, “Bihu functions and other events won’t be allowed to be held there”. He added that a formal decision on this will be taken on Monday.Last year, the lockdown imposed after Covid-19 outbreak put a lid on the cultural events. This year, with assembly polls getting over on April 6, the state government allowed celebrations, but with restrictions.Besides the usual Covid-19 protocols, the organizers of these functions were asked to get themselves tested for Covid-19 three days prior to and also after the event. All functions, which usually continue till early mornings, were asked to wrap up by 11 pm and organisers were asked to sanitise venues twice, once before the event and again after it.While some organizers decided not to hold events, many events are being held at present all over the state but the deadline for functions to get over as well as other safety measures are getting flouted in many places. On April 14, the first day of the functions, prominent singer Zubeen Garg took to the stage after 11 am and performed till 12:45 am. The singer has since restricted his performances till the deadline set by government. Another singer Bipin Chowdang also performed after 11 pm on the first day of the events.The authorities have now decided to act tough against defaulters.“Today onwards we appeal to all Bihu celebration committees of Assam to strictly follow Covid protocols and wind up before 11 pm without fail. No excuses. From tonight, strict legal action will be taken to save human lives,” Assam Police director general of police (DGP) Bhaskar Jyoti Mahanta tweeted on Sunday.Senior Congress leader and Lok Sabha MP Pradyut Bordoloi said the state government was guilty of “criminal negligence and dereliction of duty”. He claimed the state government itself flouted all Covid norms during the assembly elections and thus could not stop Bihu events citing the disease.“. ...They allowed these functions to be held by issuing some absurd SOPs like time limit of 11 pm with complete disregard to human lives. The harm has already been done. But now strictest measures should be enforced to ensure that these functions don’t continue to add to the health crisis looming in the state,” saidMd Aminul Islam, organising secretary of All India United Democratic Front said the government should stop Bihu functions held on stage to ensure safety of people.“It is very unfortunate that the government allowed Bihu functions at a time when the Covid-19 in other states was already alarming. We will love Bihu as it is the life thread of all Assamese and we become sentimental about it. It was always going to be impossible to maintain strict social distancing and other measures at places where thousands gather,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/call-to-cancel-bihu-functions-in-assam-amid-covid-19-surge-101618839992775.html

We may use it due to lack of an antiviral drug and it is useless if given at an early state to asymptomatic individuals or to patients with mild symptoms. It is also ineffective if administered late,” Guleria was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.India, which is currently facing the second wave of coronavirus, witnessed yet another record rise in its daily cases of the viral infection as 273,810 fresh cases were reported across the country on Monday, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW).

He also "pushed" the big countries to ensure smooth supply of raw materials needed for manufacturing of Covid-19 vaccines in India.“As a foreign minister, I'm pushing other countries, particularly some big countries, saying - look, please keep the raw materials flowing for vaccines to be made in India,” news agency ANI quoted Jaishankar as saying at a conclave.“If you ask why are you exporting (vaccines) at all, somebody will ask - why am I exporting to India. That is so short-sighted. Only non-serious, irresponsible people can make that argument,” he added, according to ANI.The Union minister highlighted the global supply chains saying the societies in general are not autonomous entities but rely on each other to survive.“The fact is that there are global supply chains, very few things are made exclusively in one geography, very few societies can say we are autonomous of our reliance on others,” Jaishankar stated.India’s largest vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India, who has been tasked with producing the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covid shot, has been experiencing a crunch of raw materials. SII chief Adar Poonawala had taken to Twitter to request the American President Joe Biden to lift an embargo on the supply of raw materials, after the imposition of Defense Production Act (DPA), mobilising American resources for domestic use only.Jaishankar had defended India’s 'Vaccine Maitri' mission during the Raisina Dialogue. "International cooperation is not a one-way street - where we give to others and short change ourselves, I think people need to understand that," he said on April 13.He emphasised that the government has stepped back from its commitments to the world as times got tough and the domestic population had to be prioritised, adding that most countries understood.“It's not that we aren't prioritising our people. As things got tough, we spoke to the world and said - we tried our best to live up to commitments but please understand that we have a very serious situation at home and most countries understand that,” said Jaishankar.India is a major vaccine contributor to World Health Organization’s COVAX initiative, that aims to supply vaccines to poor and middle income countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jaishankar-defends-india-s-move-to-export-covid-19-vaccines-says-prioritising-our-people-101618837924788.html

Dr Praveen Sunder, a new recruit, was asked to leave his field duty to man the helpline’s need for manpower.“Because of the surge in cases we are getting more calls, so I was brought in from April 1,” says Sunder. As a doctor employed with the directorate, Sunder was involved in distribution of medicines for Covid treatment and spreading awareness last year. Now, on the helpline duty, he claims he answers 100-150 calls during his eight hour shift. On an average, the Center has received more than a 1,000 calls every day since mid-March, said another helpline staff.The calls to the helpline are handled by doctors, health inspectors and other staff of the public health directorate, who share relevant information with the callers following the Covid-19 guidelines released periodically by the state government. A television plays out news 24 hours at the center, allowing the shift in-charge to update staff on the latest Covid-related regulations and other developments.Most calls that Sunder and his colleagues receive these days are queries on vaccines and e-pass rules. “They call to find out about any precautionary measures to take before getting vaccinated, what kind of side-effects they can expect and many people are also confused over the interval between the two doses,” said Sunder. “Some of them also call if they have a headache or any sort of pain after getting vaccinated. If they test positive, they ask if they can remain in home quarantine and when they should take a CT (Computed Tomography)”.However, when people in medical emergency situations tend to call Tamil Nadu’s 108 ambulance service, he said.The helpline also receives calls from other states and even countries to know if there will be a lockdown in Tamil Nadu and if they require an e-pass to enter. “People call us from other countries like the UK and Canada before they plan their travel,” says Sunder.His colleague who did not wish to be named has been working in the control room since last March when Tamil Nadu reported its first infection. She said the number of calls had increased to the levels seen between March and July last year, adding that in February she used to answer less than 35 calls, which has more than doubled to around 100 now.Tamil Nadu reported 6,993 daily cases on July 27 at the peak of the infections last year, which has been surpassed this year during the second wave with record 7,819 cases registered on April 14.“We are like a hub,” she says. “When we get specific queries on testing centres or bed availability, we connect the callers to our district centres.”However, there are a few complaints with the helplines at the district centres. For instance, a resident of Chengalpattu district, who didn’t wish to be named, said he called the local helpline-- 044-27427412 twice to complain against an infected person, who was roaming freely within their apartment complex. “We have elders and kids who live here and I’m worried,” he said. “They just forwarded my complaint to the local municipality to fumigate the place and put a notice in that person’s house, but till now, no one has turned up to take action.”Apart from the general helpline, the Greater Chennai Corporation has reopened a tele-counselling helpline for those in home isolation. It has a hundred parallel lines to ensure the helpline isn’t engaged.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-brings-more-hands-for-covid-helpline-as-cases-surge-101618837171994.html

He advised doctors that the Remdesivir drug does not reduce mortality and is of no use if given to people with mild symptoms.“It is important to understand that Remdesivir is not a magic bullet and is not a drug that decreases mortality. We may use it due to lack of an antiviral drug and it is useless if given at an early state to asymptomatic individuals or to patients with mild symptoms. It is also ineffective if administered late,” Guleria was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Guleria also suggested doctors to ensure that Remdesivir should be given to patients who are hospitalised. “Remdesivir should only be given to patients who are hospitalised, have reported a fall in oxygen saturation and have infiltrates on the chest X-ray or CT-scan.”A shortage of Remdesivir injection has put several state governments on alert. Maharashtra reported a shortage of Remdesivir injections in several districts. Earlier on Monday, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court directed the state government to ensure that Nagpur receives 10,000 injections within 8pm on Monday. The Delhi government also said that the two teams of officers have been deployed to monitor procurement and supply of Remdesivir drugs as the national Capital also faced a shortage.NITI Aayog member (health) Dr VK Paul on Saturday said that the production of Remdesivir has been scaled up to meet the current demands. He said, “Remdesivir production had gone down, but now from 26 lakh vials per month it has been scaled up to 40 lakh vials per month and we are aiming to produce 76 lakh vials per month.”Randeep Guleria also highlighted that doctors should ensure that medicines are given in the right time and right combination. Guleria also highlighted that plasma therapy has been ineffective in curing patients. “Studies have shown that plasma therapy has a limited role and is not of much use. Less than 2% Covid-19 patients require Tocilizumab but it is being used a lot these days. Majority of patients with mild symptoms or those who are asymptomatic will improve with treatment given to symptomatic patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remdesivir-not-a-magic-bullet-doesn-t-reduce-mortality-says-guleria-101618834660884.html
19-04-2021||India||Covid-19: IOC to supply oxygen to hospitals in Delhi, Haryana, Punjab||After Reliance Industries Ltd, state-owned Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) and Bharat Petroleum Corporation Ltd (BPCL) have begun diverting oxygen produced at their refineries to supplement the availability of medical oxygen in states worst hit by COVID-19.In a statement, IOC said it has "begun the supply of 150 tonnes of oxygen at no cost to various hospitals in Delhi, Haryana and Punjab.""The first batch of the lifesaver medical grade oxygen was dispatched today to Maha Durga Charitable Trust Hospital, New Delhi," it said. "Delhi is already facing an oxygen emergency situation."In the face of a massive surge in demand for medical oxygen during the second wave of the pandemic, IOC has diverted the high-purity oxygen used in its Mono Ethylene Glycol (MEG) unit to produce medical-grade liquid oxygen at its Panipat refinery and petrochemical complex in Haryana.The throughput of the unit has also been scaled down for a more critical cause.In a separate statement, BPCL said it has started supply of 100 tonnes of oxygen at no cost."The company will be supplying around 100 tonnes per month," it said.With average daily cases of COVID-19 rising again since last one month, the demand for oxygen has significantly risen. In fact, in most parts of the country, the cases are hitting new peak, thereby disrupting the demand-supply scenario for medical oxygen.Last week, Reliance's twin oil refineries in Jamnagar in Gujarat through minor process modification converted industrial oxygen into medical-use oxygen that can be administered to COVID-19 patients low on oxygen. In all, 100 tonnes of oxygen is being supplied from the Jamnagar refineries free of cost.BPCL is also supplying 1.5 tonnes per day of medical oxygen to Kerala from its Kochi Refinery.Last year, BPCL had supplied around 25 tonnes of medical oxygen when the average daily cases had risen in October-November.The Kochi Refinery has a provision to produce and store liquid oxygen of 99.7 per cent purity.Oil refineries can produce limited volumes of industrial oxygen in air-separation plants meant for nitrogen production. Scrubbing out other gases such as carbon dioxide can convert it into medical-use oxygen with 99.9 per cent purity.Reliance operates the world's largest oil refining complex at Jamnagar in Gujarat.IOC Chairman S M Vaidya reiterated the firm's unstinted support to the country at this critical hour in every possible way."All through the pandemic, our prime focus has been to ensure the supply of essential fuels 24X7. We have also stepped up the production of raw material for PPEs, and we are now providing lifesaving medical oxygen to hospitals."Our expertise and assets, including refineries, pipelines, petrochemical units, bottling plants, terminals and aviation fuel stations, will continue to serve the people despite the stiff challenges”, he added.As the COVID-19 cases in the country continue to rise, the demand for medical-grade oxygen too is growing rapidly. "The current initiative by IOC aims at supporting the states in fighting the battle against COVID-19," the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-ioc-to-supply-oxygen-to-hospitals-in-delhi-haryana-punjab-101618834513512.html

It's 32% this year. People, between 30 and 45 years of age, testing positive remain [the] same at 21% as was last year. There is no excess rate of young people testing positive,” ANI quoted Dr Paul as saying. He also said that air-borne transmission of the disease is more prevalent than the surface borne transmission.Dr Paul also said that the production of the Remdesivir drug, which currently has a high demand across the country, has been scaled up. “As for Remdesivir production, it had gone down but now from 26 lakh vials per month, it has been scaled up to 40 lakh vials per month while aiming for 76 lakh vials per month,” ANI quoted him as saying.Also read | India's second wave of Covid-19 'less severe', no change in death rate: ICMR DGMany experts have said that more younger people are being infected during the second wave of the pandemic. Earlier on Sunday, chief of Genestrings Diagnostic Centre Gauri Agarwal said that “A lot of young people [are] testing Covid positive as compared to old people. Symptoms are different this time. Many are complaining of dry mouth, gastrointestinal issues, nausea, loose tools, red eyes and headache. Everyone doesn't complain of fever,” ANI reported.On April 13, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal too had said that younger people are being infected with the disease in the national capital. “As per the data of last 10-15 days, 65 per cent of the patients are below 45 years of age. Your health and life are very important to us. So, I would like to appeal to the youth to step out of the house only when it is necessary and follow all Covid protocols strictly,” Kejriwal said.Meanwhile, India reported 273,810 new infections on Monday, its highest in a 24-hour span so far. Data from the Union ministry of health and family welfare also showed that 1,619 people have succumbed to the disease on the day.

With this find, the number of bat species in India increases to 130, and in Meghalaya, to 66. The species, Eudiscopus denticulus, was found by a team of scientists led by Uttam Saikia from Shillong office of Zoological Survey of India and scientists from a few European natural history museums at Lailad close to Nongkhyllem Wildlife Sanctuary in July last year. The finding about the “very specialised bamboo-dwelling bat species” has been published in the recent issue of Revue Suisse de Zoologie, a bi-annual journal published by the Geneva Museum and the Swiss Zoological Society. “The bat species is very distinctive in appearance with prominent disk-like pads in the thumb and bright orange colouration,” said a press note on the finding. “From the modifications in the feet, it was presumed to be a bamboo-dwelling species which was later identified as a disk-footed bat. This bat is reported to roost inside bamboo internodes aided by their adhesive disks,” it added. Till now, the species was recorded in few localities in Southern China, Vietnam, Thailand and Myanmar. The location in Meghalaya where the species was found is nearly 1,000 km westward of its earlier known areas.Also Read | From Rajasthan to Delhi, states ramp up measures to battle Covid-19The researchers found that though several bamboo-dwelling bat species are common throughout Southeast Asia, this particular species is rare and found only in a few localities worldwide. Comparison of the DNA sequence of the species found in Meghalaya with specimens from Vietnam revealed that despite the vast distance separating the two specimens, they were found to be identical. The researchers have hypothesized that populations of the species from Meghalaya and Vietnam may have very recent common origin and all existing bat populations expanded from the same region following recent expansion of man-made bamboo forests. “From analysis of the very high frequency echolocation calls of the Meghalaya individual, the scientists noted that the cell structure is suitable for orientation in a cluttered environment like inside bamboo grooves,” the note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-first-disk-footed-bat-recorded-in-meghalaya-dwells-in-bamboo-grooves-101618832851856.html

Kochi police commissioner CH Nagaraju said a preliminary inquiry revealed that the man wanted to kill himself and the daughter after he suffered a financial setback in his business in Pune. He allegedly suffocated his daughter on March 20 and dumped her body in the river. He also allegedly tried to kill himself but survived, said the police.

While there are several gaps in the man’s statements, as per the preliminary probe, no third party involvement is suspected. Police have moved an application in a local court, requesting custody of the man for two weeks. Police recovered his car from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. “We have information that he travelled to three-four states to dodge police and there were many attempts to mislead investigators,” said the commissioner. The man reportedly told the police that he tried to die by suicide by slitting his vein but later took medical help. In Goa, he told his interrogators that he jumped into the sea but was rescued by lifeguards. But police suspect these statements are false. An electronic equipment dealer, the accused left Pune a couple of years ago and settled in Kochi after his business suffered losses.

As I mentioned that the symptoms of joint ache, fatigue, muscle ache, loss of smell, or sore throat are much less compared to the first wave. However, shortness of breath is higher in this wave," Dr Bhargava said, reported news agency ANI.Also read: PM Modi to interact with leading doctors after explosive surge in Covid-19 casesHowever, the ICMR DG said there is no difference seen in the rate of fatalities between the first and the second wave.Pointing out at major loopholes in India's fight against the viral contagion, Dr Bhargava said, "We have had a tremendous amount of laxity and Covid-19 inappropriate behaviour was seen."It is not yet clear if the surge in infection spread and cases is the result of the double mutant found in India or the higher rate of transmissibility, the ICMR chief said.He also stressed that the RT-PCR is a gold standard test that measures two or more genes in the body, and there is no chance of missing the detection of a Covid-19 mutant through the test."I would like to emphasise that the RT-PCR test that we are utilising, they measure two or more genes and they never miss a test... We have always used two or more genes for testing and therefore missing is absolutely impossible... It can find any kind of mutant because it measures two or more genes at different sites," he told ANI.Also read | ‘Total chaos’: Sanjay Raut demands Parliament session to discuss Covid situationA common aspect in both waves has been the age group that has been infected, he pointed out and said, "In both the waves, 70% of infected patients are above 40 years."The second wave of coronavirus has overwhelmed the health infrastructure in the country as India continues to report cases above two lakhs for five straight days.India's Covid-19 tally crossed the 1.5-crore mark with around 25 lakh cases being added in just 15 days, while active cases surpassed the 19-lakh mark, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-second-wave-of-covid-19-less-severe-no-change-in-death-rate-icmr-dg-101618821805826.html

A campaign of testing will follow in rural areas since the cases are increasing there. Proper arrangements to be made for sending migrants to isolation centres and hospitals,” Baghel said. He instructed the health department to ensure continuous availability of testing kits, oxygen cylinders, Remdesivir and other necessary medicines and devices at all Covid treatment facilities and ordered immediate recruitment of necessary medical staff in districts. The number of active cases in Chhattisgarh has reached 128,019. The state is among the top three—other two being Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh-- with more than a hundred thousand active cases. Two days back, the Central government asked it to increase the number of Covid beds to meet with the crisis. Some Covid-19 patients HT spoke to, said they were struggling to get oxygen beds and Remdesivir. “Doctors prescribed Remdesivir injections to my uncle two days back, but the injections are not available even today,” said Sonu, Pandey, who is getting treated for Covid-19 in a private hospital along with his uncle. A volunteer helping Covid patients spoke about the crunch of oxygen beds in Raipur, the state capital. “Only two out of 10 patients needing oxygen beds get it on time, rest are kept waiting,” said Tirath Sahu. Last Friday, the state government decided to reserve 70% of oxygen beds at all private hospitals for Covid-19 patients.

BJP ruled states are witnessing the worst, in seven cities of Gujarat alone, 680 deaths were witnessed and there are states like UP where the BJP government has unofficially banned private testing,” she said.Also Read | Vaccines key to tackling Covid-19: Manmohan to PMCalling the minister’s remarks as “sadak chhap”, Chavan said Harsh Vardan should apologise for his remarks.He added that other responsible members of the Union government have been involved in politics at this hour of distress.“When Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope flagged shortage of vaccines in the state, BJP ministers such as Prakash Javdekar said that states were wasting the vaccines. This, when Maharashtra has spent Rs12,000 crore in making medicines and Covid-related facilities available to its people and is planning to spend another ₹350 crore out of the MLAs’ funds for tackling the pandemic in the state.” India recorded 273,810 new Covid cases on Monday morning.

19-04-2021||India||Harsh Vardhan lists 'factual inaccuracies' in Manmohan Singh's letter to PM: Read excerpts here||A day after Manmohan Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi over the country’s vaccination strategy, Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Monday responded to the senior Congress leader. Harsh Vardhan requested Singh to ask his party workers to also follow the same advice in their own respective states. In the letter, the Union health minister apprised Singh of India's "biggest and fastest" vaccination drive in the world and said "you advise not to get tempted to go by absolute numbers, but to go by percentage of the population "is not incorrect." "However, I am sure that you will agree with me that this is a practice that must be followed uniformly and junior members of your party too must follow your advice," he wrote.On Sunday, Singh wrote to PM Modi in the backdrop of an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases. He asked PM Modi for resisting the "temptation" to look at absolute numbers vaccinated, instead, he suggested that the government should focus on the percentage of the population vaccinated. Singh also stated, "Centre should tell Covid vaccine orders placed for next 6 months, how vaccines will be distributed to states." In one of the suggestion, Singh wrote that the Centre may retain 10 per cent for distribution based on emergency needs "but other than that, states should have a clear signal of likely availability so that they can plan their rollout."Harsh Vardhan posted his letter on Twitter as said that "history will be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation and valuable advice was followed by his party leaders as well. "It is saddening, Dr Singh, that while you very well understand the importance of vaccination as an important method of fighting the COVID-19 battle, people in responsible positions in your party as well as in the state governments formed by your party do not seem to share your view," Harsh Vardhan said.Read key points here:"The emphasis you have laid on vaccination as an important tool to fight COVID-19 is well taken, which is exactly why India launched the world's biggest vaccination drive and also became the fastest in the world to reach the milestones of 10, 11 and 12 crore administered doses.""It cannot be that the discussion on total cases, active cases or mortality is based on absolute numbers, which the Congress party often tries to do, but the vaccination numbers continue to be touted as a percentage of the population covered. ""It is saddening, Dr Singh, that while you very well understand the importance of vaccination as an important method of fighting the COVID-19 battle, people in responsible positions in your party as well as in the state governments formed by your party do not seem to share your view. Shouldn't it be a matter of pride that India is perhaps the only developing country to have 2 vaccines?""Let alone thanking scientists, many Congress members and Congress-ruled slate governments have taken extraordinary interest in spreading falsehoods regarding the efficacy of these vaccines, thereby fuelling vaccine hesitancy, and playing with the lives of our countrymen.""The irresponsible public pronouncements made by some of your leaders have resulted in a below national average vaccination coverage of senior citizens and even front-line workers in some of the Congress-ruled states.""However, it does seem that those who drafted your letter or advised you, have done a great disservice to your standing by misleading you regarding material that is already in public domain.""The same is the case with your suggestion regarding providing funds and other concessions to augment vaccine manufacturing This decision had also been taken many days before receipt of your letter and multiple vaccine manufacturing entities have been funded by the government to immediately enhance production."Vaccination drive in IndiaThe cumulative number of Covid-19 vaccine doses administered in the country has crossed 123 million on Monday as part of the world's largest vaccination drive, said the ministry of health and family Welfare. According to the ministry, cumulatively, 12,38,52,566 vaccine doses have been administered through 18,37,373 sessions, as per the provisional report till 7 am today.

The UK government said last week it had decided to reduce the length of Johnson’s visit following discussions with the Indian side. The Indian mission in London had announced the visit was to begin on April 25. “In the light of the current Coronavirus situation, Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be able to travel to India next week. Instead, Prime Ministers [Narendra] Modi and Johnson will speak later this month to agree and launch their ambitious plans for the future partnership between the UK and India,” said a spokesperson for the UK prime minister’s office. Johnson and Modi will remain in “regular contact beyond this, and look forward to meeting in person later this year”, the spokesperson added. Also Read | UK defends ex-PM Cameron as scale of lobbying scandal grows furtherExternal affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi added the decision to call off the visit had been made by mutual agreement. “The two sides will be holding a virtual meeting in the coming days to launch plans for a transformed India-UK relationship,” he said. Modi and Johnson “attach the highest importance to taking the India-UK partnership to its fullest potential and propose to remain in close touch in this regard and look forward to an in-person meeting later in the year”, Bagchi said. In January, Johnson cancelled a visit to India to be chief guest at the Republic Day celebrations in order to remain in Britain to focus on his government’s response to a new Coronavirus variant that was spreading rapidly at the time. While unveiling an integrated review of defence, development and foreign policy in March, the UK announced Johnson would travel to India at the end of April as part of the Britain’s tilt towards the Indo-Pacific. Monday’s development came against the backdrop of mounting criticism in Britain for Johnson’s plans to go ahead with the trip to New Delhi at a time when India is witnessing a massive surge in Covid-19 infections. The country recorded more than 270,000 cases and more than 1,600 deaths on Sunday. Experts also called on the UK government to add India to its “red list” of travel restrictions following the detection of 77 cases of the Indian “double mutant” Covid-19 variant. Experts from Imperial College said the discovery of this variant should lead to India being placed in the “red list”, under which incoming travellers are subject to hotel quarantine of 10 days. On Sunday, the main opposition Labour Party joined calls for Johnson to cancel his visit to India. “I can’t see why the prime minister can’t conduct his business with the Indian government via Zoom,” said Labour’s shadow communities secretary Steve Reed. “The prime minister, like all of us in public life, needs to try and set an example. I’d much rather the prime minister did it by Zoom rather than travelling to India,” Reed told Sky News.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-pm-johnson-calls-off-visit-to-india-over-covid-19-situation-101618825470981.html

The EU is India’s largest trading partner.India and many European countries, along with the US, have sought to distance their next generation telecom infrastructure from companies including Huawei Technologies Co. and ZTE Corp. amid concerns over their links with the Chinese government.Nations including the US, UK, Australia and India have raised red flags about Chinese majors participating in building the networks. Chinese suppliers have been shut out of recent telecom auctions in India. While the US and Japan have announced their intention to invest in 5G research, the UK plans to build an alliance of democracies for safer adoption of the technology that’s expected to spur growth post-pandemic and add $1.3 trillion to the global economy by 2030.There’s renewed focus on building common standards to ensure security across the 5G value chain, Vestager said. Standards would include agreeing on technical aspects like radio spectrum bands and interface technologies to be used by 5G networks and creating level-playing fields for local and smaller companies.“It has been part of discussions we have had so far,” she said. “And I would hope that this would be a common approach.

19-04-2021||India||Clinical symptoms of Covid-19, CT scans/X-rays should be used to rule out false negatives: Experts||Amid a staggering surge in Covid-19 cases, India's top experts on Monday said RT-PCR tests detect coronavirus in around 80 per cent of the cases, so clinical features and CT scans/chest X-rays should be used to rule out false negatives in symptomatic patients followed by a repeat test after 24 hours.Amid SARS COV-2 'variants of concern' circulating, they said RT-PCR tests do not miss mutations as the ones being used in India target more than two genes. According to government data till April 15, a total of 1,189 samples have tested positive for 'variants of concern' of SARS COV-2 in India which include 1,109 samples with the UK variant, 79 samples with South African variant and one sample with the Brazil variant.Based on ICMR data, the current variants are also being picked up by the RT-PCR tests. The RT-PCR test has sensitivity of around 80 per cent and therefore 20 per cent of the cases can still be missed out."Also, if the sample is not properly taken or if the test is done too early when the viral load is low, it may come out negative. So, if a person is symptomatic, a combination of clinical features, laboratory reports, CT/chest X-ray can be used for presumptive diagnosis of Covid-19 and treatment should be started accordingly. The test should also be repeated after 24 hours," AIIMS Director Dr Randeep Guleria told PTI.Dr Samiran Panda, the Head of Epidemiology and Communicable Diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research, said the mutants -- variants from the UK, Brazil and South Africa -- are not able to evade the diagnostic RT-PCR testing that is being conducted in India."In India, we have to be able to detect two or more genes of virus so if mutation happens on one area then the RT-PCR test kits will be able to capture it and it is capturing. However, some of the infections will remain undetected irrespective of the mutations happening," Panda said.Moreover, all the mutants have been identified from these tests only, he said.Clinical symptoms and CT scan reports should be the guiding factor for treatment rather than relying only on the RT-PCR test which has a sensitivity of around 80 per cent, another senior doctor said.Even the rapid antigen test has a sensitivity of only 40 per cent, he said, adding, "So many patients will be missed if we rely only upon these tests."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/clinical-symptoms-of-covid-19-ct-scans-x-rays-should-be-used-to-rule-out-false-negatives-experts-101618821168010.html

Harsh Vardhan’s attack came in response to former prime minister Manmohan Singh’s letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi a day ago, suggesting ways to tackle the vaccination shortage in the country.“History shall be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh Ji if your offer of constructive cooperation and valuable advice was followed by your Congress leaders as well in such extraordinary times,” Harsh Vardhan said in a tweet attaching his response.In his three-page letter, accusing the Congress and its state governments of spreading lies and rumours about the efficacy of vaccines produced in India, he said it is “saddening” that while the former prime minister understands the importance of vaccination as an important weapon in combating Covid-19, people in his party “do not seem to share his views”. Also Read | ‘It’s a short lockdown, don’t leave Delhi’: Kejriwal’s appeal to migrant workersHe further alleged that “irresponsible public pronouncements made by Congress have resulted in a below national average vaccination coverage of senior citizens and even frontline workers in some of the states where Congress is in power. “These states also have become the big contributors in the second-wave of Covid-19 infections,” the minister added.Finding “factual inaccuracies” in Singh’s letter, he said that those who helped him draft the same have done a “great disservice by misleading” him regarding the information which is already in the public domain. He clarified that the decision regarding fast-tracking foreign-made vaccines that have been approved by credible authorities had been taken before his suggestion.In his five-point letter to the PM, Singh said, “The key to our fight against Covid-19 must be ramping up the vaccination effort. We must resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated, and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated.” The former Prime Minister had urged the government to reveal the system of distribution of vaccines among states in a transparent way. Singh’s letter followed the Congress Working Committee meeting that described the Modi-led government’s pandemic strategy as a “colossal mismanagement”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/history-shall-be-kind-to-you-if-cong-took-your-advice-harsh-vardhan-to-manmohan-101618820490938.html

Both countries deliberated on disengagement of troops at Gogra-Hot Springs and Despang plains, agreeing to maintain stability on the ground to discourage any new incidents from cropping up and resolve outstanding issues in an "expeditious manner"Congress leader Ajay Maken had criticized the disengagement talks between India and China. "Why has the disengagement talks as promised by the Defence Minister on remaining friction points not yielded any results for India," Maken had said on April 18.The border standoff between the armies of Indian and China was the result of a flare-up on May 5 last year following a violent clash at Pangong Tso in Ladakh last year.After military and diplomatic level deliberations both sides ultimately withdrew troops from the north and south banks of Pangong lake in February.

India and France have been holding the exercise since 1993; it was christened Varuna in 2001.Officials said the Indian Navy’s sole aircraft carrier INS Vikramaditya would not join the exercise since it is under maintenance. But the Indian Navy’s participation will seek to make up for INS Vikramaditya’s absence by sending two to three destroyers (possibly led by INS Kolkata, the lead ship of the navy’s Kolkata-class stealth guided-missile destroyers) and frigates, an attack submarine, a P-8I maritime reconnaissance and anti-submarine warfare aircraft. The Charles de Gaulle carrier strike force comprises two frigates and a replenishment tanker.The French aircraft carrier and its strike group have been in the neighbourhood for weeks; Charles de Gaulle arrived in the Arabian Sea in mid-March for operations relating to Afghanistan and has held dual operations with the United States aircraft supercarrier Dwight D. Eisenhower Carrier Strike Group. According to the two navies, the two strike groups, which are conducting dual operations, are cooperating at levels of integration that has been “rarely achieved in the past”.USS Eisenhower carrier strike group is part of the fifth fleet, whose area of operations extends from the Red Sea to parts of the Indian Ocean. The US carrier-based squadrons of F-18 Super Hornet aircraft and E-2c Hawkeye airborne early warning aircraft tested war skills with French Rafale M fighters in the Arabian Sea on April 13.While the fledgling UAE Navy will be part of the Varuna war games, Indian and French naval warships will be involved in complex manoeuvres in the north Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf by testing interoperability skills in sub-surface, surface and aerial dimensions.Just as France is considered the oldest US ally, India and France have very deep defence cooperation and converge on the Indo-Pacific doctrine to ensure that no power unilaterally blocks the freedom of navigation from the Gulf of Aden to the western shores of the United States. Both India and France have very close ties with UAE.Like the four-nation Quad grouping, India-France and Australia have overlapping security objectives in the Indo-Pacific even though the level of war gaming between major maritime powers such as the US, France and India takes a bigger dimension with advanced skill testing and intelligence sharing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-france-uae-to-test-combat-skills-at-varuna-naval-exercise-from-sunday-101618814430812.html

Dr Mishra said that if the dearth of hospital beds, oxygen cylinders and vaccines continues, the country will be in a disastrous state. "The next three weeks are very critical for India in terms of the spread of the infection. People should take utmost care and precautions," Dr Mishra told news agency ANI.

It reminds me of indoor air pollution. The virus barely gives us time to react, while air pollution can take months, even years. This section seemed to gesture to our pre-pandemic pollution thinking. “Reducing airborne transmission of virus requires measures to avoid inhalation of infectious aerosols…air filtration…use of masks whenever indoors, attention to mask quality and fit.”Covid is the new air pollution in disguise. It is a murderous contaminant. A few lessons are in order for the months after this is over. First, urban Indians should also worry about indoor air pollution. The grey smog outside is only half the story. Second, if Covid claimed over 150,000 lives in a year, air pollution, per estimates, could have claimed almost 120,000. Third, the quality of housing is vital. Those in one-roomed, poorly ventilated shanties cannot isolate. But, pre-Covid too, the kitchen was the most polluted spot in most homes. In all scenarios, the poor in one roomed homes are most vulnerable. We shouldn’t abandon our cooking styles, but let’s redesign housing for safer air. The new study is not just about Covid. It must reform our thinking around indoor air pollution in post-pandemic times.(The writer is the founder and director of the Chintan Environmental Research and Action Group)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/air-pollution-and-covid19-101618802261627.html

19-04-2021||India||Every third minute, 1 person dies of Covid-19 in Maharashtra||Maharashtra, the worst-hit state in the country battling the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, adds more than 2,000 infections to its tally every hour, according to data analysis. The analysis shows 2,859 people are contracting the coronavirus disease every hour and one person succumbs to Covid-19 every third minute on average. Maharashtra continued to record a spurt in daily cases of the coronavirus disease as the state added 68,631 new patients on Sunday, according to the daily health bulletin by the state health department.It was the first time that the state recorded such a huge spike in a single day, which has pushed its tally to 38,39,338. The state also reported 503 fatalities, pushing the death toll to breach the 60,000-mark to 60,473. Out of the latest additions, 8468 new cases were reported from Mumbai city alone and 53 died due to Covid-19 in the span of 24 hours. The death toll in Mumbai has now reached 12,354.As Maharashtra remains the worst-hit state in the second wave of the pandemic, it is functioning under strict Covid-19 induced restrictions including weekend lockdown and Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). The state's upward trajectory in Covid cases has pushed the health infrastructure to stretch beyond limits.Amid the shortage of oxygen in the state, the Indian Railways announced 'oxygen express' trains that will transport liquid medical oxygen and oxygen cylinders to Maharashtra and other destinations. On Saturday, the railways formulated guidelines to allow transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers after the Maharashtra government and Madhya Pradesh made a request to meet the shortage of the gas used for Covid-19 patients in the state.Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope claimed on Sunday that no Covid-19 patient has died due to the shortage of medical oxygen in the state. He also said that the fatalities occurred due to the delay at patients' end in seeking medical assistance on time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/every-third-minute-1-person-dies-of-covid-19-in-maharashtra-101618801529800.html
19-04-2021||India||Are you more likely to get Covid-19? Diabetes, blood pressure are other conditions to be wary of||As the coronavirus pandemic continues to spread across India, the Centre on Monday shared a list of "risk factors" likely to increase Covid-19 vulnerability in an individual. The list was shared on the government's #IndiaFightsCorona Twitter account, aimed at keeping people well-informed about the crisis at hand. The Covid-19 risk factors, which include diabetes, old age, smoking, and certain cardiovascular and chronic respiratory diseases, are likely to make an individual more likely to contract the coronavirus disease.Here's the list of risk factors that could increase Covid-19 vulnerability:#IndiaFightsCorona:📍Risk factors increasing #COVID19 vulnerability✅Those with the age of 60 years and above ✅Those who smoke 🚬✅Those with non-communicable diseases (NCDs)#StaySafe👍 #Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/SeU7bvVNLW1. Those with the age of 60 years and above: The Union ministry of health and family welfare, in its official guidelines on Covid-19, says that older people, specifically those above the age of 60 years, are more likely to contract the coronavirus disease and develop a serious illness. As per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines, the risk for severe illness with Covid-19 increases with age, with older adults more likely to require hospitalisation if they get Covid-19, compared to younger adults. More than 80% of Covid-19 deaths occur in people over the age of 65, the CDC has warned. It's recommended that the health conditions of senior citizens are constantly monitored and urgent help is sought as soon as the need arises.2. Those who smoke: According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), smoking tobacco increases the risk factors associated with Covid-19. Although there is currently a dearth of enough well-designed peer-reviewed population-based studies to properly define the link between SARS-CoV-2 infection and smoking, a study by researchers from King’s College London in January showed that smokers are more likely to be hospitalised from Covid-19 and were more likely to have a higher symptom burden than non-smokers.3. Those with non-communicable diseases (NCDs): Certain NCDs in individuals increase Covid-19 vulnerability and make them more susceptible to contracting the coronavirus disease. These include:i) Cardiovascular disease - These include heart conditions such as heart failure, coronary artery disease, cardiomyopathies or hypertension. According to WHO, the aforementioned factors have been found to increase the odds for severe Covid-19 by 2.3, 2.9, and 3.9 times, respectively, in a meta-analysis. In another study, it was found that hypertension increased the risk of mortality from Covid-19 by 3.5 times, WHO said in its guidelines on Covid-19 and NCDs.ii) Chronic Respiratory Disease - These include chronic lung diseases, such as moderate to severe asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), such as emphysema or chronic bronchitis, scarred lung tissue or interstitial lung disease (including idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis), cystic fibrosis, and pulmonary hypertension (high blood pressure in the lungs). A study in the United Kingdom suggested that the presence of the aforementioned conditions increases patients' risk of severe complications or death from Covid-19, as per a WHO report.iii) Diabetes - The United Nations interagency task force on NCDs reported in a systematic review that people with diabetes were up to three times more likely to have severe symptoms or die of Covid-19, and the situation is worse for people with uncontrolled diabetes. The American Diabetes Association says that while there are not enough studies to show whether people with either type-1 or type-2 diabetes are more likely to get Covid-19 than the general population, it is evident that diabetic people are more likely to have worse complications once they get it and may have a higher chance of developing severe symptoms and complications.iv) Cancer - Cancer patients are more likely to experience severe Covid-19. A multicentre study conducted in China's Wuhan, and published in The Lancet medical journal, last year showed that the mortality rate from Covid-19 was significantly increased in patients with cancer and was particularly high among those with blood cancers. A new study in January earlier this year also found that patients with inactive cancer and not currently undergoing treatments for the deadly disease also face a significantly higher risk of severe illness from Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/are-you-more-likely-to-get-covid-19-govt-lists-coronavirus-risk-factors-101618796610490.html

I would like to reiterate that the safety of our students and their academic career are Education Ministry’s and my prime concerns right now,” he said.All students were advised to visit the official NTA website www.nta.ac.in and https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/ for latest updates related to the exams.The decision to defer the exam was taken in the wake of several requests from both candidates and parents.Earlier, concerns were raised about the effect of deferment of Class 12 CBSE and other state board exams on JEE (Main), JEE (Advance) and NEET exams.On Thursday, the Union health ministry postponed the NEET (PG) exams for admission to masters’ programmes in most private and government medical colleges. The exams were supposed to be held on Sunday.

Goa health minister profusely thanked his Kerala counterpart for the gesture on Sunday, when both the states registered the highest number of new Covid-19 infections and deaths.“I extend my gratitude to Smt. @shailajateacher Madam, Hon Health Minister of Kerala for helping us with movement of 20,000 litres of liquid oxygen for COVID patients in the state of Goa,” Goa health minister Vishwajit Rane tweeted, thanking Kerala health minister K K Shailaja, who is popularly known as Shailaja Teacher.Goa recorded 951 fresh cases of Covid-19 on Sunday, the highest since the pandemic outbreak, taking the active cases in the state to 7,052. It also recorded the highest single-day death toll with 11 Covid-19 patients succumbing, taking the cumulative death toll to 883, according to the daily Covid bulletin. Rane was grateful to the Kerala minister for the timely help.“The people of Goa are really grateful for your contribution to our fight against #COVID19,” Rane said.The gesture comes at a time when shortage of oxygen has become a major concern with the Prime Minister, Narendra Modi, asking for ramping up its production to meet the rising demand in hospitals among the worst-hit states including Kerala. The southernmost state of the country recorded the highest single-day surge on Sunday with 18,257 new Covid-19 cases and a test positivity rate (TPR) of 16.77%, according to the state health ministry. Kerala’s gesture to help out Goa is also noteworthy since several states including Goa have banned supply of oxygen to other states and diverted all oxygen manufactured internally for medical purposes within the state.“Supply of oxygen cylinders outside the state has been banned with immediate effect. All industrial oxygen requirements will be diverted towards the health services, GMC (Goa Medical College) & Covid hospitals. Necessary directions have been issued to secretary health to coordinate with the respective collectors to issue an order under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 in public interest and to save people’s lives,” Rane said on Friday.Rane also said the demand for oxygen had risen manifold and he had reached out to manufacturers within the state to help meet the demand.“With the increasing number of admissions at South Goa District Hospital (SGDH), oxygen consumption has also increased. Therefore, there is an urgent need for increased manufacturing of oxygen cylinders in the state of Goa. In view of the same, the government has requisitioned Oxynitro plant in Verna, Madgaon and Cuncolim which will help us in the seamless supply of oxygen to COVID Hospitals,” Rane said.Earlier Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant had claimed there was “sufficient availability of medical oxygen” and stated that the state infrastructure was “equipped to handle the demands” due to rising Covid 19 cases.The State government has also decided to add 500- beds for treatment of Covid patients at various facilities in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-is-severely-hit-by-covid-19-yet-helps-goa-with-20-000-litre-of-oxygen-101618800689793.html

So, a decision was taken to get the work completed before opening the facility to patients,” said one of the officials cited above. He said all beds at the hospital have provision for giving oxygen to patients and there are enough ventilators in the hospital. “Patients will be treated free of cost. An RT-PCR Covid positive report and Aadhar card will be necessary for admission,” he said. Another 250 beds will be added to the Covid hospital by the weekend, said a second official. It will be functioning under a major general from the military’s medical wing.

The court said that the police’s endeavour to make an example of Sidhu for the entire sequence of events since he is a popular public figure hazards a failure of justice due to “compromised objectivity”.However, the Delhi Police arrested him again hours later, in connection with another case related to the violence during the rally.The second case was also registered at Kotwali police station, but on a complaint filed by the ASI. The first case was registered on the complaint of the Kotwali police station house officer in which the actor was arrested on February 9.Sidhu is the first person to be arrested in the second case, the police said.Advocate Abhishek Gupta, Sidhu’s counsel, said his client has been sent to judicial custody and the matter will be heard on Monday. He said that they will oppose the police remand and press for his immediate release, adding that he will also move a bail application if the remand plea is allowed.The Delhi Police arrested Sidhu on February 9 for his alleged involvement in the January 26 violence.

Of these, 34 persons tested positive, the release said.On Sunday, of the total number of 220 Kumbh returnees tested at the station, 15 were found infected.All of them were shifted to Covid Care facilities, it added.In order to stem the spread of the virus in the state, Gujarat Chief Minister Vijay Rupani had on Saturday announced that people returning to the state after attending the Kumbh Mela will have to undergo COVID-19 test before they are allowed to enter their respective cities and villages.He had said that collectors of all the districts in Gujarat were directed to keep a watch on the Kumbh Mela returnees and enforce a 'nakabandi' (security checking) to prevent their entry in their hometowns without undergoing test.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-two-days-49-kumbh-returnees-test-covid-19-positive-in-gujarat-101618791055704.html
19-04-2021||India||AAP flays BJP for ‘massive’ poll rallies in West Bengal, Assam||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Sunday criticised the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying its top leaders are addressing large public gatherings and organising rallies in West Bengal, where assembly elections are underway, as well as during the assembly polls in Assam while the country is struggling with the second wave of Covid-19.The BJP, however, refuted the allegations and said the AAP should instead focus on saving Delhi from Covid-19.“Elections will be won and lost, political parties will come and go, but the lives of people will not. The BJP is putting more focus on election management and less on Covid management. While the people of India are concerned about how the Centre is managing Covid, and dealing with the surge in cases, the BJP is more concerned about their electioneering and how they can garner votes,” said AAP’s national spokesperson Raghav Chadha.“While on one hand, the pandemic has claimed thousands of lives and is infecting lakhs of people each day, on the other hand, in the assembly elections of West Bengal and Assam, the BJP, under the leadership of Home Minister Shri Amit Shah and Prime Minister Narendra Modi, is busy conducting gigantic rallies and roadshows that could be potential super spreader events with their massive crowds,” said Chadha, who is also the MLA of Delhi’s Rajendra Nagar constituency.He further said, “The rate at which people are contracting the virus is directly proportional to the speed at which these rallies conducted by the BJP are increasing.”“India has breached the 200,000-mark in Covid cases, while the BJP is focussing on conducting gigantic rallies in West Bengal. Winning elections and collecting votes is their sole motive, and the BJP has nothing to do with the people of India and their lives. In West Bengal, the BJP is promising a ‘double-engine sarkaar’, while not giving even a ‘single engine’ to Covid-19 management,” said the AAP spokesperson.BJP spokesperson Nalin Kohli said, “They (AAP) have no stake or presence in the elections (in West Bengal and Assam). Nor are they above the guidelines of the Election Commission. They would do well to do the job they are elected for — saving Delhi from Covid-19, instead of seeking media space to divert attention.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aap-flays-bjp-for-massive-poll-rallies-in-west-bengal-assam-101618790782443.html
19-04-2021||India||Future of migrant kids uncertain amid spike||Nitin Kumar’s eyes were full of despair as he waited along with his parents for a bus to Hardoi at Anand Vihar bus station on Friday afternoon to travel back to his hometown for the second time. Nitin left the city in June last year after the lockdown and returned again in October.“I was so happy to be back. I could not study in the village as the internet did not work properly; besides, all my friends are here. I do not want to go back and work in the fields there,” says 12-year-old Nitin, who lives goes to a government school.The fourth wave of Covid-19 in Delhi has costed Nitin’s father, Shyam Kumar, his job. “I have no work here. My child wants to study and stay in Delhi, but I have no choice,” says Kumar with tears in his eyes.With the sudden spurt in the number of viral infections and work drying up, Nitin is among the scores of children of migrant workers who are returning or being forced to return to their native village once again. Last year, scores of migrant workers and their families were spotted walking on the highways or hitching a ride in crammed trucks and buses to reach their hometown after a nationwide lockdown was imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19. Over the past few months, many of the children returned to the city with their parents while others remained in their villages.There has been limited assessment of the pandemic’s wider effects on the children of migrants. On Tuesday, the Supreme Court, in response to a petition filed by NGO Child Rights Trust, asked for data from all states and Union Territories on children of migrant workers. The petition said migrant children belong to three categories — children of migrant workers who stay behind in villages, children who are taken by the migrant workers to their place of work and children who migrate for labour of their own. “All these children have been the most vulnerable and the worst affected. Children of migrants and migrating children remain invisible... are denied access to health, proper nutrition, quality education and skills and knowledge they need to thrive and spend their lives in makeshift, unfriendly, unhygienic and testing conditions,” read the petition.Also read: Migrant workers treated as ‘outsiders’, says NHRC studySeema Kumar, general manager (programmes) of Smile Foundation, an NGO that works for the development of underprivileged children, said, “Children of migrants have gone through emotional upheaval and stress about a lot of things-- about their parents losing jobs, the fear of contracting the disease, about not being able to continue their studies among a host of other issues.”“We need to understand that for many of these children, school is also an opportunity to escape from the harsh realities of life in the slums. The closure of schools has had a severe emotional impact on them. Girls from the underprivileged section are particularly worried about not being able to continue their education.”She is not exaggerating. A policy brief released by the Right to Education Forum estimates around 10 million girls are at a risk of dropping out due to the impact of Covid-19.Rajni Mahto (14), a student of Class 10, said, “ We are two brothers and two sisters. My elder sister dropped out last year. I too may have to discontinue my studies if there is a lockdown.” In a slum cluster in Mayapuri, Koyal Kumari dreads that her mother, who works as a maid in Delhi, may soon be asked by her employers to take a break till the Covid-19 crisis is not brought under control and that may mean the end of her dreams of becoming a policewoman.Ismail Khan (12), who lives with his mother in Dilshad Garden, says the lockdown last year haunts him till this date as his father, who suffered from tuberculosis, died during that time. “ We did not have anything to eat, forget about having money to buy medicines for him. Another lockdown will mean we will have to struggle for food again,” he said.“In the past one year, many underprivileged children have seen the worst at a very young age–dropping out of schools to help support the family, their parents being harassed by landlords, struggling for two square meals, walking hundreds of kilometres with their parents to their villages. The worsening Covid-19 situation will only add to their woes,” said Sanjay Gupta, director of Chetna, an NGO working for poor children.“ A lot of migrants’ children, who had left Delhi, had come back in the past few months. We have taken several measures during the Covid crisis to ensure the welfare of children. We have set up Vidhan Sabha Monitoring Committees in all assembly constituencies to ensure and proper implementation of the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) and make sure every child has proper access to health and nutrition,” said Ranjana Prasad, a member of the Delhi Commission for Protection of Children Rights (DCPCR) . “Our school management committees at the district-level has been continuously working to keep a track of students who are missing from schools. It also reports cases of child labour and rescues children. We also have a child helpline, where children can seek help on any issues including health, education and food,” said Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/future-of-migrant-kids-uncertain-amid-spike-101618787862704.html
19-04-2021||India||Migrant workers treated as ‘outsiders’, says NHRC study||National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) study on the social security and health rights of migrant workers says that this politically invisible section of the society doesn’t get access to even basic facilities and they are looked upon as outsiders or second class citizens in the host states.The human rights body’s study has come at a time when India is witnessing the second wave of Covid-19 infections and there are reports of migrant workers beginning to return home from their places of work.As part of the study, commissioned by NHRC and carried out by ‘Kerala Development Society’, the researchers interviewed around 4,400 migrant workers, local workers, employers/contractors, state government officials, elected representatives, scholars, experts, NGO representatives, trade unions members across four states/UTs, Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, all of which house a large number of workers from West Bengal, Assam, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Odisha, Jharkhand and Chhattisgarh.Most of the migrant workers who come to Delhi, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Haryana work in low income and high-risk sectors such as construction, heavy industry, transport, services, and agriculture, and have poor access to health services, social protection, education services, housing and sanitation, food, water and other utilities.Also read: Fearing 2020 rerun, migrants rush homeFor example, about 84% of the respondents in Delhi did not have proper accommodation or stayed in poor quality accommodation, according to the study. Inter-state migrants also don’t have access to good health care, except Delhi, where Mohalla (neighbourhood) clinics have been a help, the study added. Female migrant workers show a higher prevalence of nutritional deficiencies and have poor access to reproductive health services in comparison with local labourers, the study pointed out. As a result of intense and daily exposure to toxic air, a section of interstate migrant workers, especially female ones, suffer from asthma, cancer and reproductive health complications. “According to the field survey, 68 % of women covered by our survey do not have access to toilets as they live in slums or squatter settlements,” the study added. In Mumbai, about 62 % of migrant workers live in slums. The study claims that 43 interstate migrant workers die every month in Delhi, 35 in Gujarat, 41 in Haryana and 38 in Maharashtra due to accidents at construction sites, suicide, and stomach related diseases and heart ailments.It adds that the dead bodies of migrant workers are not sent by contractors/employers to their homes and are instead sold to some private medical colleges for about ₹2-3 lakh. HT could not immediately confirm this independently. However, no police complaint has yet been filed to this effect.The study said there is “no institutional mechanism either at national level or at state level to address different types of human rights violations against interstate migrant workers.” “In fact, migrant workers live in inhospitable cities and villages.” In September 2020, the central government announced that it will prepare a comprehensive database about all the migrant workers in the country; but work on it is yet to start. The database was supposed to be compiled by June 2021.About 92.5% of migrant workers in Delhi, 90.5% in Maharashtra, 87% in Gujarat and 86% in Haryana, according to the NHRC study, say the local population considers them outsiders and discriminates against them. And 57% of migrant workers in Delhi, 65% in Gujarat, 59% in Haryana and 69% in Maharashtra report that employers discriminate between interstate migrant workers and locals in the labour market in terms of wages and accommodation. “Lack of political representation in the home state or host state is an area of serious concern. In effect, they are often treated as second-class citizens in host states,” the NHRC study added. Jacob John, president of Kerala Development Society, said: “Interstate migrant workers never got policy attention.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrant-workers-treated-as-outsiders-says-nhrc-study-101618787510990.html
19-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||Delhi recorded 24,375 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday at a positivity rate of 24.56%. No Indian city has registered more; actually no city anywhere in the world has, at least to this columnist’s knowledge. Sure, Los Angeles saw 29,174 cases on December 26, in the worst phase of the US’s debilitating third wave of the viral pandemic, but that was because of Christmas (it recorded no cases on December 25). Delhi, some may argue, isn’t a city, but a city-state, and technically a Union Territory with a legislature. Still, it does have all characteristics of a large city — a predominantly urban population and 11 administrative districts that are tightly connected. It may be almost twice as large as New York, but it is marginally smaller than London. And right now, it is reeling under a fourth wave of Covid-19 — not just in terms of cases, but deaths too. On Saturday, it saw 167 deaths, the highest to date. Sunday’s numbers are not in when this column is being written.How bad is the city-state’s fourth wave? According to Jamie Mullick, the keeper of HT’s Covid-19 dashboard (from back in the time when the numbers were not so easily available), Delhi’s fourth wave is actually as bad as the city’s previous three waves combined (in terms of peak case levels). The seven-day average of cases on Saturday was higher than the highest seven-day averages witnessed during the previous three peaks — taken together (see the tables accompanying this piece).The numbers reflect that — in the seven days to Saturday, Delhi recorded 13.4% of the total (827,998) cases it has seen since the beginning of the pandemic.The seven-day average of deaths presents a healthier (I know, unfortunate choice of words) picture. It was 104 on Saturday, still lower than the peak seven-day average seen during the last wave.It makes little sense to dwell on what went wrong and how we got here. All the usual suspects — from complacence to apathy to misplaced priorities to a complete disregard for science and data — have been at play. But how do we get out of here?Hindustan Times (after the country’s first, bitter experience with a 68-day-long lockdown) has maintained that comprehensive lockdowns are avoidable except in two cases. One, the health infrastructure of a city or a region is under threat of being overwhelmed, or already is, and a further rise in cases would result in (I apologise for the choice of words in advance but this isn’t the time to sugar-coat things) people dying on the streets. Two, the city or region continues to see a huge increase in cases, with a high positivity level (a clear indicator that things could get worse). On Saturday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said at a press briefing that the city-state faces a shortage of oxygen, drugs, and ICU beds. Also on Saturday, Delhi’s positivity rate touched 24.56% (which means one in four tests turned up positive). The seven-day average of the positivity rate (on Saturday) was 16.5% and rising fast. Delhi clearly needs a short sharp lockdown, one that includes curbs on inter-state movement of people (not goods) without good reason, perhaps even on trains and flights.Also read: CM issues appeal for beds as 1 in 3 samples in Delhi is positiveIt can be argued that there will be an economic cost to all this, just as the local government likely reasoned a few weeks ago — a time when it made sense to impose some not-so-drastic restrictions — that there would be an economic cost to these, but the alternative is unimaginable. Indeed, Delhi, and India’s management of the Covid-19 pandemic is a study in reactive management — we have always been a step behind the virus.Delhi also needs to aggressively vaccinate people. A little over two million people have received one dose of a vaccine and around 440,000, both doses. That’s around 12% of the city-state’s population (more than many other cities and regions) that has some form of protection against severe infection and death (there’s enough research to show that even one dose substantially enhances this protection). The question I would be asking, if I were in either the state or union government is simply this: how soon can we double this number? Because 25% protected against severe illness and death definitely sounds better.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618785260925.html
19-04-2021||India||A 3rd of all new infections reported from Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh||A third of all new cases of Covid-19 reported across India on Sunday came from just two states – Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh – both of which broke all previous single-day case records as the outbreak continued to soar in the country’s most populous regions.Sunday is also now the seventh day in a row that India has set a new record for the most new cases in a day, which has now pushed the total number of active cases in the country to nearly 2 million. As of Sunday night, there are 1,930,206 active Covid-19 cases across the country, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.A total of 68,631 new infections were reported in Maharashtra on Sunday, while 30,566 new cases were recorded in UP, the highest and second highest in the country for the day, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard. Together, they accounted for 36% of the 275,482 new cases across India, also a nationwide record.Also read: India logs 275k new Covid-19 cases, positivity rate doublesOn Sunday, 17 states and Union territories across the country set new daily case records, a statistic that highlights the geographical spread of the second wave of India’s Covid-19 outbreak. Key among them were Delhi (25,462 cases on Sunday), Karnataka (19,067 new cases), Kerala (18,257 daily infections), Madhya Pradesh (12,248) cases, Tamil Nadu (10,723), Rajasthan (10,514) and Gujarat (10,340).The 10 worst affected states are Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Rajasthan that have together reported 79% of the new infections recorded in the country on Sunday.The daily average of 218,935 cases registered over the last week is also a record, and is more than twice what was seen during the worst of the first wave in the country – the seven-day average of daily cases peaked at 93,617 for the week ending September 16, 2020. Just last week, this number was 133,918 – this means that the outbreak in the country is currently expanding by 63% every week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-3rd-of-all-new-infections-reported-from-maharashtra-uttar-pradesh-101618780868826.html
19-04-2021||India||Bengal has been a divided ground for long: Amartya Sen||Ahead of the fifth of eight phase assembly elections in West Bengal on Saturday, Nobel laureate Amartya Sen spoke to Sunetra Choudhury about the elections and the issues involved. Edited excerpts:Why are Bengal elections associated with violence? The fear of violence was also cited by the Election Commission (EC) for eight phase polls.I don’t think it is because Bengal is more violent. I think the EC wanted it divided and if you see how the election is going, where the Prime Minister goes away and does a little bit of work for his Prime Ministerial role and then comes back in time for another part of the elections. This is something in which the central government clearly has some ability to participate in every activity in a way that would not have been possible if it were a one-day election or a two-day election. Now, I don’t know whether that was the reason for EC doing it in this form. A lot of people in Bengal are rather critical of the Election Commission, the way the law and order situation has gone...Bengal is divided between Hindus and Muslims that has not been traditionally a big divider. On the contrary, if you go back to the beginning of Bengali culture and literature, in the 10th century, you will see an intermingling of Hindus and Muslims... The main epics, the Ramayana and Mahabharata, the main translating initiative came from the Muslim King in Bengal who was very fond of the epics. There has been a tradition of Hindu-Muslim unity from time to time...BJP no doubt uses polarisation, but election strategist Prashant Kishor has acknowledged that TMC and Congress only tried to appease Muslims and now Hindus wanted to vote for a party that was looking at their interests. Do you agree with this?It seems like an approximate history. Bengal has been a divided ground for a long time. When the British partitioned it early in the 20th century and wanted a Muslim part separated out, they hoped that there would be support from the Muslims in Bengal... Bengalis, both Hindus, and Muslims, were totally against it... Given that Muslims have been traditionally a lot poorer than Hindus in Bengal... there is a need for justice in dealing with it, in looking after the poor, in looking after those at the rougher end of the pyramid of justice... It is important to see who the poor in a region are and what can be done to help them. Now some of the concerns with Muslims came for the same reason as the concern for Matuas, Namasudra, and the Hindu lower caste or the Hindu-related tribal population of Bengal.So, I think the whole idea of Muslims having done it, and now it was the time for Hindus to teach them a lesson, is just a part of the propaganda of a party inspired by Hindutva thoughts...You spoke about the lower caste communities and the underprivileged, the BJP counts them as their voters. They also voted for them in Uttar Pradesh and in the 2019 general elections. What would explain that?That’s a very interesting question because what happens electorally is not just a matter of what preceding justice was in a particular area. It depends so much on the organisational facility.One of the interesting things to look at far away from Bengal or UP would be say Kerala. Kerala had more untouchability, more caste division than almost anywhere else in India. And yet, because of ultimate organisation, in this case by the Left, the caste situation changed radically over time. And it was possible for the Communist Party, which ignored these caste divisions, to get support from all the castes. We must not ignore the enormous role that political organisation plays. Hindutva has been a very dynamic political movement. I may not agree with them, but I certainly admire many of their organisational feats and they were successful not in all the elections...Do you think certain crucial mistakes were made by the state government?There may well have been, I haven’t studied it in particular. There are also achievements. The Bengali peasants still have a better health condition than the Gujarati peasants, despite being poorer. There are some delivery issues, but distribution has worked quite well and so on...||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-has-been-a-divided-ground-for-long-amartya-sen-101618779417117.html

19-04-2021||India||To encourage pilgrims, portals of Yamunotri shrine to open on May 14||This year the portals of the Yamunotri shrine will be opened on May 14 at about 12.15 pm. The decision on the date of opening the portals was taken by the Yamunotri Dham Mandir Samiti on Sunday on the occasion of Yamuna Jayanti. After checking the auspicious time from an astrological point of view, the exact time of 12.15 pm on May 14 was arrived at for opening the portals of the Yamunotri shrine for the next six months, Kriteshwar Uniyal, Secretary, Yamunotri Dham Mandir Samiti said. He informed that the portals of the Gangotri shrine will be opened on May 15 on the occasion of Akshay Tritya at around 7.30 am. In February this year, the date for opening the portals of Badrinath shrine- May 18 -was declared on the occasion of Basant Panchami. Last month the date of opening of the portals of Kedarnath shrine - May 17- was announced. The portals of the Sikh holy shrine Hemkund Sahib in Chamoli district will be opened this year on May 10. On October 10 last year, the portals of Hemkund Sahib were closed for the winter months following all rituals and prayers. The shrine was opened on September 4 last year following relaxations under Unlock 4.0. Last year Char Dham yatra didn’t start on April 26 with the opening of portals of Yamunotri and Gangotri (first two shrines to open after winter months) as lockdown had been imposed from March 22 due to the pandemic. The Char Dham shrines were opened for local pilgrims on July 1 last year by the state government and for pilgrims from other states in the last week of July. In September, the Uttarakhand government further removed the negative Covid-19 report mandatory for all pilgrims. According to Char Dham Devasthanam Management Board officials, last year, overall, 3.1 lakh pilgrims participated in the Char Dham Yatra, including 1.3 lakh pilgrims for Kedarnath. In 2019, over 32.40 lakh pilgrims had visited Char Dham shrines including over 10 lakh to Kedarnath, 12.4 lakh to Badrinath, 4.6 lakh to Yamunotri and over 5.3 lakh to Gangotri shrine Kedarnath, along with Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri, collectively called Char Dham, attract lakhs of pilgrims each year. Traditionally, Char Dham pilgrimage begins from the west from Yamunotri, then proceeding to Gangotri and finally to Kedarnath and Badrinath in the east.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/to-encourage-pilgrims-portals-of-yamunotri-shrine-to-open-on-may-14-101618776988335.html

On Sunday, the positivity rate was 29.74%, with 161 deaths being reported in the last 24 hours.Fewer than 100 intensive care unit beds were available in the city of more than 20 million people, Kejriwal said, with widespread complaints about the lack of beds, oxygen cylinders and crucial drugs.“The bigger worry is that in last 24 hours positivity rate has increased to around 30% from 24% ... The cases are rising very rapidly. The beds are filling fast,” Kejriwal told a digital news briefing.The test positivity rate – a ratio of the number of positive cases to total tests conducted, and a measure of the scale of an outbreak in the region – shot up from 0.59% over a month ago, to 29.74% on Sunday.In a separate statement, the Delhi government said it informed the Centre about “the dire need of beds and oxygen” and beds were now being set up in schools.Kejriwal said Delhi was facing an “acute shortage” of oxygen for Covid-19 patients and added that the quota of the city was diverted to other states. The remarks came hours after he wrote the letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.“Del facing acute shortage of oxygen. In view of sharply increasing cases, Del needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi’s quota has been diverted to other states. OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY IN DEL,” the chief minister tweeted on Sunday evening. He also wrote a letter to Union commerce and industries minister Piyush Goyal in this regard.The Union minister told ANI: “State governments should keep demand (for medical oxygen) under control. Demand-side management is as important as supply-side management. Containing Covid-19 spread is the responsibility of state governments and they should fulfil this responsibility.”Delhi, which has imposed a weekend curfew, is among the worst hit cities in India. The weekend curfew comes on top of 10pm-5am night curfew restrictions that are in place until April 30.Also Read | 8 states most prone to climate crisis: StudyChief minister Kejriwal and lieutenant governor Anil Baijal will hold a meeting with senior government officers on Monday over the Covid-19 situation in the national capital.Nationwide, India reported 275,482 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of cases past 15 million, second only to the US, which has reported more than 31 million infections. The country’s deaths from Covid-19 rose by a 1,622 to reach a total of 178,814.At the briefing, Kejriwal said he urged Union home minister Amit Shah to increase the number of Covid-19 beds in central government hospitals and help with oxygen supply. “In the last 24 hours, Delhi recorded around 25,500 new cases, up from around 24,000 the previous day and 19,500 new cases the day before that,” he said.“Cases are increasing at a fast rate and Covid-19 beds are getting occupied across the city. People are getting admitted in hospitals at an unprecedented rate. There is a major crisis of ICU beds. There are less than 100 ICU beds left in Delhi. We are facing a major shortage of oxygen, too. Last night, a private hospital told us that they almost ran into a disaster situation with a major shortage of oxygen supply,” the CM added.“We are constantly in touch with the central government. We are getting a lot of help from them. We thank them for that. Yesterday (Saturday), I spoke with Union health minister Harsh Vardhan. He was informed about the situation. Today, I spoke to Union home minister Amit Shah over phone. I have told him that we need more beds. In Delhi, the central government hospitals collectively have around 10,000 beds, of which around 1,800 are currently reserved for Covid-19 patients. I have requested him (Shah) to reserve at least 7,000 beds for Covid-19. The situation in Delhi is deteriorating every second. I also requested that oxygen supply be provided to us immediately,” said Kejriwal.He added that the Delhi government will be adding more than 6,000 additional Covid-19 beds with oxygen facilities in two-three days in locations that include health facilities set up at Yamuna Sports Complex, CWG village and premises of Radha Soami Satsang Beas. “We don’t know how many ICU beds we will be able to increase in such a short time. There are limitations. But we have seen that most patients primarily need high-flow oxygen. So, we are arranging more high-flow oxygen systems so that more beds can be converted into oxygen beds,” he said.In his letter to the PM, Kejriwal wrote: “The Covid-19 situation in Delhi is extremely serious. There is a severe shortage of Covid-19 beds and oxygen supply. At our level we are doing everything that is possible. We need your help.”As per the Delhi health department, 25,462 Covid-19 cases and 161 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, taking the total active cases in Delhi to 74,941. The total positive cases in the city now stand at 853,460,, including 766,398 recoveries and 12,121 deaths.As many as 85,620 samples were tested for the virus, including 56,015 RT-PCR/CBNAAT/TrueNath tests and 29,605 rapid antigen tests.In the last 24 hours, 67,448 beneficiaries were vaccinated against the coronavirus. Around 54,306 received the first dose, while 13,142 received the second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-issues-appeal-for-beds-as-1-in-3-samples-in-delhi-is-positive-101618775005331.html

Yet, those two carriageways were unavailable for motorists since the police had blocked them.“Some days ago, we opened the NH24 carriageway towards Ghaziabad. Today, we are working to open the adjacent carriageway on NH9,” said Kumar.The officer denied speculation in certain quarters that the police were suddenly working to get the agitating farmers evicted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nh9-lane-towards-meerut-to-be-opened-at-ghazipur-border-for-ambulances-101618772968615.html
19-04-2021||India||3 held for hoarding remdesivir||Bengaluru Bengaluru police on Sunday arrested at least three persons for allegedly hoarding and black marketing Remdesivir, a drug commonly used to treat Covid-19 infected persons in hospitals. “The CCB (central crime branch) conducted a drive across Bengaluru and arrested the three accused who were having illegal stock of the injection and were selling them at ₹10,500 each, which is much higher than the MRP,” Sandeep Patil, joint commissioner of police (crime), said in a statement. A total of 11 vials of injections were seized during the raid. According to medical practitioners, the anti-viral injection that costs between ₹1,000 and ₹5,500, depending on the brand, is sold for ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in the black market, Hindustan Times had earlier reported.Rajesh and Shakeeb, who run Gurushree medicals, a small medical store around Suddaguntepalya, were held in one such raid and Sohail was arrested from near Madiwala police station limits, police said. A probe is underway to find out the source of procurement.The arrests come at a time when hospitals in the city are already facing shortage of the drug.On Saturday, one person who did not wish to be named said he struggled to find the medicine for his infected mother in Banashankari locality of Bengaluru. “Even doctors are selling Remdesivir at exorbitant prices,” he claimed. The person added there was little response on the government-provided helpline number to procure Remdesivir.Representatives of one government and one private hospital told Hindustan Times that the drug was only being administered to in-patients and no other requests were being entertained keeping in mind its low availability.The Karnataka health department, however, said there was enough availability of the drug in Bengaluru and that hospitals are required to raise the request with an officer, specifically assigned for this purpose, to obtain the same. On Friday, the Karnataka government said it had placed orders for 70,000 doses of Remdesivir.“There is no shortage of the drug. However, the hospital has to raise the request for its supply with the concerned officer named for the purpose,” an official in the state health department said, requesting not to be named.Since the beginning of March, the city has witnessed a massive surge in Covid-19 cases, with more persons requiring hospitalization and critical life-saving drugs like Remdesivir.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-held-for-hoarding-remdesivir-101618772788046.html
19-04-2021||India||Executives play key role in fight against Covid||Bengaluru In the past one year, 23-year-old Shilpa has barely missed a day of work. Working in various shifts at Bangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited or BESCOM, she is among the over 100 people who are busy attending calls on the Covid-19 helpline from all corners of the city as well as districts to respond to queries ranging from availability of hospital beds to the treatment process. “Earlier, we took calls on electricity-related issues but then we started taking calls on Covid-19. It felt a little different but we got enough training and assistance. We have received all the support we needed and there is not much stress on us,” Shilpa says.“In the last one year, there was a lot of fear and people cried when they couldn’t get beds. Now, the situation has changed,” she adds. The call centre in the city receives nearly 1,000 calls per day and each representative attends to around 80-90 of them in their respective shifts, including checking on people to see if their needs were fulfilled. The staff got their first breather from Covid-related calls sometime in January when the caseload was reduced and the personnel were reassigned back to their original roles, that is, attending to electricity-related queries. “There is no stress per say because we are after all helping others with information when they need it the most,” 27-year-old Anil Kumar, an executive, says. In return for their services, these executives were picked and dropped back to their homes in sanitized company cabs to minimize their exposure to the coronavirus which has reigned havoc in the IT capital and other parts of the state and country. These faceless executives, like several others, have played a critical role in the fight against the pandemic, coordinating between hospitals, patients and their loved ones. Police, civic workers, ambulance drivers, health workers among several other sections have been the workhorses of the entire operation in Bengaluru and other parts of the country, quietly carrying out their roles behind all the clamour, chaos and cameras, experts believe.Several such workers have also paid with their lives, religiously carrying out their duties but getting minimum attention unlike frontline warriors like doctors, nurses among others. The case rise has not been kind to the people or those fighting it. More so, in the second wave which began in the first week of March. Bengaluru, in particular, has seen a sharp surge in cases since the beginning of March which has more than doubled since April. The city has reported over one lakh more infections in just the first 18 days of April as against 31,886 in March, 6,813 in February and 10,311 in January, according to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP, the city’s civic body). In the wake of the spike, the call centers have witnessed increased traffic in recent days, people aware of the developments said. Gopal, the person in charge of the call centre, said that though there are several people who may not require hospitalisation, contracting the infection causes panic among them. This is when the executives try to calm the caller, coordinate with in-house doctors and check if hospitalisation is required. “This covid helpline was set up here because this is a time-tested system where we used to at times get 25,000 calls per day, mostly regarding electricity-related complaints,” Rajesh Gowda, the managing director of BESCOM, says.The MD also said that they have added around 30 dedicated lines and more personnel due to the rising call traffic.To ensure services for all, the centre has also opened its helpline on WhatsApp which is tended to by trained professionals, medical students and even the police personnel to coordinate all related issues. Bengaluru has nearly run out of hospital beds, especially in the intensive care units (ICU) and those with ventilators. But the situation on the ground has little effect on those attending to calls who have remained as focused on the job at hand. “It feels really good when they say thank you at the end of the call. That’s all we need to continue,” Shilpa says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/executives-play-key-role-in-fight-against-covid-101618772728039.html
19-04-2021||India||127 million Covishield doses and 17 million Covaxin sent by centre so far||India has about 13 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in possession of the states — about 7.8 million Covishield and 5.7 million Covaxin – with about 10 million more in the pipeline for distribution among states over the coming weeks, data reviewed by HT showed on Sunday.Of a total of about 144 million doses that the Centre supplied to all states and Union territories till April 18, nearly 127 million were Covishield doses and 17 million doses were of the Covaxin vaccine, according to government data accessed by HT till late on Sunday.Amid allegations by states that vaccines are in short supply, the Centre maintains there is no shortage in the country. “The manufacturers are producing to their optimum capacity and supplying to the government. They are also simultaneously ramping up their capacities which will be visible by June,” said a central government official aware of the matter, adding there was no supply crunch from the manufacturers’ side.India is currently administering two vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin – after a nationwide immunization drive against the infectious disease began on January 16. The drugs controller general of India (DCGI) last week approved the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Russia’s Gamaleya Research Institute, Sputnik V, for emergency use in India, a day after the regulator’s subject expert committee (SEC) recommended that there was enough data to grant the vaccine emergency use authorisation. The first local supplies of the Russian vaccine are expected by July.Covishied is an Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine locally manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII), and Covaxin is co-developed by Bharat Biotech International Ltd. and the Indian Council of Medical Research.Out of 144 million doses supplied so far to states, a total of 123 million doses have been consumed since the nationwide Covid-19 vaccination was launched. Of these, Covishield doses are about 110 million and about 11 million are Covaxin doses, government data shows.“The companies have fixed capacities, and like I said, they are producing 100% for the government, so there are no supply issues,” the official quoted above said on condition of anonymity.Also Read | -ve RT-PCR test must for those coming from 6 states: Maharashtra govtAnother government official who spoke on condition of anonymity said: “Supplies are not an issue; the government focus is to ensure maximum eligible beneficiaries are vaccinated at the earliest.”The Union ministry of health and family welfare also wrote to states on Sunday asking to ensure movement restrictions imposed by the government for Covid-19 control do not adversely impact the vaccination exercise.“It is advised that Covid-19 vaccination services should not be affected by Covid-19 curfews/lockdowns, and the movement of beneficiaries to and from Covid-19 vaccination centres should not be restricted during such interventions…,” said Manohar Agnani, additional secretary, health ministry, in his letter to states.Experts said with the rapid rise in cases, vaccination will be one of the key interventions to bring down the numbers in the long run.“We don’t have enough evidence to support whether these vaccines are effective in stopping transmission; however, we do know that these stop disease progression to severe level. If we keep on having milder version of infection for some time, then over a period of time it may just die, which is why vaccination is important,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/13mn-vaccine-doses-with-states-another-10mn-in-pipeline-data-101618772487420.html
19-04-2021||India||Fearing 2020 rerun, migrants rush home||Hariharan Yadav (34) is one of the several migrant workers who returned from Maharashtra’s Nagpur city to his village in Uttar Pradesh’s Gorakhpur, fearing the Covid-19 situation may turn from bad to worse and that he may lose his job amid a possible lockdown like last year.Unwilling to go through the same set of troubles and pain he experienced last year, Yadav, who is a painter, said: “The pain and torture to which we were subjected during the lockdown last year is still fresh in my memory. I travelled for more than 200km on foot, faced police detention and almost died due to hunger. Hence, this year, I cannot take any chances as I have a family to look after.”Besides Yadav, more than 200 villagers, who were involved in similar professions in Maharashtra, have returned till date to Rampur Rakba, which is referred to as the painter’s village. “Around 800 villagers work in different states as painters and half of them have returned,” Jai Prakash Paswan, former village head of Rampur Rakba, East UP, said.Ravindra Pal Singh (38), a resident of Basti district, boarded a train home from New Delhi railway station last week. “I worked at a food processing plant in Bahadurgarh, Haryana. There was very little work, so I decided to return home and help my family in the fields. If the Covid-19 cases go down, I will go back,” he said.Similarly, 50-year-old Nripendra Kumar, who has been living in Mumbai for over two decades, returned to his native village Jaffarpur in Purnea district of Bihar on Friday. “I lost my job and there was nothing left for me,” Kumar said, adding that a large number of people from Bihar were leaving Mumbai and other cities of Maharashtra, where daily Covid-19 cases have crossed 60,000.Also read: A 3rd of all new infections reported from Maharashtra, Uttar PradeshIn Muzaffarpur, one of the districts that has a high migrant population in various states, reverse migration has started.

So, I decided to board the special train,” he said.In Madhya Pradesh’s Bundelkhand, Alirajpur and Jabhua, close to 20,000 workers returned from the National Capital Region (NCR), Maharashtra and Gujarat in the past week with some of them losing their jobs amid the second wave.While several state governments have decided to test migrant workers, they are yet to open quarantine centres and deploy rural health infrastructure personnel to track the returnees. Uttar Pradesh chief secretary R K Riwari announced that the government made Covid-19 test mandatory for all those entering the state.A Bihar government official said those testing positive are either sent to isolation centres or they are home quarantined with medicines and they are under constant medical observation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fearing-2020-rerun-migrants-rush-home-101618772427434.html

19-04-2021||India||‘I was hounded for no fault of mine’: Ex-ISRO scientist||For him, it is not a sweet revenge but a long drawn-battle for justice and truth. Sitting on the verandah of his house in Palkulangara in the heart of the state capital, former scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Nambi Narayanan is not elated over the media crowd around him yet again. On Thursday, the Supreme Court had ordered a probe led by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) into the wrongful arrest of the 80-year-old in an espionage case 27 years ago that blew up his career and reportedly delayed the country’s cryogenic rocket engine programme. “Let the truth come out. I was hounded for no fault of mine. The country’s rocket programme suffered badly. Who plotted the entire drama? Let the conspiracy come out,” he said, adding on a lighter note that most of the media men in the capital knew more about the case than him. But as he got into details, indignation and anger writ large on his bearded face. He remembered the day three policemen descended on his house on November 30, 1994, with a request that their boss, a deputy inspector general of police (DIG), wanted to talk to him. He followed them in their jeep quietly.At the police station, he was asked to sit on a bench. The DIG did not turn up and he fell asleep on that bench that night. On the following morning, he was informed that he was arrested for espionage among other charges. It was the beginning of a long ordeal for Narayanan. (Then) DIG Sibi Mathews, who later became the state police chief, is one of the three police officers facing the CBI probe now. Narayanan was in judicial custody for 51 days and allegedly tortured by police officials and later by the sleuths of the Intelligence Bureau (IB). He was forced to stand for long hours without food or water and was even put through a lie detection test. “I told them bluntly that rocket technology cannot be transferred on a piece of paper. But junior level officers and others kept asking me how I sold secrets. They were eager to frame me. They had no idea about either cryogenic technology or the space programme and they treated me like any other criminal in their custody,” he recalled. When the espionage case came to light, Narayanan, who was 55 years then, was in charge of the cryogenic division of ISRO. He was the first to introduce liquid prolusion fuel technology. The country’s space technology suffered badly due to the case. “The technology should have been in use by 1999 but it was delayed for 15 years and finally came in 2014,” he said. Lodged in the high-security Poojapura central jail, one of the former ISRO scientist’s cell mate was a serial killer. “They were all kind to me and consoled me saying I was framed for some other motive,” he said. When Narayanan was taken to the court, people mocked him. He was also hounded by the media. The case was later handed over to the CBI and he got bail on January 19, 1995. The ordeal was far from over. When he returned home, he found his wife Meenakshi Amma had slipped into depression and his two children were also disturbed. “Everything turned upside down for me. Hated by all, I thought of committing suicide on several occasions. But I never wanted to die as a traitor. I lived all these years only to tell my bitter story,” he said. The sensational case, which later became a plot for several books and movies, surfaced in 1994 when during a beat patrol, two policemen found two Maldivian semi-literate women Mariyam Rasheeda and Fouzia Hassan staying in one of the rented houses in the state capital despite visa expiry. A diary was seized from them which reportedly carried several names, including two senior ISRO scientists -- Nambi Narayanan and D Sasikumaran. Narayanan, Sasikumaran, a contractor and the two women were charged with offences such as espionage, cheating and hatching conspiracy under various sections, including the Official Secrets Act. They were accused of selling the country’s top rocket secrets to an enemy country for sexual favours and money. Later, the inspector general of police (IG) Ramon Srivastav’s name cropped up in the case.The case also witnessed a political fallout. Then chief minister K Karunakaran was forced to quit in 1995 when a section of party men led by Congress leaders A K Antony and Oommen Chandy revolted and accused him of protecting Ramon Srivastav. Later, Antony flew down in a chartered flight from Delhi to become the chief minister. Two powerful groups soon emerged in the state Congress and Karunakaran used all his opportunities to corner his rivals in the party. “My father was hounded badly, citing trumped up charges. More than his opponents, some in the party did more damage to him. He did not get justice. It remained an unhealed wound till his last breath,” K Karunakaran’s son K Muraleedharan said, while welcoming the latest CBI probe into the case. Srivastav also lauded the order for the CBI inquiry. It is a different story though that the CPI(M) had held a series of agitations against him at the height of the spy scandal. Srivastava, who is now settled in Kerala, is one of the top advisors of present chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan.Narayanan got relief when the CBI took over the case and exonerated him finally in 1996. The state government moved the Supreme Court with an appeal that was dismissed in 1998. “Though I was exonerated and taken back into service, the stigma still remained. For the next two decades, I fought many legal battles for my honour and I wanted to make sure it did not happen with any other official in the country,” he said. The latest CBI probe came after he moved the apex court challenging the High Court order absolving three senior police officers (former DGP Sibi Mathew, former SPs K K Joshua and S Vijayan) in the case. But all the three retired officers later claimed that the Jain Commission never heard them before recommending the CBI probe. The state government was forced to loosen its wallet and pay a compensation of ₹1.80 crore to Narayanan in three installments. And the country bestowed him the third highest civilian honour Padma Bushan in 2019. “My age is really weighing on me. Thank God, the SC has set a three-month time frame for the CBI inquiry. I hope I can see the end result of who cooked up the case,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/i-was-hounded-for-no-fault-of-mine-ex-isro-scientist-101618772308100.html
19-04-2021||India||Mamata slams govt over vaccine supply||West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the state was running out of Covid-19 vaccines and essential medicines such as Remdesivir, while cases were on the rise.In the letter, Banerjee also took a veiled dig at the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), saying people coming from other states for election campaigning “at the behest of some political parties” were responsible for the sharp rise in infections.Citing her February 24 letter in which she sought the Centre’s permission to directly purchase vaccines and start a free vaccination campaign across Bengal, Banerjee wrote, “The state has not received the requisite clearance yet. In the meantime, the number of cases in the state has also started to rise sharply, particularly in view of coming of large number of outsiders to the state for election campaign and other purposes at the behest of some political parties.”Stating that vaccination is of “top importance,” especially in Kolkata, where concentration of population is very high, Banerjee wrote, “Unfortunately for us, the supply of vaccines from the Government of India side is scarce and erratic, which has been negatively affecting our vaccination programmes…We have to vaccinate around 2.7 crore and we need 5.4 crore doses. We request for your urgent intervention to ensure that the state gets its requirement of vaccine doses fulfilled at the earliest.” “Instead of blaming the Prime Minister for the Covid crisis, the chief minister should have attended the meetings of chief ministers that the Centre convened,” Bengal BJP vice-president Jay Prakash Majumdar told HT||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-slams-centre-over-vaccine-supply-101618771887419.html
19-04-2021||India||Vaccines key to tackling Covid-19: Manmohan to PM||Former prime minister Manmohan Singh on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, suggesting five ways the government can tackle vaccine shortage amid the second wave of coronavirus in the country.Stressing that ramping up vaccination was the key to battling the pandemic, the veteran Congress leader asked Modi to make public the order for doses of coronavirus vaccines placed by the government and also indicate how the vaccines will be distributed among states based on a transparent formula.Singh also urged the government to “resist the temptation to look at the absolute numbers being vaccinated and focus instead on the percentage of the population vaccinated”.Besides this, the former prime minister suggested that the Modi government offer some kind of flexibility to states in defining the categories of frontline workers that need to be vaccinated against the virus, even if they are below the age of 45 years (the current eligibility criterion).“For instance, states may want to designate school teachers, bus, three-wheeler and taxi drivers, municipal and panchayat staff, and possibly lawyers who have to attend courts as frontline workers,” he wrote.Highlighting the vaccine shortage in the country, Singh said that any vaccine that has been approved by credible authorities like the European Medical Agency should be allowed to be imported without insisting on domestic bridging trials.“The relaxation could be for a limited period during which the bridging trials could be completed in India. All consumers of such vaccines could be duly cautioned that these vaccines are being allowed for use based on the approval granted by the relevant authority abroad,” he said.To be sure, coronavirus vaccines cleared for use in the US, the UK, the European Union, and Japan will get fast-track approval in India, the Union government said on Tuesday last week, potentially boosting the country’s pandemic response through possible imports of Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson (J&J) products.Acknowledging the huge potential in the private sector, Singh recommended that the government actively support domestic vaccine producers to expand their manufacturing facilities by providing them with funds and other concessions.“I believe this is the time to invoke the compulsory licensing provisions in the law so that a number of companies are able to produce the vaccines under a licence,” he said.The former prime minister also acknowledged the cloud of uncertainty among the people of the country who are “wondering when their lives would go back to normal”.On Sunday morning, the Union ministry of health and family welfare announced that more than 122 million people in India were vaccinated against Covid-19 in a span of 92 days. It added that in the last 24 hours, over 2.6 million people were inoculated in the country, pushing the overall figure to 122,622,590.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-key-to-tackling-covid-manmohan-singh-to-pm-modi-101618771828909.html

Expressing his gratitude to all doctors and medical staff of the country, Modi said even in this hour of crisis, they were performing their duties faithfully.Emphasising on the ‘test, track and treat’ strategy, the PM said that like the first wave, the same strategy has to be adopted to win against the virus in the second wave. “Learning from the experiences of the past year, we have to move forward cautiously,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-reviews-covid-19-situation-in-varanasi-101618771647371.html
19-04-2021||India||BJP, Maharashtra govt spar over Remdesivir supply||A row between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the ruling alliance in Maharashtra intensified on Sunday, with the BJP calling for an FIR over allegations that the Centre was blocking the supply of Remdesivir medicine to the state.Maharashtra home minister Dilip Walse Patil on Sunday accused the BJP of trying to pressurise the Mumbai Police and interfere in their work. He said the city police received a specific input that 50,000 vials of Remdesivir were being brought to the city, and added that the director of Bruck Pharma was called for questioning on Saturday in that connection.Vile Parle police summoned a director of Bruck Pharma, a Daman-based pharmaceutical manufacturer of Remdesivir for questioning about a stock of the drug. The executive was questioned at the police station for more than 45 minutes and was let go later.Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis said that the detention of the executive of Bruck Pharma, who was supposed to supply Remdesivir to Maharashtra, was a shameful act. “We visited the police station and DCP office to ask what was his offence. He had taken all permissions from Maharashtra and Daman administration…,” he said.Mumbai police are likely to call the director of the pharma company for one more round of questioning for allegedly stocking thousands of Remdesivir medicine vials, an official told PTI on Sunday.Fadnavis visited the police station on Saturday night along with other BJP leaders. The leader enquired why the director of the pharmaceutical company was called to the police station, he said in the statement.Fadnavis said that permission was taken from the FDA commissioner to donate the stock of Remdesevir vials to the Maharashtra government, as Remdesevir stocked for export cannot be diverted to the domestic market without the nod of the Drugs Controller General of India (DCGI) or the FDA.Patil said: “A probe is on whether the stock was to be sold to private parties or to the government. The stock is at present with the company. It was not going to the government… Investigation is being carried out to find out to whom it was being given.”Maharashtra Congress president Nana Patole, meanwhile, demanded action against Fadnavis and other leaders for “pressuring police to let off” the pharma company director.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-maha-govt-spar-over-remdesivir-supply-101618771588168.html
19-04-2021||India||Govt bans oxygen supply to industries||The Centre on Sunday decided to prohibit the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes by manufacturers and suppliers from April 22 barring nine select sectors, with massive shortage of medical oxygen across the country leading to more Covid-related casualties, according to a statement issued by the ministry of home affairs.The nine industrial sectors which will continue to get oxygen supply include pharmaceuticals, petroleum refineries, steel plants, ampoules and vials, nuclear energy establishments, oxygen cylinder manufacturers, waste water treatment plants, food and water purification and process industries which require uninterrupted running of furnaces. All other industrial units have been told to consider alternative measures such as import of oxygen or setting up Air Separator Units (ASUs) for generation of oxygen for their captive requirements.Home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla wrote to all states and Union territories informing them about diverting oxygen meant for industrial use for medical reasons after a review was done on Sunday by the Empowered Group-II mandated to coordinate medical logistics. Bhalla said states that have seen a rapid rise in Covid-19 cases and need medical oxygen include Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Punjab, and Rajasthan.“The country has been facing an unprecedented surge in the new daily cases of Covid in various States and UTs... The requirement for Medical Oxygen is a critical component in the treatment of Covid affected patients. In view of the recent surge... the requirement of oxygen for effective clinical treatment... has also witnessed a manifold hike,” according to the MHA statement. “Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade has conveyed that this has already reached about 60 percent of the total daily Oxygen production, and is expected to rise further. There have been reports of shortage of medical oxygen from some States and UTs,” it added.After the Sunday order was issued, Union minister Piyush Goyal said that the measure has been taken to ensure adequate supply of oxygen to hospitals.“Before Covid pandemic hit India, our daily medical oxygen consumption was around 1,000-1,200 metric tonnes. But on April 15, 4,795 metric tonnes of medical oxygen was used in the country. We’ve increased production capacity in the last one year,” Goyal said, according to news agency ANI.The minister also gave a break-up of the shares that will be allotted to states which face a shortage. “After an elaborate meeting with 12 states, the central government did mapping ... 6,177 metric tonnes of oxygen has been finalised to be distributed to states...” the Union minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-bans-oxygen-supply-to-industries-amid-massive-shortage-101618771528051.html
19-04-2021||India||Kin allege 12 died in MP due to ‘oxygen shortage’, govt and hospital dismiss claim||At least 12 Covid-19 patients died due to alleged shortage of oxygen in a medical college in Shahdol on the intervening night of Saturday and Sunday, the families of the deceased said, even as Madhya Pradesh medical education minister Vishwas Sarang asserted that no deaths took place for lack of supply.“My brother was fine at 9pm on Saturday. The doctors told me that they were giving oxygen to him and he will be fine. But at 4am on Sunday, people began shouting that there was a shortage of oxygen. The patients were not getting oxygen. The family members tried to enter the ward but the hospital staff stopped us,” Prem Kevrani, whose 31-year-old brother succumbed to the infection, said on Sunday.“Later, I entered the ward and checked my brother. His body had turned cold and there were 11 others who died in the ward. The hospital staff said they died as they did not get proper oxygen,” he added.Sarang, however, said there was no shortage of oxygen and that a probe was ordered. “The serious patients died due to medical complications but an inquiry has been ordered in the matter to know the cause of the death of so many patients in one night.”Shahdol medical college dean Dr Milind Shilarkar said: “An oxygen tanker was scheduled to reach Shahdol on Saturday but it didn’t reach the medical college due to some mechanical issue... But, we were providing oxygen through small cylinders. The patients were admitted in a serious condition and they died due to health complications.”Attacking the government, MP Congress chief Kamal Nath said: “CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is lying about oxygen supply by giving fake data. When will this end?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kin-allege-12-died-in-mp-due-to-o2-shortage-govt-and-hospital-dismiss-claim-101618771527430.html
19-04-2021||India||No lockdown for now, Bihar to contain Covid-19 spread through night curfew||Bihar will not go in for lockdown but will impose night curfew from 9 pm to 5 am and close all government and private educational institutions and postpone exams till May 15, to break the chain of transmission of the Covid-19 pandemic. The state has witnessed an unprecedented spurt in the last one month with the addition of 8690 new cases in the last 24 hours. This has taken the tally of active cases closer to 50,000 in Bihar. Announcing the move after marathon meetings with district magistrates and later with the crisis management group during the day, Chief Minister Nitish Kumar said Section 144 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) will be imposed as per requirement in town areas and block level during the day to prohibit assemblies of four or more individuals and avoid any crowding. “The district magistrates will ensure that vegetable mandis and roadside vending are staggered and not crowded. All public places like malls, cinema halls, gyms and parks as well as religious places will remain closed and restaurants and dhabas will only provide home delivery or takeaway facility. There will be a cap of 100 people for marriage and ‘shradh’ events. The government and private offices, already running with one-third attendance, will close by 5 pm, while the shops will close by 6 pm. Earlier, it was 7 pm. However, it will not apply to essential services,” he added. The announcement was very much on expected lines after Saturday’s all-party meeting, which was not unanimous on complete state-wide lockdown due to likely hardships faced by the common masses in a poor state like Bihar and the issue of large number of migrants. The CM, however, appealed to all the people living outside the state to return as early as possible, as delay will cause problems for them, hinting that the government might review the situation in the days to come to decide on sterner measures. “The government will make all arrangements. Those in home isolation will be monitored on a daily basis, while those returning will be provided with quarantine facilities like last year at the sub-divisional level. A lot of deliberations have been done on every aspect,” the CM said, adding that it had been decided to wait for some time before deciding on the possibility of lockdown. Kumar said that the government has also taken a decision to develop containment zones like last year to contain the spread of pandemic and increase number of beds in dedicated Covid hospitals and care centres and give a boost to awareness campaigns to make people aware of the need to adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour for their own safety as well as that of their near and dear ones. The CM said that during the meeting, all the aspects were discussed, viz. reports of oxygen shortage, medicine requirement, especially Remdesivir, and delay in RT-PCR reports. “The emphasis will be on fast tracking testing and vaccination. Early start of treatment is important and for that timely availability of RT-PCR reports will be ensured,” he added. The CM said that like last year, the panchayati raj department will start supply of masks in the rural and urban areas in larger numbers. “Like last year, the government has also decided to give one-month additional salary to doctors and health workers in view of the enormous work they are doing to meet the huge pandemic challenge,” he added. Health minister Mangal Pandey said that the government was ensuring smooth supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injection as also other medicines. “We are in touch with the suppliers and smooth supply will be ensured,” he added. After getting detailed feedback from all the political parties on the prevailing Covid-19 situation in Bihar at a meeting called by Governor Phagu Chauhan on Saturday, the CM had said that the government would announce further measures to contain the spread of the virus on Sunday after seeking reports from all the district magistrates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-lockdown-for-now-bihar-to-contain-covid-19-spread-through-night-curfew-101618771408023.html
19-04-2021||India||India logs 275k new Covid-19 cases, positivity rate doubles||India’s Covid-19 test positivity rate – a key indicator of the on-the-ground spread of the disease – has soared to the highest ever and has now doubled in less than two weeks, even as the country yet again set new single-day records with more than 275,000 new cases and 1,622 new deaths on Sunday, amid reports of shortages of crucial drugs and oxygen as the second wave continued its relentless expansion.A total of 275,482 new infections were lodged on Sunday, taking the total number of confirmed cases past the 15 million mark, even as daily deaths touched a record 1,622, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.India’s testing positivity rate (TPR) – the proportion of samples returning positive for Covid-19 – touched 16.7% on Saturday, as the weekly average touched 14.3%, both the highest ever and are the latest in a series of grim milestones that the second wave of the outbreak is leaving in its wake. The previous record for highest daily positivity rate was lodged on July 19, 2020, when it touched 15.7%, and the old record for weekly positivity rate was 12.5% for the week ending July 15.A positivity rate of 16.7% means that one out of every six samples being tested returned positive, a very high proportion for a country the size of India. And this number is even higher when looked at certain states and UTs. In Chhattisgarh, Delhi and Goa, for instance, one out of every three tests was positive, and in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, one in every four was positive.“Chhattisgarh reported the highest weekly positivity rate among states at 30.4%... India’s daily new cases continue to rise… Sixteen states are displaying an upward trajectory in daily new cases,” said Union health ministry in a statement.Experts say that it is crucial that the chain of transmission be broken. “The most important thing at the moment is that transmission chain has to be broken... Also, extra measures need to be taken to curb super-spreader events,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, senior public health expert, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.The rising cases have also led to increased demand for beds, medical oxygen, and the antiviral drug Remdesivir, with people finding it hard to get any of these.On Friday, Union health ministry sent out an advisory asking all central ministries to issue instructions to hospitals and public sector undertakings (PSUs) under their control to set up exclusive dedicated hospital wards or separate blocks within the hospitals for Covid care.“The directive is aimed at ensuring more beds are created for Covid-19 patients as there is being seen a surge. Many of these hospitals have the capacity to act as Covid care centres and can be made use of,” said a senior government official aware of the matter, who did not want to be identified.To meet the sudden surge in demand for medical oxygen, 162 pressure swing adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants have been sanctioned by the Centre for installation in public health facilities in all states. This step will provide additional supply of 154.19 metric tons of medical oxygen supply, the government said.Out of 162 PSA plants sanctioned, 33 have been installed— five in MP, four in Himachal Pradesh, three each in Chandigarh, Gujarat and Uttarakhand, two each in Bihar, Karnataka and Telangana; and one each in Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Delhi, Haryana, Kerala, Maharashtra, Puducherry, Punjab and Uttar Pradesh. By end of April, 2021, 59 more oxygen plants will be installed, and by end of May, around 80 more will get added, government has said. In addition to 162 plants already sanctioned, at least 100 additional plants are also being sanctioned on the request of several states.As part of its initiative to ramp up Remdesivir production, the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers on Sunday announced that soon 300,000 vials per day will be manufactured in the country to meet the demand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-275k-new-covid-19-cases-positivity-rate-doubles-101618771227425.html
