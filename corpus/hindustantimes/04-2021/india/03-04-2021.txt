It was recorded by some TMC party workers. We want her to get back to normal life soon, we also pray for that... but she must stop putting up this drama by moving around in a wheelchair."If she was exercising her leg by shaking it then I suggest that she start walking as that will help her recuperate faster."Taking a jibe at the chief minister, Rahul Sinha, a senior leader of the saffron party, said the TMC supremo's bandage will not buy her votes."The more she is losing confidence the bigger her bandage gets. People are not buying this... She must have forgotten which leg is injured, and shook the wrong foot. She has already lost the elections, the bandage won't be able to save her from imminent defeat," Sinha said.Taking strong exception to the remarks made by BJP leaders, state minister Shashi Panja said the saffron camp, by raising suspicion over Banerjee's injuries, has not just insulted her but all the women of Bengal."We condemn the manner the BJP is insulting our beloved CM. They are not just insulting our CM, but also the other women of the state. We urge them to show proper respect to the women of this state," Panja said.Echoing her, former BJP leader Yashwant Sinha, who joined the TMC recently, said if anybody was churning out lies, it was the BJP and not the TMC."Are they (BJP leaders) trying to say that a whole lot of people involved (in treating her) including eminent doctors are lying? It's only the BJP which is capable of speaking such lies. I've no doubt in my mind that they are the ones behind this (propaganda)," Sinha, who had served as the finance minister in the Atal Bihari Vajpayee cabinet, stated.TMC spokesperson Kunal Ghosh also hit out at the BJP and said that the people of Bengal will give the BJP a befitting reply for its "dirty politics"."If they (BJP leaders) are spending so much time staring at Didi's feet, they might as well fall on her feet. We condemn such politics that targets a woman who is holding campaigns sitting on a wheelchair, after being attacked. This shows that the BJP has lost its plot," Ghosh said.Banerjee sustained injuries on her left leg, waist, shoulder and neck as she fell down after allegedly being pushed by miscreants in Nandigram on March 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mamata-seen-shaking-injured-leg-in-video-sparks-war-of-words-between-tmc-and-bjp-101617472748076.html

The sacrifices of the brave martyrs will never be forgotten. May the injured recover at the earliest,” Modi wrote on Twitter.PM Modi’s post came hours after five jawans were killed and 12 others were injured during a gunbattle between security forces and Maoists in the forests at the Bijapur and Sukma districts.“The encounter lasted about three hours inside the jungle. The injured were airlifted to Raipur and an operation was underway to evacuate the injured jawans and bodies from the forest through helicopters. More details are awaited,” the said Director-General of Police (DGP), Chhattisgarh, DM Awasthi said.The body of a woman Maoist was also recovered from the encounter spot, news agency PTI reported citing police officials.According to people familiar with the developments cited by news agency ANI, the Indian Air Force has deployed Mi-17 helicopters to help the paramilitary forces in rescue operations in Sukma.The encounter broke out as security forces in Chhattisgarh had been receiving information about the whereabouts of Madvi Hidma, a top Maoist of banned CPI (Maoist) who has been linked to major attacks including the 2013 Jhiram Ghati killings, ANI reported.The agency cited CRPF sources saying that the search for the Maoist may have triggered the encounter. According to inputs received by the security forces the location of People's Liberation Guerilla Army (PLGA) 'commander' was close to the place of encounter, they added. "We have been receiving inputs of the location of Hidma in Sukma district which borders Bijapur. A joint team of DRG, Bastar Battalion, CRPF CoBRA left for jungle area after information was received," a senior CRPF official deployed in Naxal-hit area told ANI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-says-sacrifices-will-never-be-forgotten-as-5-jawans-die-in-bastar-encounter-101617469344837.html

03-04-2021||India||'Ineligible beneficiaries getting Covid shot as health, frontline workers': Centre||Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan on Saturday said that illegible beneficiaries are getting the Covid-19 vaccine under the category of healthcare and frontline workers. Bhushan directed all states and Union territories to immediately stop new registrations in the two categories on the CoWIN portal.“Various inputs have been received from different sources that in some of the CVCs (Covid Vaccination Centres) some ineligible beneficiaries are being registered as healthcare workers and frontline workers and are getting vaccinated in complete violation of the prescribed guidelines,” the letter read.As per Bhushan's letter to the states, there was a 24% increase in the database of the healthcare workers in the “past few days” on the portal.The decision was taken after a meeting of the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 (NEGVAC) on Saturday.Also read: Covid-19 vaccination drive - Over 1.3 million doses given on SaturdayThe Covid-19 vaccination drive, which started on January 16, was to immunise 300 million healthcare workers, frontline workers, those over the age of 50 years with comorbidities in a phased manner. The first to receive the shots were 10 million healthcare workers. The drive opened up to 20 million frontline workers from February 1. People over the age of 60 years and those between the age group of 45 and 59 years with a combination of 20 specified comorbidities started receiving their shots from March 1. The drive was opened to all those over the age of 45 years from April 1.The vaccination drive for all healthcare workers was to end on February 25 and for the frontline workers on March 6. The registrations were closed as the drive was coming to an end. It was later re-opened once the vaccination for the elderly and those with comorbidities began in March to vaccinate those healthcare and frontline workers who couldn't get vaccinated previously.Although no new registrations for the two categories will happen on the government’s CoWIN portal, those who are already registered but haven’t taken the shot yet can still be immunised. “Universal vaccination of already registered healthcare workers and frontline workers should be ensured at the earliest,” Bhushan's letter read.As the number of Covid-19 cases continues to rise in the country, experts call for the opening up of the vaccination drive to everyone over the age of 18 years.“We should quickly vaccinate as many people over the age of 18 years. There is still a large proportion of the susceptible population that is leading to the second wave of the infection. So far, we have immunised around 7 crore people, which translates to about 5 to 6% of the population. With a 71% efficacy in preventing infections for the AstraZeneca vaccine, we have only about 4% of the population protected. And the majority is yet to receive the second dose of the vaccine,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of pulmonology, All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-don-t-register-more-healthcare-frontline-workers-for-coronavirus-vaccine-centre-tells-states-101617467864308.html
03-04-2021||India||Retired priests of Tirumala temple get back to service as TTD restores jobs||The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, which manages the country’s richest temple of Tirumala in Andhra Pradesh’s Chittoor district, on Saturday, issued orders restoring the services of several priests for the rest of their lives.The order restores the services of former head priest of the temple Dr AV Ramana Deekshitulu, who was forced to retire three years ago on attaining the age of superannuation at 65 years, a spokesperson of the TTD said. Deekshitulu confirmed to HT that he had received the orders and he would be taking over as the head priest of the temple again. “Along with me, at least 10 others of the Tirumala temple and other associated temples like Lord Padmavathi temple at Tiruchanur and Govindarajulu Swamy temple at Tirupati, have also got back their jobs,” he said. On May 16, 2018, the TTD, for the first time, introduced retirement rules for priests, according to which all those who attained the age of 65 years would have to retire. The rule was brought in at the TTD board meeting following serious allegations of corruption in the temple administration made by Deekshitulu the previous day. Deekshitulu then alleged that the administrators of the temple were siphoning off the temple money and destroying the sanctity of the temple and demanded an open audit into the donations being received by the temple and expenditure being incurred by the TTD. He also alleged that precious ancient jewellery of the temple was missing and demanded that the TTD be brought under the purview of the Right to Information Act. Along with Deekshitulu, three other priests – Narasimha Deekshitulu, Srinivasa Murthy Deekshitulu and Narayana Deekshitulu – were also forced to retire from their services. In their place, the TTD appointed four other priests. After the YSR Congress government came to power, chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy had done away with the rule of retirement for priests performing pujas in various Hindu temples across the state on attainment of age of superannuation, following a high court order of December 2018, which said the retirement rule would not be applicable to temple priests. The Jagan government issued an order in October 2019 stating that there would be no retirement for the priests of various temples on the basis of age. “A priest shall continue in the post till he is physically fit to perform his archakatvam (priesthood) duties,” the order said. However, the order was not made applicable to Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, as it is governed by its own rules. As a result, Deekshitulu could not get back his head priest post. Instead, the TTD appointed him as Agama advisor and also honourary chief priest. Now, with Saturday’s orders, Deekshitulu will be re-joining his duties as head priest of the Tirumala temple. Of the remaining three main priests of the temple, Srinivasa Murthy died of Covid-19 on July 20 last year. The remaining two priests would also be getting back their jobs in the temple.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/retired-priests-of-tirumala-temple-get-back-to-service-as-ttd-restores-jobs-101617468248889.html

03-04-2021||India||Health minister Vardhan approves National Policy for Rare Diseases, 2021||Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan approved the 'National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021' which aims to lower the high cost of treatment for rare diseases, with increased focus on indigenous research and local production of medicines, an official statement said on Saturday.A provision for financial support up to ₹20 lakh under the Umbrella Scheme of Rastriya Arogya Nidhi is proposed for the treatment of those rare diseases that require a one-time treatment (diseases listed under Group 1 in the rare disease policy)."Beneficiaries for such financial assistance will not be limited to BPL families, but the benefit will be extended to about 40 per cent of the population who are eligible under the Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana," the health ministry said in the statement.The financial support for the treatment of rare diseases is proposed under the Umbrella Scheme of Rastriya Arogya Nidhi (RAN) and not under the Ayushman Bharat PMJAY, it stated.Besides, the policy also envisages a crowd funding mechanism in which corporates and individuals will be encouraged to extend financial support through a robust IT platform for the treatment of rare diseases.Funds so collected will be utilised by Centres of Excellence (CoEs) for treatment of all three categories of rare diseases as first charge and then the balance financial resources could also be used for research, the statement said.“Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan approved the 'National Policy for Rare Diseases 2021' on March 30," the ministry said."The Rare Diseases Policy aims to lower the high cost of treatment for rare diseases with increased focus on indigenous research with the help of a national consortium to be set up with the Department of Health Research, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare as convenor," it said.The policy also talks about the creation of national hospital based registry of rare diseases so that adequate data is available for definition of such diseases and for research and development related to rare diseases within the country, it said.It also focuses on early screening and prevention through primary and secondary health care infrastructure such as Health and Wellness Centres and District Early Intervention Centres (DEICs) and through counselling for high-risk patients, the ministry said.Screening will also be supported by Nidan Kendras set up by the Department of Biotechnology.The policy aims to strengthen tertiary health care facilities for prevention and treatment of rare diseases through designating eight health facilities as ‘Centres of Excellence’ and these will also be provided one-time financial support of up to ₹5 crore for upgradation of diagnostics facilities, it said.The Draft policy for Rare Diseases was put in public domain on January 13, 2020 on which comments/views were invited from stakeholders, general public, organisations and states and Union territories. All the comments received were examined in depth by an expert committee constituted by the health ministry.The field of rare diseases is very complex and heterogeneous, and the prevention, treatment and management of rare diseases has multiple challenges.There are also fundamental challenges in the research and development for the majority of rare diseases as relatively little is known about the pathophysiology or the natural history of these diseases, particularly in the Indian context, the statement said.Rare diseases are also difficult to research upon as the patients pool is very small and it often results in inadequate clinical experience. Availability and accessibility to medicines are also important to reduce morbidity and mortality associated with rare disease. Despite progress in recent years, there is a need to augment effective and safe treatment for rare diseases.The cost of treatment of rare diseases is prohibitively expensive. Various high courts and the Supreme Court have also expressed concern about lack of a national policy for rare diseases, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/health-minister-vardhan-approves-national-policy-for-rare-diseases-2021-101617463649930.html

Tamil Nadu, since March 5, has been witnessing a rise in fresh coronavirus cases and on April 2, the state had recorded 3,290 new infections, pushing the tally to 8,92,780 and deaths to 12,750.Chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan took part in a review meeting chaired by union cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba along with senior officials on Friday.In an official release, Ranjan said the government was following all the steps as per the guidelines framed by the Centre towards controlling the spread of the virus.The impact of the virus was closely monitored on a daily basis and restrictions would be intensified as per the requirement, he said.Ranjan said the cabinet secretary during the review meeting issued necessary guidelines to 11 States which had reported a surge in new Covid-19 infections.Accordingly, it was decided in the meeting to bring down the Covid-19 positivity rate in states which had reported over 5 per cent.In Tamil Nadu, though the positivity rate has been below 5 per cent, it was decided to adopt 'increased and aggressive testing' in places which report higher Covid-19 infections.Steps are being taken to identify those people who were in contact with primary contacts and treat them in isolation if they had contracted the contagion, he said.Noting that residential complexes reporting more than three cases were declared as 'micro containment zones', he said till April 2 there were 846 such zones in the state.He said there was sufficient amount of beds, ventilators, medicines and personal protective equipment gear.To treat a Covid-19 patient without any delay, services of '108' ambulances was also utilised, he said,adding people should adhere to the COVID-19 protocol laid down by the government. Since March 16 the state has collected ₹2.58 crore as penalties from people violating the protocol.On vaccination, Ranjan said those eligible (above 45) should get vaccinated.Till April 2, as many as 31.75 lakh people, including healthcare and frontline workers besides those engaged in poll related works and above 45, were vaccinated.Tamil Nadu has received 54.74 lakh vaccine doses from the Centre as of today, he said.On deaths caused by the virus, Ranjan said measures were taken to ensure that Covid-19 fatalities remain less in Tamil Nadu.The government has issued a circular to both government and private run hospitals to follow the 'treatment procedures' as suggested by an expert committee, comprising medical experts from the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, towards reducing the deaths caused by Covid-19, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-to-intensify-covid-19-restrictions-based-on-requirement-to-contain-pandemic-chief-secretary-101617458323302.html
03-04-2021||India||₹26.50 lakh withdrawn from Sachin Vaze's joint account after arrest: NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) has found that an amount of ₹26.50 lakh was withdrawn from the joint bank account of Sachin Vaze and his aide on March 18, five days after the Mumbai police officer was arrested for his alleged role in planting an explosives-laden SUV outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's home on February 25, the court was told on Saturday.Without naming Vaze's accomplice, the National Investigation Agency said certain "incriminating material" was also taken out by someone from the joint locker of Waze and his aide, who is a suspect in the case, from a bank located in Versova area in Mumbai.The special court extended the custody of Vaze till April 7 after the investigating agency told the court that it had recovered "incriminating material" including laptops, DVRs (Digital Video Recorders), a CPU etc, in a damaged condition, during the probe and they need to be examined.The NIA is also probing the murder of Thane-based businessman Mansukh Hiran, the purported owner of the Scorpio SUV which was found parked near Ambani's south Mumbai residence 'Antilia'.The NIA told the court that Vaze was seen moving near the "scene of the crime" on March 4, a day before Hiran's body was found (in the creek in Mumbra in Thane district).The NIA told the court that a Mercedes car was seized on April 2.The agency had also recovered a diary from a club in south Mumbai mentioning that a huge amount had been paid to Vaze.The agency told the court it had found the passport of an unknown person at Vaze's house and needs his further custody to identify that person.Additional Solicitor General Anil Singh told the court Vaze held a joint bank account and a joint locker with his accomplice.The bank account had ₹26.50 lakh on the day of Vaze's arrest on March 13. However, the cash was found to be withdrawn on March 18, Singh told the court, adding that some "incriminating material" was also found to be taken out from the bank locker.Seeking Waze's custody for another six days, Singh said the NIA needs to trace the incriminating material that went missing from the bank locker and also wants to find out who was using the Mercedes car seized on April 2 and under whose instructions.Some incriminating material was also seized during the search conducted at the house of former policeman and co- accused Vinayak Shinde, Singh said, adding the NIA will confront Waze with the recovered evidence.The NIA also needs to examine the CCTV footage data it had seized during the investigation and needs to confront Vaze and other accused with it.Opposing the NIA's plea, Vaze's lawyer Abad Ponda said the NIA can seek remand of the accused under the provisions of the Unlawful Activities Prevention (UAPA) Act after the lapse of 15 days.However, the NIA has not mentioned a single ground seeking the extension of Waze's custody under the UAPA in its remand application, he said.Ponda rejected the NIA's contention that Vaze held a joint account in the bank in Versova.He demanded that the NIA show the bank account opening form with the name and signature of the accused,which the agency rejected.Referring to the recovery of electronic devices from the Mithi river in Mumbai by the NIA, Ponda said as it is a huge river, anyone can dump anything into it.He said the NIA had planted these devices into the river, which it later showed as being recovered during the investigation.He said Vaze had nothing to do with these materials recovered by the NIA."The recovery is based on their skill and volition and completely foisted upon me (Waze)," Ponda added. Meanwhile, Vaze told the court that he was suffering from some cardiac issues and had suffered a stroke on Sunday.Vaze had demanded his examination by a cardiologist.Vaze's lawyer submitted in court that the police officer has a blockage in his heart that can be treated only by angiography and angioplasty.However, the NIA said they had run diagnostics and found that Vaze's heart was functioning normally."We did ECG and blood test, 2D Echo..His heart is working normally. Doctors had advised him a bypass (surgery) in 2019, but he didn't do it then," the NIA said, adding Waze was being provided the required treatment and that his health was being monitored.The court then directed the NIA to submit a detailed report on the next day on whether Vaze needs a specific treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rs-26-50-lakh-withdrawn-from-sachin-vaze-s-joint-account-after-arrest-nia-101617457373230.html

The party, in a strongly worded tweet in Hindi, called the poll body a “participant in the attack on the country’s democracy and constitution.”“The role of Election Commission of India is to be impartial. But it appears questionable and on the side of the authority. To reduce the duration of the ban imposed on the BJP leader [Himanta Biswa Sarma] is condemnable. The ECI is also a participant in the attack on the country’s democracy and constitution,” Congress tweeted, with a picture of the ECI’s order.भारतीय चुनाव आयोग की भूमिका निष्पक्ष होनी चाहिए। लेकिन चुनाव आयोग की भूमिका संदिग्ध है, सत्ता के पक्ष में है। भाजपा नेता पर लगाए गए बैन की अवधि कम करना निंदनीय है।देश के लोकतंत्र और संविधान पर हमले में भारतीय चुनाव आयोग भी भागीदार है। pic.twitter.com/7PacMRW9WaAlso read | EC accepts Himanta Biswa Sarma’s plea, reduces ban on his campaign ralliesSupporting his party’s stance, Congress general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala also made similar comments regarding the issue.“A dark day for Parliamentary democracy. #ECI doesn’t even have the guts to sustain its own order. Deplorable that EC buckles under Modi Govt’s pressure & reverses its own order of ban on Sh. Himanta Biswa Sarma. History will neither pardon #ECI nor #BJP for this sin,” Surjewala tweeted.2/2Will #ECI tell -1 Was this somersault taken suo moto or on a fresh plea by BJP/Himanta Sarma?2 If yes, why did EC then not call upon the complainant, BPF & Congress?3 If no, why this vexatious change of heart?4 Does it now give a license to issue threat with impunity? https://t.co/F9JaDaLA88He also posed four questions to the election commission asking about the intention to reduce the ban. “Will #ECI tell - 1. Was this somersault taken suo moto or on a fresh plea by BJP/Himanta Sarma? 2. If yes, why did EC then not call upon the complainant, BPF & Congress? 3. If no, why this vexatious change of heart? 4. Does it now give a license to issue threat with impunity?” he asked.Earlier on Friday, ECI banned Sarma from campaigning in Assam for a 48-hour duration following a complaint by the Congress on March 30 saying that he threatened Hagrama Mohilary, chief of the Bodoland People’s Front (BPF), with imprisonment. The duration of the ban was curtailed to 24 hours on Saturday.With the campaigning for the third and final phase of the Assam assembly elections set to end on April 4, Sarma has only the last day left for his campaign with the ECI’s new decision. As much as 40 assembly constituencies in Assam would go to polls during the final phase scheduled for April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ecis-role-questionable-congress-on-poll-body-s-decision-to-reduce-campaign-ban-on-himanta-biswa-sarma-101617456842301.html

Pranab Kumar Gogoi, who hails from Assam, was recovered by police in Changlang district in Arunachal Pradesh. However, there is no trace yet of Ram Kumar, another employee of the company who hails from Bihar and was abducted along with Gogoi. “We found Gogoi from Longbi village along the Indo-Myanmar border on the Indian side. He is healthy and seems to be fit. We are questioning him. There is no trace of Ram Kumar,” Mihin Gambo, superintendent of police, Changlang, said. Gogoi, a drilling superintendent, and Ram Kumar, a radio operator, employed by Quippo Oil and Gas Infrastructure Limited, a Delhi-based company, were abducted on December 21 from a drilling location in Changlang district. “It’s like a new life for me. Every day in custody was spent on worrying whether I would see the next sunrise. We were shifted every 2-3 days and kept at different locations,” Gogoi told journalists after his release. “Both Kumar and I were kept together till March 4. But we were separated after that and I have no clue about his whereabouts. I hope he is also released soon,” he added. On January 12, Paresh Baruah, commander-in-chief of ULFA-I had admitted to abducting the two employees and told TV channels in Assam that Kumar, who hails from Bihar, would become a ‘victim’ if the oil drilling company didn’t pay the outfit it’s ‘due share’ for extracting natural resources from Assam and rest of the northeast region. Baruah had said that Gogoi who’s an Assamese won’t be harmed. Later, ULFA-I had set a deadline till February 16 to complete talks and secure the release of the two abducted employees. It had also warned that chief ministers of Assam and Arunachal Pradesh would be responsible if the two employees die in an “undesired incident”. In February this year, ULFA-I threatened to take ‘final action’ on Gogoi and Kumar in a phased manner since the deadline for talks as well as discussions with the company had passed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/103-days-after-abduction-ulfa-i-releases-assam-man-no-trace-of-another-from-bihar-101617452407856.html

It's their (BJP's) youth wing. They were saying, "Rakesh Tikait, Go Back". Where should I go? They hurled stones, used lathis," said Tikait."Why are they fighting us, we're farmers, we are not a political party," he added.When asked about the possibility of a dialogue between farmers and the Centre, the BKU leader said, "If the government was run by a party, then dialogue would have concluded by now. This government is run by companies (Corporates). They only look at their business and profit. They don't care about anyone. They will profit more if there are more hungry people in the country."The convoy of Tikait was allegedly attacked at Tatarpur Chowk in Alwar on Friday. According to police, four persons have been detained in connection with the incident.After the incident, Tikait said that goons of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) tried to attack him. He tweeted in Hindi, "Tatarpur intersection of Alwar district of Rajasthan near Bansur road --- attacked by BJP goons --killing our democracy."Following the attack, the BKU chief's supporters blocked National Highway 9 at the Ghazipur border.

He had also hinted that a lockdown was inevitable if new cases continue to go up."....This is irresponsible behaviour. Fadnavis should have given information on the aid provided by the Central government to Maharashtra. For the last year, the state has been battling pandemic and natural disasters like cyclones, floods and heavy rains on its own. The MVA government is working hard to mitigate the hardships of the people."However, the Centre had acted out of bias against the state by not parting the rightful share of funds to the state. Instead of contributing to the Chief Minister's relief fund, BJP leaders had donated to the PM Cares Fund for Covid-19. What has the state got from the ₹20 lakh crore ('aatmanirbhar') package," Patole asked.He alleged the Centre used federal investigating agencies to malign the image of Maharashtra."The unplanned lockdown last year had pushed the country on the brink of the economic crisis," the Congress leader said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-withheld-funds-meant-for-maharashtra-out-of-bias-congress-101617447193006.html

03-04-2021||India||ISRO espionage case: SC-appointed probe panel submits report on Nambi Narayanan's illegal arrest||A high-level probe panel appointed by the Supreme Court to take erring cops to task for causing "tremendous harassment" and "immeasurable anguish" to ISRO scientist Dr Nambi Narayanan in the 1994 espionage case has submitted its report to the apex court, sources said.The SC had on September 14, 2018 appointed the three-member panel headed by its former judge D K Jain while directing the Kerala government to cough up ₹50 lakh compensation for compelling Narayanan to undergo "immense humiliation".The scientist was arrested when the Congress was heading the government in Kerala. The panel, after investigation, submitted its report in a sealed cover to the apex court recently.The CBI, in its probe, had held that the then top police officials in Kerala were responsible for Narayanan's illegal arrest.The case also had its political fallout, with a section in the Congress targeting the then Chief Minister late K Karunakaran over the issue, that eventually led to his resignation.Over a period of almost two-and-a-half years, the panel headed by Justice Jain examined the circumstances leading to the arrest.The espionage case, which had hit the headlines in 1994, pertained to allegations of transfer of certain confidential documents on India's space programme to foreign countries by two scientists and four others, including two Maldivian women.The 79-year-old former scientist, who was given a clean chit by the CBI, maintained that the Kerala Police had "fabricated" the case and the technology he was accused to have stolen and sold in the 1994 case did not even exist at that time.Narayanan had approached the apex court against a Kerala High Court judgement that said "no action needed to be taken" against former DGP Siby Mathews, who was then heading the SIT probe team, two retired superintendents of police, K K Joshua and S Vijayan, and the then Deputy Director, Intelligence Bureau, R B Shreekumar, who were later held responsible by the CBI for the scientist's illegal arrest.The apex court in its judgement had said, "We think that the obtaining factual scenario calls for constitution of a committee to find out ways and means to take appropriate steps against the erring officials.""The criminal law was set in motion without any basis. It was initiated, if one is allowed to say, on some kind of fancy or notion," a bench headed by the then Chief Justice Dipak Misra had said."We are of the view that the appellant was arrested and he has suffered custody for almost 50 days. His arrest has been seriously criticised in the closure report of the CBI. From the aforesaid report, the harassment and mental torture faced by the appellant is obvious," the bench had added.The judgement had said the "entire prosecution" initiated by the state police was "malicious and it has caused tremendous harassment and immeasurable anguish" to Narayanan. "It can be stated with certitude" that the fundamental right of life and personal liberty of Narayanan was "gravely affected".The CBI, while giving a clean chit to the scientist, had said that Siby Mathews had left "the entire investigation to IB surrendering his duties" and ordered indiscriminate arrest of the scientist and others without adequate evidence.The case had caught attention in October 1994, when Maldivian national Rasheeda was arrested in Thiruvananthapuram for allegedly obtaining secret drawings of ISRO rocket engines to sell to Pakistan.Narayanan, the then director of the cryogenic project at ISRO, was arrested along with the then ISRO Deputy Director D Sasikumaran, and Fousiya Hasan, a Maldivian friend of Rasheeda.The apex court had termed the police action against the ex-scientist of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) a "psycho-pathological treatment".It had said that his "liberty and dignity", basic to his human rights, were jeopardised as he was taken into custody and, eventually, despite all the glory of the past, was compelled to face "cynical abhorrence".Awarding a compensation ₹50 lakh, which was to be paid by the state government, the top court had said it was being given to compensate for his suffering, anxiety and the treatment meted out to him.The apex court had said the "reputation of an individual is an insegregable facet of his right to life with dignity" and had rejected the plea of the Kerala government that due to the lapse of time, no inquiry or subsequent actions were needed to be taken against the erring officials.It had accepted Narayanan's plea that the authorities, who were responsible for causing such a "harrowing effect" on his mind, should face "legal consequences".The findings of the report are not yet known.

03-04-2021||India||Covid-19 second wave may peak in India by mid-April, say scientists||Using a mathematical model, scientists have predicted that the ongoing second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) across India could peak by mid-April, after which it may see a decline by May end.A mathematical approach, named SUTRA, predicted last year that the initial spike of the coronavirus infection in August would rise by September and decrease in February this year.Manindra Agrawal, a scientist from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Kanpur, applied the model to predict the trajectory of the current spike in coronavirus disease and found that the number of daily new infections is likely to peak in mid-April."For the last several days, we have found that there is a reasonable chance that the cases in India could peak sometime between 15-20 April. It is a sharp slope, but on the way down, it would likely be equally sharp, coming down very fast and by end of May may see a dramatic reduction," Agrawal told news agency PTI.He further said that there is some uncertainty in predicting the peak value of daily new infections because of the sharp rise. "Currently, it is coming to 1 lakh infections per day, but this can go up or down. But the timing remains the same between April 15-20," he added.Scientists have predicted that in the second wave of Covid-19, the first state to be affected could be Punjab in a few days, followed by Maharashtra.However, Agrawal added that the model's prediction of the new peak is sensitive to the daily new infections data. "Even a little bit of change each day causes the peak numbers to change by several thousand numbers. But the location of the peak has remained on mid-April," he said.Independent calculations made by scientists, including Gautam Menon from Ashoka University in Haryana, have also predicted that the surge of the second wave of Covid-19 infections could be between mid-April and mid-May."Any excessively precise prediction, of a peak within just a 5-day window, would ignore the many uncertainties associated with the inputs to any such calculation," Menon told PTI.Agrawal stated that the SUTRA model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the coronavirus pandemic. "The first is called Beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-naught value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads the virus to over the course of their infection," he added.He said the other two parameters are 'Reach', which is a measure of exposure level of the population to Covid-19 pandemic, and 'Epsilon' which is the ratio of detected and undetected coronavirus cases.Agrawal said, "The reason we had to introduce 'Reach' is that unlike earlier pandemics which start at a location and suddenly spread fast across a place, in Covid-19, the spread of the pandemic has been slower due to the many protective measures in place."He further said that 'Epsilon' helps factor in the number of asymptomatic infections across the nation. "Since the detected cases are quarantined, we assume they no longer contribute to new infections. So a growing number of daily new cases, reflect larger undetected infections. By measuring the number of new cases each day, we try to estimate the undetected and asymptomatic infections," he added.Agrawal said the SUTRA model relies on inputs from daily reported new infections, based on which the value of the three main parameters are deduced."We learn everything from the daily-infections data. The beta value across India has gone up by 50 per cent in March, which indicates that a combination of factors -- people becoming more relaxed, and more infectious variants going around. But precisely what reason this could be is something biologists have to say," he added.Agrawal said the model did not previously predict a second Covid-19 wave in India as it could have been due to a change in the parameters sometime between February and March this year. "So clearly during this time, some parameters had changed. So we had to wait for some time to collect new data and see how the parameters had changed, which we now know," he added.On Saturday, India recorded 89,129 new Covid-19 cases and 714 related deaths in the last 24 hours, according to the health ministry’s dashboard. With the new infections and fatalities, the country’s tally mounted to 12,392,260 and its death toll to 164,110, respectively.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/scientists-predict-2nd-wave-of-covid-19-in-india-by-midapril-101617441924456.html

03-04-2021||India||Farmers protest wheat procurement process in Karnal as fresh standoff builds||Hundreds of farmers gathering at Haryana’s Karnal grain market since Friday are demanding unscheduled and immediate procurement of wheat in a fresh standoff with the government, following a protest call by the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Charuni), one of the bodies behind the five-month long farmers’ protest against the three central farm laws.In the fresh flashpoint, farmers alleged that most of them were not sent SMSs inviting them for procurement of wheat harvest, resulting in a costly delay. The BKU further accused the government of deliberately delaying procurement and demanded that all the wheat being brought to the Mandi was immediately procured irrespective of the SMS criteria.Last year, the government agencies had roped-in commission agents to schedule farmers’ visit to Mandi for procurement. However, this year, it was decided that farmers will be allowed to approach Mandi for procurement as per the schedule messaged to them.“The government wants to delay the procurement and that is why they did not send SMSs to the farmers registered on the Meri Fasal Mera Bayora (My crop, my detail) portal,” said Jadgip Singh Aulakh, a local BKU leader.He said that the government agencies were turning away farmers, who had lined-up with their produce, saying they did not have the SMS confirming an appointment for procurement at the Mandi.“Our crop was ready for harvest but we did not get any SMS to bring it to the Mandi yet. I brought wheat produce from three acre of land to the Karnal grain market but was not allowed to enter for hours,” alleged Bhupinder Singh, a farmer from Bijna village in the district. He added that he had registered for procurement of 450 quintals of wheat but did not get any SMS.The protesting farmers unloaded wheat outside the office of the Mandi secretary and said that they will stage a sit-in till procurement of their produce begins. “We cannot delay the harvesting of crops as farmers use the same set of harvesters and the government should procure all the wheat coming to the Mandis,” demanded Bhajan Singh, a farmer.The farmer union leaders are demanding that all the wheat arriving at the Mandi is procured at the minimum support price MSP of ₹1,975 per quintal.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Yadav called a meeting of procurement agencies and Mandi officials to break the deadlock. District officials said SMSs were being sent to farmers as harvesting was yet to pick pace and the moisture content in wheat was also high at the moment.Officials from Haryana food and civil supplies department said on condition of anonymity that the government may relax the criteria to allow 50% farmers to visit Mandi as per the schedule sent by SMS, while 30% will be called by the commissioner agents and the remaining 20% farmers would be allowed to walk in to Mandis with their produce. All the farmers must be registered on the Meri Fasal Mera Bayora portal and should procure an online gate pass on arrival at Mandi, they said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/farmers-protest-wheat-procurement-process-in-karnal-as-fresh-standoff-builds-101617442627970.html

Our family remains grateful to everyone for their messages of support & their prayers,” Omar Abdullah said in a tweet.Abdullah was admitted at Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences at Soura in the morning as a “precautionary measure”, said hospital officials aware of the development.“He is absolutely fine but his hospitalisation was done as a precautionary measure,” the hospital official said on condition of anonymity.A leader of the National Conference said Abdullah has mild symptoms of the disease. “The only issue is that he has become weak owing to Covid-19,” he said.The NC patriarch and the senior-most politician among the mainstream leaders in Jammu and Kashmir, Abdullah turned 84 last year in October. In 2014, he underwent a successful kidney transplant after his wife Molly donated a kidney.People close to the NC leader said Abdullah was ‘immunocompromised’ because of the kidney transplant.Earlier on Tuesday, Omar said his father tested positive for Covid-19 and was showing some symptoms of the disease.“I will be self-isolating along with other family members until we get ourselves tested. I request anyone who has come in contact with us over the last few days to take all the mandated precautions,” Omar Abdullah then said.Besides various terms as Lok Sabha member, Farooq Abdullah has thrice been the chief minister of Jammu and Kashmir in 1982, 1986 and 1996.

03-04-2021||India||Bring NDA back to power, Modi tells voters at his last poll rally in Assam||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday urged voters in Assam to bring back the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) alliance to power in the state for continued momentum of growth. At his last rally ahead of the third and last phase of polling in Assam on Tuesday, Modi listed developmental projects undertaken by the Centre and the BJP-led state government. He referred to the construction of bridges over the Brahmaputra and an improved road network. “To continue this momentum of growth and development, it is very important to bring back NDA government to power. We believe in sabka saath, sabka vikas, sabka vishwas (with all, development for all, with the trust of all). We do not discriminate in our schemes and everyone is equally benefitted,” he said at the rally in Tamulpur. Earlier this week, the Bodoland Peoples’ Front (BPF) candidate from Tamulpur, Rangja Kungur Basumatary, withdrew from the contest and joined the BJP. Basumatary’s move is expected to help Leho Ram Boro, who is BJP ally United People’s Party Liberal’s candidate from Tamulpur.BPF was part of the BJP-led government in Assam before it switched over to the Congress-led alliance of seven parties. The party won 12 seats in 2016 and is contesting the same number of seats this time. Modi accused the Congress-led alliance of conspiring to take over Assam. “The election is still on. But yesterday some people made an announcement saying what kind of dress those in the next government would wear. There can be no greater dishonour for Assam and its culture. It is shocking that they are conspiring to take over Assam. You have to come out in large numbers and vote to foil their designs,” Modi said. Modi was referring to a statement made by lawmaker Abdur Rahim Ajmal, who is the son of All India United Democratic Front (AIUDF) chief Badruddin Ajmal.Abdur Rahim Ajmal said there will be a dari-tupi-lungi (beard-skullcap-loincloth) government in Assam this time. AIUDF is part of the Congress-led alliance. The BJP has continuously targeted Congress and AIUDF by calling their alliance unholy. Many BJP leaders including Modi and Union home minister Amit Shah have said that Ajmal would encourage infiltration from Bangladesh if he comes to power and would destroy Assam’s culture. “This is my last election meeting in Assam. This is an occasion not just to ask for votes for the third phase but also to thank you for the blessings you have showered to us in the first two phases. From my meetings, I can say that you have decided to bring NDA back to power again,” Modi said. Polling is being held for 40 seats in the last phase of polling. The results will be declared on May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bring-nda-back-to-power-modi-tells-voters-at-his-last-poll-rally-in-assam-101617436267306.html

03-04-2021||India||Himanta Biswa Sarma likely to seek EC's review of ban on him campaigning||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader and Assam minister Himanta Biswa Sarma was likely to seek the Election Commission (EC)’s review of its Friday order barring him from campaigning in the ongoing assembly polls.“We are not going to HC [high court] with regards to the EC order. But there are plans to approach the EC to appeal to review its Friday order,” said a person aware of Sarma’s plans.Reports earlier said Sarma was likely to move the Gauhati High Court against the order.On Friday, EC barred Sarma from campaigning for 48 hours after the Congress filed a complaint against him alleging he threatened to put Bodoland Peoples’ Party (BPF) chief Hagrama Mohilary behind bars.Since campaigning for the third and final phase of polls ends on Sunday, the order effectively puts an end to Sarma’s campaign.A total of 40 seats including Jalukbari, from where Sarma is contesting, will go to the polls in the third phase on April 6.“The commission strongly condemns the impugned statements made by Sh. Himanta Biswa Sarma, BJP leader and star campaigner,” said the order issued by EC secretary Ajay Kumar Verma.“The commission under Article 324 of Constitution of India and all other powers enabling in this behalf, bars him from holding any public meetings, public processions, public rallies, road shows, interviews and public utterances in media (electronic, print, social media) etc. in connection with ongoing elections for 48 hours from immediate effect on 02.04.2021 (Friday).”Also Read: The other battle in Assam—Sarbananda Sonowal versus Himanta Biswa SarmaHolding him prima facie guilty of violating the model code of conduct, EC Thursday sent a notice to Sarma directing him to “explain his position” by 5 pm on Friday.Though Sarma denied the allegations against him in his reply, the EC found it to be unsatisfactory.“I am asked by ECI to stop campaigning for the next 48 hours. Therefore, all my meetings scheduled for tomorrow stand cancelled,” Sarma tweeted.One of BJP’s leading campaigners, Sarma was attending 6-7 meetings daily besides conducting roadshows. Between February 25 and March 30, he attended 71 poll meetings, held roadshows, bike and cycle rallies, and visited 73 of the total 126 assembly constituencies in the state.On Friday, he took part in five public rallies and one roadshow.“Assam’s forever-in-waiting CM can’t issue some threats to unleash state agencies and bully the BPF,” Assam Congress president Ripun Bora tweeted after the EC order on Friday.On March 30, Congress filed the complaint with EC alleging that Sarma had “openly threatened” to send Mohilary to jail by misusing National Investigation Agency.Mohilary’s BPF is part of the Congress alliance of seven parties which also includes the All-India United Democratic Front.Congress alleged that Sarma with his threats also attempted to influence voters not to vote for the Congress-led alliance including BPF.Following the complaint, the EC obtained the full transcript of Sarma’s statement. He was found to have prima facie violated the model code of conduct.A former chief of the rebel group Bodo Liberation Tigers, Mohilary joined a peace process in 2003.BPF was also part of the BJP-led government in Assam. It later joined the Congress-led alliance and is contesting 12 seats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sarma-moves-court-against-ec-ban-on-campaigning-101617432187439.html
03-04-2021||India||Massive surge in Covid-19 cases in India this week. 10 points||With India reporting as many as 89,129 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) on Saturday, the country's infection tally currently stands at 1,23,92,260. 714 new fatalities have pushed the death toll from the virus to 1,64,110. According to health ministry data, the country's tally of cases stood at 1,20,39,644 at the beginning of the week, on Monday, while the death toll was at 1,61,843. Thus, over the span of five days, India registered 3,52,616 Covid-19 cases and 2,267 deaths. Presently, the active caseload stands at 6,58,909, a sharp increase of 1,37,101 cases from Monday's active case count of 5,21,808.Meanwhile, the worldwide tally has crossed the 130 million mark, with the United States (US), Brazil, and India occupying the top three spots in the country-wise distribution of global cases.Here are the significant Covid-19-related developments this week in India in 10 points:1. Delhi has been recording a massive surge in cases in the span of the last few weeks. On Friday, the national capital recorded as many as 3,594 fresh cases of Covid-19, the highest daily count this year. The last time the count reached nearly as high was on December 4 last year, when Delhi recorded 4,067 cases, according to official data.2. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that the national capital is encountering the fourth wave of Covid-19. However, the imposition of a lockdown is not being considered yet, he said, adding that the fourth wave is less serious than the previous ones as there are fewer deaths and hospitalisations this time. If there is a need for a lockdown in the future, the decision will be taken after due public consultation, he said.3. Maharashtra, the worst-hit state by the pandemic, is mulling over the possibility of another lockdown. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray said on Friday that the possibility of a lockdown cannot be ruled out if the current coronavirus situation prevails. He also cautioned that the state may fall short of healthcare infrastructure in the next 15 to 20 days. On Friday, Maharashtra recorded 47,827 new Covid-19 cases, the highest daily rise since the coronavirus pandemic began last year.4. Karnataka has issued a fresh set of Covid-19 related guidelines to curb the virus spreading in the state. According to an official notification, cinema halls, pubs, bars, clubs, and restaurants have been directed to allow no more than 50% of the maximum capacity. While gyms and swimming pools remain closed, shopping malls and departmental stores must ensure compliance with Covid-19 appropriate behaviour from customers. Moreover, classes from 6-9 have been suspended and all gatherings at places of worship remain prohibited.5. Amid an increased tourist footfall, the Jammu and Kashmir government is resorting to a 'fast-track vaccination' process in four districts of Jammu, Srinagar, Budgam, and Baramulla. The administration is aiming to inoculate all persons in the eligible age group in these four districts, which account for the maximum number of Covid-19 cases in the union territory.6. The central government has categorised 11 states and Union territories as those being "of grave concern" with regard to the Covid-19 situation. In a high-level meeting on Friday chaired by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, the authorities directed Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Gujarat, Tamil Nadu, Madhya Pradesh, Chandigarh, Haryana, and Delhi to make a "time-bound plan" to ensure 100% vaccination of every single eligible beneficiary.7. With 1,733 Covid-19 new cases, West Bengal, too, logged its highest single-day spike of 2021 on Friday, a health department bulletin said. Kolkata alone accounts for 513 of these fresh cases, followed by North 24 Parganas at 331.8. With regards to vaccination, a total of 36.7 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines were administered across India on Friday, the highest single-day coverage till now. As per the union health ministry's provisional report till 8pm on Friday, more than seven crores (7,06,18,026, to be exact) vaccine doses have been administered in the country. Maharashtra is at the heart of India's vaccination drive, with the state accounting for 9.48% of the total vaccine doses administered.9. India is the leading vaccine exporter in the world, with over 640 lakh doses supplied to more than 80 countries till now, the Union Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) has informed. The ministry's spokesperson Arindam Bagchi asserted on Friday that India's 'Vaccine Maitree' initiative to supply vaccines abroad has been "very successful". Of the total 644 lakh doses supplied abroad till now, 104 lakh have been delivered as a "grant", 357 lakh on a commercial basis, and 182 lakh through the 'COVAX' initiative, Bagchi said.10. Experts have recommended that the private sector step up and collaborate with the government to speed up the country's vaccination drive. VK Paul, NITI Aayog member, told reporters earlier this week that the private vaccine providers need to participate in India's inoculation campaign. "We were told there are 20,000 private vaccination centres in the country. But less than 6,000 vaccination centres are being run by the private sector in India. We request the private sector to make the remaining vaccination centres functional and increase their number," he was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/massive-surge-in-covid-19-cases-in-india-this-week-10-points-101617418846899.html

To this, the Congress leader said: "I do not hear anything from the US establishment about what's happening in India. If you are saying partnership of democracies, I mean what is your view on what is going on here."The Lok Sabha MP from Wayanad also claimed that the reason parties like the Bahujan Samaj Party, the Samajwadi Party, and the Nationalist Congress Party are also not winning elections in India was the "wholesale capture of the country's institutional framework" and "an absolute financial and media dominance by the BJP"."In Assam, the gentleman who runs our campaign has been sending videos of BJP candidates running around voting machines in their cars. But there is nothing going on in national media," Gandhi said during the virtual conversation with Burns.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-gandhi-wants-to-know-us-govt-s-view-on-what-s-going-on-in-india-101617425414775.html

03-04-2021||India||89,030 new cases in India, highest since Sept 19||A total of 89,030 new cases of the coronavirus disease were reported across India on Friday, the highest single-day increase in infections in the country since September 19, 2020, as the second wave of the viral outbreak continued to spread its footprint across the country at an alarming rate.The seven-day average of daily cases across the country, a figure which denotes a region’s case trajectory, soared to 68,969 on Friday, the highest since October 13 last year.Friday’s new cases takes the total number of confirmed infections in the country to 12,391,140.The second wave of the outbreak is dangerously expanding its footprint throughout the country at a time when the vaccination drive has finally started gathering momentum – on Thursday, India had opened its Covid-19 vaccination programme to everyone over the age of 45 years.Experts have repeatedly stressed that a widespread inoculation drive is the best, and perhaps, the only chance the country has to turn the tide against the building second wave of infections.A total of 70,618,026 doses have been administered across the country as of Friday night, according to data released by the Union health ministry.Friday’s national case tally is particularly noteworthy because the last time India reported more cases in a single day was on September 19, 2020, which was just three days after the country’s first wave peaked (on September 16).India’s highest single-day caseload was 99,181 on September 10, according to the HT dashboard.Just one state, Maharashtra, alone accounted for 54% of all infections reported on Friday. The western state, which is the country’s worst-hit region with 2.9 million confirmed cases, recorded 47,827 new Covid-19 cases, the highest daily count since the start of the pandemic in March last year. This is the second day in a row that the state has set a new record for daily infections.On the second spot, Karnataka reported 4,991 new infections, while Chhattisgarh saw 4,174 new cases on Friday.As many as 713 new Covid deaths were reported across the country on Friday, however, this number was inflated due to Maharashtra adding 279 old fatalities to its tally that had earlier been unreported.A total of 164,162 people have lost their lives to the viral outbreak in the country so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/89030-new-cases-in-india-highest-since-sept-19-101617403212841.html
03-04-2021||India||Exclude Maharashtra, and India’s second Covid wave is still frightening||In the past week, more than 56% of all new infections of the coronavirus disease reported across India and 45% of Covid-19 deaths can be traced to just one state, Maharashtra. The outbreak in the western state, which is by a far margin the worst-hit in the country, has (rightfully) dominated headlines over the past monthand-a-half. But is the outbreak in Maharashtra magnifying the severity of India’s second wave? Do India’s current Covid numbers look better if we remove Maharashtra’s numbers from the national tally? The answer to both is: not really. Indeed, the magnitude of the outbreak in Maharashtra may have actually masked the march of the viral disease in other states.Removing Maharashtra from the national tally results in two key, but grim, findings. First, the severity of India’s second Covid wave does not reduce at all; it is only delayed. Second, it shows that nine other states, spread across the country geographically, are rapidly becoming Covid-19 hot spots.CLick here for complete Covid-19 coverage1. India’s second wave gets a 12-day delay...On the basis of the seven-day average of daily infections, which denotes a region’s case trajectory, India’s first Covid wave bottomed out on February 11 at 10,988. This is the point from where the second wave started.If Maharashtra’s numbers are removed from the national numbers — it is important to caveat that this is an academic exercise since some of the infections elsewhere in India might have originated in Maharashtra and vice versa — the bottoming out of the Covid wave still takes place, but is delayed by 12 days. Instead of the trend reversing on February 11, the Indian trajectory (without Maharashtra) bottoms out on February 23 (at an average of 7,395 new cases a day). But the reversal is just as evident even without taking Maharashtra into account.To be sure, there is a gap of over 3,000 cases a day in the two troughs, but that is to be expected given the state excluded is the country’s second most populous (after Uttar Pradesh) and has been a massive hot spot throughout India’s battle with Covid.2. ... but the severity of the wave remains intactIf the 12-day gap is taken into account and the two outbreaks (with, and without Maharashtra) aligned from the day each of them bottomed out, it is clear that even without counting numbers from Maharashtra, cases across the country are rising just as fast. Without Maharashtra, the country’s case trajectory has grown 288% in the 37 days since bottoming out – the seven-day average of daily cases went from 7,395 on February 23 to 28,670 on April 1.Also Read | Lockdown in Maharashtra can't be ruled out as Covid-19 cases rise, says Uddhav; stricter curbs to be announced soonOverall, India’s trajectory has grown 493% since bottoming out – the seven-day average went from 10,988 on February 11 to 65,146 for the week ending April 1 – but this has been over a period of 49 days since bottoming out.To put these two sets of numbers in context, it is important to look at the overall numbers (India including Maharashtra) 37 days since its bottoming out. The seven-day average of daily cases at that point in time was 34,271, or 212% more than its trough value.This means that even without Maharashtra, the country’s case rate (while delayed by 12 days) is rising at a faster rate today than it was with Maharashtra taken into account.3. Maharashtra’s huge numbers mask nine hot spotsAs stated above, a majority of cases reported across the country (56%) over the past week have been in Maharasthra. This is such a large proportion that it ends up masking numbers from other states. For instance, Karnataka is the state on the second spot on this list, but it has contributed only 5% of all cases in the country in the past week. In the third spot is Chhattisgarh, with 4.8% of all new cases in the country in the past week, followed by Punjab with 4.4% of India’s cases.But when the same numbers are looked at after excluding Maharashtra, it is clear that there are nine regions that have each contributed heavily to the tally. These nine regions – Karnataka, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh – are responsible for nearly 75% of all new infections in the country in the past week (excluding Maharashtra).There are two worrying things about the nine. One, they are spread geographically across the country. This counters the current idea that the regions currently reporting rising cases are primarily located in western part of the country (like Maharashtra, Gujarat, etc). Two, with the exception of Kerala, the 7-day average of daily cases is rising in all nine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/exclude-maharashtra-and-india-s-second-covid-wave-is-still-frightening-101617402320617.html
03-04-2021||India||Covid-19: For second consecutive day, Delhi inoculates over 52,000 people||The city administered more than 50,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines for the second straight day on Friday, as people aged 45 and above drove up the Capital’s inoculation numbers a day after jabs were opened up for them.Delhi saw 71,284 shots administered on Thursday, the most in a single day so far.Of the 52,408 shots given on Friday, 30,764 were first doses administered to those between the ages of 45 and 59. The vaccination drive was opened up in March to those above the age of 60, and those between 45 and 59 with comorbidities.In Delhi, 1.14 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine so far, which accounts for about 5.7% of the city’s nearly 20 million population. As on Friday, 273,000 people have received both doses of the vaccine, showed government data.Experts said the pace of vaccinations was too slow to prevent a surge in cases.“When we say that 5% have been immunised, they haven’t completed their entire vaccination schedule. The best possible protection is achieved only about two weeks after both doses are administered,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences.Health experts also urged residents to follow masking and social distancing norms, even after getting inoculated.“People must continue to wear masks when they step outside, even if they have been vaccinated, because there is still a risk of getting the infection and spreading it. There is a need to increase the number of vaccines being administered. But any impact — fewer hospitalisations or deaths — of this will be visible only after eight to 12 weeks,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-for-second-consecutive-day-delhi-inoculates-over-52-000-people-101617395944898.html

The number of active Covid-19 patients has now gone up to 2586. Nuapara district reported 86 new infections today.In a letter to all district collectors, municipal commissioners and CDMOs and public health officers, additional chief secretary (health) Pradipta Mohapatra urged them to step up vaccination of patients with co-morbidities on a war footing.“The required numbers of beds with oxygen facilities in district headquarter hospitals and medical college hospitals should be kept in readiness for immediate use of Covid-19 patients. Other categories of isolation beds in ICU, HDU, dialysis, labour room should also be kept in readiness for immediate use of patients. Private hospitals of the districts should also be kept in readiness for immediate use at short notice. Adequate stock of medicines like Flavipiravir, Remdisivir etc should be maintained at district level to meet the demand at the local level. District teams should be re-oriented on the SOP for treatment of patients under home isolation, and the same should be followed without fail,” Mohapatra wrote in his letter.Mohapatra also pointed out that the RRTs teams should undertake periodic visits to patients under home isolation as per SOP.The district administration of Jharsuguda banned weekly markets in the district for the next 3 weeks to check the spread of Covid-19 as minister of state (Home) Dibya Shankar Mishra told the Odisha Assembly on Friday that the rise in Covid-19 cases in western Odisha was due to a cricket tournament in Raipur town of Chhattisgarh.The Road Safety World Cricket Series 2020-21 played between March 5 and 21 at Raipur’s Saheed Veer Narayan Singh International Cricket stadium saw large attendance of youth from western Odisha districts like Kalahandi, Bargarh and Nuapara. After the rise in Covid-19 cases in western Odisha district of Nuapara, the state government curbed inter-state bus service to Chhattisgarh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-asks-collectors-to-vaccinate-people-with-co-morbidities-on-priority-101617393223186.html

Neither the Centre nor our scientists have warned that it is more virulent. Whatever treatment and procedure was underway for the previous strain, the same will be continued for the new variant,” he added.As many as 52 people were discharged from hospitals while 893 others completed their home isolation period today, leaving the state with 31,858 active cases. The number of people who have recovered from the infection increased to 3,21,873, he said.The worst-hit districts of Raipur and Durg accounted for 1,405 and 964 of the new cases respectively. While the total count of the infection in Raipur has touched 68,404, including 930 deaths, Durg’s caseload increased to 41,032, including 766 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chhattisgarh-adds-4-174-new-covid-19-cases-new-variant-found-101617391373838.html
03-04-2021||India||What science tells us about Covid-19 vaccines||Re-infections, infections after vaccine shots, prevention of transmission – the Indian medical and scientific space is beset with conflicting information regarding Covid-19 and the vaccines meant to stop the virus’s march, with some originating from the very people who should be shedding clarity on the issues. On Thursday, April 2, HT and some others published details of a study conducted by scientists from the Indian Council of Medical Research that suggested a 4.5% re-infection rate, but without analysing the genomes of the first and the second infections. These may not have been readily available – despite a surge that is most likely caused by so-called VOCs, or variants of concern, especially in Maharashtra, India is not sequencing as many viral genomes as it should, nor even as many as it promised to when variants became a matter of concern. The number is also much higher than what most international studies suggest – a reinfection rate of under 1%. Indeed, if the reinfection rate is 4.5%, as indicated by the study, then the house is already on fire.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverageThere are also some reports, likely true, of doctors who have received two doses of the vaccine, as prescribed, contracting Covid-19. According to science, immunity sets in around two weeks after the second dose, although research recommends delaying the second dose in the case of the Covishield vaccine (the Indian version of the Oxford/ AstraZeneca vaccine) by 6-8 weeks to maximise immunity. That means these people should have been immune. How, then, did they get infected?Data put out by the companies behind the two vaccines in use in India (Bharat Biotech is the second) claim an efficacy of 70%-80% in preventing infections. Taking the lower end of the range, let’s assume the vaccine is effective in 70% of cases. What does this mean? It means 70% of those vaccinated will not be infected. Conversely, three of every 10 people who have received vaccines may be, and that is likely what is emerging, especially as the rate of infection itself speeds as the intensity of the second wave of infections in India becomes stronger. But both vaccines are also, based on their makers’ claims, 100% effective in preventing severe disease and death. This means no one who gets the vaccine will die from Covid-19. Low as India’s case fatality rate is, this is still a relief.Science isn’t very clear on whether those vaccinated could still carry the virus even if they don’t get infected themselves, and whether they can then pass it on to others. The answer is likely yes, which means that the vaccines probably do not offer any protection against transmission. This is important to understand – especially in a country where even the announcement of vaccines was met with a collective exhalation of relief and rapid abandonment of all Covid-safe behaviour. There were a few rash statements by health administrators at the beginning of the vaccine drive that the shots prevent transmission, but they do not.Finally, there’s been some confusion on Adverse Events Following Immunisation (or AEFI) as it is called. The Economic Times reported on Friday that six of the 13 AEFI cases studied by the national committee looking at these showed a “consistent causal” relationship with the vaccination, a finding that has set alarm bells ringing in various quarters. But the report also adds that none of the cases were caused by the vaccine itself. Clearly, more clarity is needed (the committee studied 13 cases till March 9). Till then, it makes sense to look closely at the numbers. There were 79 deaths till March 13, according to a report in The Hindu. India had administered 29.19 million doses of the vaccine till that day (18.56 million had one dose and 5.21 million both doses). So, these 79 deaths need to be seen in the context of the 24 million people vaccinated. Which means, 99.9997% of the people who take the vaccine have no reason to fear.So, what do the vaccines do? They prevent death and severe disease in all cases, infections in the majority of cases, and perhaps do not have any bearing at all on transmission. This is what science tells us as of today, April 2. If there is an update, you will read it here. Meanwhile, take the jab.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-science-tells-us-about-covid-19-vaccines-101617391020870.html
03-04-2021||India||Bengaluru’s cab fare hike comes with some relief, many concerns||Karnataka government’s decision to increase the basic fare for cabs services in Bengaluru has come as a relief and with concerns for both drivers and customers. The increase, which is up to 92%, comes days after a debt-ridden cab driver died by suicide at Bengaluru’s Kempegowda International Airport. As per the state government order, the minimum fare was increased to ₹75 for small cabs and ₹150 for luxury taxis for the first 4 kilometres. Earlier, the rates for these categories were ₹44 and ₹80 respectively. While some cab drivers call this a welcome move considering the recent inflation, customers feel this could discourage people from taking cabs and rely on private vehicles. Cab aggregator drivers’ association members said they will hold another meeting with the transport department for more clarifications on the new changes. Tanveer Pasha, former President of Ola and Uber Drivers Association told Hindustan Times that the revised rates have not come into effect, despite the government order. Pasha said as per the communication from the state transport department, the new fares will be implemented from Monday since Friday was a government holiday. “This is a welcome decision because cab drivers have been suffering for a long time. When companies were charging ₹8 per kilometre, it was the driver who was suffering. Autorickshaws in the city charge ₹13 per kilometres and the cab driver, who has to pay EMIs for cars that cost up to ₹10 and pay almost ₹90 for diesel, was getting a bad deal. The companies could keep the rates low to attract business, but the problem is that discounts were not coming from the companies’ pockets and the drivers were paying for it,” said Pasha. He added that the cab driver died by suicide because he was struggling to pay off the car loans and fear the seizure of his car. On Tuesday, a 34-year-old cab driver, Pratap, set himself ablaze in his cab. Pratap was with an airport taxi service of Karnataka State Tourism Development Corporation. His death led to protest demanding regularization of the cab fares since cab services, like the one owned by KSTDC, was charging up to ₹24 per kilometre while Ola and Uber were operating under ₹10 per kilometre. While the association is happy with the decision, cab drivers have apprehensions about the new directive. Manjunath Gowda, driver attached to cab aggregator said that he fears that the increase could have an adverse effect on the demand for cabs. “From the city to the airport it takes ₹600-900. With the new rule, it could be ₹1,200 to 1,800. Will people opt for cabs in a big question,” said Gowda. Rohan Thomas, graphics designer based in Bengaluru, who uses cabs for his daily commute said that the revised charges would burn a big hole in his pockets. “Unlike New Delhi or Mumbai, Bengaluru doesn’t have a good public transport system and cabs are the most preferred mode of transport. I’m really concerned about the new move. Losing customers like me can’t be good for cab drivers also, right?” he asked. The fare structure is classified into four categories as per the cost of vehicles, with A being highest (more than ₹16 lakh) and D being the lowest (up to ₹5 lakh). The largest increase was given in category C ( ₹5-10 lakhs), which is the most prominent category among cab services. Ramesh Kalburgi, another cab driver said that instead of the steep increase in the fares, the government should have increased the drivers’ share in the earning from a ride. A senior official in the Karnataka Transport Department said following the incident at the airport, the cab drivers had approached the government. “They pointed out that there was a disparity in fares. The government also believes that cab drivers who are contributing to the development of the city were at a disadvantage and within days we issued the revised rates. The last time they were updated was in 2018,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengalurus-cab-fare-hike-comes-with-some-relief-many-concerns-101617390424935.html
03-04-2021||India||India wields oil 'weapon' to cut dependence on Saudi||When India's government last month asked refiners to speed up diversification and reduce dependence on the Middle East - days after OPEC+ said it would maintain production cuts - it sent a message about its clout and foreshadowed changes to the world's energy maps.It was a move that had been in the works for years, fuelled by repeated comments from Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who in 2015 called oil purchases a "weapon" for his country.When the Organisation of Oil Exporting Countries and Major Producers (OPEC+) extended the production cuts into April, India unsheathed that weapon. Indian refiners plan to cut imports from the Kingdom by about a quarter in May, sources told Reuters, dropping them to 10.8 million barrels from monthly average of 14.7-14.8 million barrels.Oil secretary Tarun Kapoor, the top bureaucrat in the ministry, told Reuters that India is asking state refiners to jointly negotiate with oil producers to get better deals, but declined to comment on plans to cut Saudi imports."India is a big market so sellers have to be mindful of our country's demand as well to keep the long-term relationship intact," he said.The Saudi state oil company Saudi Aramco and the Saudi energy ministry declined to comment.Pradhan, who sees high oil prices as a threat to India's recovering economy, said he was saddened by the OPEC+ decision. India's fuel import bill has rocketed, and fuel prices – inflated by government taxes imposed last year - have hit records.The International Energy Agency forecasts India's consumption to double and its oil import bill to nearly triple from 2019 levels to more than $250 billion by 2040.An oil ministry official, who declined to be named because of the sensitivity of the matter, said the OPEC+ cuts have created uncertainty and made it difficult for refiners to plan for procurement and price risk.It also creates opportunities for companies in the Americas, Africa, Russia and elsewhere to fill the gap.If India is successful, it will set an example for other countries. As buyers see more affordable choices and renewable energy becomes increasingly common, the influence of big producers like Saudi Arabia could wane, altering geopolitics and trade routes.DIVERSIFICATION DRIVEIndia's oil demand has risen by 25% in the last seven years - more than any other major buyer - and the country has surpassed Japan as the world's third-largest oil importer and consumer.The country has already curbed its reliance on the Middle East from more than 64% of imports in 2016 to below 60% in 2019.That trend reversed in 2020, however, when the pandemic pummelled fuel demand and forced Indian refiners to make committed oil purchases from the Middle East under term contracts, shunning spot purchases.As India shifts gears again after Pradhan's call for faster diversification, refineries are looking for new suppliers, the oil ministry official said.Costly refinery upgrades that allow for the processing of cheaper, heavier oil grades have encouraged importers to seek out far-flung sources. HPCL-Mittal Energy Ltd bought the country's first cargo from Guyana this month, and Mangalore Refinery and Petrochemicals Ltd just imported Brazilian Tupi crude for the first time.Since the break with Saudi Arabia began, Pradhan has had meetings with United Arab Emirates' minister of state and chief executive of Abu Dhabi National Oil Co (ADNOC), Sultan Ahmed Al Jaber, and U.S. energy secretary Jennifer Granholm to strengthen energy partnerships.Pradhan recently said African nations could play a central role in India's oil diversification. The country is looking at signing long-term oil supply deal with Guyana and exploring options to raise imports from Russia, the oil ministry source said.A separate Indian government source said the government expects Iranian sanctions to ease in three to four months, potentially offering India a cheaper alternative to Saudi oil.Two traders agreed that Iran stood a good chance to benefit from India's shift, as did Venezuela, Kuwait and the United States. An Indian refinery source said the U.S., Africa, Kazakhstan's CPC Blend and Russian oil would probably get a look too.Although Indian importers will scoop up increasing volumes of attractively priced global grades, most analysts expect the Middle East to remain India's primary oil supplier, mainly because of lower shipping costs.India's oil ministry is working with refiners on a framework to jointly negotiate terms with suppliers."Buyers have alternatives in today's market and these alternatives are going to multiply going forward," Kapoor said."There are so many companies in India that do buying at their own level, so these companies coming together also becomes quite a big bloc."On Thursday, Saudi Arabia and OPEC+ agreed after discussions with U.S. officials to ease oil curbs beginning in May.Saudi energy minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman conceded that the production cuts had put state oil company Aramco "in some difficulty with some of its partners."THE RELATIONSHIPAnalysts say the oil spat does not need to spill over into broader strategic ties in other sectors, including defence."Until recently, the balance of power was skewed towards Saudi Arabia, but increasingly, India is using access to its market and the diversity of options to put pressure on Saudi Arabia," consultancy Eurasia said in a note. "For Saudi Arabia, losing market share in a global environment in which most developed economies are already seeing their oil demand decline due to green policy implementation, would be a blow."Abdulaziz confirmed that Aramco had maintained normal April oil supplies to Indian refiners while cutting volumes for other buyers - a sign Saudi Arabia is concerned about India's search for new sources.Saudi Arabia is India's fourth-biggest trade partner, importing a slew of items, including food. Saudi Armaco is looking at buying a 20% stake in Reliance Industries' oil and chemicals business. It is also a part of a joint venture to build a 1.2 million barrels per day refinery in India.But Amitendu Palit, senior research fellow at National University of Singapore, said it would be difficult for Saudi to find a stable alternative buyer if India continues with reduced purchases for too long."This bilateral relationship should not be impacted due to any decisions on one commodity. However in a global surplus, market buyers have a lot of negotiating power and sources," Palit said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-wields-oil-weapon-to-cut-dependence-on-saudi-101617389940308.html

If you are saying about partnership in democracy, then what is your view on what’s going on here?”Gandhi answered questions on a wide range of subjects and maintained that countries must act to stop China as the global manufacturer or its Belt and Road initiative.The interaction, largely on economy and foreign policy, saw Gandhi supporting recent steps taken by US President Joe Biden. When asked about his comments of the US package on economic revival after Covid-19, Gandhi said, “President Biden is doing spot on. India should think along similar terms. Our government refuses to put money in system. The US has done groundbreaking.” He said that while there was a definite space for private sector, in areas such as education and health, public sector had a role to play.Talking about domestic politics, Gandhi said the Congress needed to redefine itself but added, “We are no longer in same paradigm. Institutions don’t protect us or support a fair political fight. There is complete control of system by the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party].”“Opportunity for us is huge. We have to redefine ourselves too,” Gandhi said, asserting that people were fast losing hope with the current regime.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rahul-hails-biden-seeks-us-govt-views-on-what-s-going-on-in-india-101617390184661.html

Sunil shot a video of himself wherein he mentioned his frustration with the lack of job opportunities in the state as the reason behind his extreme step. “He breathed his last this (Friday) morning. The body has been moved to Gandhi Hospital in Secunderabad for postmortem after which it would be taken to his native place later in the night,” the Punjagutta police said.Activists of Telangana Youth Congress, led by state unit president Shiva Sena Reddy, staged a dharna in front of the Gandhi Hospital and demanded the resignation of Telangana chief minister K Chandrasekhar Rao. They were immediately taken into custody by the police.“We were arrested when all we wanted was to pay floral tributes to the deceased. We shall take part in his funeral procession at his native place,” Reddy said.Minutes after consuming pesticide at a secluded place on the Kakatiya University campus, Sunil recorded a video on his mobile and sent it to his friends. In the video, Sunil said he was resorting to the extreme step not because he was inefficient and was dreaming to be a civil servant.“But I thought my death is the only way to open the eyes of the government. It has been seven years since the Telangana state was formed but the government has not filled up any job vacancies. Students who had struggled for a separate statehood are frustrated due to lack of jobs,” he said and asked the youth to fight against KCR (the chief minister).The police, who were alerted by his friends, quickly traced Sunil and took him to the MGM Hospital in Warangal. On Tuesday, he was brought to the NIMS, where he died on Friday.In the video, Sunil also said he was preparing for the competitive examinations and even cleared the written test for the sub-inspector’s examination in 2016 but was denied a job on the pretext that he didn’t meet the criteria as he wasn’t tall enough.“There have been no job recruitments in Telangana since then. If I survive, I will continue my struggle for the jobs; otherwise, Telangana’s youth should fight against the government,” he said.Bharatiya Janata Party state president Bandi Sanjay lashed out at the TRS government for ignoring the plight of the unemployed. “The youth are frustrated due to the lack of employment opportunities. Since Sunil named the chief minister in his selfie video before suicide, the police should arrest KCR,” he demanded.Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee president N Uttam Kumar Reddy said the unfortunate incident reflects the height of negligence of the TRS government towards the unemployed youth. “The Congress will be on the forefront of the struggles of the youth to carry on the fight for job recruitments,” he said.TRS leaders could not be reached for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/telangana-man-decries-lack-of-jobs-in-video-dies-after-consuming-pesticide-101617390004823.html
03-04-2021||India||Minister’s charge against CM under review, says BJP||Bengaluru Rural development and panchayat raj minister K S Eshwarappa’s allegation of interference in his departmental affairs by chief minister B S Yediyurappa is under review and will be resolved in the next two days, state Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Nalin Kumar Kateel said on Friday. Eshwarappa, meanwhile, dismissed claims that he was targeting the chief minister over personal differences and asserted that he was always loyal to the party.Addressing reporters in Mangaluru, Kateel said: “This will end well. In the next two days, I will only resolve it.” The BJP leader added that the party is reviewing the developments that have taken place in the last two days and discussions will be held with all concerned parties to resolve the issue. Besides this, Kateel said a notice has been sent to BJP MLA Basanagouda Patil Yatnal seeking clarification on his critical comments (seeking Yediyurappa’s removal) in March against the chief minister. In a strongly-worded letter to governor Vajubai Vala on Wednesday, Eshwarappa had said that Yediyurappa had indiscriminately sanctioned funds to various MLAs and other persons in violation of rules. On Friday, the minister said he was merely trying to reinstate the practice of following rules and procedures. “I am not a rebel, I am loyal. I have always been loyal from the beginning and will never rebel against my party,” the minister, who belongs to Yediyurappa’s home district of Shivamogga, told reporters in Mysuru. “Without my knowledge ₹65 crore was sanctioned for the Bengaluru Urban district Panchayat. Further, ₹774 crore was released in the first instalment and ₹460 crore in the second instalment. So altogether ₹1,299 crore was released, which violates the Business Transaction Rules,” the minister alleged.Eshwarappa also recalled how Yediyurappa had quit the saffron party in 2012 to form the Karnataka Janata Party (KJP).The developments come at a time when Yediyurappa already finds himself in a corner over the recent sexual harassment case involving former minister Ramesh Jarkiholi, non-performance of his two-year-old government, cash crunch and growing calls for his removal among other problems.The three bypolls on April 17 have presented the 78-year-old with an opportunity to silence growing dissent and consolidate his position for the remainder of the two years in power.Leader of Opposition Siddaramaiah on Thursday urged the Karnataka governor to immediately remove Yediyurappa and recommend President’s rule in the state. “The governor must immediately intervene, remove the chief minister and recommend for President’s rule,” the Congress leader said in a statement.However, at least four Cabinet ministers extended their support to the chief minister on Thursday.“The chief minister has allocated RDPR funds to the MLAs and it is an administrative issue. Since Eshwarappa heads the department and is unhappy over this, it has to be resolved among ourselves,” Karnataka home, law and parliamentary affairs minister Basavaraj Bommai said.“We do not know if there is Centre’s sanction but there are some invisible hands operating. Yatnal and Eshwarappa are only mouths and the hands operating them are unseen,” A Narayana, political analyst and faculty at the Azim Premji University, had said on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ministers-charge-against-cm-under-review-says-bjp-101617389824210.html
03-04-2021||India||Muslim man travelling with Hindu woman stabbed in Karnataka: Cops||A 23-year-old Muslim man was beaten up and stabbed by a group of men, believed to be right-wing activists, for travelling with a Hindu woman in a bus in coastal Karnataka’s Dakshina Kannada district on Thursday, police officials said on Friday.The victim, identified as Anwar Mohammed by police, has been admitted to the intensive care unit at a private hospital in Mangaluru. His condition is said to be serious.Thursday’s incident comes at a time several states in the country, including Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh, have introduced laws regulating inter-faith marriages, deemed by right-wing activists as “love jihad”.According to police, the man and the woman (23), who knew each other from school, were travelling in an overnight bus from Mangaluru to Bengaluru when the group of men stopped the bus and attacked the man. It wasn’t immediately clear how the group knew that the two were on the bus.The woman, whose identity was not released by the police, was also attacked and suffered minor injuries.“Around 9pm, they stopped the bus near Pumpwell Circle in Mangaluru. They initially questioned [the man and the woman] why they were travelling together and later stabbed the man with a sharp object,” said Mangaluru police commissioner Shashi Kumar.The officer added that Mohammad was accompanying the woman as she had applied for a job in Bengaluru and hadn’t been to the city before.An FIR has been registered for attempt to murder (IPC section 307) among other sections at the Kankanady police station in Mangaluru. No arrests have been made so far. Police officials at the station said they are questioning some suspects in the case, but that the perpetrators have not been identified.Since the attack on Thursday, a WhatsApp message doing the rounds claims Bajrang Dal activists stopped the duo from travelling. “Ongoing Operation by Bajrang Dal Today (Thursday). A Hindu young woman who was fleeing with a Muslim man was travelling from Mangaluru to Bengaluru. Bajrang Dal activists stopped the couple near Pumpwell,” read a message.SharanPumpwell, the Vishwa Hindu Parishad’s (VHP) divisional secretary, too claimed on Friday that the group’s men intercepted the couple because it was a case of “love jihad”, but that a mob gathered and turned violent. “We were trying to save the girl from love jihad. But after the mob gathered and turned violent. Police are investigating the case,” he added.Police said that they are investigating the VHP leader’s claim and the authenticity of the message.On Thursday, Gujarat became the latest Bharatiya Janata Party-led state to pass a Bill proposing amendments to the Freedom of Religion Act, 2002 to ensure stringent punishment for forced religious conversions.Last month, the UP Assembly passed the Prohibition of Unlawful Religious Conversion Bill, 2021 by a voice vote. In March, the MP Assembly passed the MP Freedom of Religion Bill 2020 to prohibit forcible religious conversion by way of allurement, fraud, threat or marriage. Haryana and Karnataka, too, are considering a similar law.While state governments claim their move is aimed at curbing cases of “love jihad”, where Muslim men allegedly lure and marry women from other religions to convert them, the Union government told Parliament in February 2020 that the term “love jihad” was not defined under any laws and no such case had been reported.Petitions have also been filed in the Supreme Court against the legislations, that petitioners say, can be misused to falsely implicate couples belonging to different faiths who marry out of their free will.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/muslim-man-travelling-with-hindu-woman-stabbed-cops-101617388864050.html

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend the opening and closing of the event.French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian will begin his two-day visit to India on the evening of April 12. His meeting with Indian external affairs minister S Jaishankar and Australian foreign minister Marise Payne is scheduled for the following day.India, France and Australia are on the same page on addressing the challenges in the Indo-Pacific. In recent months, France has come around to acknowledging the central role that New Delhi can play in the shared commitment to freedom of navigation in the South China Sea.It is in recognition of the role that New Delhi can play that France decided to hold the La Pérouse joint naval exercise in the Bay of Bengal on April 4-7, and invited the Indian Navy to the wargame. The joint exercise, first held in 2019, earlier included navies from the three other members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad: Australia, Japan and the US.“This (trilateral dialogue) will be a meeting of middle powers, who have democratic polity and have the economic strength and shared values to help each other in terms of trade and technology,” said a senior Indian official.The three foreign ministers will discuss the global security environment and the Chinese posture in the Indo-Pacific.Also Read | How much India should invest in the Indo-PacificFrench envoy Christophe Penot, who is an advisor to President Emmanuel Marcon on the Indo-Pacific, signalled the pivotal role that Paris expects New Delhi to play in the region when he briefed top diplomatic corps and heads of multilateral agencies in Paris this week. It is understood that Penot in his virtual briefing outlined the role of France, Australia and India in the Indo-Pacific with particular emphasis on New Delhi’s role in the efforts.A former foreign secretary linked the emphasis on India to the government’s decision to stand up to China when the latter tried to expand its territory across the Line of Actual Control.After this, this person added, “not only Quad powers but key strategic allies, France and UK, recognise the centrality of India in ensuring the right to free navigation in the Indo-Pacific.”Officials said it has helped that foreign ministers Jaishankar, Drian and Payne have a personal connect with each other apart from being representatives of democratic powers put under pressure by Chinese behaviour in East Ladakh, Caledonia and island territories, respectively, in the far Pacific.While India and France have deep defence cooperation with each other, Australia under Prime Minister Scott Morrison has joined hands with New Delhi on not only working on closer bilateral ties but also on military ties through multilateral naval exercises such as Malabar 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indiafranceaustralia-meet-on-april-13-maritime-security-indo-pacific-top-agenda-101617388804180.html
03-04-2021||India||NIA questions Vaze colleagues in Hiran murder case||Mumbai The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Friday questioned suspended Mumbai Police officer Sachin Vaze’s colleagues in connection with the murder of 48-year-old Thane auto parts dealer Mansukh Hiran last month. Riyazuddin Shaikh, an officer at Crime Intelligence Unit and crime branch officer Prakash Ovhal, who is believed to have purchased a Mitsubishi Outlander from Vaze, were probed for around nine hours at the central agency’s office on Peddar Road, NIA officials said. The agency also questioned a woman whose identity is yet to be ascertained.Besides this, the NIA also conducted raids at a hotel and a club in south Mumbai in connection with the case, news agency PTI reported. Customers and staff members of the hotel were asked to vacate the premises, located near the Babulnath temple. The NIA also recorded the statement of the owner of the club. Hiran was linked to the explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani Antilia home in south Mumbai. He had gone missing late in the evening on March 4 and his body was recovered from a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra the next day.Six handkerchiefs were found stuffed in his mouth, and his face was covered by a scarf.On March 13, Vaze was arrested by NIA officials for his purported role in abandoning the vehicle with 20 loses gelatin sticks near Ambani’s residence.The Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS), which was earlier probing the case, arrested former constable Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gor on March 21 in connection with the murder. ATS suspected that Vaze is also the prime accused in Hiran’s murder case, while Shinde allegedly helped him execute the murder, and Gor arranged for some SIM cards used in the commission of the crime from Gujarat.Both ATS and NIA officials believe that Mansukh was smothered in a vehicle at Gaimukh, along Ghodbunder Road.The initial probe by ATS had revealed that Hiran had received a call around 8.29 pm on March 4, and the caller spoke to him for around 11 minutes and asked him to meet near Majiwada junction on Ghodbunder Road.According to an ATS officer, the trader was made to sit in a four-wheeler at Majiwada junction, taken 10km away to Gaimukh breach front, and smothered in the vehicle at the spot. Later the body was dumped in the creek at Reti Bunder, suspect NIA officials.NIA is also trying to trace the Maruti Eeco, allegedly stolen from Aurangabad in November. The car’s original number plates were found during a search in Mithi river on March 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nia-questions-vaze-colleagues-in-hiran-murder-case-101617388744030.html
03-04-2021||India||Widespread rain likely in J&K, Uttarakhand: IMD||A fresh western disturbance is likely to affect the Western Himalayan region from the night of April 3, bringing widespread rain over Jammu and Kashmir, Ladakh, Himachal Pradesh, parts of Uttarakhand and surrounding areas, India Meteorological Department (IMD) predicted on Friday.There is a possibility of rain over the Western Himalayan region from April 4 to 6, IMD said. Due to the approaching western disturbance, no heatwave conditions are likely over most parts of northwest and Central India during the next 4-5 days except Rajasthan and Vidarbha, where there is possibility of heatwave on April 3 and 4, according to IMD officials.Heatwave conditions are also likely over Saurashtra, Kutch, Telangana and Rayalaseema during next 2 days, over Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam during next 3 days, and over Tamil Nadu, Puducherry and Karaikal during next 4 days. There is a severe heatwave warning for isolated pockets over Coastal Andhra Pradesh and Yanam, IMD officials said.After the WD passes, maximum temperatures are likely to rise gradually over northwest India, including Delhi NCR. “By April 6 and 7, we are expecting maximum temperature in Delhi to be around 37 to 38 degrees Celsius. It will gradually rise to 40 degrees C. We are not expecting any major impact of the WD in Delhi. There may be some cloudiness and trace rainfall,” said Kuldeep Shrivastava, head, regional weather forecasting centre. The maximum temperature in the national capital on Thursday was recorded at 34.4 degrees C, 1 degree above normal.Meanwhile, there is likely to be heavy and widespread rain over Andaman and Nicobar region for next two days. A depression over north Andaman Sea remained practically stationary and lay centred about 400 km east-northeast of Port Blair (Andaman Islands), 420 km north-northwest of Phuket (Thailand) and 640 km south of Yangon (Myanmar), IMD officials said. It is likely to move northeastwards towards Myanmar coast and intensify further into a deep depression during next 12 hours.Under its influence, widespread rainfall with isolated thunderstorm, lightning and gusty winds is very likely over Andaman and Nicobar Islands during the next 2 days. “As of today, we are not expecting the deep depression to intensify into a cyclonic storm. It will move towards the Myanmar coast and bring heavy rain over Andaman and Nicobar Islands and over the sea so maritime activities may be impacted,” said Sunitha Devi, in charge of cyclones at IMD. Fishermen are advised not to venture into the Andaman Sea till April 3.A trough (line of low pressure) in westerlies is likely to cause widespread rainfall over Arunachal Pradesh and isolated rainfall over Assam, Meghalaya, Nagaland, Manipur, Mizoram and Tripura with isolated thunderstorm/lightning and gusty winds over the region during next 2-3 days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/widespread-rain-likely-in-j-k-u-khand-imd-101617388624633.html
03-04-2021||India||Centre gives thermal plants new deadlines to meet emission norms||The Union environment ministry has amended rules allowing thermal power plants within 10 kilometres of the National Capital Region (NCR) and in cities with more than 1 million population to comply with new emission norms by the end of 2022, official notification has said.The notification dated March 31 replaces the Environment (Protection) Rules, 1986, with the Environment (Protection) Amendment Rules, 2021.Thermal power plants within 10 km radius of critically polluted areas or non-attainment cities (that did not meet the annual national standard for particulate matter emissions from 2011 to 2015) will have to meet the standards by December 31, 2023, the notification said. HT has seen the notification.The environment ministry joint secretary Naresh Gangawar confirmed that the notification has been issued but did not divulge details on why the deadlines were deferred.The plants that do not fall in these two categories and are not scheduled for retirement will have to meet the norms by December 31, 2024, the notification said.The ministry notified superior emission standards for thermal power plants in December 2015 for implementation by the end of 2017. The deadline, however, was pushed to 2022 due to resistance from the thermal power industry.The environment ministry agreed to extend the deadline to 2022, and approached the Supreme Court, which also ordered for an extension.Later, the power ministry approached the environment ministry last year seeking a further delay in the deadline citing the Covid-19 associated economic slowdown. The power ministry also said that the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign made it difficult to procure systems for flue gas desulphurization (FGD) that help to control SO2 emissions from thermal power plants.“Power ministry has approached us. They are finding it difficult to meet the 2022 deadline both because of Covid-19 and curbs on imports from China. We are considering the matter. We may have to give the thermal power plants time to deliver on the deadline,” RP Gupta, secretary, environment ministry said in August last year.Environmental experts said that the ministry was only favoring the power industry by delaying the deadline.“It is very unfortunate that MoEFCC sides with the polluters and law offenders time and again to give them extensions and dilutions rather than with the common public who is suffering from severe pollution and health impacts, whose interest MoEFCC is duty bound to protect. It’s not even a day since the extension and we can confidently say that many plants will not meet even the new deadline given that they are yet to even award any contracts to install pollution control equipment which would take three years to build by the power company’s own admission. Given that this is the third time this notification has been extended, MoEFCC needs to clarify what commitments they have received from power companies and ministry of power, which ensures the implementation at least this time around, otherwise it merely seems that the role of MoEFCC is just to extend deadlines and not to regulate their own laws and pollution,” said Sunil Dahiya, Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) said in a statement on Friday.“This notification in one stroke has delayed the deadline for majority of the power plants in the country as there are only a few plants within 10 km radius of million plus cities that have been prioritised to meet the standards by 2022. While the plants that have already taken steps to meet the standards have not been incentivised, the laggards who have not acted on time, have been rewarded. This will perpetuate locking in of pollution and carbon when we are expected to accelerate our roadmap for clean air and low carbon growth path. Moreover, the effectiveness of the proposed penalty will have to be examined carefully,” said Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, Centre for Science and Environment.A 2017 paper in the journal Nature warned against rising SO2 levels in India. The paper, India Is Overtaking China as the World’s Largest Emitter of Anthropogenic Sulfur Dioxide, said that India and China are on opposite trajectories for sulphurous pollution.Since 2007, emissions in China have declined by 75% while those in India have increased by 50%. With these changes, India has been surpassing China as the world’s largest emitter of anthropogenic SO2, the paper said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-gives-thermal-plants-new-deadlines-to-meet-emission-norms-101617388564082.html

The western state is, by far, the worst affected in India and has been driving the second wave of infections in India with record cases. On Friday, it posted 47,913cases.Click here for complete Covid-19 coverage“I am not announcing a lockdown, but definitely warning about it. I am sure we can avoid a lockdown if we decided firmly about it. We will observe for the next couple of days, if people are observing protocol strictly. But in case no such solution found, I cannot allow to go the situation out of hand,” he said.Thackeray warned that hospital beds will start falling short in next 15 days if the current spike in Covid cases continued. He also said stricter curbs will be announced in the next couple of days after speaking to political leaders and experts from various sectors.“We will issue guidelines for stricter curbs in next couple of days. Political parties, industrialists have been opposing the lockdown and warning the government against it. We are in a Catch-22 situation. If a lockdown is imposed, we face an economic crisis. At the same time, people’s lives are more important for us. Many countries including France, United Kingdom, Belgium, Brazil have impose the strict lockdown for many weeks in their fight against the second wave,” he said.Thackeray said the government had ramped up health infrastructure. “We ramped up infrastructure, by increasing the number of hospital beds to 3,75,000 from about 10,000 during the pre-Covid-19 period. The beds are filling very fast. 62% or 1,37,549 of 2,20,000 isolation beds have been occupied. 48% of 20,519 ICU beds are occupied, 25% of 62,000 oxygen beds are full. 25% of the 9347 ventilators under use for Covid-19 patients. If the rise continued there will be acute shortage of the beds. In some districts, we have started facing the shortage,” he said.“We have been advised to ramp up health care infrastructure, which we have done over the last one year. But where are we going to get doctors, nurses and health care workers, who are already under pressure and have started taken ill?” he asked.“Till now, we have administered 65 lakh COVID-19 vaccine doses, including three lakh vaccine doses yesterday,” Thackeray said.But some people are getting infected even after vaccination because they stop wearing masks, he added. People have become complacent, the chief minister noted, adding “I cannot rule out imposing lockdown if the current situation prevails.”Thackeray asked political parties not to politicise the situation.“Don’t play with people’s lives. I am ready to become a villain for protecting people,” the CM said.People should wear face masks, maintain physical distance, wash hands and avoid crowding, he appealed. “Many ask me why there is no rise in the number of cases in other states. I do not want to talk about other states, but we have been maintaining transperancy without hiding anything about the cases,” he said.According to the officials privy to developments, the government has prepared an standard operating procedure and decision about stricter norms is expected in the next two days. “The eight districts severely hit by cases have already imposed lockdown or night curfew. There would stricter norms in other districts across the state,” Thackeray said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-ruling-out-lockdown-says-uddhav-amid-covid-19-spike-101617388272365.html
03-04-2021||India||At Friday prayers, UP clerics push for vaccination||LucknowMuslim clerics in Lucknow on Friday held gatherings to bust misinformation surrounding the Covid-19 vaccination process and motivated people to get the doses. Taking the vaccine was the only way to arrest the spread of the virus, the clerics told people at religious gatherings in the city. “As we know, we are going through tough times. The cases are on the rise. Hence, you are requested to take all possible anti-Covid precautionary measures to keep the infection at bay. Also, those who are above 45 years should compulsorily take the jab as it’s the only way to combat the coronavirus menace,” said Maulana Khalid Rasheed Farangi Mahali, senior member of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) and Imam of the Eidgah masjid in Lucknow. The Sunni cleric was addressing people at the Eidgah during Friday prayers, after leaders across ideological lines decided to publicise the common message.The crucial appeal comes at a time when India is firmly under the grip of the second wave of the pandemic. Infections have spiked across the country with experts saying that picking up the pace of vaccination was the best way to counter the disease.India opened up its vaccination drive to all people above 45 on Thursday. The previous two phases of the drive – the first was aimed at frontline workers and the second at those above 60, or above 45 with comorbidities – were dogged by slow rollout, teething problems, vaccine hesitancy and misinformation. India is home to roughly 175 million Muslims, who form about 14% of the country’s population.Shia leaders in the city also endorsed the appeal for vaccinations.Shia cleric Maulana Kalbe Jawad at another gathering after Friday prayers said it was “our moral responsibility” to get vaccinated. “It is our moral responsibility to get ourselves and our family members vaccinated. Hence, people are requested to get themselves vaccinated at the earliest,” he said at the Asafi Mosque in Bara Imambada complex of Lucknow.Similar requests were made at other mosques in the city as well. “We are spreading the word at almost all religious gatherings, not only in Lucknow but also in the districts like Sultanpur, Lakhimpur Khiri, Hardoi, Sitapur and others. It is the best possible way to connect to the masses,” said Shia cleric Maulana Yasoob Abbas, who is also general secretary of the All-India Shia Personal Law Board (AISPLB).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-friday-prayers-up-clerics-push-for-vaccination-101617388324695.html

03-04-2021||India||Jailed DU professor GN Saibaba terminated by Ram Lal Anand College||Delhi University professor GN Saibaba, sentenced to life imprisonment in 2017 by a Maharashtra court for his links with Left-wing extremist groups, was terminated from his services at Ram Lal Anand College on Thursday. While the college principal did not respond to several texts and calls seeking comment, Delhi University officials said the decision was taken as per existing rules.In a note sent to Saibaba’s family on Thursday, college principal Rakesh Kumar Gupta wrote, “The services of GN Saibaba, Assistant Professor, Ram Lal Anand College, are terminated with effect from the afternoon of 31st day of March, 2021. Three months’ salary has been paid in his Savings Bank Account.”His wife Vasantha Kumari confirmed receiving the letter and said that no reason was mentioned by the college for the termination. “We have already challenged the conviction in the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court which is pending. What was the reason to terminate him in such a hurry during a pandemic? There have been cases in the past where people have been acquitted after being wrongly convicted,” she said.DU’s Dean of Colleges Balaram Pani said the college governing body took the call on the basis of existing rules. “The university has given the approval to the governing body decision which was taken because the said professor is under life imprisonment. This [the termination notice] is the rule. The governing body would have kept legal implications in mind and taken the decision accordingly. As far as an appeal to a higher court is concerned, we will see what the court says.”In March 2017, the Gadchiroli sessions court convicted Saibaba along with five others for links with Left-wing extremist organisations and “waging war” against India under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. All of them were sentenced to life imprisonment.GN Saibaba was convicted under sections 13, 18, 20, 38 and 39 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, and 120B (criminal conspiracy) of the Indian Penal Code. The sections of the UAPA refer to committing terrorist activities, abetting, advising or inciting lawful activities, association with terror groups and inviting support for terror groups.Saibaba, a wheelchair-bound English professor, was arrested by the Maharashtra police in May, 2014, for his alleged links with top leaders of the outlawed CPI (Maoist) including Puppalla Laxman Rao alias Ganapathy.On Friday, DU Teachers’ Association President (DUTA) Rajib Ray criticised the move: “The final decision in the case is yet to come out considering the appeal. Therefore, the college and university administration should not have taken this decision.”Saibaba’s family alleged that the college’s decision is only to “mentally torture and harass” them. “We were receiving half the salary since the suspension, and the college administration wanted to stop that as well. They have taken this decision to terrorize us,” said Kumari.The family also claimed to have received several memoranda from the college over arbitrary matters. One such memorandum sent by the college in September 2019 stated: “The College has come to a conclusion that his (Saibaba’s) conduct was unbecoming of a teacher and that he was not fulfilling his obligation as a teacher. The college has arrived at the conclusion that appropriate action must be taken against Dr. Saibaba…”The college asked Saibaba to furnish a response within 21 days failing which governing body would be “free to take such action as may be appropriate .”On behalf of Saibaba, Kumari responded saying that her husband was not in “good health” and “not in a position to read and send a reply within stipulated time.” In the reply, she requested the college not to take any action as the case is not final “until all appellate remedies are exhausted.”In the letter, Kumari also raised the case of former DU professor SAR Geelani who was convicted and then acquitted in the 2001 Parliament attack case. “He was merely suspended despite his arrest in the Parliament Attack case and his employment remained under suspension despite conviction in the trial court,” Kumari said.Nandita Narain, a DU professor associated with the Committee for the Defence and Release of Dr GN Saibaba, said: “The college had been issuing multiple notices to the family. Usually, retributive action is not taken by the college while the judicial process is on.”Saibaba tested positive for Covid in February and is recovering, the family said. “His post-Covid care hasn’t been great and he is still recovering from cough and cold. We will be challenging the termination in court,” said Kumari.In a letter to the college in 2019, Kumari had written, “My husband has three dependents, me, our daughter and his mother, all of whom are completely dependent on his salary to survive including the payment of rent and other expenses.” Saibaba’s mother died last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jailed-du-professor-gn-saibaba-terminated-by-ram-lal-anand-college-101617387964098.html
03-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Record 3.6 million doses administered in one day||India administered at least 3.6 million Covid-19 vaccine doses on Thursday, the highest single-day vaccination number so far, even as the Centre said on Friday that 11 states and Union Territories, marked as “states of grave concern” because of surging infections, had not shown a commensurate increase in enforcement of containment activities.In all, at least 70 million Covid-19 vaccine doses have been administered since the nationwide immunisation drive was launched on January 16.Of the total vaccine doses administered so far, at least 30 million have been given to beneficiaries above 60 years of age, and at least 200,000 in this category have been fully vaccinated.“India has achieved a milestone in its vaccination drive with the highest ever single day figure of more than 36.7 lakh vaccination coverage recorded in the past 24 hours (Thursday). As on Day-76 of the vaccination drive (1st April, 2021), 36,71,242 vaccine doses were given. Out of which, 33,65,597 beneficiaries were vaccinated across 51,215 sessions for 1st dose and 3,05,645 beneficiaries received 2nd dose of vaccine,” the Union health ministry said on Friday.About 10 million individuals between the ages of 45 and 59 with specified comorbidities have received their first vaccine dose, and at least 40,000 of them have received the second dose.Eight states account for 59.58% of the cumulative doses given so far. Maharashtra alone accounts for 9.48% of the total doses administered in the country.Gujarat accounts for 8.96% doses, Rajasthan 8.73%, Uttar Pradesh 8.28%, West Bengal 7.88%, Karnataka 5.74%, Madhya Pradesh 5.43%, and Kerala has administered 5.07% vaccine doses so far, according to official data.The vaccination numbers reported a jump after the vaccinations were opened to all individuals above 45 years of age.The government is looking at ramping up the vaccination process further in the coming weeks, with new cases reporting a steep rise in many states of the country, according to people aware of the developments. The Centre has directed the states to make optimal use of the private sector to deliver vaccines to the eligible individuals as quickly as possible.“There is a huge private sector capable of providing vaccinations that states must make use of; provided they fulfil the criteria required to function as a Covid-19 vaccination centre. It will help optimise the process,” said Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary.According to the health ministry, 11 states currently have been assessed as states of grave concern as these accounted for at least 90% of the Covid-19 cases, and equal percentage of deaths till the end of March. The worst-affected states are Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Haryana, with Maharashtra, Punjab and Chhattisgarh being of particular concern.With new cases seeing a rapid increase, experts in the field say that ramping up vaccination, along with stringent containment measures, increasing Covid-19 testing, prompt contact tracing, and implementing Covid-19-appropriate behaviour is the key to defeat the virus transmission at this stage of the pandemic.“There was a lot of interest in the younger population as it is mobile and aware of the repercussions, but this group was restricted by the requirements for specified co-morbidities, need for getting a certification by a registered medical practitioner. However, it’s also important to sustain this interest and keep coverage consistently high across rural and urban areas. There will be a need to go for community outreach in a big way to cover maximum population,” said Anant Bhan, senior public health expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/record-3-6-million-doses-administered-in-one-day-101617387846081.html
03-04-2021||India||11 states told to increase testing, create more containment zones||The Centre on Friday told 11 states that are seeing a surge in Covid-19 cases to continuously increase testing to bring down positivity rate to 5% or less, ensure that 70% of the tests are the accurate RT-PCR ones, and create more containment zones as parts of an elaborate emergency action plan, at a meeting chaired by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba.The states have also been told to review death rates by hospitals and come up with a strategy to stop late admission in hospitals and non-adherence to the National Clinical Management Protocol. The union government also wants district-wise action plans with a “focus on mapping of cases, reviewing of ward/block wise indicators” and 24X7 Emergency Operations Centre. The government has also advised strict imposition of penalties on defaulters.The meeting concluded that the situation is particularly worrying in Maharashtra, Punjab, and Chattisgarh. It also recommended five “tools”: “vaccination, enhanced testing, strict containment, prompt contact tracing, and enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour.”The meeting, attended by state chief secretaries and director generals of police, senior officials from the health ministry, ICMR, NCDC, and Niti Aayog came against the backdrop of a surge in cases across India. On Friday, India recorded 89,030 cases, the highest since September 19, 2020, according to HT’s dashboard.Maharashtra was told to take up “immediate and high effective measures” to contain active cases and the death toll through a strict clinical management protocol that was shared earlier with all states.In the meeting, union home secretary Ajay Bhalla expressed anguish and observed that even amidst the rapid surge of Covid cases, none of the states/ UTs have shown “commensurate increase in enforcement of containment activities” . Dr V. K. Paul, member Niti Ayog, emphasized that the states follow a protocol for sharing clinical and epidemiological data for detailed study of mutant strains of virus.Several experts are of the view that these so-called variants of concern or VOCs are behind the surge, especially in states such as Maharashtra and Punjab.The 11 states and union territories that attended the meeting were: Maharashtra, Punjab, Karnataka, Kerala, Chhattisgarh, Chandigarh, Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Haryana. Together, the 11, described by Gauba as “states of grave concern” accounted for 90% of Covid cases and 90.5% of deaths in the past 14 days (as on March 31). Some of them have also crossed their early reported peaks in last year.After a detailed and comprehensive review, Gauba told the states that waiting time for test results has to be reduced and Rapid Antigen Tests (RAT) should be used for screening in densely populated areas and places where new cluster of cases are emerging.The cabinet secretary also added that “all symptomatic RAT negatives be mandatorily subjected to RT-PCR tests,” according to an official release. Last month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi too, emphasized on RT-PCR tests over RAT during his meeting with the chief ministers. RT-PCR tests are the gold standard of testing and considered very accurate. Rapid Antigen Tests throw up a lot of false negatives -- identifying infected people as uninfected.The states have been also asked to ensure effective and prompt isolation of the affected in institutional facilities and daily monitoring of patients isolated at home, and the immediate transfer, if required of isolated people who test positive.Emphasizing contact tracing, Gauba and other union secretaries insisted that at least 25 close contacts should be traced for each infected person and that this be done within 72 hours of the person testing positive.The centre has also reiterated the need to define containment zones and micro containment zones to break the chain of transmission.The 11 states and union territories were told to increase the number of isolation beds, oxygen beds, ventilators/ICU beds and planned oxygen supply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/11-states-told-to-increase-testing-create-more-containment-zones-101617387786354.html
03-04-2021||India||Covid vaccine causing deaths? AEFI experts say there’s insufficient evidence||Details of eight recent deaths following a Covid-19 vaccine shot show causality in terms of time, but there isn’t enough evidence that the vaccine itself caused the death, according to details accessed by HT.There were 79 deaths till mid March reported in individuals who took the vaccine. The national committee looking at Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI) against Covid-19 approved the causality assessment for eight of these.HT has reviewed the assessment of eight deaths analysed in March (two more deaths were assessed earlier). “Three of the eight causally assessed cases have been found to have consistent causal association to vaccination, four cases have been found to have inconsistent causal association to vaccination (coincidental) and one case was found unclassifiable. None have been found to be due to the COVID-19 vaccine,” the experts said in their analysis.Of the eight deaths analysed recently, two each were reported from Maharashtra and Karnataka, and one each from Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Telangana, and Madhya Pradesh. The age group of the deceased was between 36 and 61 years; three of them were women and the rest, men.Three deaths were placed in the so-called B1 category by the experts, which means “temporal relationship is consistent but there is insufficient definitive evidence for vaccine causing event”, and four in coincidental category that is described as “underlying or emerging condition(s), or conditions caused by exposure to something other than the vaccine”, according to the panel’s definitions. One of the deaths in the B1 category was that of a 61-year-old man from Thane, Maharashtra, who took the vaccine on January 20, and suffered a sudden cardiac death 11 days after vaccination. He was known to suffer from hypertension and was on medication for the same. Sudden cardiac death is likely to be due to a cardiovascular event, the experts concluded. Covid-19 is known to trigger pro thrombotic state and cardiovascular events, they reasoned.Another death in the B1 category was of a 38-year-old man from Harda in MP, who took the jab on January 28 and also suffered a cardiac arrest. “Young patient without any cardiac risk factors, he had Covid-19 infection two months (8 weeks and 4 days) back. Covid-19 disease is known to trigger pro thrombotic state and cardiovascular events,” the committee concluded.The third B1 case was of a 36-year-old woman from Belagavi in Karnataka, who took the shot on January 22 and suffered a stroke. “Covid disease is known to lead to thrombocytopenia as well as pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic state. Biological plausibility exists for vaccine causing acute stroke with severe thrombocytopenia,” said the experts in their analysis.Among four coincidental cases was that of a 52-year-old woman from Aurangabad in Maharashtra, who took the jab on January 29. “Patient had documented Myocardial infarction (ECG, clinical assessment, post mortem finding of necrotic patch in inferior wall of heart). She had a preceding risk factor of hypertension,” the experts said.A 43-year-old man from Ballari in Karnataka, who took the shot on January 16, also was put in the coincidental death category. The experts said, “... he had risk factors for myocardial infarction including long standing diabetes mellitus and hypertension.”The third case in the category was that of a 52-year-old woman from Mancherial district in Telangana, who took the jab on January 19. “Patient presented with symptoms of fever with cough and difficulty in breathing, blood pressure of 210/120mmHg. Was clinically diagnosed to have accelerated HTN (hypertension) with LVF (left ventricular failure) with pneumonia,” the experts concluded.The fourth case was of a 56-year-old man from Pilibhit in Uttar Pradesh, who was inoculated on January 28. This “was a known case of coronary artery disease...,” the analysis said.The single unclassifiable case was of a man, 43, from Saran in Bihar, who was vaccinated on January 18. “There was little clinical information and no diagnosis was mentioned... Postmortem was not done,” said the experts.A Special group was created to conduct causality assessment of AEFIs following Covid-19 vaccination. The results of causality assessment done by this special group are discussed in the national AEFI committee meeting for final approval.The final analysis is sent to the Union health ministry’s immunisation division that stores data at the central level. The results of assessment for the eight cases were completed on March 9.Of the 68 million doses administered to date, AEFI have been reported in 0.028% of the cases, or 19,250 in all. “The number of people experiencing any kind of side-effect post immunisation is also very small, much less those who suffer side-effects warranting hospitalisation,” said an expert looking into AEFI cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccine-causing-deaths-aefi-experts-say-there-s-insufficient-evidence-101617347882860.html
