EVMs are stored across 75 strong rooms across Tamil Nadu including three in Chennai. “Even if something happens in four out of the 75 strong rooms, it means there is wrongdoing in all the 75 so we cannot be callous,” said Haasan.Sahoo did not respond to calls and messages. However, in a press conference on Monday, he dismissed that EVMs could be tampered with. “No one can hack EVMs. They are like calculators; they cannot be hacked” said Sahoo. “EVMs are under tight security cover. On complaints received from political parties, he said, “We will also monitor vehicles stationed near the counting centres.”Counting of votes will begin from May 2 in Tamil Nadu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-stalin-now-kamal-haasan-complains-of-irregularities-in-evm-strong-rooms-101618943198962.html

20-04-2021||India||UK, US, Hong Kong and Singapore tighten travel curbs on India amid Covid-19 surge||New Zealand, the UK, the US and Singapore are among the countries that have imposed fresh restrictions on travellers from India against the backdrop of a massive spike in Covid-19 infections.On Monday, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised Americans to avoid all travel to India even if they are vaccinated. CDC placed India among “level 4” countries, or those with “very high” levels of Covid-19 cases.“Because of the current situation in India even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants and should avoid all travel to India,” the CDC said.On Monday, India recorded nearly 274,000 new infections and the total number of confirmed cases was more than 15 million. Countries around the world have watched warily as the number of cases has grown, especially in the past two weeks, and high-profile visits and summits have been called off. Also read: ’India gasping for oxygen’ - Rahul Gandhi jabs Centre on Covid-19New Zealand, which has worked assiduously to keep infection rates low, was the first country to act as cases increased in India. On April 8, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced New Zealand was temporarily suspending the entry of travellers from India, including its own citizens, for two weeks.The move followed New Zealand recording 23 new positive cases at its borders, including 17 from India.Singapore’s health ministry announced on Tuesday that Covid-19 border measures will be tightened for travellers from India, who will have to stay at home for an additional seven days after the mandatory 14-day stay at dedicated facilities. The new rule will come into force from Thursday.Singapore will also reduce entry approvals for non-citizens and permanent residents due to the worsening Covid-19 situation in India and the emergence of the new Coronavirus variant, the ministry said.Hours after the cancellation of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India on Monday, India became the 40th country to be included in Britain’s travel “red list”. Most travellers, except British and Irish passport-holders, coming from or transiting through India won’t be allowed to enter the UK from April 23. Many experts believe the UK had held off on including India in the red list because Johnson planned to go ahead with his visit on April 25. Britain’s decision also followed the detection of more than 100 cases of the Indian “double mutant” variant of Covid-19.Pakistan on Monday put a ban on travellers from India for two weeks, citing the spread of the new Coronavirus variant. The National Command and Operation Centre placed India in the “list of Category C countries” and said there would “be a ban on inbound passengers coming from India via air and land routes”.Hong Kong suspended flights from India, Pakistan and the Philippines from Tuesday for two weeks after a mutant Covid-19 variant was detected in the financial hub for the first time. The three countries were classified as “extremely high risk” after multiple cases of travellers carrying the strain into Hong Kong in the past fortnight.Authorities in Hong Kong said on Tuesday that 53 passengers on a flight from New Delhi to the city had tested positive for Covid-19. The passengers flew into Hong Kong on a Vistara flight on April 4.Flights from India continue to be Canada’s top source of international passengers testing positive for Covid-19, Toronto Sun reported on Tuesday. Data from Health Canada showed nearly all of the twice-daily flights between Delhi and Toronto carried passengers infected with the Coronavirus. Thirty of the 106 flights carrying infected passengers into Canada since March 4 originated from Delhi, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-us-hong-kong-and-singapore-tighten-travel-curbs-on-india-amid-covid-19-surge-101618939658885.html

The state grappled with an acute scarcity of vaccines for the second consecutive day, as per the official data. In the last 24 hours, 112,221 tests were conducted in the state and at least nine districts recorded more than 1,000 cases. Ernakulam topped the list with 3,212 cases and many areas in the district were declared containment areas. Active caseload also touched an all-time high of 1,18,673, according to the data released by the state health ministry. With 28 fatalities, the death toll went up to 4978. Despite the grim scenario, the state health ministry claimed there were enough ICU beds and oxygen supply was satisfactory. Though many hospitals were packed to the brim, health officials said the situation was under control. Hospitals were strictly told to admit those in serious condition to ease the pressure. Amid mounting cases, the state reported an acute shortage of Covid-19 vaccine forcing health authorities to shut many vaccination centres. In capital city Thiruvananthapuram, out of 150 centres, only 26 operated while in Ernakulam, one of the worst-affected districts, only two dozen centres functioned. Health authorities said the public was informed about the shortage but several beneficiaries were caught unaware and crowded centres. The state government sent another SOS to the Union health ministry on Tuesday. Last week also it wrote to the ministry seeking 50 lakh doses of the vaccine. A senior health ministry official said by Wednesday the state will be getting 10 lakh vials that will help tide over the present shortage. Mass vaccination campaign launched by the government was also affected due to the paucity of doses. Though a large number of vaccines were wasted by some states, Kerala reported almost nil wastage. Tamil Nadu topped the list with 12% followed by Haryana at 9.74%, as per the Union health ministry data. As Covid-19 cases galloped, the state has strengthened containment measures. Night curfew will be in force from Tuesday night for two weeks. RT-PCR test was made mandatory for all domestic travellers and those coming from abroad. On Monday, the government decided to hold Thrissur Pooram, the mother of all temple festivals, sans spectators. Meanwhile, state health minister KK Shailaja entered into quarantine after her son and daughter-in-law tested positive for the virus. She said she will remain in quarantine for the next two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/situation-grim-as-kerala-reports-highest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases-101618935218781.html

In October 2018, a 737 Max plane operated by Lion Air crashed in Indonesia killing 180 people.On the 737 Max plane, the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency expressed concerns about the requirements of pilot training as well as on malfunction of the “angle of attack” system which triggered an anti-stall system linked to the aforementioned two crashes.“This order applies to all persons operating the Boeing Company Model 737-8 and Boeing Company Model 737-9 airplanes in the territory of Republic of India, and to Indian/ foreign operators permitted by India to conduct flights with Boeing Company Model 737-8 and Boeing Company Model 737-9 airplanes,” the DGCA said.The regulator said the ban imposed on March 13, 2019, would not apply to foreign-registered 737 Max plane that wants to overfly “the Indian airspace”. However, such an aircraft must have permissions from the “regulatory authority of the state of registry” as well as the DGCA.On March 13, 2019, budget carrier SpiceJet had to ground 12 Max planes, forcing it to cancel a significant number of flights on that day as well as on the next day. Jet Airways also had five Max planes in its fleet but they were already grounded as due to non-payment of dues to lessors. A month later, the full-service carrier had shut down its operations due to a lack of funds.In March 2019, the 737 Max plane was banned by the regulators of several countries, including India. “This Order supersedes the Order No. DGCA-15018(21)/9/2018-DAS dated 13th March 2019, regarding operation of Boeing 737 Max aircraft,” the DGCA order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-allows-banned-boeing-737-max-to-fly-over-india-101618930778255.html

Of them, 202 families went to Bongofapara and the rest went to Haduklau on Monday,” said Kanchanpur sub divisional magistrate Chandni Chandran. More families are expected to move to their newly-allotted permanent residences in the second batch on Thursday, she added.This day was made possible due to the breakthrough agreement signed last January between the Union home ministry, governments of Tripura and Mizoram and the Bru migrants, who remained in Tripura after repatriation of over 5,000 community members in nine phases since 2009.The agreement also assigned ₹600 crore for the community’s resettlement.The agreement last year led to several protests by few local organizations alleging it would effect a change in the demography of the 15 areas identified in the six districts of Tripura for the community’s resettlement. Two persons, including a fireman, were killed and 20 others were injured in the clashes.As the new chapter in their lives begin, the community members have been enrolled for Aadhar making them eligible to receive benefits under different schemes, including those announced for their resettlement. All the families were being given a temporary house with provision for water and ration supplies.The Brus fled from Mizoram after clashes with the Mizo tribe in the state and are currently spread across Tripura, Mizoram and parts of southern Assam. Also known as Reangs in the state, they are one of the 19 scheduled tribes of Tripura and have their own language and dialect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bru-migrants-move-to-permanent-homes-in-tripura-23-yrs-after-exiting-mizoram-101618926098171.html

20-04-2021||India||Immediate implementation of order suspending oxygen to industries: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed immediate implementation of order to suspend oxygen to industries. Amid a spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in several states, the Centre had asked all states on Sunday to prohibit the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except for those that fall in the exempted category from April 22. Oxygen is an important element used in the treatment of certain medical conditions which arise due to the Covid-19 infection.“Industries can wait. Patients cannot. Human lives are at stake,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said to the central government.The direction came during the hearing of a petition, related to Covid-19 tests, that the high court revived on April 19 amid rise in Covid-19 cases.In its decision taken on Sunday, the Centre said that the ban was crucial as there was an increase in demand for medical oxygen in several states like Maharashtra and Delhi among others, which have been consistently reporting an increase in Covid-19 cases.“Keeping in view the rapid rise in Covid cases and resultant rapid demand for medical oxygen, particularly in high-burden states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, etc, EG-II has reviewed the supply of oxygen for industrial use in order to divert the same to meet the rising demand for medical oxygen in the country and save precious lives,” Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote in a letter to all chief secretaries on Sunday.The government had then also given a break-up of the shares that will be allotted to states which face the shortage of oxygen under which Maharashtra was allotted 1,646 metric tonnes of oxygen, followed by Uttar Pradesh which was given 752 metric tonnes and Delhi which was allotted 378 metric tonnes.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also voiced concern over a shortage in supply of oxygen in the national capital on Sunday."Del facing acute shortage of oxygen. In view of sharply increasing cases, Del needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi’s quota has been diverted to other states. OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY IN DEL," Kejriwal wrote in a tweet.Chief minister Kejriwal also wrote to Union commerce & industries minister Piyush Goyal, requesting him to ensure uninterrupted supply of 700MT of oxygen on daily basis & restoration of supply of 140MT of oxygen by INOX.Delhi on Sunday recorded its biggest jump in daily Covid-19 cases with 25,462 fresh infections logged. The national capital is under six-day lockdown which began on Monday, following a weekend curfew imposed on Friday night, aimed at checking the spread of the viral disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-says-immediate-implementation-of-order-to-suspend-oxygen-to-industries-101618922820004.html

We have also increased the number of oxygen beds which has led to higher consumption of medical oxygen,” he further added.The chief minister’s remarks came after the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Gujarat chapter, on Tuesday, suggested to the Gujarat high court that a two-week lockdown should be implemented to check the transmission of Covid-19 in the state, news agency PTI reported.Also read | With 11,403 new Covid-19 cases, Gujarat logs record one-day spike“The government should completely ban all kinds of gatherings, be it social, political or religious. If possible, the government should impose a total lockdown for 14 days. If it is not possible, then put severe restrictions on activities,” PTI quoted IMA’s Gujarat chapter president Dr Devendra Patel as saying to the high court bench.To avoid people rushing for hospital beds between hospitals, Dr Patel also suggested that the state government should create a centralised system which has details about availability of beds for Covid-19 patients, PTI reported.In another instance on Tuesday, the HC also questioned the Gujarat government about its submission on the number of beds occupied in the state for Covid-19. The government said that 55,783 beds were occupied out of the 79,944 in the state and the remaining were unoccupied, PTI reported.“Complaints are coming, maybe you are also receiving that patients are not being admitted because there is no vacancy in hospitals. Beds are not available. The figures shared by you suggest that even designated hospitals have vacant beds,” the bench said, PTI reported. “(If that is true) then why are people running around, finding sources and recommendations for getting hospitals beds and treatment,” the bench further asked.Gujarat on Monday detected 11,403 new infections of the coronavirus disease, its highest surge in a 24-hour time span and 117 patients succumbed to the disease in the state.

It will peak in mid-May or by the end of May and then suddenly there will be a dip,” Dr Tickoo said."The way it has gone up, the same way it will go down," he added. But till then, said Dr Tickoo, people will have to be careful and follow all Covid-19 protocols.He also said that more and more younger people are getting infected with Covid-19 this time. "They are the ones who go for work, who take public transport, and have been part of celebrations and going on holidays. They are the ones who have a kind of attitude that nothing will happen to them," said the doctor.He also highlighted the fact that the infection is getting registered early. "Earlier, it used to be in 6-7 days, but in this wave, my personal observation is that the lungs are getting affected in 4-5 days," said Dr Tickoo.The Union health ministry said on Tuesday that 10 states, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, account for 77.67 per cent of the new Covid-19 infections reported in a day.

20-04-2021||India||Vidurashwatha Massacre, the Forgotten Jallianwala Bagh of South India||The year was 1938 and India’s freedom struggle was at its peak. On the morning of April 25, a group of villages led by leaders of the Indian National Congress (INC) had gathered at an open ground in Vidurashwatha village, close to the now Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border, in Chikkballapur district, to hoist the national flag. Defying prohibitory orders, just as they were proceeding to hoist the flag, police opened fire, killing 32 people and injuring more than 100 others. At least 90 rounds of ammunition was fired by the police that morning.Due to its resemblance to the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Vidurashwatha later came to be known as the Jallianwala Bagh of the South. Decades later, the village is now a forgotten chapter in the history of the country’s freedom struggle.Gangadhara Murthy, a retired professor and author of a book ‘The forgotten Jallianwala Bagh of South India’ said the firing led to the Mirza-Patel pact, an agreement between then Diwan of Mysore Mirza Ismail and Indian statesman Vallabhbhai Patel, which resulted in the formation of the first government with the participation of the people in Mysore state.“Mahatma Gandhi himself took note of the incident and deputed senior Congress leaders Sardar Patel and Acharya Kriplani to take stock of the situation. It is an important landmark in our history,” he said.What led to the firing was a decision by the authorities not to allow the hoisting of the national flag (swaraj India flag). In 1930, the INC, in an attempt to make a determined effort towards freedom, had decided to hoist the flag in Mysore state.The INC leaders initially tried to hoist the flag during a session of the Mysore Congress at Shivpurathat year. After the leaders were arrested for defying government orders, the party decided to hold Dhwaja Satyagraha (flag satyagraha) across the state.It was the call for this protest that led to a large gathering at Vidurashwatha. “Since they were unable to hoist the flag at Shivapura, the leaders decided to do the same in this village at all cost. They knew that the police would crackdown (against them), so between April 22 and 24, they did not hoist any flag or gather a large crowd. Their plan was to hoist the flag when the police put their guard down,” Murthy said.On April 25 at 10.30 am, several people, mostly from villages around Vidurashwatha, began gathering at the ground.“It was an open ground which had a river at one end and a temple on the other. The plan of the leaders was that if the police resorted to lathi charge, they would cross the river. Across the river was Nizam’s state of Hyderabad and the police didn’t have any jurisdiction (there). But this didn’t go as per plan,” Murthy explained.Eighty-five-year-old Narsimhaiah was one of the people Murthy interviewed that day who managed to escape unhurt. “As the crowd grew bigger, around afternoon, some minor face-offs between the police and protesters erupted. Before the crowd could react, according to Naraishaiah, police opened fire. He ran in the hope that the bullets would not find him,” Murthy said.At least 96 rounds were fired by the police that day, killing 32 people. “As per the accounts from that day, it was a police sub-inspector, who was then transferred from Bengaluru, who led the firing. A man was shot dead. Soon, other policemen, including the then superintendent of police, rained bullets on the protesters,” Murthy added.The forest in Vidurashwatha turned into a cemetery in the days that followed.Gandhi, who visited Wardha on learning about the firing, released a statement on April 29, part of which read: “the sacrifices of the 32 people who died in Vidurashwatha in an attempt to achieve independence through non-violence are not in vain.”While the cops involved in the firing got a clean chit, the government claimed only 10 people lost their lives. This led to widespread agitation across Mysore state, prompting Gandhi to send Patel and Kriplani to Mysore to take stock of the situation.“After visiting several villages around Vidurashwatha, they concluded that 32 people were killed in the firing,” he said.The anger against the government was used by the Congress leaders to bring changes in the way Mysore was administered. They demanded that their leaders should get participation in governance, which led to the famous Mirza-Patel pact.“As per the pact, all restrictions on hoisting the flags were lifted, seven members of the Congress were incorporated in the Reforms Committee to suggest new norms of governance and the leaders were allowed to attend the assembly meeting,” Murthy said.At the spot of the massacre now stands a memorial which gets occasional visitors.Even though 32 lives were lost that day, Vidurashwatha never got its due in history, Murthy, who maintains the memorial, said. “We want to keep telling the story as long as we can so that the Jallianwala Bagh of South India is not forgotten by the next generations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jallianwala-bagh-of-the-south-vidurashwatha-massacre-a-forgotten-chapter-in-the-history-of-country-s-freedom-movement-101618915177005.html

He ruled out a complete lockdown and said the situation will be reviewed in a week. He was speaking at Shillong on Monday.The CM said while it took 114 days for Covid-19 cases to touch the 665 cases mark during the first wave last year, during the second wave this year, close to 680 cases were reported in less than a month.“The rise of cases is six times higher this time compared to the last time. Therefore, the situation is serious and there are a lot of concerns.

Represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, the Uttar Pradesh government mentioned the matter before the Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde, to which the top court agreed to hear the case.

A day later on Tuesday, the grim record was surpassed with 4,761 new infections, further justifying the new restrictions on operation of schools, interstate transport and public gatherings announced a day earlier, when a decision to augment the state’s patient-handling capacity was also taken, said officials“It is seen that the number of Covid-19 cases are showing an increasing trend in the state. Therefore, the state government has decided to impose weekend shutdown in all urban areas across the state from April 24,” said special relief commissioner Pradip Jena on Monday.Currently, a weekend shutdown is being enforced in urban areas of 10 districts including Sundargarh, bordering Chhattisgarh. Sundargarh district reported 673 positive cases on Tuesday, a few less than the 722 registered on Monday, when the test positivity rate (TPR) in the district touched 26.8. The number of cases in Khurda however shot up drastically to 820 on Tuesday from the 587 recorded on Monday.The surge in cases was being fuelled by a statewide TPR of 14.71 recorded on Tuesday, up from 12.28 on Monday, and also the reproductive number or R0 of 2.39. TPR is the ratio of tests performed to cases confirmed and the R0 or the reproductive number is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person. For R0 > 1, the number infected is likely to increase, and for R0 < 1, transmission is likely to die out.The health authorities say the situation is very unpredictable. “We initially thought the peak of the second wave in Odisha would come by April 25. But now, it seems no one can predict for sure. None of the health experts know when the peak will come. Today the cases surged to more than 4,500, tomorrow it can go beyond 5,500. We just don’t know how the double mutant strain (of the virus) is behaving,” said PK Mohapatra, additional chief secretary (health) of Odisha.The state government on Monday stopped interstate bus movements. Intrastate transport is allowed as long as the number of passengers doesn’t exceed the seating capacity and everyone wears masks, according to an official statement. For weddings, organisers have been told to submit a list of no more than 50 invitees to local administration 24 hours in advance. The list has to be displayed at the marriage venue as well, the statement said.In schools, 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff have been permitted to perform important functions such as admissions, distribution of books, monitoring of mid day meal programmes etc.On the positive side, there was no scarcity of Covid-19 beds in hospitals in the state. Director of public health Niranjan Mishra said only 17.43% of the total Covid-19 beds, including ICUs and ventilators, were occupied till now in both government and private healthcare facilities in the state.Of the 24,578 active cases, 2,059 patients were currently under treatment in various hospitals including 945 in government healthcare facilities. 424 patients were in ICUs and 59 were on ventilator support, according to the daily Covid-19 bulletin released by the state.Currently, 7,432 general Covid-19 beds are lying vacant in Odisha including 3,887 in private and 3,545 in government hospitals. Similarly, 1,594 ICU beds including 1,174 in private and 420 in government hospitals and 723 ventilators including 562 in private and 161 in government hospitals are currently unused.Mishra said the number of beds for Covid-19 patients is being increased up to five times compared to last year. In Bhubaneswar, more private hospitals are being added to the list of Covid-19 hospitals. Nilachal and hi-tech Covid-19 hospitals become operational on Monday and Blue Wheel will become operational from Tuesday. Sparsh and KIMS Covid-19 hospitals too will soon start operations, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-orders-weekend-shutdowns-in-urban-areas-amid-all-time-high-covid-surge-101618902277430.html

"We believe in constructive cooperation and we will continue to work for the safety of our people, no matter what you say," it added.On Sunday, Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he offered his advice on the Covid-19 situation in the country. He also listed out five suggestions and urged the Centre to expand the vaccination drive to people beyond the age of 45. It is to be noted that the Centre has opened the vaccination drive to all above 18 years of age on Sunday. This will come into effect from May 1.Singh also asked the Centre to place "enough" vaccine orders in advance and retain 10 per cent for distribution based on emergency needs. "Other than that, states should have a clear signal of likely availability so that they can plan their roll out," he wrote in the letter.The letter triggered a sharp response from the Union health minister as he lashed out at the Congress leader and told Singh to ask his party workers to follow the same advice in their own respective states. "History will be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation and valuable advice was followed by his party leaders as well. "It is saddening, Dr Singh, that while you very well understand the importance of vaccination as an important method of fighting the COVID-19 battle, people in responsible positions in your party as well as in the state governments formed by your party do not seem to share your view," Harsh Vardhan said.India has been reporting a frightening spike in Covid-19 cases over the past few weeks. For the last five consecutive days, the daily number of cases has surged to above 200,000 and it is still continuing on the upward trajectory. As of Tuesday morning, the country has 15,321,089 cases of the coronavirus disease as it added 259,170 fresh infections in the last 24-hours.

Responding to the order, UP additional chief secretary (information), Navneet Sehgal said strict curbs are necessary to control the spread of the virus and that the government has taken several steps in that direction. He, however, said that protecting livelihoods is equally important to save lives, adding that a complete lockdown in these cities was not necessary for now since people are "automatically closing many places".The total number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Uttar Pradesh currently stands at 879,831, as per the official tally provided by the state government at 10:45pm on Monday. Of these, 208,523 are active cases while the statewide death toll has almost touched 10,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-moves-sc-against-allahabad-hc-order-imposing-covid-19-curbs-in-5-cities-101618899165292.html

Modi said the Centre has been working hard from over a year to ensure that maximum numbers of people are able to get the vaccine in the shortest possible of time.“India is vaccinating people at world record pace and we will continue this with even greater momentum,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said during the meeting where the decision to vaccinate all adults in the country was taken.ALSO READ: What changes from May 1 in Covid-19 vaccination drive? FAQs answeredLast week, Poonawalla had urged the United States to lift export ban from critical raw materials required for the production of vaccines against the coronavirus disease.The long list of raw materials that SII imports from the US include filters, bags, and adjuvant. Large, sterile plastic bags are used to grow vaccine cells. An adjuvant is a substance that is used to increase the efficacy of a vaccine and helps the immune system generate antibodies.The United States in February invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the power to control the distribution of products, to curb the export of raw materials critical for vaccine production.India recently approved Russian made Sputnik V and is also planning to approve vaccines made by Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.ALSO READ: India to waive import duty on Covid-19 vaccinesIndia set the milestone of vaccinating more than 126 million people in a period of 92 days.

Besides seeking a ban on the movie -- “Nyay: The Justice”, "Suicide or Murder: A star was lost" and “Shashank”, his father Krishna Kishore Singh has also sought an injunction against any other film, publication, caricature, etc based on the actor's life.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri issued the notice on a suit by Singh contending that any publication, production, or depiction of the private life of the late actor is a blatant and willful breach of the fundamental right to privacy and it cannot be undertaken without the prior approval of his legal heir.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Rajput’s father, told the court that the movie in question has been launched in a planned and orchestrated manner by close confidants of the alleged accused in case of abetment of suicide to influence a pending investigation, witness and other officials.The plea added that releasing any movie depicting Rajput's personal life will influence the witness in the cases and also change the public perception. Rajput’s father has said that many people took the death of his son as an "opportunity to get fame by developing different theories/stories", at the cost of his and his family’s reputation.After learning about movies based on the late actor, like “Nyay: The Justice”, "Suicide or Murder: A star was lost" and “Shashank”, the actor’s father said that he apprehends that various plays, movies, web series, books, interviews or other material may be published which would harm the reputation of Sushant Singh Rajput and his family."Thus, the publication of movie depicting his personal life, name/images/caricature and misappropriating his personality in a distorted manner, without the consent of the plaintiff, would influence the witness of the case and also would change public perception and the case is at a very nascent stage even the investigation has not been completed," the plea stated.Advocate Akshay Dev, another counsel for Rajput's father said, that they are seeking an injunction against any filmmaker or against the publication of any book from putting out anything since that is likely to influence the ongoing investigation.The matter would be now heard on May 24.Singh was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra in June last year following which the Mumbai Police conducted a probe and said that he died by suicide. The case was later handed over to the Central Investigation Bureau (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) were also roped in to investigate the money laundering and drugs angle in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-movie-delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-makers-on-plea-by-actor-s-father-seeking-ban-101618899801011.html

20-04-2021||India||Can’t give bail just because he is rich, says SC on plea of Arsalan scion||The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a petition by Biryani restaurant chain Arsalan owner, Akhtar Parwez, seeking the release of his son on bail in a 2019 hit-and-run case, saying the accused cannot expect a concession only because he is rich.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta rejected the bail plea after underlining that the accused, Raghib, was driving his Jaguar SUV at a speed of 130-135 km/hour on August 16, 2019, when he smashed into a Mercedes-Benz and led to the death of two Bangladeshis standing nearby.“Is it not true that you were driving at a speed of more than 130 km/hour? Is it not true that you had a history of violating traffic signals 48 times during the seven months prior to this incident? You want a concession only because you are rich. But we will not do that,” the bench told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Arsalan’s owner.Parwez has been representing his son during the trial, claiming Raghib suffers from a psychological disorder and that he is not capable of facing the trial because of his mental illness.The Calcutta high court on April 13 ordered Raghib to stand trial after a board of National Institute of Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, said that his psychological conditions were not such that he could not face it.Relying on this report, the high court cancelled Raghib’s interim bail and directed him to surrender by April 20, failing which he will be arrested. The high court noted that Raghib “after committing the ghastly incident... fled to a foreign country (Dubai).”Before the top court, Sibal cited Raghib’s mental conditions and added he could not understand the trial procedures and that should be allowed to remain on bail. The senior counsel added that Raghib was incarcerated for eight months after his arrest in 2019 and that no purpose would be served to send him back to jail after the charge sheet has been filed.But the bench remained unmoved: “Do you mean to say we should release everyone where a charge sheet has been filed? This is always a case-by-case basis. It also depends on the seriousness of the crime. It cannot be that in every case where a charge sheet has been filed, we should give bail to everyone. Is it not correct that you tried to escape and made someone else a scapegoat?”The court pointed out that claims regarding insanity and mental illness have not been established so far and that an expert committee in fact gave a contradictory opinion. “You take this defence at the trial. We cannot pass any comment on this,” it told Sibal.Initially, Arsalan Parvez, Raghib’s younger brother, confessed to having been at the wheel at the time of the accident.The family claimed Raghib was in Australia for higher studies. But after analysing the data recorder of the Jaguar, police got the phone number of the person who was last at the wheel. From the phone number’s WhatsApp account, police found Raghib’s photograph. A subsequent scan of CCTV cameras also showed Raghib taking out the Jaguar from his home.Raghib, who had fled to Dubai after the incident, returned to Kolkata two days later and was arrested from a nursing home where he had got admitted after his return.In April last year, Raghib was given interim bail by the high court after a medical report said he required psychological help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-concession-because-he-is-rich-says-sc-while-rejecting-bail-plea-101618892377031.html

The Centre on Monday opened up the vaccination for everyone above 18 from May 1.A state unit chief said Nadda has set a target of “mera booth, corona mukt [my booth, corona free]” for them and identified a three-pronged approach. “First, to ensure compliance with Covid protocol by distributing masks and sanitisers and ensuring there is no vaccine hesitancy.”The state units have been asked to carry out special programmes in the rural areas to encourage vaccination. “We have noticed vaccine hesitancy in rural areas particularly. For instance, if we have a capacity for 50 lakh [five million] doses, only 30-35 lakh [three to 3.5 million] people show up. [The] places where we carried out special drives, the numbers went up. So, this will be scaled up,” said the person quoted above.Also Read | BJP, TMC scale down campaigns amid spikeTwo other functionaries, who attended his virtual meeting with state functionaries on Sunday, said Nadda underlined the need to set up helplines in every district to facilitate hospital admissions and help those under home quarantine with the supply of essentials.“...[Nadda] said the cadre must resume relief work to help people in need. When the lockdown was first announced last year, the cadre had taken on the responsibility of providing food and medicines to people in need. Now as the cases of Covid 19 are steadily going up, he said there is a need to help people connect with doctors and get access to healthcare,” said the state unit chief quoted above.The functionaries were specifically asked not to hoard or procure medicines, but to help people with information on their availability and in case of need to ferry them to hospitals.“He explained that it is the government’s job to procure medicines such as Remdesivir that is in high demand. He said party functionaries should not try to procure the drug as it could be construed as hoarding. They can, however, help people with information,” said a second functionary.The Maharashtra government last week accused the BJP of trying to procure Remdesivir without informing it. The BJP maintained it was procuring the drug for the state government for further supply.In March last year, Nadda tasked the party cadre to feed over 50 million people during the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-hoard-medicines-resume-help-nadda-to-bjp-workers-101618888956066.html

20-04-2021||India||Deep Sidhu sent to jail for 14 days in R-Day case||A Delhi court on Monday dismissed a plea by the city police seeking four days custody for Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu in connection with a case registered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in the damage caused to the Red Fort during a tractor rally by farmers on the Republic Day, and instead sent him to jail for 14 days.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gajendra Singh Nagar turned down the police remand for Sidhu’s custodial interrogation, saying there was no sufficient ground to allow the custody.In the current case, Sidhu was arrested on Saturday, hours after he was granted bail in connection with another case related to the violence on Republic Day. A tractor rally taken out by farmers protesting against the three contentious farm bills descended into chaos after the protestes broke police barricades and clashed with the cops at several places including Red Fort.Also read: CBI to probe ₹207 crore alleged ‘scam’ in DUSIBThe Delhi Police arrested Sidhu on February 9 for his alleged involvement in the January 26 events. The agency told the court that Sidhu was the “main instigator” and one of the rioters, a charge that he has denied. He was granted bail in this case on Friday.On Monday, public prosecutor Rajiv Kamboj told the court that they were seeking four days police custody for Sidhu, saying investigation was pending.Sidhu’s counsel Abhishek Gupta and Jasdeep Dhillon said that both the FIRs were registered on similar allegations, and since Sidhu had already been interrogated by the police in the matter, there was no need for fresh police remand now.Sidhu also addressed the judge and said that he has been cooperating with the investigation and will continue doing that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deep-sidhu-sent-to-jail-for-14-days-in-r-day-case-101618878998700.html

20-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||No one should be writing letters (or, for that matter, columns, other than people whose job it is to) in the midst of the pandemic.There’s work to be done, and because such is the nature of governance — the others can volunteer, and do good, if they want to, but are unlikely to have as much impact as the State — much of it will have to be done by those in power, in the Centre and the states.I’m sure some of these are already being done, but since epistolary duties can be distracting, here is a quick list of what needs doing — right now. This is important not just to help India tide over this wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic, but to also prepare it for the next. That a lot of what follows wasn’t done (or wasn’t done at scale) is evident from the crisis on our hands. Daily cases are nearing 300,000. Only one country, the US, has seen more, and that too on only one day. We look set to beat the record. Deaths are already at record highs (with the exception of one day last June when both Delhi and Maharashtra deemed it fit to get their death numbers in order). Hindustan Times has reported from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (bit.ly/3eujgCf; bit.ly/2REevOs) that there is a clear disconnect between the fatalities claimed by the state (and therefore, those on the HT dashboard) and the numbers being reported by local crematoriums and graveyards. Everything is in short supply — oxygen, ICU beds, and ambulances. I’m not mentioning Remdesivir, because despite India’s obsession with it, there is really no evidence proving its effectiveness or that of plasma (the research in this case is quite clear: it doesn’t work for Covid-19).Provoked by a piece in Scroll.in that pointed out that a plan to install 162 oxygen plants in district hospitals in India — something that would have definitely helped at a time like this — wasn’t going to script (https://scroll.in/article/992537/india-is-running-out-of-oxygen-covid-19-patients-are-dying-because-the-government-wasted-time), the health ministry pointed out that 33 are ready, and that another 47 will be ready by the end of May (with 26 of these being completed by the end of April). That’s just around half the planned number. The story refers to an announcement made last week by the government about a plan to set up another 100 oxygen plants. Even as everyone comes together to address the current oxygen shortage, it is important to keep an eye on this. India needs those oxygen plants.The other thing it desperately needs to do is sequence more viral genomes. Among the burning topics of discussion in the international scientific community right now is the nature of behaviour of the strain of the virus with the double mutation (B.1.617) that was first identified in India. Another topic of discussion is either the rampant gaming of RT-PCR tests by passengers flying out of India or the poor quality of Indian RT-PCR tests. Hong Kong, on Monday, banned flights from India till May 3 after a large number of passengers on a flight from Mumbai tested positive. If India doesn’t address both issues immediately, it may face similar bans from other countries. Canada, for instance, is reporting similar problems with passengers from India.Also read: Capital back in lockdownAnd finally, with cases surging, India has to take a hard call on vaccines. At least 90% of those eligible for their second shots of the vaccine between now and May 31 have been administered Covishield. There’s enough scientific evidence to show that: one, even one dose gives people a much better chance at fighting off severe infections; and two, a three-month gap between the first and second dose of Covishield does not reduce the vaccine’s efficacy. According to HT’s calculations, this number is 71.3 million. In addition, assuming an aggressive target of 4 million vaccinations a day (the government, till a few weeks ago, was speaking about 5 million, but that looks unlikely), 100.7 million people will get their first doses in this period (April 20-May 31). That will take the total number of people who have received at least once dose of vaccine in India to 278.4 million by the end of May.The government’s move to open up supply of vaccines, and expand the eligibility criteria to everyone over the age of 18 years (long delayed, but it came finally on Monday) from May 1 will help meet this target, perhaps even exceed it. At that number, the results, in terms of a fall in infections (or, at the least, hospitalisations), will start making themselves evident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618872038311.html
20-04-2021||India||Can’t continue to obstruct others, SC tells farm leaders||The Supreme Court on Monday called upon the farm leaders to reflect on whether their protests over three contentious agricultural laws should continue to obstruct others’ right to commute freely on public roads.A bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, took a grim view of the continuing road blockades by thousands of farmers who have camped at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh since November last year in protest against the central laws, adding to commuters’ travel times in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR).“Just because you are not in sync with a particular policy that doesn’t mean that the others should suffer and you obstruct their way. You want to create a village; do it by all means, but don’t obstruct others,” said the bench, which included justice Hemant Gupta.The top court was hearing a petition by a single mother, complaining that it has been taking her almost two hours, instead of 20 minutes, to travel from Noida to Delhi due to frequent blockades and protests. The court on March 26 issued notices to the Centre and Delhi Police “to ensure that the road area is kept clear so that the passage from one place to the other is not affected”.On Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union government and Delhi Police, said that although the priority has been shifted due to the sudden surge in Covid cases, the authorities were trying their best to remove blockades and make the commute in Delhi-NCR smooth.As Mehta sought adjournment of the hearing by two weeks owing to the focus on Covid management, justice Kaul retorted: “We will give you time. But we should also tell you what our concern is. People may have a right (to protest) but what concerns us is the tendency to block roads which impacts a large section of the society.”The bench added that it was also not sure if crowding was a good idea at a time like these when corona infections have seen a sudden spurt. To this, the S-G replied that he was also of the view that protesters should not crowd.“In other places we may not have this extent of the problem,” said justice Kaul, as the bench adjourned the hearing of the matter to May 7.Addressing a monthly mahapanchayat at the Delhi-Ghazipur border on Saturday, Bharatiya Kisan Union national president Naresh Tikait declared that farmers will not end the protest until the farm laws are not repealed.The central government claims that the laws are part of the long-pending reforms in the agriculture sector. The farmers’ groups led by BKU, however, complain that it will put them at the mercy of corporates, resulting into an impasse over the two sides since November last.On April 9, too, the bench emphasised that protesters cannot block roads and continually inconvenience the public while regretting that despite several judicial pronouncements on keeping public roads free, the situation did not seem to improve.“This is a single mother before us who has to face many problems because of blocked roads,” the court had then said, asking the S-G to resolve the issue “politically or administratively or judicially”.Petitioner Monicca Agarwaal, who works in an information technology firm, has stated in her petition that she needs to commute between Delhi and Noida for work, but said the travel has become a “nightmare” for her.She rued that various directions passed by the top court in several cases, including the Shaheen Bagh protest matter, to keep public roads clear, have not been followed. Her plea added that the petitioner being a single mother with medical issues was facing harrowing time on account of failure of the authorities in complying with the Supreme Court’s orders.Even though there was no specific response to the SC observation by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the farmer unions collective announced a “resistance week” beginning Tuesday and invited more farmers to reach the protest site with the slogan “phir Dilli chalo”.” Because it is the harvesting season, many farmers had returned to villages. There are indications that the government is plotting to end the peasant movement on the pretext of the Covid pandemic. There have been several reports in the media that as soon as the state assembly elections are over, the Haryana government and the Centre have planned to attack the protest sites and evacuate them,” SKM said in a statement .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-continue-to-obstruct-others-sc-tells-farm-leaders-101618870563787.html

Doctors also shared their personal experiences,” said one of the doctors who attended the meeting.Modi also discussed the progress in Covid-19 vaccinations with the doctors.“Last year, during the same time, it was due to our doctors’ hard work and the nation’s strategy that we were able to control the coronavirus wave. Now that the country is facing the second wave of coronavirus, all the doctors, our frontline workers are confronting the pandemic with full force, and are saving the lives of millions of people,” an official statement quoted the Prime Minister as saying.He said that vaccination was the biggest weapon in the fight against Covid-19, and urged the doctors to encourage more and more patients to get vaccinated, and help allay unfounded fears related to vaccines. “…it is very important that people do not become a victim of panic. For this, along with proper treatment, emphasis must also be on counselling of patients admitted in hospitals...,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-meets-pharma-firms-and-doctors-101618867461429.html

20-04-2021||India||Ensure supply of oxygen, Remdesivir: Madhya Pradesh HC||The Madhya Pradesh high court on Monday asked the state government to ensure continuous and regular supply of life-saving drugs, including medical oxygen and Remdesivir used in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.Hearing five petitions alleging failure of the state government in dealing with the surge in Covid-19 cases, a bench comprising Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and justice Atul Sreedharan directed the government to deal with the existing crises.“The state government may regulate the supply of Remdesivir injections and other lifesaving drugs, but the process adopted for this purpose should be hassle-free and should not be cumbersome so as to ensure the supply of the drug in such a way that the time limit from requisition by the treating doctors and supply of medicines does not exceed an hour,” said the order.“The state government should consider increasing the per day testing number of Covid infected persons for their early detection so as to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. Test reports should be provided to concerned patients positively within 36 hours from the time of collection of the sample,” said the order.It further urged the central government to “consider stepping in to ensure an increase in the production of Remdesivir and till such time it is not done, it should consider procuring Remdesivir by importing it...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-supply-of-oxygen-remdesivir-madhya-pradesh-hc-101618863341951.html
20-04-2021||India||Compensation pending, SC adjourns Italy marines case||The Supreme Court on Monday adjourned to next week a plea by the central government to close all proceedings in India against the Italian marines who killed two fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde took note of a submission by the government’s lawyer Rajat Nair that they were yet to receive the compensation amount from the Italian government. “We will deposit the money in this court within 24 hours of receiving it from the Italian counterpart. Although the process of transferring the money has been initiated, we are yet to receive it,” Nair told the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.At this, the bench recalled that it was always of the opinion that the case should be listed on a later date but it was the government which was in a hurry to have a hearing as soon as possible. On April 9, the court had asked Italy to deposit ₹10 crore with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) as agreed upon by the Italian government for disbursal to the families of the slain fishermen and the injured boat owner. While the bench contemplated deferring the matter for 15 days to complete these formalities, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre, asked for an “earliest possible date” since the MEA would deposit the money in the court registry within three days of receiving it.Amused by the zeal of the government for the closure of proceedings against the two marines before the top court and a criminal trial pending before a special court in Delhi, the Supreme Court then remarked that it expected the government to act with the same speed in other cases too.“We will like it if you act with the same speed in other matters too. Here, (in this case) you are asking for three days. Normally, you ask at least for two weeks or four weeks’ time,” CJI Bobde had commented.The court was dealing with an application by the Centre filed in July 2020 wherein it said that all proceedings in India against the two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, should be closed since the Union government has accepted the May 2020 decision of the international arbitral tribunal. The tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity and hence only Italy could try them whereas India was entitled to compensation.Subsequently, during a hearing in August 2020, the bench had clarified that it would close the proceedings only after the families of the victims were heard and given “adequate” compensation, after it noted that the victims’ families were not parties to the case before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/compensation-pending-sc-adjourns-italy-marines-case-101618863040518.html
20-04-2021||India||Night curfew, tightened curbs as Covid-19 rages across country||Several states across India clamped stricter curbs on assembly and movement of people, shut popular establishments and imposed night curfews on Monday in an attempt to arrest an alarming spike in Covid-19 infections that has gripped India.Punjab extended its night curfew duration by an hour and shut gyms, pubs and spas, Rajasthan closed down all offices and markets until May 3, Kerala imposed a curfew between 9pm and 6am every day and Odisha ordered a weekend lockdown in all urban areas from April 24 till further notice. The national capital announced a weeklong lockdown until April 26. As of Monday night, there were a total of 2,030,725 active cases across the country, the highest active caseload ever recorded in India since the start of the outbreak in March last year, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.A Punjab government order said that fresh restrictions will come into effect from Tuesday, adding that curfew timings will now be from 8pm to 5am, instead of the earlier 9pm to 5am. The new restrictions, which also include closure of all malls, shops and markets on Sundays, coupled with the ones imposed earlier, will remain in effect till April 30, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said.“I understand that the restrictions we are imposing from tomorrow because of spike in #Covid19 may inconvenience people. However, these steps are necessary to prevent the spread of #Covid19 & to save lives. Request you to abide by them & to take care of yourself,” the chief minister tweeted.On Monday, there were 4,622 new cases in the state and 83 fatalities. At present, there are 304,660 Covid cases in Punjab.In Rajasthan, the government ordered the closure of all offices and markets till May 3. According to an official release issued by home secretary Abhay Kumar, only shops and offices providing essential services will remain open during the 15-day period which the government has called Jan Anushasan Pakhwada (public discipline fortnight). Those entering Rajasthan will have to show a negative RT-PCR report issued 72 hours prior to the travel. On Monday, there were 11,715 new cases in the state, taking the overall tally to 426,584. “We are in a dangerous situation and everyone must follow the guidelines and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Kerala imposed curfew between 9pm and 6am from Tuesday. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary V P Joy. Kerala logged 13,644 cases on Monday, pushing the tally to 1,253,068The state government has also directed all domestic travellers coming to the state to undergo RT-PCR tests. Odisha announced a weekend lockdown in all urban areas from April 24 as the state reported a record single-day surge of 4,445 new infections.“It is seen that the number of Covid cases are showing increasing trend in the state. Therefore, the state government has decided to impose weekend shutdown in all urban areas across the state from April 24,” said special relief commissioner Pradip Jena. “We initially thought the peak of the second wave in Odisha would come by April 25. But now it seems no one can predict for sure. None of the health experts know when will the peak come. Today the cases surged to more than 4,500. Tomorrow it can go beyond 5,500. We just don’t how the double mutant strain is behaving,” said PK Mohapatra, additional chief secretary (health) of Odisha. The state on Monday stopped interstate bus movement and limited the number of guests at weddings to 50.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfew-tightened-curbs-as-covid-19-rages-across-country-101618861413253.html
20-04-2021||India||Vaccines for all from May||All adults will become eligible for a coronavirus vaccine and doses can be sold via the market from May 1, the Union government said on Monday, heeding to a growing clamour for wider access as the country grapples with a devastating surge of Covid-19 infections.The decision, taken during a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, makes India one of the first countries to allow all adults to seek a vaccine, although people under the age of 45 will only be able to receive doses once private sales begin or if state governments procure stocks for distribution to these age groups.“The government has been working hard from over a year to ensure that maximum numbers of Indians are able to get the vaccine in the shortest possible of time,” a statement by the Press Information Bureau quoted Modi as saying.According to officials aware of developments, Modi made the decision to open up vaccinations after meeting officials overseeing the process. The PM also called a number of chief ministers to discuss the matter in wake of the Covid-19 surge.The statement added that under the third phase of the vaccination strategy, the government will make pricing, procurement, eligibility, and administration open and flexible.According to the details in the statement, vaccine makers will be able to sell half of what they produce at a price of their choosing to the open market and to state governments. The remainder will need to be supplied to Centre for the state-sponsored component of the vaccination programme, which remains limited to the 45-and-over age group only.If the vaccines have been imported as ready-to-use, the government will allow all of the stocks to be sold on the open market or to the states. The pricing for any doses sold in the open market will need to be “transparent”, although the government’s release did not indicate a cap.“India has been following a dynamic mapping model based on availability of vaccines & coverage of vulnerable priority groups to take decisions of when to open up vaccinations to other age-groups. A good amount of coverage of vulnerable groups is expected by 30th April,” the statement said.While the two Indian companies supplying doses at present — Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech — didn’t respond to requests for a comment, their supply capacities suggest a little over 45 million doses per month may be available for private sales (or to state governments) beginning May.SII at present produces 70 million doses a month and its CEO Adar Poonawalla recently said the company is looking to expand capacity to 100 million by May-end. Bharat Biotech is estimated to have produced 10 million doses in April and, after a department of biotechnology collaboration announced last week, the company expects to up monthly production to 60-70 million by July-August.The PM is scheduled to meet some of the makers on Tuesday. This follows his discussions with doctors and pharmaceutical companies on Monday, in which he discussed the outbreak situation and the availability of medicines and medical oxygen, the people quoted above said.Also read: Two held for Remdesivir black marketing after sting operation by news channelThe PIB statement said the state-sponsored campaign that is underway, and in which doses have been paid for by Centre, will continue to cover those above the age of 45, and health care and front line workers.“Second dose of all existing priority groups i.e. HCWs (health care workers), FLWs (frontline workers) and population above 45 years, wherever it has become due, would be given priority, for which a specific and focused strategy would be communicated to all stakeholders,” the government said.Allocation of doses to states and Union territories will be on the basis of their active case load and their performance in vaccinating people, while wastage will be taken into affect as criteria that can affect a state negatively when doses are being distributed by Centre.“This policy would come into effect from 1st May 2021 and will be reviewed from time to time,” the statement added.Experts said the move raises questions over how much supplies may immediately be available for such an opening up and the government will have to make sure there is no access disparity. “If the vaccine supply chain can be maintained, and everyone who wants it gets it, it is a welcome steep. While for above 45, the government is taking care of the vaccinations, below 45 years is meant essentially through the private sector. The states will have to step up to ensure poor people below the age of 45 are not left without the vaccine. Access disparity should be avoided,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India. “From vaccination to protection is several weeks, so [vaccination for all is] not an immediate solution, but if we can immunise everyone, it will make a difference,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of country’s top vaccinologists.Monday’s announcement comes less than a week after India on April 13 said it will fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines authorised by Western countries and Japan, paving the way for possible imports of Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna shots. None of the companies have announced plans to enter the Indian market under the fast-track routes as yet, although J&J and Novavax already have licensed Indian companies (J&J has authorised Biological E and Novavax has authorised Serum Institute of India) to produce millions of doses. India, the world’s biggest maker of vaccines, has so far administered a little over 124 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin – the first two shots to be approved in the country. A third, Sputnik V made by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, was approved formally on April 13 and its initial doses are expected to be imported.The PIB statement added that all vaccinations will still need to be managed under the National Vaccination Programme, and companies will have to follow workflows on the Co-WIN platform, which includes the registration and certification process and captures Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-for-all-from-may-101618859241615.html
20-04-2021||India||Thrissur Pooram to be held but no spectators allowed||Thiruvanthapuram Amid a relentless surge in Covid cases, the Kerala government and temple authorities on Monday agreed to celebrate Thrissur Pooram, the largest festival of the state at Vadakkunnathan temple in Thrissur, on April 23 with tight restrictions without any spectators, along the lines of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL). The district medical officer and intelligentsia had appealed to call off the annual festival even as the government said it was under pressure from temple authorities to hold the same. Chief secretary V P Joy on Monday held a series of talks with officials of two temples -- Thiruvambady and Paramekavu -- and decided to livestream the function and rituals while making it mandatory for artists and mahouts to produce Covid-19 negative certificates 24 hours before the event. Devotees and onlookers will not be allowed to enter the temple premises during the festival. “We agreed to most of the restrictions in the prevailing scenario. But this chorus was not visible during major rallies at the same venue during the elections,” G Rajesh, one of the organisers of the festival, said. However, DMO K J Reena claimed that the Covid situation wasn’t this bad when permission was granted for campaigns for the assembly polls which was held in a single phase on April 6. “We need festivals but at the same time we cannot play with lives,” she said. The developments come a day after state health minister K K Shailaja said that planning and preparations for “pooram” had begun much earlier and that it was difficult to call it off now. Temple authorities also had a second thought after the government imposed night curfew for a week from Tuesday.“Good that the rituals are being held as per tradition. Some of the temple boards suffered badly due to abrupt restrictions. Hope the government will help them,” Congress MP from Thrissur, T N Prathapan, said. While the main festival is on April 23, thousands attended the flag hoisting ceremonies at Vadakkunnathan temple on Saturday. Regarded as the mother of all festivals, Thrissur Pooram was cancelled for the first time last year when the pandemic broke out. The largest cultural pageant of the state, Pooram was started in the late 18th century by erstwhile King of Kochi Sakthan Thamburan. More than two million devotees take part in the 10-day celebration which culminates with a musical ensemble, a parade of caparisoned elephants and grand fireworks. Meanwhile, the government on Monday announced a night curfew from Tuesday from 9 pm to 5 am and advised people to leave their homes only when necessary. The decision was taken after a high-level meeting chaired by the chief secretary. Besides this, the government also decided to strict enforcement of restrictions and made it mandatory for all domestic travellers entering the state to undergo RT-PCR tests. On Monday, the state reported 13,644 cases with a test positivity rate of 15.63%. The active caseload has crossed one lakh (103,004), according to data released by the state health ministry. Kozhikode district topped the chart with 2,022 cases followed by Ernakulam which has registered 1,781 cases. With 21 fatalities in 24 hours, the death toll in the state climbed to 4,950.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thrissur-pooram-to-be-held-but-no-spectators-allowed-101618859372556.html
20-04-2021||India||19 Odisha women rescued from TN garment factory||Chennai: The Tirupur district administration rescued and sent 19 women, who were working at a garment unit at Velampalayam on low wages, to their hometown in Odisha, said officials familiar with the development. The move came after their families in Odisha alerted local officials, who in turn contacted Tirupur police on Saturday. The women, who were shifted to a temporary shelter at a wedding home on Sunday, boarded the train on Monday at 1.15pm to their hometown in Rayagada district. The women arrived at the garment unit in December 2020 for a three-month training programme and were offered employment. Police, however, rejected the reports that the women were forced to stay and work against their will. “Initially, the women had agreed to work but after the second wave of Covid-19 infection started, one of them contacted her family and said she wanted to return…,” Velampalayam police inspector P N Rajan said, adding, “When we went to enquire yesterday, all of them wanted to return home, so we arranged for the same.” Meanwhile, activists pointed out that there were several such cases where women are brought from Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to work in garment factories, where labour laws are violated, and the women want to go back. “They are put through excessive working hours and double shifts, but their wage is 30-40% lower than that of Tamil workers,” said Viyakula Mary, executive director of Tirupur-based SAVE (Social Awareness and Voluntary Education), which works for promotion of fair labour standards. “Their movement is restricted. Basically, they’re under control of their owners,” she added. Mary said that they visited the wedding hall but were not allowed to meet or speak to the rescued women. “We were told that low wages were the problem,” she added. In December, the organisation had rescued and sent back 38 women, who had also complained of low wages, to Jharkhand. Those women had also contacted local activists back home who got in touch with the police. “Since the outbreak of the pandemic, a lot of migrant workers are directly making distress calls to helplines and local police are altered, which is a huge development in awareness amongst them,” said Mary. The general procedure, Mary said, was for the labour department to take action. Police said the labour department would inquire into the incident under provisions of the labour law. Mary said these women, who are mostly in their 20s, accept the jobs due to lack of work back home. Former Tirupur police commissioner Sanjay Kumar, who headed several operations of sending migrant workers back during the first wave of the pandemic, said he began creating a database of migrant workers and their dependents in 2019. “We have no idea about the whereabouts of migrant workers in the state,” Kumar said. “Even if we want to help them, send them back we have no identification and authentication. The government portal would have a figure, but the actual number is much more. The Tirupur, Erode, Coimbatore industrial belt is fed by migrants and a large number of them are from north east states. We need to start registering them.” SAVE has also petitioned the government to open up self-registration for migrant workers. “Now, the system is for the factory owners to register their migrant workers, but they either don’t do it or do it for only a handful of workers,” said Mary. “If a migrant worker can register themselves with the Tamil Nadu labour department, they will have a receipt for themselves and we will also be aware of the interstate workers. Now, who even knew that these 19 women were working in Tamil Nadu?” Mary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/19-odisha-women-rescued-from-tn-garment-factory-101618859312527.html
20-04-2021||India||Prioritise vaccination for the disabled, high court tells TN||Chennai: The Madras high court on Monday directed the Tamil Nadu government to prioritise Covid-19 vaccination and open special counters in all government centres for the disabled, irrespective of whether they attained the age of 45 years. The first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamorrthy passed the order based on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by disability rights activist and co-founder of Chennai-based Equals Centre for Promotion of Social Justice, Meenakshi Balasubramanian. The court also asked the state government to draft guidelines and decide the minimum age limit within three days and if necessary, hold consultations with the central government and vaccine manufacturers to avoid adverse effects. There should be a separate counter, priority queuing and vaccination centres should be accessible such as constructing ramps as prescribed in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, the court noted. “At any rate, persons with disabilities should be given priority in being vaccinated even if the numbers do not warrant an exclusive counter being set up at every government vaccination centre,” the court added. In her petition, Balasubramanian said that people with disabilities may not be able to maintain physical distance and wear masks amid the Covid-19 pandemic. She pointed out that those with development and intellectual disabilities such as cerebral palsy and autism aren’t used to masks and drooling often made it unusable. Caregivers also have to be in close contact with them, she said. The court also took note of documents submitted by the Centre which showed that that certain categories of persons with disabilities who require high support, intellectual disabilities, muscular dystrophy, acid attack victims whose respiratory system has been affected, among others, are already being viewed as persons who are at greater risk of being infected. The state today submitted to the court that only certain categories of people with disabilities were being prioritised by the central government and that it had written to the Centre to open the drive to all categories but were yet to receive a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prioritise-vaccination-for-the-disabled-high-court-tells-tn-101618859252497.html
20-04-2021||India||Kochi man held from K’taka over murder of his daughter||Thiruvananthapuram: Nearly a month after a 13-year-old girl was found dead in a river in Kochi, the Kerala Police on Monday confirmed the arrest of her father for her murder from Karwar in Karnataka. Kochi police commissioner CH Nagaraju said the preliminary probe revealed that the accused, identified as 45-year-old Sanu Mohan, a resident of Aluva in Kochi, had planned to end his life after killing his daughter due to the financial setback he suffered in his business in Pune. He allegedly suffocated his daughter on March 20 and dumped her body in the river, police said. Mohan then tried to drown himself, but got scared and came out of Muttar river, the police commissioner said, adding that he then fled in his car. The post-mortem report of the girl confirmed the cause of her death as drowning, with the police suspecting that the girl was dumped in the river before her death. The commissioner said there were several gaps in Mohan’s preliminary statements, adding that they need to be investigated thoroughly. The police have ruled out any involvement of a third party in the case as of now. Nagaraju said police moved an application in a local court on Monday for two-week custody of Mohan. Police have recovered his car from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. After CCTV visuals at Walayar check-post along the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border confirmed his car crossing the check-post in the early hours of March 21, police began their hunt for the accused, covering three states, the top cop said. “We have information that he travelled to three-four states to dodge police and there were many attempts to mislead investigators,” he said. Police said that the accused told them that he tried to cut his vein in a bid to end his life but later took medical help. In Goa, where he also claimed to have attempted to end his life, he told the interrogators that he jumped into the sea but rescued by lifeguards. But police said these were excuses to earn sympathy, adding that he was changing his statements frequently. The Kochi police commissioner said four teams were formed and they were chasing the accused scanning three states. He said the final breakthrough in the case came when Mohan was spotted in a lodge in Mookambika temple in Karnataka. But before police reached the spot, he fled from there. Police said Mohan stopped using his mobile phone a few days before his disappearance on March 21. When he was detained in Karwar on Sunday, he was found using another mobile phone, the top police officer said. An electronic equipment dealer, Mohan left Pune a couple of years ago after his business suffered losses. Police said a case was registered against him in Pune for financial malpractices. Occupants of the flat where he stayed in Kochi said he was a well-behaved man and attached to his daughter, who was interested in dancing and extra- curricular activities. The mother of the victim is yet to record her statement, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kochi-man-held-from-k-taka-over-murder-of-his-daughter-101618859192490.html
20-04-2021||India||Karnataka govt ignored second wave warning, say experts||Ats a time when Karnataka is in the grip of the deadlier second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a senior member of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said the government was warned about the second wave.“The onset of the second wave was warned by the experts in Karnataka on November 30, 2020. We missed the timing and the quantum is higher than expected. Governments had all the time to review and prepare,” tweeted Dr Girighara Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and a member of the state TAC on Covid-19.On Sunday, Bengaluru recorded its highest ever number of cases with 12,793 infections.“The bed capacity is hardly sufficient for few days. It is also necessary to reduce the speed of transmission. There are only few options any Government can have when the cases surge rapidly and resources are limited. We need stricter mitigation and containment, starting now,” Babu said in another tweet.Babu has been one of the leading advisors to the Karnataka government on Covid-19.Many other experts like Babu have been raising concerns about the government’s inaction, which they believe, led to the Covid-19 situation going out of control. “The government was given first set of recommendation asking for stricter measures to be put in place to tackle the second wave. They ignored it. They were asked to implement several measures including reducing the footfall at cinemas, schools and many others. These recommendations were made in February and March again, but it was shot down,” said an expert purview to development, who did not wish to be named.The expert also pointed out that despite the projections from the TAC, the government was planning for the second wave using the numbers of the previous surge. “On the second day of the second wave, we crossed the highest number reported in the first wave. We are now reporting more than 100% more cases than the last wave. The government failed to listen to the experts there as well,” the expert added.Besides, the allocation on health in the state budget, too, did not reflect the government’s readiness to prepare for the second wave, an expert said.“For starters, even though the pandemic was the biggest challenge faced by the government, the budget allocation for health remained at 4%. It was as though nothing had changed. They announced to build Intensive Care Units, but it was not to be immediate. The plan was to develop them over two years. When the government knew, a second wave was coming, why it didn’t plan for more hospital facilities?” asked a faculty member of the medical college in Bengaluru, currently deployed on Covid-19 duty.A senior government official, who attended the review meeting on Monday, in which restrictions to be imposed in the city were discussed, said that more than any constructive discussion, the meeting saw legislators indulging in mudslinging. “The opposition was asking the government why there was no lockdown, and the governing party was arguing over why they (Opposition) were supporting a lockdown,” he said.Another member of the TAC said that expert opinion has been that a lockdown is required in Bengaluru to control the current Covid-19 situation. “We have no other choice. The number of cases is only going to increase, stretching our healthcare system. We need to announce a lockdown and built infrastructure in the meanwhile. We hope that in the meeting with the governor, which will have lesser members than today (Monday), some sensible decisions will be taken,” added the TAC member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-govt-ignored-second-wave-warning-say-experts-101618858537650.html

However, it does seem that those who drafted your letter or advised you, have done a great disservice to your standing by misleading you regarding material that is already in public domain,” said the minister.The Congress hit back, with party leader Ashok Chavan demanding an apology, and calling the letter a cheap retort lacking in grace.Party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate dismissed the allegation that Congress-ruled states created vaccine hesitancy.“It’s a natural concern and despite being a doctor, it is sad that the minister labelled it as a politically fuelled hesitancy.”Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot hit out at Vardhan for his “politically motivated” response.“It is unfortunate and condemnable of the health minister to have written a politically motivated reply to the former prime minister,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-targets-manmohan-over-letter-congress-charges-back-101618857932996.html
20-04-2021||India||Young not more prone to Covid-19 in 2nd wave: Govt||Young people aren’t more vulnerable to the second wave of coronavirus infections in India when compared to the first, said top government medical experts on Monday, citing official hospital data to establish that there was no dramatic shift in the age profile of Covid-19 patients from last year.In an official briefing, Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog and Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said data coming from the ground showed that young people contributed roughly the same caseload to the current outbreak as the one that ravaged India last year. They claimed that need for oxygen and shortness of breath was seen more among patients in this wave.“If we look at age profiles, we will see in the last year people under 30 years contributed 31 per cent of the cases and now it is 32 per cent, so essentially there is no difference. There is no overarching excess of young people becoming Covid positive. The main point we are making is essentially we do not see a shift in the age prevalence of Covid-19 overall in the country,” said Paul.Also read: Over 2 million active cases stretch health infrastructure to limitsBhargava said only a marginally high proportion of patients were younger and that the average of patients in the first wave was 50 and in this wave, was 49. “From zero to 19 years - the difference was 5.8% versus 4.2%, and in 20-40 years, the difference was 25 per cent versus 23 per cent. There is a marginal difference in this,” he said.The data set was taken from the National Clinical Covid-19 Registry that ICMR launched in September last year. The data of 9,485 patients, from August 2020 to April 2021, was taken for the analysis. “The changes that we have seen are that oxygen utilisation has increased to 54.5% in the second wave, from 41.1% that was seen during the first wave last year. And requirement for ventilation has gone down from 37.3 to 27.8% between the two waves,” said Bhargava.Shortness of breath was seen in 47.5% hospitalised positive cases this year as compared to 41.7% last year, he added. The first wave data was taken from September to November 2020, and second wave data between February and April, 2021.“The good news is that the death profile has not seen much change...It is 9.6% hospitalised patients in the first wave and 9.7% among patients in the second wave,” he said.The analysis also found that in both the waves, 70% of those hospitalised were above 40. Among 20-40, 23.7% hospitalisations were seen during the first wave, and 25.5% in the second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/young-not-more-prone-to-covid-in-2nd-wave-govt-101618857932384.html
20-04-2021||India||Govt okays extending aid to vaccine makers||The finance ministry has approved in-principle a move by the Union health ministry to extend advance to vaccine manufacturers involved in making coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine doses to boost the nationwide inoculation drive, a finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity.A CNBC report on Monday said the government sanctioned ₹4,500 crore supply credit to Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers — Serum Institute of India ( ₹3,000 crore) and Bharat Biotech ( ₹1,500 crore). “The health ministry will work company specific details and provide them advance money so that they ramp up their manufacturing capacities and continue vaccine supplies without interruption,” the official quoted above said.India is currently inoculating its citizens using two vaccines -- the Oxford/AztraZeneca vaccine manufactured by SII under the brand name Covishield, and Covaxin created by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research and manufactured by Bharat Biotech.Also read: Capital back in lockdownBoth the companies were seeking to ramp up their vaccine production in the wake of rising demand for Covid-19 vaccines, and looking to raise finances.The chief executive officer of SII, Adar Poonawalla, in an interview to NDTV this month, said that the company will require around ₹3,000 crore to ramp up production capacity. The company at the moment produces about 50-60 million vaccine doses per month, and has plans of ramping it up to about 100 million doses per month, he added in the interviewIn the case of Covaxin, the Centre on Friday announced that it will help double the production capacity of India’s first made-in-India Covid-19 vaccine by May-June 2021 from the existing 10 million doses per month, with a target of helping produce nearly 100 million doses per month by September.On Friday, the Centre announced releasing ₹65 crore to Bharat Biotech, the maker of Covaxin, to upgrade its production capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-okays-extending-aid-to-vaccine-makers-101618857873529.html
20-04-2021||India||Over 2 million active Covid-19 cases stretch health infrastructure to limits||The number of active cases in India on Monday crossed the two million mark as the mammoth surge of new infections continued to push the overburdened health care system to limits, with reports emerging from across the country of hospitals running out of ICU beds, and crucial supplies such as oxygen cylinders.The latest in the series of grim landmarks for the country comes only 10 days after active cases in the country crossed the 1 million active cases mark on April 10.As of Monday night, there were a total of 2,030,725 active cases across the country, the highest active caseload ever recorded in India since the start of the outbreak in March last year, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.For the third day running, India’s daily case tally remained above the quarter million mark as 256,596 new cases were reported, while a record 1,757 daily deaths were lodged. India’s overall caseload has now reached 15.3 million – the second-highest after the United States – and 154,320 people have lost their lives to the disease, according to HT’s dashboard.Active cases – those Covid-19 patients still carrying the virus, and thus under treatment – is a crucial metric representing the country’s battle against the disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in a region.While the total number of active cases is alarming, the rate at which this number is rising is even more so. In the past week, the country has added nearly 770,000 active cases to its tally.When the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak was raging at its peak, India’s active cases only hovered over the 1 million mark briefly (for a period of five days between September 15 and September 20 last year).This means that the current active caseload, and by extension the burden on the country’s hospitals and nursing homes, is more than double what the country saw even during the peak for the first wave.This also makes India only the second country after the US to have more than 2 million active cases at any given point of time.In Brazil, which is the world’s third worst-hit country, active cases topped out at 1.3 million two weeks ago, and appear to be on dropping now.To be sure, there are currently 6.9 million active cases in the US, where it touched a peak of 9.1 million in late January, when the country’s third wave was at its peak.The metric is even more crucial in current circumstances because the country’s health care system is being weighed down by cases, particularly in regions that have massive chunks of active cases such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi, many of which have been reporting not only shortage of supplies such as oxygen tanks, but are also running out of ICU beds, and even space in morgues and funeral homes.Also read: Night curfew, tightened curbs as Covid-19 rages across countryOne of the major reasons to have caused an acute area-specific shortage of life-saving supplies is the uneven distribution of the active cases in the country. Maharashtra, for instance, is home to only 9% of the country’s population, but is currently bearing the load of one of every three (33.4%) active cases in India. The western state, the worst-hit by Covid-19, had 678,198 active cases as of Monday night.Just the top 10 states by active cases are responsible for over 80% of all such cases.Uttar Pradesh had 208,523 active cases (10% of the country’s caseload), Karnataka 142,084 (7%), Chhattisgarh 129,000 active cases (6.4%) and Kerala with 103,327 active cases (5.1%) made the top five along with Maharashtra.Delhi, which is home to 0.3% of the country’s population, has 3.8% of India active cases – 76,887.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2-million-active-covid-19-cases-stretch-health-infra-to-limits-101618857872303.html
20-04-2021||India||Two top poll panel officials test Covid-19 positive||Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioner Rajiv Kumar have both tested positive for Covid-19, as the bitterly fought elections in West Bengal continue, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The post of the third commissioner has been vacant since April 13, when former CEC Sunil Arora demitted office. People familiar with the matter said that other senior officials, such as some deputy election commissioners, also contracted the virus and all those who have tested positive are in quarantine.Despite all odds, the EC is constantly in touch with all required officials via video call to ensure the smooth conduct of the remaining three phases of the West Bengal elections, said the people cited above.HT on April 9 reported that in the politically fraught battle in Bengal, the EC received over 19,000 complaints, of which only 99 remained to be resolved as of April 8. The high stakes political battle has had various party leaders knocking on the EC’s door to intervene in cases of violation of the poll code.On Sunday, the commission imposed a 24-hour campaigning ban on Sujata Mondal and Sayantan Basu for code violation.EC seeks officials’ reply on feasibility of pollsThe Election Commission of India on Monday has sought feedback from poll officials in West Bengal regarding the feasibility of allowing election rallies, a person familiar with the matter said. This comes amid a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases across the country which has parties demanding that public rallies be suspended and the remaining phases [in West Bengal] be clubbed into one.A person familiar with the matter said, “Every state is different. The EC has already effectively suspended campaigning for the eighth phase. And today is the last day for campaigning for the sixth phase. EC will hear from officials in the state.”The last three phases of the polls are scheduled for April 22, April 26, and April 29 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-top-poll-panel-officials-test-covid-ve-101618857392315.html
20-04-2021||India||BJP, TMC scale down campaigns amid spike||New Delhi The Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decided on Monday to scale back their campaigns for the ongoing West Bengal elections in the face of rising coronavirus cases in the eastern state and sharp criticism of rampant violation of Covid-19 protocols in rallies.TMC said chief minister Mamata Banerjee will address no events in state capital Kolkata, save one symbolic rally on the last day of campaigning on April 26. Its main rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it will limit audience at public events to 500, and hold meetings only in open spaces and in accordance with Covid guidelines.The announcements came on a day the state posted 8,426 cases and 38 deaths, pushing its tally to 668,353 and death toll to 10,606, respectively.“Mamata Banerjee will not campaign in Kolkata anymore. Only one ‘symbolic’ meeting on the last day of campaigning in the city on April 26 will be held. She slashed time for all her election rallies in all districts and is now restricted to just 30 minutes,” party MP Derek O’Brien said in a tweet.Later in the day, the BJP announced curbs of its own.“It has been decided that only small public meetings with not more than 500 people will be held by PM Modi and other central ministers in West Bengal. All these public meetings will be held in open spaces following Covid-19 guidelines,” BJP said, adding that breaking the chain of infections was needed in such a difficult time.Party’s social media in-charge Amit Malaviya said that the party will leverage its digital footprint to take BJP’s message to the people. “We will ensure that BJP leverages its massive digital footprint and takes message of PM and other leaders to lakhs of people. We did that successfully during Bihar elections, which too was conducted under the cloud of Covid. Opposition had then complaint that it gave us an edge,” Malaviya tweeted.Political parties in Bengal have faced flak from experts because of rampant violation of mask mandates and distancing protocols in rallies. Last week, the Election Commission warned that all parties will have to strictly adhere to guidelines during campaigning even as health experts criticised the poll watchdog for failing to strictly implement norms.On Sunday, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said he will not address any rallies in the state.The sixth phase of West Bengal elections will be held on April 22, seventh on April 26 and the final phase on April 29. The Commission has already extended the silent period from 48 to 72 hours, in view of the rising cases, therefore not allowing any campaigning between the seventh and the eight phases. Last week, EC also banned public meetings and road shows between 7 pm and 10 am and threatened penal provisions against any political party or candidate found violating Covid-19 protocol at public events. On Monday – the last day of campaigning for the sixth phase -- Banerjee trained her guns at BJP and EC for the rising coronavirus cases.“With folded hands, I request EC to hold the next three phases of polls on a single day. If not one, conduct it in two days and save one day. Please don’t take your decision based on what the BJP says. Please ensure that you protect public health by curtailing the poll schedule, even if it is by one day,” the TMC supremo said at her rally in Chakulia.The BJP hit back. Union home minister Amit Shah said that each candidate has to be given a certain number of days to campaign and it is constitutional duty of the commission to ensure that an appropriate amount of time is provided. “Constitutionally, the EC has no other option but to conduct elections. Mamata Ji makes comments without reading the Constitution,” Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-tmc-scale-down-campaigns-amid-spike-101618857332251.html
20-04-2021||India||HC wants curbs in 5 UP cities; not possible: Govt||The Allahabad high court on Monday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to strictly enforce closure of all establishments (government or private) in Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar and Gorakhpur till April 26 in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases.While the court clarified that it was not imposing a complete lockdown in the entire state by its order, the Yogi Adityanath government asserted that there will not be any “imposition of statewide lockdown or any fresh restrictions in the five cities (Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Kanpur City, and Gorakhpur)”.“There should be no confusion.

People themselves [are] proactive and doing closures,” the spokesperson added.Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, “The UP government is submitting its reply before the HC on its observations.”The government’s statement came hours after a bench comprising justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar passed the order in a suo motu public interest litigation on conditions of quarantine centres in the state and the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“We... direct the government to consider imposition of a complete lockdown in the entire state for at least a period of two weeks,” the bench said.The court’s directive came on a day on when UP recorded 167 deaths and 28,287 fresh Covid-19 cases. The state capital alone saw 22 deaths and 5,897 fresh cases.Financial institutions and departments, medical and health services, industrial and scientific establishments, essential services, including municipal functions, and public transport will be exempted from the closure ordered by the court till April 26.Also read: Two top poll panel officials test Covid-19 positiveThe court further asked the state government to ensure that grocery shops and other commercial shops, excluding medicine shops, with more than three workers shall remain closed till April 26.

The ministry spokesperson said trains will continue to run even during the curfew.“Today evening there was some speculation about the crowd coming to station or rush building up. It is requested that all may avoid such reports as the reality is different...Rush and crowd happen when there is a speculation that trains would not be available at all or will be stopped. There is no such situation now. Trains are not going to be stopped and I think public knows about it. They know that, if they don’t get to travel today, they can go the next day or later on. Even under the curfew guidelines, one is allowed to travel to the station with a valid ticket. There is nothing to panic,” railway ministry spokesperson DJ Narain said.However, the sale of platform tickets at railway stations in Delhi has been suspended to regulate entry of the passengers and avoid crowding at platforms. “Due to surge in Covid-19 cases, Delhi Division of Northern Railway has decided to stop the sale of platform tickets with immediate effect till further orders to regulate the entry of passengers at platforms and station premises,” Northern Railways’ DRM tweeted.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine for everyone above 18 from May 1, PM Modi gives go aheadKeen to avoid a situation like last year, the Indian Railways is adding additional summer special trains to cater to the rush of migrants headed home, taking the current train service operations to around 70% of pre-Covid times, HT reported last Friday.Last March, railways suspended regular passenger train services during the nationwide lockdown.Over the past week the railways have planned 69 additional ‘summer special trains’ to cater to the rush being reported across stations. Till April 30, the national transporter has planned 133 additional trains with 88 ‘summer specials’ and 45 ‘festival special’ trains.According to railway ministry’s data till Wednesday, the national carrier has approved total of 9,622 special trains and at present it is running an average of 7,745 trains as compared to an average 11,283 trains during pre-Covid times.

By virtue of citizenship, one becomes a member of a sovereign country and becomes entitled to various rights and privileges granted by law in that country,” said the order. “If any question arises about citizenship of a person, in our opinion, the same should be adjudicated as far as possible on the basis of merit and on hearing the person concerned,” it added.Also Read | East India extremely vulnerable to climate change: AnalysisAs per the Assam Accord of 1985, anyone who has been staying in the state prior to March 24, 1971, or can establish lineage to people residing on or before that date is considered as Indian citizen — a requirement also accepted for inclusion in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) updated in 2019.Names of around 1.9 million people who failed to prove theirs or their ancestor’s residency in Assam on that date and those who were declared foreigners by foreigners’ tribunals (as well their relatives) were excluded from the NRC.The HC found that though a notice was served by the tribunal to Khatun, her son appeared on her behalf without her knowledge. “Unfortunately, the petitioner’s son neglected to appear before the tribunal on various dates fixed by the tribunal resulting in passing of the ex-parte order. From the records, it is evident that the learned tribunal passed the order without hearing the petitioner,” the HC order of April 8 read.

20-04-2021||India||8 states most prone to climate crisis: Study||Eight states in the eastern parts of India are most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and should be prioritised for interventions, a new assessment has found. The states are Jharkhand, Mizoram, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and West Bengal.The assessment by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of Technology at Mandi and Guwahati, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, has used the intergovernmental panel on climate change’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) to define vulnerability and make state and district-wise assessments.The AR5 defines the risk of climate change as the interaction of “hazard”, “exposure” and “vulnerability”, where vulnerability is conceptualised as the “propensity or predisposition of the system to be adversely affected”.“Vulnerability is basically a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity. All states in India are vulnerable to climate change as per our assessment. But these eastern and central states are more vulnerable because of their poverty levels; lack of irrigation; low forest cover in some cases; low adaptive capacity of the health sector among other drivers. This assessment can basically guide which states should be prioritised for use of adaptation fund. It should also guide aid agencies and international financial institutions like the World Bank and others on where money is needed the most,” said NH Ravindranath, retired professor, Indian Institute of Science, and a co-researcher of the assessment.Sensitivity determines the first-order impact of a climate hazard. The effect may be direct (for instance, change in crop yield in response to a change in the mean, range, or variability of temperature) or indirect (such as damages caused by an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise), the report says. Some key indicators were selected for the assessment through discussions with state governments and scientists. These include: Percentage of population living below the poverty line; income share from natural resources; the proportion of marginal and small land holdings, women’s participation in the workforce; yield variability of food grains; the area under rainfed agriculture, forest area per 1,000 rural population; area covered under crop insurance; density of health care workers and others. Weights were assigned to each of these indicators to calculate a score and all states were found to cross the threshold making all of them vulnerable.“Approximately 90% districts in Assam, 80% in Bihar, and 60% in Jharkhand fall in Quartile I (i.e, in the category of 153 most vulnerable districts) exhibiting a high level of concentration of vulnerable districts,” the assessment states, adding that the least vulnerable states as per the assessment released on Saturday are Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Sikkim, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Nagaland, Goa and Maharashtra.Also read: Amid Covid surge, Kalka-Shimla heritage track sees 70% drop in passenger trafficThe authors clarify that vulnerability indicators are relative measures and that it does not imply that, say, Maharashtra is not vulnerable in an absolute sense. “It should also be noted that this vulnerability ranking is based on a set of indicators that were used in this assessment with a specific objective. These indicators predominantly focused on socio-economic drivers as well as those related to primary sector-based livelihood along with some biophysical and institutional factors,” the report said.For Jharkhand which is the most vulnerable state according to the assessment, a high proportion of BPL (below poverty line) population, prevalence of rainfed agriculture, and high incidence of vector-borne diseases are the major drivers of vulnerability.A relatively high rate of implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, a high road density and extensive railway network, a greater number of health care workers per 1,000 population, and a low prevalence of vector-borne diseases were among indicators found in less vulnerable states. The authors have recommended a climate risk index to be developed for all states based on hazards and vulnerability of states.Another international study has flagged India’s vulnerability to climate change this week. Monsoon rainfall in India is likely to become stronger and more erratic according to an analysis by a team of German researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, Germany (LMU) which compared more than 30 climate models. The study published in the Journal of Earth System Dynamics predicts more extremely wet years in the future with grave consequences for India’s economy, food systems and agriculture.“We have found robust evidence for an exponential dependence: For every degree Celsius of warming, monsoon rainfall will likely increase by about 5%,” said lead author Anja Katzenberger from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in a statement.“The study reiterates the need for the 2020s to become a decade of climate action and building climate resilience. As a next step, it is also important to highlight the complexity and non-linearity of climate risks across Indian states. The focus needs to be on climate-proofing of geographies, economies and infrastructure at the state and district level. A CEEW analysis has already found that more than 75% of Indian districts are vulnerable to extreme climate events. Identification of risks at a granular level via building a climate risk atlas would be crucial,” said Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, CEEW.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-states-most-prone-to-climate-crisis-study-101618772427958.html
