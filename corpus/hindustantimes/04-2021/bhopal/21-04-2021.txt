The official added attempts are on to identify the people behind the incident and cases were being lodged.Madhya Pradesh is suffering from one of the worst surges of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as the state recorded more than 12,000 cases on Tuesday taking its tally to 433,704. The death toll in the city also rose to 4,713 with 77 fresh fatalities. The state imposed restrictions akin to lockdown to check the transmission of the virus.Medical experts highlighted that during the second wave of Covid-19 there is a higher demand for oxygen. Oxygen remains an indispensable tool in treating Covid-19 as the disease leads to respiratory problems. “There has been a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, creating panic among the people to get admitted to hospitals and, therefore, the oxygen requirement suddenly shot up, which is one reason. But this is limited data from hospital settings and more will have to be looked at,” ICMR director general Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday.Reliance Industries Ltd ramped up its production of medical oxygen and it is being supplied free of cost to states which are severely affected by Covid-19, including Madhya Pradesh. The demand for oxygen went up in Maharashtra and Delhi as well. Delhi high court on Tuesday pulled up the Centre amid reports of a crisis in medical oxygen being reported from the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/miscreants-flee-with-oxygen-cylinders-from-hospital-in-mp-s-damoh-probe-ordered-101618990160966.html

The passengers said they were afraid of returning by foot, so they decided to return on the overcrowded bus.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced the six-day lockdown until April 26 citing a surge in Covid-19 infections. The Covid-19 cases have risen by close to 600% in the last two weeks and inundated hospitals and triggered a shortage in critical medical supplies in Delhi. He requested migrant workers to stay put as this was a small lockdown and promised to take care of them as part of efforts to avoid their mass exodus like during the nationwide lockdown last year.Also Read | Bikers killed after crashing into electric pole in PuneMigrant workers began pouring into interstate bus terminals and private bus depots around Anand Vihar and Ghazipur in Delhi and Kaushambi in Ghaziabad after Kejriwal made the announcement.Scores of migrant workers died in road accidents during the lockdown last year as tens of thousands of them walked and cycled home from big cities after losing their jobs until special buses and trains were arranged for them.Sanghi said the driver of the bus was allegedly intoxicated when the vehicle met with the accident at Jaurasi Ghati.“Police have registered a case and were making arrangement to send the passengers to their homes,” he added.The three passengers, who died in the accident, were identified as Mukesh Dhimar, 26, Matadin Ahirwar, 33, and Jitendra Ahirwar, 22. They are all residents of Tikamgarh district.Parasram Chander, 23, an injured passenger, said, “We did not want to spend days empty stomach without work so we boarded the bus by paying double the fare.”(With inputs from Mahesh Shivhare from Gwalior)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/three-migrants-labourers-returning-from-delhi-killed-in-accident-in-mp-s-gwalior-101618919138042.html
