We want to reduce the positivity rate, which is around 23% to 24% presently,” said Yadav.As many as nine Covid-related deaths were also reported on Thursday, taking the total number of deaths in the district to 462. Also, only 455 beneficiaries received the first dose of the vaccine on Thursday, as vaccinations were put on hold due to increased workload and reduced staff strength.Dr Yadav said that slots for vaccination of people aged above 18 years would be available after May 1, only if the state government get its quota of vaccines. “At present, vaccines have not been received and we may get it on Friday, but this is not confirmed. Session sites would be set up only after adequate doses are received by the state government,” said Yadav.In a move to involved the private sector for vaccine outreach, private clinics and health centres can participate in the vaccinate drive in collaboration with the health department, said Yadav. “A meeting of the district task force on Covid-19 will be held on Friday, in which all the modalities of vaccine roll out at local level will be finalised in line with the guidelines received from the government,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/5042-new-covid-19-cases-reported-includes-backlog-of-1000-101619718824396.html

29-04-2021||Gurugram||Vaccination suspended for healthcare staff training||The vaccination process for the public has been put on hold for two days, starting Thursday, to train healthcare staff on new technicalities in the process, officials of the health department said. With a rapid surge in cases, as Gurugram reported 5,042 new Covid-19 infections on Thursday, officials said that the staff strength has also dwindled with over a 100 workers testing positive last week and an increase in workload for contact tracing in large outbreak regions.The staff are being trained to upload details of vaccinations, including the vaccine name and dose wastage, on the CoWIN portal, said officials.Dr MP Singh, district immunisation officer, said, “For stage three of vaccination that is scheduled to start from May 1, there are certain technical changes in the CoWIN portal, which need to be conveyed to doctors, vaccinators, and other healthcare workers, due to which we have halted the vaccination process for two days. For the next stage, hospitals will have to update details, such as the number of vaccines, wastage, name of the vaccine, on the portals on their own. In these two days (Thursday and Friday), healthcare staff from both private and government hospitals are being trained on the technicalities of handling the data on the portal.”Officials said that the district, at present, has a stock of around 10,000 doses of vaccines for use at government vaccination sites, ahead of the next phase, for which private hospitals have been directed to procure vaccines directly from the manufacturers. Officials said that the health department will not be supplying it to them.Private hospitals have also been given time till 5pm on Friday, to inform the health department about the number of vaccine doses left with them and return the same to the health department.“All vaccinations that will be done from May 1 in private hospitals will be done based on vaccines that they are able to procure directly from the manufacturers. We have given them time till Friday evening to inform us about stock left with them, which they will have to return. Vaccination will continue at government centres, but for private centres, slots will be visible on CoWIN application, based on their stock availability,” said Singh.According to Singh, the vaccination will continue to be free of cost for beneficiaries above the age of 45 years, while government directives are awaited on the charges for beneficiaries aged 18 to 44.Officials also said that another reason for suspending vaccinations for two days is the lack of healthcare staff availability, as testing has been increased in large outbreak areas along with contact tracing.“With the increase in cases, our healthcare staff is also testing positive, which demoralises them. With limited healthcare workers, it is difficult to manage vaccination, contact tracing and training process. So, with staff who are still working, we are focusing on training for the next stage of vaccination and contact tracing with rapid testing,” said a senior health official, requesting anonymity.Virendra Yadav, chief medical officer of Gurugram, said, “The portal has certain changes with respect to the price of the vaccines and allotment of slots that need to be updated by private hospitals based on the stock of vaccine that they are able to procure. These two days, those updates are being done, after which vaccination will start in the district again.”However, the vaccination process was only stopped for the public, with 50 healthcare workers and frontline workers receiving the jabs at government session sites, while 1,458 were vaccinated at private facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/vaccination-suspended-for-healthcare-staff-training-101619718823800.html
29-04-2021||Gurugram||Hospitals with fewer than 15 beds barred from treating Covid-19 cases||Hospitals having fewer than 15 beds will not be allowed to treat Covid-19 patients in Gurugram, Faridabad, Panchkula, Karnal, Hisar and Sonepat districts to ensure continuous oxygen supply, according to an order issued by the additional chief secretary (health) on Thursday. District administrations were directed to ensure that this does not lead to a reduction in the number of beds, with officials asked to increase the number of beds in larger hospitals.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer for Gurugram, said that hospitals that are not registered on the state Covid-19 website would also not be allowed to treat Covid-19 patients. “It has been decided that smaller hospital with bed capacity less than 15 beds won’t be allowed to admit Covid-19 patients as they are facing a lot of issues with regard to oxygen supply. This measure will ensure that hospitals which don’t have adequate facilities won’t be allowed to treat Covid-19 patients,” said Yadav.According to the order, hospitals in other districts having a minimum bed capacity of 10 were allowed to treat Covid-19 patients. Officials familiar with the development said that the directions would ensure rationalisation of hospital beds and optimum use of oxygen for critical Covid-19 patients, as smaller hospitals don’t have the capacity to store oxygen for longer durations, with some needing a refill every three hours.To meet the challenge of oxygen supply in Gurugram, the district administration also launched an oxygen helpline, 0124-2971110, for hospitals to reach out to the district administration for help in case of an emergency.According to the order, the district administration has to ensure that number of hospital beds is not reduced by this order. A committee under the deputy commissioner was also constituted to ensure these directions are followed, as per the order, said officials.The government order also said that every district will have a vehicle loaded with three to four oxygen cylinders, which shall be kept on standby to meet any emergency. Additional hospitals beds can also be created only if the district has adequate health Infrastructure, manpower, facilities and oxygen supply, the order stated.In a related development, the district administration also decided to implement a token system for hospitals that are sending their staff to refill oxygen cylinders at the three facilities in the district. “The modalities for distribution of gas through a token system is being worked out and it will be introduced in a day or two,” Hitesh Yadav, assistant commissioner of police, Manesar, who is also a member of the MCG team constituted for the supply of oxygen in the district.According to Yadav, around 30 to 40 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, depending upon the supply, is distributed daily. “Real-time information is shared by the nodal groups and we escort trucks from Bhiwadi and Panipat from KMP Expressway. These trucks are sent to filling stations and hospitals as per the schedule developed by nodal officers of these two plants,” said Yadav.To ensure that the vehicles transporting oxygen do not face hindrances in the passage, dedicated corridors were created and police personnel posted at key points, including the Kherki Daula toll plaza, said Yadav.Police personnel were also deployed at the two filling stations in Manesar and the one in Gurugram to ensure cylinders are filled in an orderly manner. “Documents and papers of those coming to the filling stations are checked and oxygen is given only after that. All efforts are being made to ensure oxygen is distributed properly,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospitals-with-fewer-than-15-beds-barred-from-treating-covid-19-cases-101619718703180.html

To curb the spread of infection and to avoid a lockdown, the district administration notified 91 areas as large outbreak zones where strict curbs will be enforced, said the officials familiar with the matter.Officials said that the state government has decided against imposing a complete lockdown as it would adversely affect the economy.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, while addressing a press conference on Wednesday, said that imposing a lockdown would certainly affect the state’s economy, due to which the government has allowed industries to operate with strict Covid-19 protocols in place.Khattar said that instead of imposing a lockdown, deputy commissioners were directed to ensure strict implementation of Section 144 of the CrPC, restricting gatherings of more than four people, in their respective districts.Officials of the district administration said that personnel are being deployed to ensure there is no crowding in public areas. Also, permissions should be sought for conducting social events and functions, including weddings.Meanwhile, the total number of active Covid-19 patients reached 31,119, according to the health department data on Wednesday, with 29,974 of them in home isolation.Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that to stop the surge in cases, they will start intensive testing, screening and contact tracing in the large outbreak regions. “The key to control the spread is to stop the movement of people and enforce social distancing norms,” said Yadav.On Wednesday, 1,490 patients recovered from Covid-19 infections, while 92 people were to institutional quarantine facilities, as per the health department data. On the testing front, the health department collected 11,609 samples.According to district administration officials, the positivity rate of Covid-19 patients in the district is currently at 22-23%.
