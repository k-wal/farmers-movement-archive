Although Gurugram has a daily discharge of around 300 Covid-19 patients, due to the recent surge in coronavirus cases, beds are not readily available. Instead of wasting precious time and waiting for beds to become available, we inform patients or their families about beds available in nearby districts,” said Sharma.As per the coronaharyana.in portal of the Haryana government, there are 497 ICU beds, 220 ventilator beds, and 2,351 general beds for Covid-19 patients across the city’s 41 hospitals.“While the data on the availability of Covid-19 beds in Gurugram is updated on various government portals on a real-time basis, the same may not be the case in other districts, and through our colleagues and acquaintances, we keep a regular update on the situation elsewhere to help people find beds,” said Sharma.According to the coronaharyana.in portal of the Haryana government, there are six Covid-19 hospitals in Jhajjar, with a total capacity of 294 Covid-19 beds, 47 ICU beds, and 13 ventilator beds.

I called up a few hospitals in Gurugram and their staff told us that there are no beds available at the moment. I visited a hospital near Sector 29 in the hope of finding a bed, but to no avail. One of the administration officials there told me about beds available in Jhajjar. As my mother-in-law’s condition was deteriorating, I took her to AIIMS Jhajjar immediately and was able to admit her,” said Anmol Roy, a resident of Sushant Lok 1.Before April 11, the highest single-day spike in Covid-19 cases was 964 on November 8 last year.
