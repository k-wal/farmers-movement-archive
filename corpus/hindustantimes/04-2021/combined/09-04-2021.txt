In almost three months, since the vaccination drive was launched on January 16, Punjab has given the first shot to only 60% (six of every ten) health workers and the front-line workers. Till April 8, around 1.54 lakh health care workers have taken the first dose, with 375 workers inoculated on Thursday. There has not been a single day when the state has managed to meet its target for vaccination of health care workers. According to the Centre’s notification, health workers include doctors, nurses, Auxiliary Nurse Midwife, paramedical staff, support staff, Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) workers and medical students. Officials, who are part of the vaccination drive, said the state continues to be the worst-performing state in the country to vaccinate its registered health workers. Last month, Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu had warned health workers, who do not get vaccinated despite being given repeated opportunities. “If health workers get infected at a later stage, they will have to bear the cost of their treatment and will not be allowed quarantine/isolation leave,” Sidhu had warned. No change, however, is even now visible on the ground. Officials said ASHA workers and ANMs have been found to be the major defaulters, who were on field duties. Officers claim they have been using their own vaccination as a bargaining chip to get their pending demands approved from the state government. “What will happen, even if we get ourselves vaccinated? If we can survive in the first wave when the government did not provided us anything, we will live even without the vaccination. We won’t take the jabs till the government accepts our demands,” said state president of ASHA workers’ association, Kiranjeet Panjola. They want better working conditions and pay. Punjab health and family welfare director Dr KB Singh said, “The stubbornness of a few is responsible for this. Unfortunately, a few health workers have not understood that the vaccine is for their safety and to protect their family members as well. We have held meetings, but to no avail.”In stark contrast to the health workers, 92% of front-line workers have already received the first shot. Among front-line workers, Punjab Police, which is the largest component in this category, is the best performer with around 90% already taking the first dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/3-months-after-vaccination-drive-just-60-of-punjab-s-health-workers-have-taken-1st-dose-101617992835395.html

The bench of Justice Jitendra Chauhan and justice Vivek Puri, however, has ordered that proceeds of the sale of this crop be deposited with Jalandhar divisional deputy director of rural and panchayat department. In case of emergency, these private respondents shall be at liberty to approach the divisional deputy director for release of funds against proper security, the court added. The Gaggrewal panchayat had approached the high court through its counsel RK Grewal seeking cancellation of these land deeds and to seek an order restraining these private land cultivators from harvesting the crop. Their plea had added that the Jalandhar divisional deputy director had cancelled the land deeds; they had also challenged the order of the director of rural and panchayat department. The panchayat filed a case for cancellation of two leases of 196 acre of panchayat land executed in 2015 and 2017 with the Jalandhar divisional deputy director, Jagwinderjit Singh Sandhu, for violation of Village Common Land (Regulations) Acts 1961. In October 2020, Sandhu quashed the two leases. The private landowners appealed and the commissioner, panchayat lands, ordered that the 2015 lease shall continue till its term, while the 2017 lease was quashed.After this, the panchayat moved the high court. “Private cultivators have usurped 196 acre of panchayat land for a very meagre amount of less than ₹5,000 per acre whereas prevailing actual approximate rate of lease of similar land in Gaggrewal or surrounding areas is over ₹30,000 per acre, which comes out to about ₹60 lakh. Private cultivators have caused a huge loss to gram panchayat,” the panchayat’s plea said, adding, “The panchayat urges the court to stay the order passed by commissioner panchayat lands till pendency of matter.”Deputy director writes to BDPO for implementationOn Friday, divisional deputy director Sandhu, has written a letter to Khadoor Sahib BDPO for the implementation of court order in the case. “Keep vigil on the crop and the money after its sale should be deposited in the divisional deputy director account immediately after the harvesting of the crop. If police assistance is required, it will be taken at your level on the basis of court order,” the letter says. It adds that if the high court’s orders are not followed, then the BDPO’s responsibility will also be fixed, along with action against the private cultivators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tarn-taran-panchayat-land-dispute-harvest-wheat-but-deposit-sale-proceeds-with-govt-hc-to-7-private-cultivators-101617992475284.html

The bail prayer in the Dumka treasury casewas postponed for April 16 by Justice Aparesh Kumar Singh after the CBI sought time to file its reply on the matter. Prasad's lawyer Kapil Sibal appearing through video- conferencing argued that the central probe agency was deliberately delaying the matter as it wanted to keep his client in the jail "due to political reasons." Accepting CBI counsel plea for more time, the court directed it to submit its counter-affidavit on the matter in the next three days and put the matter for hearing on April 16. The case relates to illegal withdrawal of ₹3.13 crore from the Dumka treasury in 90s in Bihar. Prasad continues to remain in jail pending bail in the Dumka treasury case. He has already acquired bail in three other cases of the multi-crore rupees fodder scam. Prasad is presently recuperating at AIIMS New Delhi where he was airlifted in January last. Devashri Mandal had filed Prasad's bail application in the High Court saying that the RJD chief has completed half of the sentence in the case so he should be allowed bail. The plea also cited poor health condition of septuagenarian Prasad. On February 19 last, the court had rejected bail to Prasad as he had falled short by 17 days to complete half of his sentencing. After completing the said period in jail, Prasad once again sought bail in the court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/lalu-prasad-yadav-s-hearing-on-bail-plea-postponed-by-a-week-101617991614741.html

Before this, schools in Bihar were scheduled to reopen on April 5 but was postponed to April 11 as the state saw rising infections. “The order of closure of schools (which was deferred from) April 5 to April 11 has been extended for one more week,” Nitish Kumar was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Bihar CM Kumar also said that adequate arrangements will be made for people returning to the state. He said that people arriving from Maharashtra will be tested for Covid-19 at railway stations. “Those arriving via trains from Maharashtra will be tested for Covid-19 at railway stations,” he said. The state government on Tuesday had instructed officials to ready quarantine centres at block level as people return from states witnessing a spurt in Covid-19 cases.Bihar government’s principal secretary Pratyaya Amrit said all shops will be permitted to remain open till 7pm in the state. Amrit also said restaurants, dhabas and hotels will be allowed to operate with 25% capacity while public transport and movie theatres can operate at 50% occupancy.

But for now, the target does not seem achievable as the government has cancelled the global bids invited for appointment of a consultant, nearly four months after zeroing in on the selection of a bidder. The decision was taken due to some lacunae in the process of examination/evaluation of the bidders, said officials. “The state government has cancelled the bids. However, the process is underway for the appointment of consultant to make UP a trillion-dollar economy,” said RK Tiwari, chief secretary. “For technical reasons we have cancelled the process of bidding for appointment of a consultant to draw a road map to boost the size of GSDP to one trillion dollars in five years (2020-2025). We are initiating the process of bidding afresh and hope to complete the same in the next two to three months,” said another officer. A notice with subject line ‘Request for proposal for selection of consultant to boost Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) of Uttar Pradesh to one trillion dollars in five years (2020-2025)’ was issued by special secretary, planning, in this regard. “The undersigned is directed to refer to the tender ID2020_DPUP509747_1 dated 10-09-2020 on the subject cited above and to say that the said tender process is hereby cancelled with the approval of the competent authority. Fresh tender notice in this regard is likely to be published soon,” said special secretary, planning, in the notice dated March 22, 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi had first floated the idea of UP’s trillion-dollar economy while speaking at the Uttar Pradesh Investors Summit-2018 on February 21, 2018. Modi said Maharashtra too had set a target to become a trillion-dollar economy. “Can Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh compete with each other to become trillion-dollar economies? Will UP government compete with other states? More the competition, more will be the investment. This will result in creation of more jobs and strengthen the concept of cooperative federalism,” said Modi at the summit in 2018. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath and his team began working on the idea soon thereafter. The state government began inviting suggestions and various rounds of discussions were held with reputed institutions on the issue. A formal process of floating global bids for appointment of a consultant began on June 19, 2020. The state government decided to revise the Request for Proposal (RFP) document and the timelines. The bidders were asked to submit their e-bids by October 9, 2020. The revised RFP expected the selected consultant to perform the ‘Herculean Task” of taking the size of UP’s GSDP to trillion dollars. In all, the state government received eight bids. Those who submitted the bids included a premier management institute of the country. Four of the bidders qualified the technical round and their financial bids were opened on November 27, 2020 and the authorities nearly zeroed in on the selection of a bidder as consultant. “UP government has already lost so much time in bidding to select a consultant. If they want to invite fresh bids, they should do so faster as they are losing precious time,” said Alok Ranjan, former UP chief secretary. The cancellation of bids is bound to upset the state government’s applecart. The state government is unlikely to achieve the objective of taking the size of GSDP to one trillion dollars in the next five years. “UP government’s objective of taking the size of GSDP to one trillion dollars is more of an aspirational goal than an achievable target in a given timeframe. Instead of setting short-term targets, the state government should come out with a long-term vision for the economy. The state government should emphasise on qualitative development instead of focusing on the size of GSDP,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor, department of economics, Lucknow University.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/roadmap-for-trillion-dollar-economy-up-govt-cancels-global-bids-for-appointment-of-consultant-101617984073084.html

He also directed officials to re-introduce ‘work from home’ (WFH) in offices in four districts – Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi and Kanpur City. “All government and non-government offices in these four cities should make provisions for ‘work from home’, as per convenience and operate with 50% human resource capacity or on shift basis,” said the chief minister during a high level Covid review meeting at his official residence in Lucknow.While the CM and Governor Anandiben Patel will meet political leaders on April 11, on the two subsequent days, they will meet mayors and religious leaders to discuss the situation and seek their participation to spread anti-Covid awareness.The CM instructed officials to set up three new dedicated Covid hospitals in Lucknow in the next three days. Yogi asked for a 300-bed Covid hospital at Balrampur Hospital and conversion of Era Medical College and TS Mishra Medical College into Covid hospitals. He asked officers to ramp up vaccination in Lucknow, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Agra, Gorakhpur, Meerut, and Varanasi. For effective prevention of Covid, action should be taken in accordance with the mantra of ‘test, trace, treat’, added Yogi. “The state must do two lakh Covid tests each day, of which half should be done by RT-PCR method,” said the CM.Yogi also issued guidelines for increasing the number of beds in Level-2 and Level-3 Covid hospitals.After reviewing the Covid-19 situation in the state, the CM decided to go for an on-the-spot review of steps taken in Prayagraj, Varanasi and Gorakhpur to contain the virus. Minister for medical education Suresh Khanna and minister for health Jay Pratap Singh, along with senior officers, were tasked to carry out the review in the remaining districts to bring about an improvement in the Covid situation. Meanwhile, preparations were on to make the ‘Teeka Utsav’ (vaccination festival) from April 11 to 14 a success across the state. At his video conferencing with chief ministers on Thursday evening, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had given a call to hold the ‘Teeka Utsav’ from April 11 to 14 to ensure more vaccinations for people in eligible age groups. Subsequently, the CM had asked officers to work out modalities for the vaccination festival. Focus on 10 dists accounting for over 50% of cases in UPLUCKNOW The UP government also braced for a strategy to check the spread of infection in 10 districts that accounted for over 50% of Covid cases across the state. At the moment, UP had 48,306 active cases and Lucknow accounted for 13,478 cases, Kanpur Nagar 2,477, Prayagraj 5,502, Varanasi 4,553, Ghaziabad 574, Gautam Budd Nagar 940, Meerut, 1,027, Gorakhpur 1,334, Bareilly 708 and Jhansi 972, as per the health department. “Districts accounting for more than 50% of the total cases in UP are in focus. The CM is visiting Prayagraj and Varanasi and will be going to Gorakhpur on Saturday. Minister for medical education Suresh Khanna has been sent to Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Meerut and Saharanpur while minister for medical and health Jay Pratap Singh Singh will be in Kanpur, Agra, Jhansi and Bareilly,” said Navneet Sehgal, additional chief secretary, information.Chief secretary RK Tiwari and additional chief secretary rural development Manoj Kumar Singh will review the Covid situation in Lucknow, he said.Chief secretary and ACS (rural development) would review the situation including availability of beds, medcines, medical equipment and ambulances along with the situation at the crematorium in Lucknow and give necessary directives for improvement, said officials.

09-04-2021||Pune||No shot given at 36 centres in Pune due to shortage; stock arrives at Friday night||Pune: After a week of vaccinating highest number of beneficiaries daily, not a single shot was given at 36 out of the 130 vaccination centres in Pune city on Friday. The administration awaits fresh stock supply even as politics over vaccine continues. Two days after state health minister Rajesh Tope said that there is shortage of vaccine which will hamper the vaccination drive, Pune Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders stated that the Centre has now started to directly supply vaccines to the district. Meanwhile, around 10 pm on Friday, Pune gets 1.25 lakh vaccines.On Monday, the district saw over 85,000 beneficiaries get vaccine in a single day which has been reducing ever since. On Thursday, only 54,000 got the vaccine at 427 sites of which 130 were from Pune city. On Friday, of these 130, only 94 could vaccinate beneficiaries as the 36 sites had to be shut because of shortage of vaccine. Many had to return home, especially those who had come through walk-in including those who had come for their second dose. Dr Anjali Tilekar, ward medical officer of Kothrud-Bavdhan said that only 150 shots were given in Sutar Hospital. BJP leader and MLA Siddharth Shirole tweeted on Friday evening, “The Central government has now started direct supply of vaccine to Pune. 2.48 lakh vaccines have already arrived today, additional 1.25 lakh will reach the district by Sunday.” Pune major Murldihar Mohol also assured that vaccination would continue in the city on all days, including weekends. He said, “Out of the total stock of vaccines which would arrive to Pune, 40% would go to PMC, 40% to Pune rural and 20% to PCMC.” Even as BJP leaders made these claims, as of late Friday evening, the administration still awaited its fresh stock of vaccine. Zilla Parishad CEO Ayush Prasad said, “We have got the message that the vaccines would reach Pune shortly, but we do not know how they would come and where we would have to collect them? As in directly from Serum Institute, or the airport or we will have to go to Mumbai to collect it. We have our vehicles ready to collect as soon as we get the message.” Another PMC health official also confirmed that by late Friday evening the stocks had not yet arrived. The official said, “As of now we have created the session sites for vaccination at PMC hospitals and the private hospitals would decide for their centres depending on their available stock. We are hoping to get some stock by late night.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/no-shot-given-at-36-centres-in-pune-due-to-shortage-stock-expected-by-friday-night-101617982872817.html
09-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra records another highest single-day spike with 58,993 fresh Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra on Friday recorded nearly 59,000 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 301 related deaths, even as the health minister Rajesh Tope said a lockdown can be imposed in the state if the infections continued to surge. With the new cases and fatalities, Maharashtra’s tally stands at 3,288,540 and the death toll at 57,329, according to the state health department bulletin. Maharashtra, which is the worst-hit region in the country and witnessing the second wave of the pandemic that began around February 11, reported 56,286 new Covid-19 cases and 376 deaths on Thursday. The state recorded 59,907 cases on Wednesday, its highest daily spike since the beginning of the pandemic. “We would need a complete lockdown for 15 days to three weeks even though I am not in favour of that immediately. If hospitals are overwhelmed, if there is a shortage of medicines and if the government is unable to cope with the growing number of patients then such a step can be taken," Tope told a television channel.However, Tope said he was hopeful that the government would be able to check the surge with the curbs which are already in place. Officials also said that the government was considering extending the weekend lockdown beyond Monday.Mumbai's tally of the coronavirus disease crossed the 500,000-mark on Friday as the city reported 9,200 new cases and its death toll mounted to 11,909 after 35 patients died, according to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Mumbai’s caseload mounted to 5,00,898. The civic body’s data also showed that the number of deaths reported on Friday is the highest since October 26 last year, when 37 Covid-19 patients succumbed. The state’s capital city recorded 8,938 cases and 25 deaths on Thursday. The city has added nearly 100,000 new cases in the last 12 days. The state’s health department has said the number of active Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra is likely to cross 1,100,000 by April 30 in the absence of adequate measures to control the spread of the virus. “We are recording more cases than we predicted. The state has already recorded 50% more active cases during this wave, in comparison to the previous wave in September 2020. If cases increase in this proportion, by April 17 we will have around 568,000 active cases,” Pradeep Vyas, the state health department principal secretary, said on Wednesday.Officials have said the surge in the cases of the coronavirus disease caused stress on the health infrastructure in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-records-another-highest-single-day-spike-with-58-993-fresh-cases-101617981680863.html

09-04-2021||Pune||229 villages in Pune district are yet to report first Covid case||Even as Pune district continues to remain the most affected district in the country, with maximum active Covid-19 cases and daily Covid-19 fresh cases, there are 229 villages in the district which have not reported a single Covid-19 case since the pandemic began last year. The secret has been Covid-appropriate behaviour and a successful quarantine of those travelling to the city for work or trade purposes. Of the 1,405 villages under the Pune Zilla Parishad, 229 have been able to successfully live a Covid-free life. These villages have not reported a single Covid-19 positive case since March 2020. These 229 villages account for a population of 0.6-0.7 million of the 5.2 million rural Pune population. The villages have successful drives to detect SARI and ILI patients and also have penalised people for not wearing masks. Ayush Prasad, chief executive officer (CEO) of Pune Zilla Parishad said, “These villages do have people who travel to the city or town area for trade and work purposes. However, the containment measures are so successful in these villages that they have bene able to keep the virus at bay for over a year now. The Covid- appropriate behaviour has been considered as asocial practice and so even though there are no cases, people are penalised for not wearing masks and anyone travelling to the city for any work is quarantined upon their return.” Prasad added: “In some of these villages while there have been cases in nearby villages, they have remained untouched. We also have 200-odd villages who have reported single digit Covid19 cases. These positives are also of those who were migrants and there was no local transmission in these 200 villages.” Theses 229 gram panchayat’s with no cases are from talukas connected to the city including Haveli, Ambegaon, Bhor, Khed, Mulshi, Maval, Purandar, Shirur, Junnar and Velha among others.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/229-villages-in-pune-district-are-yet-to-report-first-covid-case-101617980532400.html

09-04-2021||Mumbai||Malavika’s Mumbaistan: Cinema Paradiso||There are many ways to map the evolution of a city, but perhaps none as meaningful as through its cinemas — those darkened temples of dreams and desires where the real and the reel and the personal and the public meld so tantalisingly. These days, with the unceremonious ease by which we call up movies on OTT platforms, our ADHDs in full throttle as we frolic wantonly between Oscar winners, sci-fi thrillers, classic romances and run- of- the-mill new releases, does anyone recall the stately thrall with which the city’s cinemas once held us? From the flea-infested Lido of our suburban childhood where we’d be dragged by nannies to see mythological tear jerkers, to the silk and velvet- curtained, embellished-ceilings of Metro, Eros and Regal and that Golden Triangle of peerless entertainment that was Sterling, New Empire and Excelsior (with Vithal’s Bhelpuri and Waikiki at convenient equidistance), to the post-liberalisation, polished sheen and deep pile carpets of the latter day multiplexes — watching a movie used to be a singular occasion, one which had rites and rituals all of its own. First, one had to secure one’s entry into the promised land. In the days before internet and BookMyShow, this meant a trip to the theatre where the film was showing and yes, standing in the “advance booking” queue. This could take anything between a few minutes to an hour (the queues outside Metro during the screening of Bobby disrupted traffic at Dhobhi Talao so much that bus conductors would refer to it as the ‘Bobby’ stop), but it was a passage of time, brimming with opportunity. For here, you would be afforded an introduction to others who had the same tastes as you; plainly speaking, this meant people who were as crazy as you to wait in a long line under a hot sun to secure their three hours (counting the trailers, advertisements, Films Division newsreel and intermission) of preferred pleasure. Believe me when I say that it aced any algorithm Mark Zuckerberg could ever have invented. When released at Eros, Woodstock had been a festival of bandanas and blue jeans; Love Story at the New Empire saw a hall full of weeping girls with Ali McGraw eyebrows, and The Young Ones at Regal attracted a posse of the city’s puffs; and it would not be wrong to say many a young girl met a many a young boy in these propitious circumstances (and went on to watch many a future film together as a couple). But even before you gained access to the movie of your choice, you had to cross the first gatepost: your inquisitor behind the box office window, pointing impatiently at his hand-drawn seating chart. This would be your moment of reckoning — the snooty Dress Circle or the plebeians stalls? The above-board, good-intentioned, middle-of-the-hall family seat or the college hooky player’s last row, or worse still, the horny teenager’s darkened corner for an afternoon of unbridled necking? Of course, you might have been one of those whose cinema -going escapades were more spontaneous, requiring you to resort to the “current booking” queue. Here too, you’d be faced with soul-searing questions: Wait your turn and risk the horror of a “houseful” sign appearing? Or dare to descend into the dark world of the neighbourhood friendly black marketeer, ever at hand with his sideways hiss? Nevertheless, whichever way you earned your seat, you would be undoubtedly attired in your Sunday best as you entered the cinema’s portals; and by the time you were greeted by its heady whoosh of central air-conditioning, redolent with the aroma of popcorn, sickly sweet colas and mayo-drenched chicken rolls, you’d already be transported. And what a trip it was: The audience at the Regal screaming in faux-fright during the screening of Titanic as the ship appeared to tilt into the hall; the Eros turning in to a choir of little girls during My Fair Lady as they sang along with Audrey Hepburn; a spate of macho-moxie at the Strand where Mackenna’s Gold and the Terence Stamp Bud Spencer franchise played on for weeks. And the food! Mutton patties at Regal; chilled cold coffee and Coca Cola from a dispensing machine at Metro; chicken Rolls and Punjabi samosas at Eros; softie ice cream at the New Empire. If anything, the advent of multiplexes turned the cinema experience into even more of a moveable feast. Now you could pre-book your order of multigrain dahi papdi chaat and veggie stix sour cream and have it delivered to your seat as you snuggled under a fluffy blanket. Of course, traditionalists bemoaned the fact that multiplexes lacked the art deco grandeur of standalone theatres. And yes, their assembly line proximity could be the cause of occasional hilarity. A dotty old aunt who went to see Dhoom but had mistakenly wandered into the auditorium screening Shrek 2 only realised her error during the film’s intermission; and yes, the vegetarian in urgent need of his chunky chaat often received a portion of someone else’s junglee chicken. No matter, these were minor hazards compared with the thrill of reclining in a darkened hall, among strangers when your chosen movie began, heralded, of course, by a furious whooshing and shushing and last-minute coughing. How thrilling to be suspended in that undiluted mass of human emotion and allow yourself to be charmed, seduced, frightened out of your wits, or to shed a silent tear, so separately and yet so concurrently. And then, of course there was the leaving of the theatre — as singular an experience as that of entering it; walking en masse on shaky legs through the exits and down mysterious labyrinths of stairs, while your eyes slowly got accustomed to the bright lights and your mind hovered dreamily between the show reel of images and stories you’d just witnessed and the demands and duties of your post-movie day. Indeed, there are many ways to trace the evolution of a city, but perhaps none as meaningful as through its cinemas; why is it then so hard to gauge from this journey of 70-mm screens and stereophonic sound to the 11-inch screens on our smart phones, whether our lives have been enhanced or diminished in the process?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/malavikas-mumbaistan-cinema-paradiso-101617977893483.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi shuts schools over rising Covid-19 cases. These states have already closed them||Authorities across states have been forced to take immediate measures to curb the spread of infections amid the growing number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases. Several states, including Delhi, Punjab, Maharashtra and Uttar Pradesh, have shut down schools and colleges. Not just this, some states have also postponed examinations for Classes 8, 9 and 11 and board exams for Classes 10 and 12 to curb the pandemic. Schools and colleges had shut down in March last year, ahead of the national lockdown, to curb the spread of the disease but institutions had reopened as caseload subsided.Here are some of the states where schools have been closed again:1. Delhi: Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday announced that all schools and colleges will be closed in the national capital given the massive rise in coronavirus disease cases.2. Maharashtra: The Maharashtra government has said that students from Classes 1 to 8 will be promoted to the next class without any examination. Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray tweeted, "In view of the ongoing situation due to Covid-19, all state board students across Maharashtra state from Class 1st to Class 8th will be promoted to the next class without any examinations. A decision regarding students of Class 9th and 11th will soon be taken."3. Bihar: The Bihar government has extended its order and asked all schools, colleges and coaching centres to remain shut till April 18. "Order for closure of schools from April 5 to April 11, has been extended for one week," Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar said on Friday.4. Uttar Pradesh: Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath has ordered schools to remain closed for Classes up to 8 till April 11.

As the appointment of the three secretaries takes the total number of All India Congress Committee (AICC) secretaries to nine, the party leaders have begun talking about the likely changes when the Congress gets a new president in coming months and how they may help AICC general secretary (incharge UP) Priyanka Gandhi Vadra in accomplishing her UP mission. “We are looking at a larger national level role for AICC general secretary (in charge for Uttar Pradesh) Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. She has already begun moving out to campaign for the party in other states. We understand some of the AICC secretaries working in the state will also be moved out. AICC secretary Rana Goswami is contesting elections in Assam and he has been practically relieved of his responsibility here,” said a senior Congress leader. As major changes in the Congress in coming months have become a talking point, the party men are again demanding that Rahul Gandhi should be convinced about assuming role as party president and Priyanka Gandhi Vadra be given a larger role in the party organisation. “UP’s party men want a larger role for Priyanka Gandhi Vadra. We hope Rahul Gandhi will agree to take over as president if the party goes for a new leader after elections to five state assemblies and announcement of results on May 2, ” said the leader. AICC secretary Zubair Ahmad, who was appointed in charge for panchayat elections in UP along with AICC secretary Dheeaj Gurjar, said the party men in the state had been making the demand in this regard and a decision would be taken only by the party high command. Khan said the three secretaries had been appointed to strengthen the party organisation in the state and some of the party’s secretaries may be shifted. He said work was allotted to seven secretaries who were made in charges of 8 to 12 districts to oversee the party’s preparations and support for candidates in panchayat polls in the state. It may be mentioned that on March 27, AICC general secretary KC Venugopal had issued an order appointing three AICC secretaries Rajesh Tiwari, Tauquir Alam and Pradeep Narwal for the state. Other AICC secretaries attached to the general secretary in charge Priyanka Gandhi include Zubair Khan, Rohit Chaudhary, Dheeraj Gurjar, Baji Rao Khade, Sachin Naik and Rana Goswami. “Rajiv Tiwari is working with Chhatisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel. Earlier, he worked for training of the UPCC team. Chattisgarh’s team will now be camping in some districts for panchayat elections,” said another leader. “Changes are always made for the better. The party is bringing in leaders who have worked at the ground level and have remained involved in training programmes earlier. We are sure the changes will strengthen Priyanka Gandhi Vadra’s mission for Uttar Pradesh,” said Congress spokesman Surendra Rajput.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-poised-for-major-changes-in-coming-months-101617970750803.html

The state government’s recovery of tax revenue in 2020-2021 fell short only by 3.3 per cent against the previous year, earning a revenue of 1.23 lakh crore (2020-2021) against the revenue of ₹1.19 lakh crore in 2019-2020. “Our revenue from taxes from April 1, 2020 to March 31, 2020 is only 3.3 per cent less than the amount recovered during the same period in 2019-2020,” said minister for finance Suresh Khanna while briefing media persons about the revenue recovery situation in the state in 2020-2021. Khanna said the state government had also received additional amount of about ₹8000 crore from the centre. He said the state government was to get a sum of about ₹1.52 lakh crore from the centre, which later revised the figures to only ₹1.40 lakh crore and later reduced this amount further to ₹98,000 crore only. “The centre has, however, given ₹1.06 lakh crore now as the tax collection went up there,” said Khanna. “This is in sync with the trends of increase in revenue observed since the lifting of lockdown in second quarter of 2020-2021. This is a good sign that the state government’s own revenue has been augmented by increase flow of resources from the centre. This also indicates that the state’s economic recovery is better than expected,” said Yashvir Tyagi, former professor, department of economics, Lucknow University. Khanna said the state government’s tax and non-tax recovery from March 1 to 31, 2021 had shown an increase of ₹3030.48 crore against the recovery in the same month in 2020. He said the state government collected a sum of ₹16,476.33 crore against ₹13,445.85 crore collected in March 2019. He said the collections under VAT and GST heads fell short of about ₹1095.74 crore with the state government getting revenue of ₹8769.15 crore against ₹9864.89 crore in 2019-2020. The GST and VAT collections remained 103 per cent of targets of ₹8471 crore. The state government’s recovery from excise was ₹2518.50 crore, 114.7 per cent of targets and it got ₹1247.06 crore from stamps and registration, 105.8 per cent of targets. The state government’s earning from transport was 154.33 crore, lower than the figures of 2019-2020 and 100.8 per cent of targets for 2020-2021. It may be mentioned that the state government’s estimated expenditure on payment of salary and pension etc. remains about ₹13000 crore to ₹15000 crore per month. The state government may have to spend more under the head as the freeze on DA announced during lockdown may end in the coming months. The state government will have to take measures to augment its revenue to meet committed expenditure and provide more funds for development projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-claims-faster-economic-recovery-101617970390750.html

The move comes in a bid to directly employ women as site managers and indirectly attract women to opt for MGNREGS employment. The state rural development department has already taken a first major step towards it. “The appointment will begin soon after the panchayat election results are out and new panchayats are formed,” said Yogesh Kumar, additional commissioner, MGNREGS, UP.In two successive orders, the department is making a provision for appointing women mates (job sites managers) across the state while also fixing the criteria on allocating one woman mate to every 20-40 workers. While one order to this effect was passed on international women’s day on March 8, the second one was issued on March 19. Not only this, to make speed up the appointment process, the government will select women mates from the existing women self-help groups (SHGs) in every panchayats. The first phase of panchayat polls are due on April 15 and the results will be declared on May 2.Also read: After Lucknow, UP’s Moradabad imposes night curfew to check Covid-19 casesDuring the Covid-19 pandemic, the state managed to employ a whopping 1.11 crore people - a workforce dominated by men. Now, the state has decided to introduce women mates for job-sites, all-women worksites, and women-specific jobs.As per data, Uttar Pradesh generated only 32.52% of women person-days of the 30.55 crore person-days of work generated in 2020-21. The state registered a whopping 87% increase in person-days generated against the previous year. Women’s share, however, remained unchanged in the last five years. In 28th position, UP ranked lowest in the country with only Jammu and Kashmir, and Lakshadweep falling below in women’s employment under the MNREGS. Kerala, Pudducherry, and Tamil Nadu were among the top rankers on women’s count with 91.41%, 87.04%, and 84.88% women person-days respectively. “We have zeroed in on some significant factors and have also prepared remedial strategies to attain 50-55% women participation in 2021-22 and we are starting with women mates,” said Kumar. According to the orders, the women mates will be selected by the respective gram panchayats, would be registered as semi-skilled workers, trained at the block development level and their emoluments will be between ₹315 to ₹405 per day, according to the existing wages range of various PWD (public works department) circles in the state. The direct mandate for the women mates will be to manage job sites - taking measurements of the job done by workers, muster-roll maintenance, attendance, arrangement for water, shade, creche, etc. “Socio-cultural set-up and physical intensive works are inhibiting factors behind the low female participation. Women do not like to work in men dominated worksites and on physically gruelling jobs. So, we have decided to introduce steps such as women mates and will introduce all-women worksites and women-specific works, such as plantation, gardening, nutrition gardens, nurseries or organic cultivations,” Yogesh said. He said the department would be able to employ at least 35,000 women as women mates across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/uttar-pradesh-to-soon-have-women-on-mgnregs-job-sites-101617967572577.html

09-04-2021||Pune||Slam dunk: Blending the art and science of coaching team sports||In team sports, the development of individual players is the responsibility of the coach, while simultaneously attempting to win as many games as possible in the most competitive leagues, such as the NBA and football’s English Premier League. Through years of observing the best coaches in the sport of basketball at its highest level, there are a few outstanding similarities that successful coaches share to benefit players. Some of the key factors in coaching and developing talented players revolve around intangibles, resulting in greater player motivation and effort, which enables an individual’s talent to shine through. The cumulative effect of talented individuals all performing at their best results in team success. Great coaches are deliberate about consciously giving their talented players a sense of autonomy. Athletes are often motivated by feeling like they are in control of a situation, and in the field of play an athlete is only as good as his or her ability to make decisions quickly and decisively. Giving players a choice and control over what they do includes them in the process of improvement and feeling a sense of responsibility to the success of the team. Examples of this can be seen when championship coaches such as Gregg Popovich and Steve Kerr allow their veteran players to lead timeout huddles, trusting that the players will be able to impart key concepts of game play and strategy to all members of the team. This increased autonomy gives players a sense of belonging to the group and helps them relate with their teammates during the game instead of being disconnected. Focusing on more tangible attributes that great coaches display, they often understand the concept of self-determination among their players and are therefore, very deliberate about the types of feedback they provide. It is clearly obvious that players respond differently to various types and frequency of feedback on their performances. The best coaches are adept at communicating roles, game situations, and technical skill execution pointers to their players in order to get the best performance out of them. Communicating these pieces of information at a sub-optimal time could result in over-thinking from the player and thus be detrimental to player performance in the complex environment of the game. The final critical piece of coaching is developing players’ ability to execute technical skills during gameplay. Elite coaches understand that technical skill execution in the game environment is the result of advanced decision-making and pattern recognition skills in their players. Players must first see and perceive a situation, after which they must utilise the technical skills available to them to perform an action that increases their teams’ chances of a successful outcome. The best coaches teach their players these concepts through constraints-led coaching techniques which allow players to harness the creativity in their technical skills to make quick decision that repeatedly produce positive outcomes. By teaching in this manner, coaches do not limit their players’ creativity and allow them to understand their individual strengths and weaknesses so that they can figure out what technical skills apply to each scenario presented to them in gameplay. In combination, the attributes and coaching techniques above employed by great coaches result in a greater degree of “automatic processing” from players during the fluid changing scenarios in a game. This developed sense of game intelligence will likely contribute to greater team success and positive outcomes in team sport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/slam-dunk-blending-the-art-and-science-of-coaching-team-sports-101617967031263.html

As per the NGO, this has led to the felling of close to 89,000 trees in Goa. The NGO has moved the Bombay High Court at Goa which has directed the ‘tree authorities’ of the North and South Goa districts that are set up under the Goa Preservation of Trees Act, 1984 to file status reports regarding their functioning. “Over a period of ten years, out of all the applications that were received for felling trees, 99.3% were approved and only 0.3% were rejected,” the foundation found through RTI applications. This, the NGO has said, is only the tip of the iceberg since trees are often felled without any permission, much less compensatory afforestation. Several calls to officers at various levels of the state forest department went unanswered. Deputy Conservator of Forests, Jabestin A, responded but refrained from commenting on the matter.According to data furnished by the NGO, between 2010 and 2019, the Forest Department received 4,041 applications for felling 88,978 trees. Out of the total 4,041 applications received, 2,537 were sanctioned and only 19 were rejected while the rest were kept pending. “A ratio of sanctioned to rejected applications is 99.26% and only 0.74 were rejected. However, the act stipulates that if a tree officer fails to communicate his permission or refusal within a specified period, it shall be deemed to have been granted. If the 1,444 pending applications are taken to be deemed to be sanctioned then the sanctioned to rejected ratio would be further abysmal,” NGO director Mohan Kumar said. “Failure to effectively oversee replantation of trees that have been felled has led to a loss of tree cover to the state of Goa and its residents to the tune of over 77000 trees. They claim that over 13,000 trees have been replanted but no data on the survival of such planted trees is visible,” the NGO said in its petition. “The state of Goa and its residents have lost nearly 74,445 trees due to the dereliction of duties shown by the respondent,” it added. “As a result, Goa is rapidly losing its tree cover, which poses severe challenges in the present and future. Damages caused by the negative impact of non-implementation of environmental legislation enacted to protect the environment have to be seen not only beyond their face value in the present but future damages too need to be taken into account,” the NGO said. The NGO has also alleged that the Goa Tree Authority has not been meeting at all despite being mandated to do so at least once every three months. The tree authority, which is constituted under the Goa Preservation of Trees Act, is tasked with the preservation of trees, carrying out a census of trees, setting standards for plantation of trees, development and maintenance of nurseries, overseeing planting and transplanting, among other responsibilities,“Between January 2010 and June 2019, the Tree Authority should have met at least 38 times as the tree act mandates it to meet at least once in every three months but going by the submissions, it seems that the Authority has been dormant, non-functioning and has failed to discharge its duties ever since its constitution in 1998,” the NGO said in its petition before the High Court. The State Forest Department has been given time till April 28 to file its reply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/goa-forest-department-sanctions-99-tree-felling-applications-says-ngo-hc-seeks-response-101617964256066.html

09-04-2021||Chandigarh||Resume talks with farmers: Haryana minister to Centre amid Covid surge||Worried about the huge presence of agitating farmers at the Delhi border amid the Covid-19 second wave, Haryana health and home minister Anil Vij on Friday said he will write to Union agriculture minister Narendra Singh Tomar to restart the dialogue with farmers and break the logjam. “The presence of such a huge crowd of farmers at Haryana’s borders is a matter of worry for me. The Covid-19 infection is spreading at an alarming speed. I have to shield (protesting) farmers also from the virus,” Vij told reporters on Friday, saying the state government will discuss and act on all directions Prime Minister Narendra Modi gave on Thursday, including night curfew. Also read: ‘No plan to curtail train services’: RailwaysReiterating the significance of dialogue in hammering out solutions of complex problems, Vij said he will soon write to Tomar to resume talks with the farmers, who have been protesting against the Centre’s three farm laws. He said dialogue is the only way to diagnose the problems of the farmers so that those gathered at the Haryana-Delhi border call off the stir. Protests leave BJP-JJP leaders red-faced There is growing concern that the massive presence of agitating farmers at Delhi border has the potential to become a superspreader event. Also, another worry of BJP-JJP government in Haryana is borne by the fact that the protesting farmers and the organisations supporting them have not been allowing BJP-JJP leaders to hold public functions in the state. Such is the situation that chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar has been holding virtual ceremonies (via videoconferences) to inaugurate developmental projects. Not just this, every now and then BJP-JJP leaders are being left red-faced by the boycott calls given by farmers who are not allowing leaders to enter villages. Stricter guidelines on gatherings in place With coronavirus cases increasing, the Haryana government has imposed fresh curbs on indoor and outdoor gatherings, besides funerals from April 5. While the gathering at funerals has been restricted to 50 people, at indoor events, 50% of the hall capacity and not more than 200 people will be allowed to assemble. For outdoor functions, the state government has allowed 500 people to assemble. “The new guidelines issued on Sunday are being implemented strictly in order to wipe out the virus,” Vij said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/resume-talks-with-farmers-haryana-minister-to-centre-amid-covid-surge-101617962215710.html

The Speaker said that police had to be deployed that day along with marshals due to a significant shortage of Vidhan Sabha security personnel. “Nobody can be given the right to cross the ‘Lakshman Rekha (line)’ of decency and decorum – be it a member or any police official. Decent behaviour with the members is expected in all circumstances. There can be no compromise with the honour of the members. The dignity of the House is supreme,” the Speaker said, asking the officials to examine the footage to identify the guilty. Bihar Special Armed Police Bill, 2021 was passed on March 23 by the Bihar Assembly. As per reports, police were deployed inside the House without any debate to evict the protesting members amid unprecedented scenes. The assembly witnessed over half a dozen adjournments and ransacking of tables and chairs by an angry Opposition. Many of the members had to be forcibly evicted by the police. IG, Patna, Sanjay Kumar Singh refused to on the matter. “When there is any development, we will share,” he added.During the meeting, the CCTV footage of the Vidhan Sabha and the footage made available by leader of opposition and Rashtriya Janata Dal (RJD) leader Tejashwi Prasad Yadav was examined. The Speaker directed Vidhan Sabha in-charge secretary Bhudev Rai to make all possible footage connected with that day’s turn of events available to the two officers. Tejashwi also wrote to the Speaker on April 3, demanding the sacking of the guilty police officials who, he said, “brutally assaulted the members at the behest of the state government while discharging their democratic right”. Yadav asked the officials to ensure strong actions against the policemen responsible for unruly behaviour against the members after identifying them through an examination of audio-video footage of the House’s proceedings and circumstantial evidence. Barely two days after the unsavoury incident, Sinha asked additional chief secretary (home) Chaitanya Prasad and DGP SK Singhal to identify the police officials who resorted to indecent behaviour with the legislators. Sinha has also asked for a report in this regard and called for the video footage of that day for a thorough review by the ethics committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-speaker-calls-for-strong-action-against-policemen-for-unruly-behaviour-with-legislators-101617959995436.html
09-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Crowding at Mumbai’s outstation train terminuses not due to migrants’: Rail authorities||Railways authorities on Friday said that crowds at outstation train terminuses in Mumbai are not because of migrants workers rushing back to their states given the Covid-19 lockdown but the summer-time rush of people returning to their native places. A Central Railway official said, “videos and images of people crowding inside outstation trains and on platforms are old and fake”. “We have cross-checked the serial numbers outside the train compartments in the videos and pictures that are being circulated and they do not match with the trains operating. No unreserved passengers are allowed to travel. The passengers have booked their train travel earlier,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relation officer, Central Railway.Both Central and Western Railway said they were allowing only travellers who have booked the tickets in advance due to Covid-19 rules. Such rush is seen every year during the summer vacations and to cope with the demand, they are also plying unscheduled or special trains, they added.The Central and Western Railway also suspended railway platform tickets on all railway stations in the city to prevent those who rush to stations without a valid ticket for travel.Four special outstation trains towards Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Assam have been planned by the Central Railway.Also read: Covid-19 - No more platform tickets at these Maharashtra railway stationsThe Western Railway will be also be operating 14 special outstation trains. Further, with the increase in the number of passengers, additional special outstation trains will be planned.Railway authorities have registered a complaint with the Government Railway Police (GRP) cybercrime cell regarding the spread of old videos of crowding inside the outstation train compartments.Further, the railway authorities have also clarified that there has been no panic booking among passengers till now.“There has been no panic booking till now. We have our commercial and Railway Protection Force (RPF) teams deployed to monitor the on-ground situation,” said Shalabh Goel, divisional railway manager, Central Railway.The number of coaches in special outstation trains are also being increased by the railways.“We are increasing the number of coaches in outstation trains as we witness the increase in the number of waitlist passengers. In March, 575 coaches were added to clear passenger rush. Crowding on railway stations is also being witnessed as passengers are coming four to five hours before train scheduled.” said Alok Kansal, general manager, Western Railway. Transport experts have asked the state government to deploy volunteers outside railway stations. “Volunteers should be deployed outside railway stations to guard and ensure no crowding takes place. The volunteers should also take down details of passengers travelling in order to track their movements. This will particularly help to monitor the crowd and stop the spread of the virus,” said transport expert Ashok Datar. Meanwhile, experts have cautioned against overcrowding citing the worsening state of Covid-19 infections. “Any type of overcrowding is a super spreader. Last year, when people were going back and reaching destinations, tracking and symptom inspection were being done. This will be helpful now as well. An exit swab or antigen test on reaching the destination will help. Anybody moving across borders should be monitored. Symptoms should be checked or home isolation must be done,” said epidemiologist Dr Lancelot Pinto.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/crowding-at-mumbai-s-outstation-train-terminuses-not-due-to-migrants-rail-authorities-101617959695521.html

Ltd. The court helt that the complaint filed was not in confirmation with the law prescribed.In an order released earlier this week, sessions judge Uday Padwal said Trimukhe’s complaint was not according to Section 199 of Criminal Procedure Code. As per the said law, the public prosecutor has to be the complainant, which was not so in Trimukhe’s case where he was listed as the complainant.“The sanction to make a complaint is also given to the public prosecutor and not to Shri. Trimukhe. Therefore, the present complaint ought to have been made by the public prosecutor alone, which is not the case here,” the court observed while dismissing the complaint.Also Read | TRP scam: Maharashtra to complete probe against Republic TV in 12 weeks“He has the remedy to make a complaint before the competent magistrate. His filing the complaint even through the public prosecutor, however, would not confer any jurisdiction on this court to take cognizance of the alleged offence,” court said.In his complaint filed on February 2, Trimukhe claimed that Goswami made several defamatory statements against him during a panel discussion pertaining to the phone records of actor Rhea Chakraborty, in connection with actor Sushant Singh Rajput’s death on June 14, 2020. Trimukhe claimed that the discussion was posted on the company’s YouTube channel on August 7 the same year.The police officer alleged that the same content was also published on the microblogging platform, Twitter, by Goswami later on. “Accused No. 1 (Goswami) has published several defamatory tweets and has essentially reiterated and re-circulated the contents of the defamatory telecast to an even larger audience by means of Twitter. The tweets are without context and have been wilfully circulated to damage the complainant’s reputation,” states the complaint.“The accused persons are well aware that investigation into the death of late Mr. Sushant Sing Rajput (being a well-known Bollywood star) will garner significant public interest. The accused persons, instead of conducting themselves as responsible journalists (self-proclaimed) / citizens, have chosen to profit from the situation by sensationalising and scandalising the same, and using Mr Sushant Singh Rajput’s death and photograph (by tagging him) to disseminate the story to as many people as possible, all the while intending to defame the complainant,” read the complaint||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/court-dismisses-ips-officer-s-defamation-case-against-arnab-goswami-101617955794927.html

This breaks the previous Guinness World Record by over 82 days! On achieving this new feat, Sufiya says, “I’m ecstatic at the moment! The run was gruelling and tested me on various stages, but I was bent on completing this attempt at a world record, while spreading the message of hope (humanity, openness, positivity and equality) that has been my motto in all my runs.” This was Sufiya’s second attempt at completing the Golden Quadrilateral run. “I had started in early 2020, and even reached Maharashtra when the lockdown was announced. I got stuck there for over two months and eventually had to forfeit the attempt and had to fly back home. But that made my resolve to complete the run stronger!” recalls Sufiya, adding, “On 16 December 2020, I set out once again from Delhi, and finally chased my target by finishing at India Gate on April 6... I kept a steady target to cover 60 kms per day. I don’t have a crew, doctor or therapist. Vikas, my partner, travels with me and acts as my coach, guide, and therapist. And the circumstances during this run often went against us. Right before I reached Bengaluru, I developed a severe case of food poisoning. But I continued my run after taking medicines and a drip. It’s easy to train the body, but it’s harder to train the mind. Anything can be achieved if one remains positive in the face of adversity!”The 35-year-old started running in 2017, after a tiring job in the aviation industry left her with no time for the gym. “I used to feel lethargic all the time since I worked night shifts. My partner Vikas, who is a cyclist himself, motivated me to start running, and that’s how my tryst with long distance running happened,” recalls Sufiya, who in spite of the financial challenges quit her job to pursue running full time. Previously a Guiness Record Holder for being the first and fastest female in the world to run from Kashmir to Kanyakumari, Sufiya says she found immense support from various people in the country, during her last run. “India really is incredible. Various running groups in different cities accompanied me in different legs of the journey. Someone would hand me a water bottle without even knowing what I was participating in. There is so much warmth in people, no matter where they are from. This is what inspires me, and I want to spread the message of love and positivity among others through my runs.” “In 2023, I’m planning to run around the world and cover a distance of 30,000 kms. I believe in the idea of Vasudhaiva Kutumbakam, which means that the world is one family. Amid all the differences in the world, it’s running gives me the opportunity to explore different places and meet different people. That is what I hope to continue,” she concludes.

09-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi to begin sero surveillance from Monday, 28,000 samples to be collected||After a gap of two months, Delhi is gearing up to conduct its sixth round of sero-surveillance from Monday, according to senior officials from the health department. The survey will measure the increase in the number of people exposed to the infection between January and April. The protocol followed for the current round of the survey will be the same as the previous round – just over 100 samples will be collected at random from each of the 272 municipal wards in the city. The total sample size will be 28,000. The fifth serological survey in Delhi to detect Covid-19 antibodies showed that 56.13% of the 28,000 people sampled tested positive, the government said in February.Also Read | Herd immunity difficult to achieve: AIIMS director Randeep GuleriaThe questionnaire will ask for a history of vaccination and previous infection in people whose blood samples are collected to test for the presence of antibodies against Sars-CoV-2 virus. “The participants for the survey will be selected at random and not depending on whether they have been vaccinated. However, since the vaccination drive started between the two surveys, we will naturally ask the participants for their history of vaccination,” said a senior official from the health department, requesting anonymity. Without the information about a participant receiving the jab, there is no way of knowing whether the antibodies developed are due to an infection or vaccination. The test kits used for the surveillance are qualitative ones, meaning they can just tell whether a person has the antibodies or not. They cannot measure the level of the antibodies. “The kits used for sero-surveillance tel us whether a person has antibodies against Sars-CoV-2. Whether through vaccination or through natural infection, the antibodies developed are similar and protect against another infection. Also, if the researchers collect data on the date that a person received the shot, we might be able to guess after what time they develop antibodies,” said Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the department of community medicine at Safdarjung Hospital. The previous round of sero-surveillance, for which the data was collected between January 11 and 21, found that 56% of Delhi residents had antibodies against Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19. The number was higher still in south-east district where the prevalence of antibodies was 62%. The experts had believed that the high sero-prevalence led to the slowing down of the disease spread in December and January. However, the infection has picked up pace again with cases surging in the city. Delhi reported 7,437 new cases of the infection on Thursday. Delhi’s first serological survey was done in June-July and it had shown that 23.4% of people surveyed had developed antibodies against the virus. Similar surveys in August showed that 29.1% of people had antibodies, 25.1% in September, and 25.5% in October.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-begin-sero-surveillance-from-monday-28-000-samples-to-be-collected-101617949794565.html

If there are any violations, we will act against shopkeepers based on the orders from state government,” said PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar.

09-04-2021||Other||Odisha to hand over unused govt buildings, ponds to women self-help groups||In more sops to the women self-help groups in Odisha, the Naveen Patnaik government on Thursday directed the district administrations to hand over unutilised government properties such as government building, shops, ponds to them so that they can use them.“All such unused government property in the block, panchayat and district levels should be handed over to the local Mission Shakti SHGs within two months. Once these assets are under the control of women SHGs, these groups will manage the unused property for the betterment of the locals and society,” said chief minister Naveen Patnaik.Incidentally, the announcement has come about a week before the bypolls to the crucial Pipili assembly seat. Though the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) held the seat, the party is facing a tough fight from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP).“The move to give more work to the SHGs would definitely add to their confidence and provide more money in their hands. It’s a concrete step towards women empowerment and in line with chief minister Naveen Patnaik’s faith in women of Odisha carving a separate niche in the society,” said Pratap Deb, BJD spokesman.Though the women SHGs existed in Odisha in the 90s, they got a separate identity when the BJD, under chief minister Naveen Patnaik, rode to power in 2000. A year after becoming the CM, Patnaik started the Mission Shakti programme and began the formation of these SHGs. The self-help groups were started to organise women into groups for holistic empowerment and targeted livelihood activities. Today, there are a little over 6 lakh SHGs in Odisha under Mission Shakti with 70 lakh members.These SHGs take loans from banks and provide small non-agricultural loans to their members at a high interest rate, make packaged ready-to-eat fortified power food for children in anganwadi centres and look after the mid-day meal schemes of state’s schools.In 2020-21, at least 2 lakh SHGs were given credit linkages worth ₹3,411 crore. For SHG groups that take loans up to ₹3 lakh from banks and repay on time, the state government takes care of the interest payment. The government now plans to give interest-free loans, up to ₹5 lakh each, to these women SHGs instead of the current ₹3 lakh. The government is also planning to provide ₹50 lakh to each SHG federation in a block for the construction of special mission Shakti Griha.Also Read: Negative RT-PCR report compulsory for people coming to OdishaApart from providing small loans to the members, these SHGs are also engaged in a variety of works, including the collection of power tariff from consumers. A little more than a year ago, the government tied up with e-commerce platforms Amazon and Flipkart to help the SHG members gain access to a bigger market. An exclusive Mission Shakti e-commerce portal is also being developed in collaboration with the Tata Trusts to market women SHGs products online. In May 2019, the Naveen Patnaik government approved the provisioning of services and goods for different government departments through Mission Shakti, which would provide direct business worth ₹1,000 crore to the SHGs every year.The growth of SHGs in Odisha over the last 20 years is also matched by the rising participation of women in elections. In 2000, when Naveen Patnaik was first elected as the CM, only 55.6% of the women electorate cast their votes as against 63.8% of men voters. In 2019 polls, close to 75% of the women electorate exercised their franchise as opposed 71% men. Over the last several assembly polls, the BJD, backed by the women voters, has done well.Last year during the Covid-19 pandemic, SHG groups in urban areas were engaged as implementing partners under the Urban Wage Employment Initiative. Apart from this, around 400 SHGs manufactured over 3.3 million masks for distribution among people last year. During the Covid-19 lockdown, when dry ration and vegetable shops were shut in rural Odisha, these groups distributed more than 9 million cooked meals through the free kitchen centres managed by them in Odisha’s gram panchayats.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/odisha-to-hand-over-unused-govt-buildings-ponds-to-women-self-help-groups-101617941032339.html

The daily number of cases dropped to around 130 in mid-February this year.“With cases surging, the CPMS has been reactivated. The system was launched in July 2020 for better management of Covid patients. The system also had an OTP-based interface that allowed family members of a Covid-19 to get regular update about their kin’s wellness,” said a senior official of the state government. All hospitals have been directed to log the details of Covid-19 patients in realtime and update the patient monitoring score at least four times a day. Also Read | Covid-19 in India: Hard lockdown ruled out, PM Modi says focus on testing“Hospitals have been directed to upload data related to the admission, treatment, discharge and death of a Covid-19 patient on the CPMS, including the early warning score and basic health parameters,” said a health department official. The system was put in place last year after several hospitals in Bengal drew flak from family members of Covid-19 patients who alleged that they were not getting any information about their kin undergoing treatment. At least 96 doctors were deployed and worked 24x7 to maintain the CPMS, including providing telemedicine to Covid-19 patients. Health experts have said that one of the primary reasons for the surge in cases in West Bengal are mass gatherings – road shows and public meetings - before the elections. “With elections going on, political parties are organising huge public rallies and roadshows every day and thousands of people are gathering together. Precautions such as social distancing and wearing masks have taken a back seat. Under such circumstances there has been a staggering rise in Covid-19 cases,” Sukumar Mukherjee, member of the expert committee that was set up in 2020 to advise chief minister Mamata Banerjee on pandemic-related matters, had said earlier this week. On February 26 when the Election Commission of India announced the poll schedule, there were 3,343 active cases in the state. On Thursday, the state reported 16,109 active cases in various state-run and private hospitals – a rise of nearly five times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/bengal-govt-reactivates-covid-patient-management-system-daily-count-crosses-2k-101617938751919.html

The report should be obtained not more than 72 hours before entry to the state. Besides, a Covid-19 negative report, a person can also produce a final vaccination certificate, an official order stated.In the order, the Special Relief Commissioner’s office said people coming to Odisha by any public transport, such as train, bus, aeroplane, or waterways etc., will have to produce a negative RT-PCR report obtained within 72 hours of entry or a final vaccination certificate (after two doses of vaccination). The SRC’s notification said people coming to Odisha without such a report shall have to undergo seven days of mandatory home or institutional quarantine.On Thursday, Odisha reported 879 new Covid cases.The state government has also suspended all public transport from Odisha to Chhattisgarh and vice versa till April 30. The transport department has been asked to set up Border Check Points at strategic locations/border entry points to manage the entry of incoming persons/vehicles.Meanwhile, Odisha chief secretary Suresh Chandra Mahapatra urged Railway Board chairman Suneet Sharma to cancel all passenger trains, including local and mail/express from Chhattisgarh with effect from April 10. Mahapatra said Indian Railways should ensure that all passengers travelling to Odisha, from anywhere by train, must have an RT-PCR negative test report not more than 72 hours old from the date of journey or a second dose vaccination certificate.Though the Covid-19 situation in Odisha is not alarming, officials said the cross border movements of people may worsen the situation in almost all border districts of Odisha. There has been a significant surge in Covid-19 cases in Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Andhra Pradesh.The state government has authorised the collectors of Sundargarh, Jharsuguda, Sambalpur, Bargarh, Balangir, Nuapada, Kalahandi, Nabarangpur, Koraput, Malkangiri, Ganjam, Gajapati, Rayagada, Keonjhar, Mayurbhanj and Balasore districts to set up and operationalise Temporary Medical Centres/Cluster Temporary Medical Centres as per the requirement to provide institutional quarantine facilities for people coming from other states. The expenditure for opening and running of such facilities shall be borne under the Chief Minister’s Relief Fund.Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik has requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to release ₹300 crore to the state for the management of the upsurge in the Covid-19 pandemic.“During 2020-21, Odisha requested for ₹400 crores under the Emergency Covid Response Plan but we received only ₹146 crores. In view of the new wave of Covid, it is requested that at least ₹300 crores be released to Odisha for 2021-22 for Covid Management,” Patnaik said.The chief minister also raised the issue about vaccine supply and requested the Centre to ensure an advance release of at least 10 days’ stock of vaccines for Odisha.“Odisha has been doing well in vaccination program with among the lowest wastage in the country and efficient system of administering the vaccine to eligible beneficiaries,” the CM said. “We have not been able to ramp up the vaccination due to supply issues. We are currently able to vaccinate 2.5 lakh people daily and have the capability to increase further. We request for at least 10 days of vaccine stock for Odisha,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/negative-rt-pcr-report-compulsory-for-people-coming-to-odisha-101617937911662.html

Deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal was also summoned by the central agency on Thursday and CBI was recording his statements till the time of going to press.In his statement, Singh submitted the printout of Patil’s chat with him, in which the ACP mentioned meeting Deshmukh, said a CBI official.CBI had also summoned advocate Jaishri Patil on Thursday to record her further statement, but she couldn’t appear as she had to attend the hearing of the appeal filed by Maharashtra government and Deshmukh, challenging the Bombay high court (HC) order which directed the central agency to conduct preliminary inquiry into the corruption allegations. “Singh has also handed over some other documents as evidence. As of now, we have recorded statements of Jaishri Patil, Singh, Patil and Vaze, and are investigating further,” the official said.Patil, whose statements were recorded on Wednesday too, said she will be visiting the Defence Research and Development Organisation guest house on Friday to give CBI her statement.Meanwhile, the CBI moved the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, seeking direction to the NIA to share the records related to the investigation into the Antilia explosives case.

09-04-2021||Noida||Covid-19: After Delhi, night curfews in Noida, Ghaziabad||District administrations in Noida and Ghaziabad on Thursday put in place curfews between 10pm and 5am till April 17 to arrest a surge in Covid-19 cases in the two Uttar Pradesh districts. All government and private educational institutions have also been barred from holding in-person classes till April 17.In separate orders, the two administrations said the movement of essential goods or commodities and medical and other essential services will be exempt from the restrictions.The order comes a day after Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath held a videoconference with officials of 13 high Covid-19 caseload districts and two days after the Delhi government imposed similar restrictions.Gautam Budh Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY clarified that all examinations, including practicals, will be held according to the schedule and are exempt from the school closure order.“We will aggressively enforce rules regarding wearing of masks and social distancing at public places and workplaces,” he said.Ghaziabad DM Ajay Shankar Pandey said, “We will review the situation after April 17. With restrictions in place, we hope the spread of the infection will be checked.”Central and state government officials and health care staff will be exempt from the night restrictions. Pregnant women and those in need of medical help too are not covered under the restrictions, the orders by the two administrations said.Suhas LY said those travelling towards and from the airports, railway stations and bus terminals will have to produce a copy of their ticket. “Any violation of this order will lead to action under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code and relevant sections of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, 2005,” he said.According to the state health bulletin, the Covid-19 tally in Gautam Budh Nagar district mounted to 26,821 on Thursday, as 134 more people tested positive for the infection, the highest single-day rise this year.Ghaziabad, meanwhile, added 108 cases on Thursday.Experts said the restrictions will have a “limited impact” because the city has no major spots for night life and that movement is usually limited after 10pm in any case.“It acts as a deterrent against night life, parties, restaurants and even late-night functions. When people know that there are restrictions, they will automatically prefer not to move out. However, officials should also consider closing markets early. Further, since they have started marking containment zones, there should be restriction on movement of people. Otherwise, there will be no check on the spread of the infection,” said Dr Lalit Kant, the former epidemiology and communicable diseases head at the Indian Council for Medical Research.On April 3, the state government rolled out directions for surveillance in containment zones.“Instead of night restrictions, authorities should focus on enforcement of Covid protocol in markets, weekly markets and other public places besides the containment zones... There is also a need to increase vaccination coverage,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Ghaziabad wing of the Indian Medical Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/covid19-after-delhi-night-curfews-in-noida-ghaziabad-101617912469030.html
09-04-2021||Chandigarh||We have no choice but to implement DBT for farmers, says Punjab FM Manpreet||Punjab finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal on Thursday said the state government has “no choice” but to implement the Centre’s mandated instruction on direct benefit transfer (DBT) of minimum support price (MSP) to farmers from the current procurement season that starts on April 10. Manpreet, after a lengthy discussion with Union food minister Piyush Goyal on this issue, said the Centre rejected the state government’s demand to give more time to implement DBT for farmers. Besides Manpreet, Punjab food minister Bharat Bhushan Ashu, PWD minister Vijay Inder Singla and Mandi Board chairman Lal Singh were present in the meeting. “Punjab ministers in the meeting agreed to implement the DBT for farmers from this season,” Union food secretary Sudhanshu Pandey told PTI. The Centre and Punjab, however, were able to reach a common ground on the issue of extension to the new system of giving farad (land record) at time of procurement of the produce, recovery of pending rural development fund (RDF) of the previous kharif procurement and release of incidental payments to the tune of Rs. 1,500 crore. “We had sought more time because in Punjab there is a traditional arhtiya system. ....But the GoI dismissed our demand. We tried a lot but they did not listen,” Badal told reporters after 2.30 hours of meeting. “We will have to implement the DBT for farmers from the current season itself and a new mechanism will be worked out,” he added. Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh has called a meeting with ‘arthiyas’ (commission agents) on Friday to discuss about a new mechanism ahead of wheat procurement that will commence from April 10. Punjab procures wheat and rice at MSP on behalf of the central government under the National Food Security Act (NFSA). Currently, MSP to farmers in Punjab is paid through arthiyas unlike directly to farmers’ bank accounts in other states. Citing reasons for rejecting Punjab’s demand, Badal said the central government was arguing that the food stock procured belongs to it and the state government is just an agent and should make payment directly to farmers. Union minister Goyal said the arhtiyas’ role in the procurement process will continue and they will get a fixed commission of ₹48 per quintal. However, the arhtiyas in Punjab said they will go on strike from April 10 and boycott the procurement process. “We will shut mandi operations and not allow procurement to take place,” said VK Kalra, head of a faction of arhtiyas’ association. There are 33,000 arhtiyas in the state and they are considered money bags for the political class for the reason that they handle the MSP to the tune of ₹60,000 crore every year for two procurements in rabi and kharif season and a 2% commission which make a whopping ₹1,200 crore. “Tomorrow, the CM will meet arthiyas and take them into the loop. We will develop a system that will give some protection to arhtiyas,” said Ashu. He said said the Centre has agreed to defer implementation of land records integration (required to track land ownership of farmers during procurement) by six months. On release of pending RDF to state, the minister said about 2% RDF is fixed for Punjab. The state is getting only 1% and the rest 2% is pending. “GoI is not happy with the justification given by us. They assured that GoI will release arrear of 2% fee if the state government gives a credible justification on where the funds have been spent,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/we-have-no-choice-but-to-implement-dbt-for-farmers-says-punjab-fm-manpreet-101617912348777.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||Covid-19 cases gallop in Capital: Delhi adds 7,437 infections, most since Nov 19||Cases of the coronavirus disease in Delhi are currently rising at a rate not seen even during the worst phases of the previous three waves of Covid-19 in the Capital, indicating that the fourth wave of infections is well on course to break all previous records, shows data analysed by HT.On Thursday, Delhi reported 7,437 new Covid-19 infections, the highest single-day increase in cases since November 19, even as the Covid-19 positivity rate – the fraction of tests that return positive – continued to rise and touched 8.1%.For the week ending on April 8, Delhi has now reported 4,684 new infections every day on average, the highest the seven-day average has touched since December 1. While in absolute numbers, this is the worst case rate in over three months, the numbers get far more alarming in terms of rate of increase.Just seven days ago, the seven-day average of daily cases was just 1,783. This means that in just a week, the rate of new infections has increased by 163%.This is a week-on-week growth rate much higher than what was witnessed in Delhi during any of the first, second or third waves, data shows. During the first wave (between early May and early July), the seven-day average of cases peaked at 3,446 and the week-on-week growth touched a high of 101%. In the second wave, which peaked at 4,174 cases in mid-September, the growth rate never went beyond 58%. Even during the third wave, when the seven-day average of new cases soared to 7,341 in mid-November, the week-on-week growth rate remained under 40%.A growth rate of 163% is the largest rate of increase in cases witnessed in the Capital since the first week of April last year. To be sure, in April 2020, the outbreak in India was just a month old (the first batch of cases were reported on March 3) and the volume of cases was significantly lower — Delhi was reporting around 50 new cases a day then.In fact, if cases stay on this course of growth for one more week, then the city may be reporting more than 10,000 cases a day — far beyond the third wave’s peak.The case-spike has the state government and experts worried.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain on Wednesday said, “The pace at which cases are increasing, we worry it might break the previous record. We cannot say anything for sure, but many other states have a higher positivity rate than Delhi.”The Capital added a record 8,593 cases on November 11, at the peak of the third wave of the infection in the city.Jain said the vaccination drive needed to be sped up and that the Delhi government has written to the Centre urging them to allow vaccinations for everyone above the age of 18.The Centre on Wednesday allowed states to start vaccination drives at workplaces, to speed up the pace of inoculations.The positivity rate in the city has also increased rapidly. Just a week ago, the positivity rate was 3.57%, while it was 1.8% seven days before that.Delhi’s positivity rate remained 1% for 82 days before it breached the threshold on March 20.“Infections are increasing rapidly. The virus is clearly transmitting faster. One of the reasons for the faster spread of the infection is that young people are out and about. It makes a lot of a difference. For example, young people tend to speak louder; it has already been established the louder you speak the farther the viral particle spreads. It can travel up to six metres and not just two metres that we ask people to maintain,” said Dr SK Sarin, director, Institute of Liver and Biliary Sciences (ILBS). He headed the Delhi government’s first committee on Covid-19 control and management.He also said that eating together increased the risk of transmission several times.“If you are eating together in restaurants and offices, the risk of transmission goes up. Statistics from the district of Columbia in Washington DC showed that there was a 10-fold increase in the number of cases and five-fold increase in the number of deaths 100 days after restaurants were opened up,” he said.Meanwhile, 37 doctors treating Covid-19 patients at Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital tested positive for Covid-19, hospital officials said, adding that the majority of them had mild symptoms. Thirty two doctors are in home isolation, and five are admitted in the hospital.HC stops hybrid hearings after spikeThe Delhi high court and the city’s seven district courts have stopped hybrid hearings (physical and virtual) till April 23 and will only hear cases through video conferencing from Friday in the wake of a sharp spike in the number of Covid-19 infections in the city.In a notification, Manoj Jain, registrar of the Delhi high court, said that the full court of the Delhi HC has decided to take up cases virtually “in view of the alarming rise in the Covid-19 cases in the NCT of Delhi”.“….this Court shall, with effect from April 9, take up matters as per the existing arrangement with regard to listing of cases, through virtual mode only, till April 23,” the order read.“All the courts of Joint Registrar (Judicial) shall also, with effect from April 9, hold courts through virtual mode only, till April 23,” it added.The courts in the city had earlier started physical hearing from March 15. However, it later switched to hybrid hearings after requests from lawyers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-cases-gallop-in-capital-delhi-adds-7-437-infections-most-since-nov-19-101617911888169.html
09-04-2021||Chandigarh||MC polls not referendum to my 3-year rule: Jai Ram||Himachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Thursday said that to interpret the outcome of the MC polls as a referendum to his three-year rule would be an unfair assessment. “Elections to the municipal corporation are different. Here issues are local and national issues do not count,” Thakur said, while blaming the Congress for running a vicious campaign against the party. Thakur said his government had upgraded the nagar panchayats in Solan, Palampur and Mandi for the planned development of towns. “My party has won the elections in Mandi with overwhelming support and is close to victory in Dharamshala . We accepted the challenge to hold elections on party symbols. Congress has little reason to be elated as the BJP has emerged victorious in the elections,” he said, adding that the outcome of the elections will not have any bearing on future politics. He said rebellion had hampered the party’s prospects in Solan, Palampur and Dharamshala. “There have been some shortcomings. We will assess and rectify them,” he said. Hints action against Mandi MLA Jai Ram hinted that action will be taken against BJP’s Mandi legislator Anil Sharma for defying the party dictate during the MC polls. “The high command will initiate action against Sharma. I do not want to say much as his state is pitiable. We already threw him out from the cabinet,” said the CM, in response to a question at a press conference in Shimla . Thakur was flanked by state party chief Suresh Kashyap , Jal Shakti Minister Mahender Singh Thakur, urban development minister Suresh Bhardwaj, health minister Rajiv Sehjal and party general secretary Trilok Jamwal. Four-time legislator Anil Sharma was not included in the any of the poll panels. He has been sidelined by the party ever since his son Ashray contested to Lok Sabha on a Congress ticket and he was compelled to quit the cabinet. Sharma had launched an offensive against the CM during the campaign and countered him over lack of development in Mandi town. “What should I say about Anil as BJP won from his home ward and from the adjoining one,” he said. Sharma’s defiance had become cause for embarrassment for BJP in polls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/mc-polls-not-referendum-to-my-3-year-rule-jai-ram-101617912229373.html
09-04-2021||Chandigarh||Arhtiyas’ strike against online payment halts wheat procurement||Ambala/Karnal The wheat procurement that started on April 1 in the state came to a halt on Thursday as the commission agents (arhtiyas) started their indefinite strike against the direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode of payment to farmers. The strike was announced after a state-level meeting of arhtiyas in Karnal on Tuesday. On the first day of the strike, negligible wheat procurement took place at Ambala grain markets by 3pm. Situation was the same in Karnal and Kurukshetra mandis. In Ambala, around 50 gate passes were issued at Gate No. 1 to the farmers, who unloaded their produce under the sheds but no other work was initiated by the commission agents. President of the Haryana State Anaj Mandi Arhtiyas’ Association Ashok Gupta made it clear that their strike will continue until the government withdraws the order to pay farmers directly. “We don’t know why the government is adamant on DBT. We want the government to leave this decision on the farmers as done last year,” he said. Farmers, on the other hand, accused the government and arhtiyas of harassing them. “Both the government and the arhtiyas are harassing farmers. Harvesting is picking up and the arhtiyas have declared the strike,” said farmer Ramesh Kumar, who was waiting for buyers at Ladwa grain market of Kurukshetra district. Dhuni Chand, president of a body representing commission agents, said the online payment will affect all and it doesn’t benefit farmers. “The farmers will be allowed to come to the mandis but no loading or packing of their produce will be done by labourers,” he said. A group of labourers who were relaxing under a shed at Ambala City grain market said they were bound to follow the orders of arhtiyas. “We don’t know the issue exactly but we can’t go anywhere. We are sitting idle since morning and they’ll call us late at night to start packing,” one of them said. Dilbar Singh, a farmer from Sambhalkha village of Ambala, said he was aware of the strike but had to come to the mandi to unload his crop. Ambala deputy commissioner Ashok Kumar Sharma said despite the strike, procurement was initiated at some purchase centres in Naraingarh and Naneola around 2:30pm. The Haryana Arhtiyas’ Association demanded that the farmers be given an option to choose the mode of payment. Government officials said they were planning to start the procurement with the help of depot holders. On Thursday, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar in a video conference told the deputy commissioners and officers of the procurement agencies that the government has already accepted the demand of commission agents to clear their pending commission and labour charges with interest. He asked the officials to hold talks with arhtiyas. He also asked them to ensure that all the farmers of the state got registered on the ‘Meri Fasal, Mera Bayora’ portal. Commission agents divided In Karnal, a group of around 200 arhtiyas decided to join the procurement operations after a meeting with deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav. “We have decided to start procurement operations as the government has responded positively to our demands. Strike is not a solution and the arhtiyas should not harass farmers,” said commission agent Dharambir Singh Pada, president of arhtiyas’ association at Karnal grain market. Accusing Ashok Gupta of misleading the commission agents and harassing farmers, Pada said the option to choose mode of payment should be given to the farmers but strike is not a solution. Also, the government also started disbursement of payment directly into the bank accounts of farmers on Thursday. Several farmer unions in the state have already come in the support of the direct payment to farmers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/arhtiyas-strike-against-online-payment-halts-wheat-procurement-101617912173744.html
09-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Transfer forest land for BKC, Dharavi stations for Metro-3’||The Maharashtra government recently directed that two patches of mangrove forest in Dharavi and Bandra-Kurla Complex – measuring 0.34hectares and 0.91hectares, respectively – be handed over to the Mumbai Metro Rail Corporation (MMRC) to build the BKC and Dharavi stations on the Metro-3 (Colaba-SEEPZ) line. Officials in the forest department clarified that the handover will be made “at the earliest” by the mangrove cell. Stage 1 and stage 2 clearance under the Forest Conservation Act (1980) had already been granted by the MoEFCC’s regional office in 2017 and 2019. “What remains is for the land to be handed to the user agency, namely the MMRCL, so that work can proceed. The land will be transferred shortly by the DFO, MMCU. All other clearances, including CRZ and permission from the High Court for diversion of mangroves, are in order,” said Virendra Tiwari, additional principal chief conservator of forest (APCCF), mangrove cell. As per guidelines laid down by the National Green Tribunal, the user agency is mandated to issue a public notice so that any objections may be directed by citizens and interest groups to the NGT directly. The MMRCL issued a public notice on April 8, along with copies of the Stage 1 and 2 clearance (which are also available on its website). The clearances were issued in 2017 and 2019, followed by the state government order for transfer of land on March 23. Official estimates suggest that about 1,000 mangrove trees will be cleared in total for both stations. To mitigate this loss, the MMRCL had submitted an in-situ mangrove conservation plan to the forest department. In addition to this, the MMRCL has been directed to plant 5,000 mangrove trees at an alternate site for compensatory afforestation. Land transferred for creek bridgeIn a boost to the Mumbai Metropolitan Region Development Authority’s (MMRDA) Vasai-Bhayander creek bridge project, the Central government’s Department for promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) has transferred a 9.86-hectare land parcel to the state government’s urban development department for construction of the bridge. MMRDA, on Thursday, called the move a major breakthrough for the project that is expected to cut travel time between the Vasai and Bhayander by 45 minutes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/transfer-forest-land-for-bkc-dharavi-stations-for-metro3-101617911988159.html
09-04-2021||Mumbai||Ransomware attack on MIDC server: Attack origin traced to Russia-Kazakhstan||The ransomware attack on the server of Maharashtra Industrial Development Corporation (MIDC), which disrupted the functioning at the MIDC’s head office in Mumbai and 16 other regional offices last month, was carried out somewhere in Russia-Kazakhstan, investigation of the cyber police station has revealed. However, the cyber police are yet to identify the perpetrators. On March 21 at 2.30am, a ransomware, SYNack, attacked the MIDC system. The attack was on the local server system to take unauthorised access of the computer system of MIDC and encrypted data. Because of this, MIDC personnel could not use the system data for over a week. This also damaged the computers at the corporation’s 16 regional offices. The email sent by the attackers explained the kind of attack and their demand for ransom, the police said. Ten days later, MIDC filed an official complaint with the cyber police on April 1. It is being alleged that the hackers had demanded ₹500 crore ransom, however neither the police nor the MIDC officials have confirmed the amount. “The technical investigation indicated the attack’s origin could be Russia-Kazakhstan region. Efforts are being taken to know the exact location,” a senior police officer part of the investigation told HT. After the attack, all computers were disconnected from the server. The corporation also asked all its departments to shut the system and not to switch on the computers until the issues were resolved completely. This had caused disruption of services across the state. Earlier, MIDC has claimed that all their systems were hosted on the ESDS (cloud service provider) and local server of the corporation and for security and maintenance purpose, the corporation was using a well-known anti-virus. The corporation claimed that as backup files of its website, Single Window Clearance system, Building Plan Approval Management System (BPAMS), ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning), computerised land distribution system, water bills, etc. are stored on different networks, they are all safe. Later, the services were restored completely. A team of cyber police officials had visited the MIDC office, made enquiries with the technical staff there to understand the nature of attack. Earlier, an attempted cyber sabotage allegedly by a Chinese state-sponsored cyber threat group had caused massive power outage in Mumbai last October. Then home minister Anil Deshmukh had said that the Maharashtra cyber police had found evidence which suggested that the grid failure in Mumbai on October 12 last year, which resulted in the city plunging into darkness, disrupting train services and shutting down the stock market, was likely to be a cyber sabotage. The New York Times, citing a report by a US-based cybersecurity firm, had claimed the Chinese-state sponsored groups had targeted power sector in India with malware. This came months after the clash between troops of the two nations in Galwan valley in June 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/ransomware-attack-on-midc-server-attack-origin-traced-to-russiakazakhstan-101617911928707.html
09-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Less than 1% Maha e-waste recycled last year’||Of the total quantum of electronic waste generated in Maharashtra last year, less than 1% was recycled, suggests data with the Maharashtra Pollution Control Board. This was revealed 8 during a webinar on waste management, organised by a consortium of three advocacy groups along with the Maharashtra environment department’s Majhi Vasundhara initiative on Thursday.According to records maintained by the MPCB for 2019-20, 975.25 tonnes of e-waste were recycled during the financial year 2019-20 by nine empanelled recyclers. Another 11,015.49 tonnes was dismantled (and is awaiting recycling) by 90 empanelled dismantlers. However, as per the MPCB’s own estimate -- which was modelled using techniques laid down by the Central Pollution Control Board -- the state produced approximately 10,00,000 tonnes of e-waste during the same period. Satish Sinha, associate director, Toxic Links, one of the three groups, said, “A majority of it is handled by the informal sector, which is illegal.”Nandakumar Gurav, a regional officer with the MPCB, said, “The data suggests that a disproportionately large quantity of e-waste is being handled by the informal sector. We have issued directions to every urban local body to streamline the collection and treatment process as per the Centre’s e-waste management rules.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/less-than-1-maha-e-waste-recycled-last-year-101617911928084.html

The court of Sushil Kumar Garg, the special CBI judge at Panchkula, framed charges under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 302 (murder), 307 (attempt to murder), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (unlawful assembly) and 506 (criminal intimidation) of the Indian Penal Code against Chhotu Ram Bhat, Mahendra, alias Gangajal, Sukhwinder, alias Minda, Mukhram, alias Kalu, Sukhdeep Singh, Harsimrandeep Singh and Sukhpreet Singh, alias Budha. Charges under Section 506, read with Section 149, of the IPC were also framed against Ravinder.“A prima facie case for commission of offences punishable under Section 25 of the Arms Act is made out against accused Harsimrandeep Singh, Sukhpreet Singh, Chhotu Ram Bhat, Mukhram and Mahendra,” the court said. The case was argued by senior public prosecutor KP Singh. The court summoned prosecution witnesses on the next date of hearing on July 16. The accused, who are in jail, will be produced through video-conference. In January 2017, Satbir Punia, 40, and Amit Saharan, 38, were gunned down in the office of a kinnow waxing plant of Pradeep Godara at Chautala village. The assailants came in a vehicle and started firing indiscriminately on entering the office where Satbir and Amit were sitting. The FIR was registered at Dabwali Sadar police station on January 12, 2017. In 2018, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed the CBI to probe, after Navina, the wife of Amit Saharan, requested for transferring the investigation of the case.

09-04-2021||Other||More trouble is in store for Maharashtra govt||Even as it is struggling to handle the Covid-19 surge in the state, the ruling Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) is battling the political crisis following the allegations levelled by former Mumbai top cop Param Bir Singh and now suspended police officer Sachin Vaze. MVA also suffered a setback on Thursday after the Supreme Court (SC) refused to stay the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe ordered by the Bombay high court into the corruption allegations against former home minister Anil Deshmukh. Latest in the row faced by the ruling coalition are the allegations made by Vaze, who is in the custody of National Investigation Agency (NIA) for his role in the Antilia explosives case. Echoing the charges made by Singh, Vaze in a letter has claimed that the top MVA ministers had asked him to extort money from entrepreneurs and establishments. He named Deshmukh and transport minister Anil Parab in the letter. With SC allowing the CBI inquiry, MVA will have to face further embarrassment, as Deshmukh would be called for the same in the coming days. While Deshmukh had to resign as home minister following HC’s order for probe against him, another minister, Sanjay Rathod, who handled the forest portfolio, had to step down after his name was dragged in a case pertaining to the suicide of a Tiktok star in Pune. The allegations made by Vaze have given fresh salvo to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). On Thursday, Union information and broadcasting minister Prakash Javadekar, in a press conference, demanded the resignation of MVA government on the grounds that Vaze’s letter has exposed the coalition government. He also made a scathing attack by terming MVA as “Maha Vasooli Aghadi” and said the common minimum programme (CMP) of the coalition government is to “collect money through the police.” “The Vaze controversy, planting of a bomb by police and “vasooli” by the home minister of a state … the list goes on. Such pervasive corruption shows the character of the ruling alliance in Maharashtra. They have no right to remain in power and we demand their resignation,” Javadekar said in Delhi. State BJP also stepped up its attack on MVA, with party chief Chandrakant Patil saying that the allegations by Vaze and Singh are related to “organised crime” by ministers, and need to be probed under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime Act (Mcoca). “If the evidence comes out on paper, provisions of Mcoca will have to be invoked for investigation against MVA ministers... Maharashtra is a fit case for imposing President’s rule,” Patil told reporters, adding that two more ministers will have to resign in the coming two weeks. Responding to the allegations, state Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) chief and water resources minister Jayant Patil said that people have started believing that BJP is behind all the developments, as BJP leaders seem to be knowing what will happen next. “People have started believing that those [BJP] who want to dispel MVA government are behind these allegations. BJP leaders were saying that they will take more wickets [force more ministers to resign] in the next two-three days and then the media gets a letter from NIA written by Vaze, in which he has made allegations against some more ministers. Therefore, it appears that first BJP leaders had created an environment of suspicion and then NIA disclosed some information. Whether this means probe or politics needs to be investigated,” Patil said, casting aspersions on the role of the central investigation agencies in the entire issue. Political analyst Prakash Bal said that BJP wants to bring down MVA government, which is now obvious, but the MVA government, especially chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, is not confronting them and without it BJP will not back down. “Thackeray should have at least taken up the issue of vaccination shortage. The way Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan castigated the Maharashtra government, Thackeray should have come out openly and said that the Centre is not providing them with adequate vaccine doses to deliberately create a crisis in the state,” Bal said, pointing out to fresh clashes between MVA government and the Centre after state health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday pointed out the shortfall of vaccine doses in the state which has led to shutting down of vaccination centres in many parts of the state. Responding to it, Dr Harsh Vardhan said he has been witnessing “misgovernance and utter casual approach on part of Maharashtra government in battling the virus” throughout the year.” Bal added, “The MVA government is failing to take BJP head on. Unless they become aggressive, BJP will try to push them to the wall. TMC (Trinamool Congress) chief Mamata Banerjee is a perfect example for them [MVA] as she is facing a similar situation in West Bengal but is fighting back fiercely.” On Thursday, the state crossed the 3.2 million-mark after 56,286 new cases took the tally to 3,229,547. The death toll breached the 57,000-mark after 376 fatalities on Thursday took the figures to 57,028.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/more-trouble-is-in-store-for-maharashtra-govt-101617911808731.html

All the loans were sanctioned within a span of 12 days. Of the 10 people on whose name the CCL accounts were created have been traced and have denied having signed any loan paper. Addresses of the people on whose name these loans were sanctioned belonged to Bhadsali village of Haroli sub-division.

In an order issued by additional chief secretary Rajiv Arora, the 54-year-old officer was reinstated at Ambala itself. During his suspension announced on February 9, Kumar was posted at the office of RTC, Bhondsi in Gurugram. His suspension order was issued on the day he was granted interim bail by the court of additional sessions judge Sundeep Singh that had asked him to join the investigation within three days. The 2006-batch IPS officer was booked under various sections of the IPC on Feb 7 after a verbal spat with Kapil Vij. “I was attending a birthday party at Sirhind Club where Kumar was also invited. The officer under the influence of alcohol and without any provocation started abusing me and my family, and also threatened me of dire consequences. Kumar said he was DIG vigilance and nobody could harm him. He also made obscene gestures at me while leaving,” Kapil Vij had said in his complaint. Kumar’s counsel Satinder Singh Garg, while appearing in the court denied the allegations and placed four photographs on record. Three purportedly showed Kumar was not having alcohol and the fourth showed complainant (Kapil Vij) sitting at a table with a glass of drink in front of him. It was also alleged by Garg that the complainant was misusing the position of his brother Anil Vij and had rudely told Kumar to serve him at the party. While, Kumar had joined the investigation after reporting to the Ambala Cantt police station two days after the court order, several protests by his community groups were held in neighbouring districts in his favour. Kumar had been reportedly trying to bring an end to the controversy and had also met Anil Vij at his residence last month.

The court had taken up the petition of Gujjar and his co-accused Saurav Jindal who also given bail. The firing was allegedly carried out after Naresh Aggarwal, the liquor trader, did not pay a ransom. Gujjar was stated to be the mastermind of the incident, police had claimed. The incident took place on December 20 that year when some unidentified persons started firing outside Aggarwal’s house. A case of extortion and attempt to murder was registered the next day at the Model Town police station in Hoshiarpur. In the high court, Gujjar argued that he was lodged in jail at the time of incident, said lawyer Mandeep Kaushik. The police had named Gujjar and others as accused on the basis of a confessional statement of one Paras Sharma who had told court that he was in touch with the gangster through WhatsApp and that the latter ordered the firing and arranged for weapons and transport.The police had argued that both are habitual offenders were involved in multiple cases and hence bail should not be granted to them.The court observed that veracity of the confessional statement would be tested during the trial and also it remained unexplained as how Gujjar had access to a mobile phone in jail. It also took note of the fact that both the accused have been behind bars since more than a year. The trial will take some time to conclude as charges have not been framed, the court said allowing their bail plea.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2019-hoshiarpur-firing-case-hc-grants-bail-to-gangster-binny-gujjar-coaccused-101617911691336.html

However, the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government is likely to go ahead with the probe by the committee, constituted on March 30, to investigate into the allegations of corrupt malpractices by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh.The government has been told that the findings of the panel would have limited legal standings as the CBI probe would have wider scope. “There are instances of parallel investigation by such committees in the past too. We also have checked with justice Chandiwal if he still wishes to continue with the probe after the HC order. The orders related to the remuneration, office space and other logistical assistance will soon be issued,” said an official from Mantralaya.Former advocate general Shreehari Aney said the Chandiwal committee will no more serve its purpose. “The CBI inquiry does not stop government from going ahead with the probe by the committee but it has become redundant in law as CBI’s scope of investigation is much larger than that of the committee. CBI’s findings would result in prosecution, whereas the Chandiwal committee’s findings are just fact findings in nature. It would be ultimately the prerogative of the state whether to accept it or make it public. I fear in the given case, one might be confronted with two different reports on fact,” said Aney.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/probe-against-anil-deshmukh-experts-say-maharashtra-govt-panel-s-findings-to-be-redundant-101617911688711.html

Addressing a ‘kisan rally’ at the grain market in Gurdaspur district’s Batala to mobilise farmers and labourers for the agitation against the three agriculture laws, Charuni said, “The Centre has not held talks with us over the issue for the last two-and-a-half months. The farmers and labourers have common concerns. First, the government passed anti-labourer laws and then anti-farmer legislations. Some corporate houses want to rule over all sections of society. These big companies will swallow small businesses. We need to fight them together.”The SKM will hold programmes on the birth anniversary of BR Ambedkar on April 14 and on May 1 to mark Labour Day under the leadership of labourers, he said. “We are reaping what we had sown. We don’t think before voting for anyone. We always vote for a professional politician who considers politics business. We never vote for those who fight for civil rights. Or we vote for singers and actors. For instance, you voted for actor Sunny Deol and the result is in front of you. We must introspect,” he added. During the protest, the farmers should not use force against the police and other government officials who merely perform their duty, he said.Apart from SKM leaders, Punjabi singers such as Kamal Khan, Resham Anmol, Bir Singh, Debi Makhsoospuri, and Haryana youth farmer leader Navdeep Singh also addressed the gathering.Covid-19 guidelines were not adhered to during the rally with majority of the protesters seen without masks.

Punjab’s virus positivity rate till the week ending April 7 was found to be as high as 7.6%. Senior health department officials involved in Covid-19 management said so far the state had capped antigen at 10% of the total tests. “As the state’s positivity rate is increasing and the government has set daily testing target at 45,000, we have decided to raise antigen to 25% of the total tests,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. As per the Union health ministry’s guidelines, antigen testing should not be more than 30% of the total tests. “The accuracy level of antigen test is nearly 30% as it can show false negative results. But since cases are increasing quickly, we have to rely on antigen testing in which reports come within half an hour. It will help in early detection of cases. Moreover, if a person is found negative, we send their samples for RT-PCR tests as well,” Dr Bhaskar said. The results of the RT-PCR testing, which has much higher level of accuracy, take at least 48 hours to arrive.The state on Wednesday conducted 44,250 tests, the daily highest so far, with average daily growth rate of new infections in the week from March 31 to April 7 touching 1.2%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-to-up-antigen-testing-as-covid-cases-soar-101617911513243.html

Saying that the victories in Palmapur and Solan will energise the party cadre, Rathore dedicated the victory in the MC polls to the party workers “BJP only won the Mandi MC where the CM had to campaign from door-to-door, making it a prestige issue. BJP resorted to pressuring and influencing voters by misusing the administration and government machinery. In Dharamshala, the BJP did not get a clear majority despite blatant misuse of power,” he said.He said Congress gave such a tough competition to the BJP during the election campaign that it had to rope in the entire Cabinet and even the national leaders. “After the Panchayati Raj Elections I had openly challenged the CM to conduct these elections on party symbols, which the CM has also acknowledged and with the dedicated efforts of our party workers we won more seats than BJP in MC elections and the majority in two MCs,” Rathore had said. “The BJP termed these elections as a semi final to 2022 Vidhan Sabha Elections and the results show that people have lost faith in the saffron regime, he said adding that victory has boosted the party cadre and will help it in the upcoming byelections to Mandi Lok Sabha and Fatehpur Vidhan Sabha. Rathore said that Congress will progress further under the leadership and guidance of Congress president Sonia Gandhi, Rahul Gandhi and Rajeev Shukla and with the able guidance of former CM Virbhadra Singh, Congress will also win the 2022 Vidhan Sabha elections .Rathore said of the 64 wards he himself had visited 45 wards organised more than 50 Nukkar Sabha’s and established eoordination with all the senior leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/poll-outcome-suggests-strong-undercurrent-against-bjp-rathore-101617911509295.html

The vehicles were allegedly used by Sachin Vaze – the police officer suspended and arrested for his alleged role in the Antilia case.During investigation, NIA discovered that though Vaze used all the eight high-end vehicles, only an Outlander seized was registered on his name. He had sold the Outlander to his former colleague, assistant inspector Prakash Howal, who was then attached to the crime intelligence unit.The first vehicle seized in the case, a Scorpio, was registered in the name of a Navi Mumbai resident, but was in Hiran’s possession since the past three years.Hiran’s body was found near Retibunder in Mumbra creek on March 5. The anti-terrorism squad, which was earlier probing the case, was informed by Hiran’s wife Vimla that Vaze was using the Scorpio since last November till February 5.After taking over the probe, NIA on March 9 seized an Innova (MH01-ZA- 403) from the motor transport department at Nagpada. The car belongs to Mumbai Police and was given to CIU, which Vaze headed, for official purposes. This is the same Innova which was found trailing the explosive-laden Scorpio near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s home Antilia in south Mumbai. The police had claimed that after parking the Scorpio, Vaze boarded the Innova and left the spot.NIA believes that Hiran was likely killed in the car and his body later dumped near Retibunder. The agency also discovered that Vaze was using several high-end cars and would bring them to his office in the police commissionerate premises.On March 16, NIA seized the third vehicle – a black Mercedes Benz with registration number (MH 18 BR 9095) from a parking area near Mumbai Police commissioner’s office. The agency found an invoice of ₹28 lakh of the car’s purchase. While conducting a search of Vaze’s office at CIU, the car’s key was also recovered. The vehicle is registered on a Dhule-based tour operator’s name. He had said he had nothing to do with Vaze and had sold the vehicle in February to a car-trading site.Two days after seizing the Mercedes Benz, a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado (MH02-CC-0101) was seized from outside Vaze’s Saket building in Thane.The same day, a Mercedes Benz ML 250 CDI (MH43- AR -8697), owned by a construction firm in Vashi, Navi Mumbai, was also seized. The vehicle was bought on February 18, 2015. However, its link to Sachin Vaze is as yet to be ascertained.On March 23, the ATS seized a Volvo XC90, registered on the name of a Navi Mumbai developer. The car was sold to a Thane resident who was allegedly Vaze’s business partner.A week later, NIA seized the seventh high-end car, a Mitsubishi Outlander (MH01 AX 2627) which had been parked on a road at Kamothe in Navi Mumbai for a month. It is registered in Vaze’s name. Preliminary investigation has revealed that it was being used by a crime branch officer, assistant police inspector Howal, who is said to have purchased the car from Vaze at ₹1.50 lakh. The vehicle was bought in June 2011.On April 6, NIA seized a bike, Benelli DSK TNT 600GT, which is registered in the name of a Thane woman, who was seen in the CCTV grab with Vaze at a five-star hotel, with a cash-counting machine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/8-seized-vehicles-used-by-ex-mumbai-cop-are-worth-1-5-crore-in-market-101617911209772.html
09-04-2021||Chandigarh||BJP claims majority in Dharamshala as Independent joins its ranks||The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has claimed majority in the Dharamshala municipal corporation after one of the independent councillors joined the party on Thursday.The BJP had won eight of 17 wards in the MC polls held on April 7 and was one short of the majority mark. The Congress, which had 15 members in the previous corporation, had bagged five seats while independent candidates had won four seats. Forest minister Rakesh Pathania ,who was in-charge of the Dharamshala civic body polls, said the BJP will form the new corporation with 12 councillors against Congress’ five.“Independent councillor Sarv Chand has extended support to the party and also attended its meeting. Two more independent councillors intend to come aboard,” he said.Pathania admitted that party had erred in allotting tickets in some wards, which had led to the party candidates’ loss.“We have absolute majority in the house and will form the new corporation,” said Pathania. He, however, did not disclose the party’s faces for the post of mayor and deputy mayor, saying the decision will be taken by the party high command.However, party sources said the BJP may offer one of the two posts to Chand, who has returned to the party’s fold. He had contested as an Independent after being denied a ticket by the BJP and was subsequently expelled.Thanking voters, Pathania said they will expedite development work in the town.“The smart city project is the Modi government’s gift to the people of Dharamshala and directions will be issued to carry out the project on war footing. Projects worth ₹ 334 crore are being implemented to develop Dharamshala as a smart city. Additional plans will be prepared for projects worth ₹ 296 crore,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bjp-claims-majority-in-dharamshala-as-independent-joins-its-ranks-101617911208569.html

The children were picking garbage without any safety measures, which can lead to multiple health issues. Interaction with the children revealed they mostly hailed from Uttar Pradesh, Bengal and Bihar, and only some were from Chandigarh,” said Harjinder Kaur, chairperson, CCPCR. “Children are often found working at the landfill, even though they shouldn’t even be allowed inside as per MC rules. We had previously written about this to the authorities,” said Dyal Krishan president of the Dadumajra Dumping Site Joint Action Committee.Krishan, who lives near the site, said he had spoken to several children visiting the landfill and learnt they didn’t go to school. On MC’s part, mayor Ravi Kant Sharma said he will discuss the matter with the officials concerned. “Child labour cannot be allowed, and if something like this is going on, we will take immediate action,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/child-rights-panel-summons-mc-officials-over-kids-working-at-dadumajra-landfill-101617911148618.html

According to the chargesheet, Rajender Singh, alias Ganja, of Amritsar, Parminder Pal Singh, alias Bobby, and Jasmeet Singh Hakimzada, resident of New Delhi but currently living in Dubai, have been charged under various sections of Indian Penal Code (IPC) and Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. In the statement, the NIA said the investigation revealed that Rajender was instrumental in selling smuggled heroin, while Parminder played an important role in channelising the proceeds through hawala from India to Dubai. It also said that Jasmeet Singh Hakimzada, a Dubai-based international drugs smuggler and money launderer, used to transfer the funds to entities based in Pakistan, who used the money to support the activities of banned terrorist organisation KLF. Hakimzada along with Harmeet Singh, a Pakistan-based self-styled chief of the KLF have been instrumental in running a narco-terror network. The investigation also established that a network of narco-traffickers, terrorists and hawala operatives based in Punjab, Delhi and Dubai was operating at the behest of Hakimzada and was indulging in subversive activities against India,” the NIA said in the chargesheet. An FIR was registered by Punjab Police in Amritsar in May 2020 under NDPS Act. “It pertains to the seizure of 500gm of heroin and ₹1.2 lakh drug money on May 31, 2020 from accused Jajbir Singh Samra and two others.

09-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh MC launches new e-office application||In another digital push, the Chandigarh municipal corporation (MC) on Thursday launched a new e-office application. The new digital gateway will help cut internal office procedures which were so far based on manual handling of files and paper movement.Chandigarh mayor Ravi Kant Sharma launched the e-office application here at the command and control centre of MCC building, Sector 17, Chandigarh, in the presence of senior officers and MC officials concerned.The new e-office model developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) will not just help the civic body streamline internal operations, but also enhance the ease of tracking project files. It aims to improve governance by automating the internal processes of handling files and taking decisions within the MCC.All the wings of civic body are likely to use the new application making MCC one of the largest government departments in Chandigarh to automate its internal office procedures. The e-office application’s main module — eFile — enables online file related work, from receiving and marking dak, operating a file, preparing a draft letter, its approval/signature to dispatch of the signed letter.The mayor said that the new technology will bring more transparency, accountability, while speeding up the decision making process. In the present context, the new system will also help in avoiding situation arising due to Covid-19 as it is based on a contactless model thereby preventing any possible transmission of virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-mc-launches-new-e-office-application-101617911032886.html

09-04-2021||Mumbai||Vaze-Deshmukh controversy: United in Maharashtra govt, divided during crisis||The past five weeks have been the most challenging in the 16-month rule of the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government led by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray. Amid allegations of corruption, malpractices and deteriorating law and order situation, the rift between the ruling parties – Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) and Congress – and their lack of coordination has come to the fore. Insiders in the MVA believe lack of strategy and ability to take quick decision has led a series of embarrassments for the Thackeray government. It started with the leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis cornering the MVA government on the Antilia explosives scare and subsequent death of the trader in whose car the explosives were found, Hiran Mansukh, in the first week of March. First, the probe was transferred to the National Investigation Agency, followed by allegations by a former Mumbai police commissioner against the home minister leading to a Central Bureau of Investigation probe. There has been no end to setbacks since then. By dismissing the petition of state and former home minister Anil Deshmukh against the Bombay high court’s ruling of handing over the probe to the CBI, the apex court has given another shock to the Thackeray government. A day ago, a leaked letter by Vaze left the Shiv Sena, and in turn the MVA government, red-faced as it had named leaders for demanding extortion.“The MVA did not have a clear strategy as a coalition. Each party is defending itself as and when it is at the receiving end. In the Deshmukh controversy, the Shiv Sena or Congress did not come defend the home minister vehemently. There should have put up a joint defence,” said a senior NCP minister.He also said no steps were taken to give a clear message to the administration that those who sympathise with the previous regime should not work against the interest of the current regime. “This time, not the opposition, but our own officers challenged those in power. Besides Singh and Vaze, Rashmi Shukla’s leaked report on ‘money for police transfers’ resulted in great embarrassment. The government failed to take stern action against the two officers for insubordination, false allegations and misguiding the government. In case of allegations by former top cop Param Bir Singh, the committee under the retired judge should have been constituted much earlier, as it would have helped stop the central agency from taking over the probe,” the minister said.He said the damage control exercise, under which two ministers – Nawab Malik and Jitendra Awhad – speak about the allegations of police transfers, came too late. The leader added that the allegations of corruption caused more damage compared to the women-related instances against Dhananjay Munde and Sanjay Rathod. “Forget these cases, even in Sushant Singh Rajput and Kangana Ranaut cases, the response of the state government was too slow. The government could survive the attacks because the Covid-19 pandemic was at its peak and they were in their early months,” a senior IAS officer said.Political analyst Hemant Desai said, “The Bharatiya Janata Party has, it seems, decided to attack the state tooth and nail. They have been targeting Uddhav Thackeray and key leaders around him to destabilise the government, but at the same time the MVA government is lagging in the strategy to combat it. The three-party government is lacking in proper coordination, which could have helped them.”According to a Congress leader, the party chose to remain a mute spectator, as it would have led to tainting their image. Fadnavis alleged on Thursday that the shortage of vaccination is being deliberately politicised to divert the attention from the beating the government has received in scams and judicial rulings.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vazedeshmukh-controversy-united-in-maharashtra-govt-divided-during-crisis-101617910848985.html

From 461 daily cases in the UT on April 1, the count has reached a six-month high of 812 cases on April 7.“The tourist influx is mostly concentrated in Srinagar. They stay in Srinagar hotels, go to different places and then come back to Srinagar to stay in hotels and homes. That can be a reason for escalation of cases,” he said.Srinagar was declared an orange zone on March 30 but people were allowed to gather at public parks and garden. People have been criticising the government for organising Tulip Festival from April 3 which saw heavy rush of people most of whom did not follow the SOPs.Till April 7, Srinagar health authorities have administered around 81,500 vaccines, including first and second dose, to healthcare and frontline workers and citizens over 45 years of age as against 2.26 lakh doses in Jammu.“We need to ramp up vaccinationas even the young population is now getting affected. Of the total J&K population, we have vaccinated just 1.72 lakh people with both the doses,” Dr Hassan said.Overall, Srinagar has recorded 28,115 cases and 477 deaths of total 1,27,774 cases and 2,018 deaths in the UT.The J&K administration closed schools from Monday due to surging cases of Covid-19.

09-04-2021||Mumbai||Pocso rules: Bombay HC asks cops, courts to inform survivors, kin about cases||The Bombay high court (HC) while laying down guidelines to be followed in cases under Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (Pocso) Act, has made it mandatory for investigating officers and lower courts to inform the family of the survivor about the court case so that they are present for the hearing/trial. The guidelines were issued after hearing a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by an activist who claimed that the families of many survivors were not aware of the trials against the accused, as a result of which the accused managed to get bail without the survivor getting a chance to express her opposition. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni while hearing the PIL by Arjun Malge was informed that as per the Pocso Act and Rules and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC), it is the duty of the special juvenile police unit (SPJU) to provide a child assistance of a legal counsel of his/her choice. The unit is also expected to inform the survivor’s parent or guardian about the developments, including arrest of the accused, applications filed by the accused and other court proceedings. Malge’s petition submitted that as the police were not doing their duty, in many instances the accused were able to secure bail. As the survivor and their families were not aware of the same, they could not exercise their right to appeal against the conviction, seek cancellation of bail or be heard in case the accused approached the court to quash criminal proceedings. Malge also cited examples of accused getting bail from lower courts in the absence of the survivor or their families. In light of these submissions, he sought framing of guidelines to ensure that the concerned authorities complied with the provisions under the Pocso Act and its rules. The bench issued guidelines for effective participation of survivor at various stages of judicial process for cases under Pocso Act and put additional duties on SPJU to inform the survivor’s family. The court also directed lower courts to ensure that the survivor, his/her family or counsel are informed about court proceedings, and to make such reasoned order as it deems fit to secure the ends of justice, taking into account any emergent circumstances that warrant dealing with the application in the absence of the child’s family or guardian or legal counsel. The bench then directed the order to be widely circulated with sessions courts in the state, director general of police, superintendent of police, and director of prosecution state of Maharashtra and state legal services authorities. It also granted liberty to presiding officers to frame such stipulations and requirements as they deem necessary to operationalise and administer the provisions of the Act and comply with the HC order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pocso-rules-bombay-hc-asks-cops-courts-to-inform-survivors-kin-about-cases-101617910730500.html

09-04-2021||Mumbai||Vaccine shortage: War of words continues between Maharashtra, Centre||Even as the state struggles with shortage of Covid-19 vaccine doses, antiviral drug Remdesvir and oxygen supply, the war of words between Maharashtra and the Central government continued for a second day. A day after state health minister Rajesh Tope said there is a shortage of doses, many centres were shut in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai, Panvel, Satara, Sangli and various other parts of Maharashtra. Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar said the drive may have to be halted in Mumbai after Friday, if doses are not sent. Tope, while talking to reporters on Thursday, questioned the “discrimination” being faced by Maharashtra in allotment of doses, when compared to other states. He said Maharashtra will require 4 million (40 lakh) doses per week to meet its target and reiterated the demand to open vaccination for all those above 18 years of age, like the US. He also said the state may run out of oxygen supply if cases continue to rise at the current rate of almost 60,000 infections per day. However, Union minister and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Prakash Javadekar said it is the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi’s (MVA) poor planning that has led to this situation. “According to the latest release order of vaccines from the Centre, Maharashtra has been given 7.5 lakh vaccine doses only. While Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana have been given more than 30-40 lakh doses,” Tope said. He further said, “Why are we facing this discrimination when we have a population of 12 crore, the highest active cases and a positivity rate of 20-25%?”Tope said the state has close to 900,000 doses, which will last for a day-and-a-half. Maharashtra has been vaccinating 400,000 to 450,000 people daily. For the city, once the vaccine doses are collected from the Serum Institute of India (SII) in Pune, they are transported to the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s cold storage facility in Parel. From there, the doses are distributed to the 118 vaccination centres in the city. The distribution load is considered on the basis of population of the area and response pattern of citizens. In case of private hospitals, 100 to 500 doses are distributed daily, considering private hospitals vaccinate only on the basis of appointments. In case of government centres, the allocation is done on the basis of population of the area, followed by anticipation of walk-in entries. Each centre gets 2,000 to 3000 doses every day. For the state, the quantity of doses supplied to districts is decided based on the remaining stock. The stock is supplied to the districts based on the vaccination rate over the past few days and the stock required for the next few days. Expected number of beneficiaries after citizens above 45 years were deemed eligible has been ascertained in every district on the basis of population. The plan is chalked out for the supply in the proportion of the stock the state gets from the Centre. Each district is given stock for an average of three days. On the shortage of dose, Tope said the Centre has assured corrections will be made soon. “The Centre is going to supply 17 lakh doses after April 15. But this will also be less. We need 40 lakh doses every week because our target is to vaccinate 6 lakh people per day. Today, we have close to 9 lakh doses, which will last 1.5 days. Vaccination in many districts has already been shut,” Tope said. He said that even though Gujarat’s population is half of Maharashtra and has 17,000 active cases, both states were given equal doses. Several states had said they will run out of doses within days and requested the Centre for replenishments, resulting in a strong rebuttal from Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday. He accused three states, particularly Maharashtra, of politicising the issue. In his statement, the minister blamed the state government for misgovernance and “utter casual approach” in its battle against the virus. “I do not want to get into any debates. I am requesting the union health minister to provide the requisite doses. As for the comments on Maharashtra’s performance, the state has been following all the protocols as provided by the Centre,” Tope said. On Thursday, Javadekar said, “Maharashtra has 23 lakh doses, which is sufficient for five days. Doses for another three days are also in the pipeline. In fact, every state has stock for 3-4 days. Once the doses are sent to the state, it is the state’s responsibility to send it to districts. Maharashtra has wasted 5 lakh doses of vaccine because of its poor planning,” Javadekar said in a press conference in Delhi. On Thursday evening, union health minister Harsh Varshan tweeted, “Hue & cry by certain States about partisanship by the Union Govt is just a farce, an attempt to hide their own incompetence. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are 2 of the top 3 States based on allocation of #COVID19Vaccine doses. Both are non-BJP governed States.” He shared a slide stated that Maharashtra has received 1,06,19,190 doses, followed by Gujarat and Rajasthan that have also received more than a crore doses. Tope said that the Central government must ask neighbouring states of Maharashtra to provide oxygen supply to the state. “As of now, we have sufficient supply but if the cases continue to rise, there will be shortage in the next 10 days. Centre must ask neighbouring states to provide supply to Maharashtra,” Tope said. The Centre and state had also locked horns over the issue of oxygen supply. The Centre’s Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade had objected to Maharashtra government’s decision to reserve 80% oxygen supply for medical and pharmaceutical purposes. On Thursday, Tope said the state has stock of oxygen, but would need more if the spike in cases continues. “If the current speed of about 60,000 daily new cases continues, we would need oxygen so we are requesting Centre to provide the same from other states,” he said.Tope also said that the state will also ask the Central government to increase the supply of Remdesivir medicine and cap the prices. “Various local bodies are calling me stating that there is a shortage of Remdesvir. The Central government should also look into the black-marketing of Remdesvir. Unfortunately, the medicine is not produced in Maharashtra. We need to procure adequate stock from the companies. We will address this issue in a meeting with the prime minister today,” he said. He also said that cost of the medicine needs to be reduced from ₹4,000 to ₹1,200 to make it affordable for the common man. On Thursday, there were queues outside chemist shops in several parts of the state owing to the shortage of the medicine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccine-shortage-war-of-words-continues-between-maharashtra-centre-101617910728055.html
09-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat starts arriving in south Punjab mandis||Farmers started reaching mandis or purchase centres with harvested wheat in south Punjab on Thursday amid uncertainty over procurement and mode of payment. Officials said no purchase was made on Thursday as procurement, which was delayed by 10 days due to Covid-19, will commence from Saturday across the state. Officials are in a quandary as there is no clarity on the role of arhtiyas for staggered procurement.“According to official instructions, wheat will be allowed to enter mandis after special permits are issued to farmers through arhtiyas. As commission agents have announced to boycott the procurement if authorities agree to mandatory direct benefit transfer (DBT) mode of payment to farmers, we have no clue how the purchase will begin,” said an official.Farmers are a worried lot as the harvesting of the rabi crop will pick up pace from the next week.Darshan Singh of Burj Hari village in Mansa district said that he started harvesting wheat on Wednesday on 40 acres of land, half of which was on lease, but there were no takers in the mandi. “The arhtiya at the local mandi told me that stocks of wheat will be bought after coupons are issued to farmers. It will burden me with extra labour cost as I will have to take wheat back home and then visit the mandi again after Saturday,” he said.Mansa district mandi officer Ranjnish Goel said 336 passes were issued on Thursday and priority will be given to the farmers who have started reaching mandis with harvested wheat.“Like the previous season, a farmer will be entitled to come to mandi with only 50 quintals. The coupons were issued to arhtiyas to invite farmers from Saturday,” he said.Bathinda mandi officer Preet Kanwar Singh Brar said an estimated 200 coupons will be issued to arhtiyas on Friday.“Wheat arrived at five mandis on Thursday and farmers have been told come with a specified moisture level of grains. All preparations are in place for smooth purchase,” said Brar.Bathinda Arhtiya Association president Satish Kumar Babbu said commission agents are firm on their resolution to boycott rabi procurement if DBT and uploading of land records is made mandatory.“If our demands are not met, arhtiyas across the state will not become part of coupon distribution exercise for procurement. The state leaders will take a final decision on Friday,” said Babbu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-starts-arriving-in-south-punjab-mandis-101617910671266.html

Experts said more age groups needed to be included in the vaccination drive, even though the infection’s severity was lesser in the younger population.“Doses can be provided to comorbid people below the age of 45 as well. The government should also adopt the strategy of allowing more people from regions that are witnessing widespread infection,” said Dr Yogesh Chawla, former director, Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh.Echoing his views, Dr Rajesh Kumar, former head of community medicine department and School of Public Health, PGIMER, said the vaccination criteria should be expanded. Arun Gupta, health secretary, UT, said vaccination eligibility was based on age groups where the severity of the infection was higher.Recently, the central government had pointed out that the Covid situation in Chandigarh, Punjab, Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, among some other states, was concerning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/younger-people-in-chandigarh-account-for-50-covid-cases-in-recent-surge-101617910669196.html

Kaur has remained president of the society on different occasions. The land, according to the complaint, belongs to Begowal nagar panchayat and is worth ₹100 crore. The complainant is one George Subh, who has alleged that the beneficiary had even raised illegal construction on the land that should be razed and restored to the nagar panchayat.Kaur had argued in high court that under Section 10 of the Act, the Lokpal has power to inquire into allegations of misconduct against a public figure within five years from the date of occurrence of that misconduct. However, in the present case, the issue would not fall within the scope and ambit of Section 10 of the Act for an inquiry to be directed, her lawyer, R Kartikeya had argued.The lokpal was told that school was set up in 1995 and was being managed by a society, and she had remained president of the society at different points of time. These objections, even though noticed in the order passed by Lokpal has not been dealt with, she had told court adding that Under section 12 (3) of the Act any order passed by the Lokpal affecting rights of a person complained against has to be a speaking order.However, the impugned order passed cannot be construed as a speaking one, as much as the objections specifically raised by her have not been dealt with, it was argued. The high court has sought response from the state government by August 10.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-stays-probe-against-sgpc-chief-jagir-kaur-101617910609835.html

Sharma was interrogated for over nine hours and left NIA office at 10.30pm. On Wednesday, he was questioned for around seven hours.NIA has recorded the statements of around 45 people, including former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh and two deputy commissioners as well as a dozen cops from the crime intelligence unit, in connection with the Antilia case. Singh’s statement was recorded for around three hours on Wednesday. NIA recorded his statement as the main accused in the case, Sachin Vaze, who was then in-charge of the crime intelligence unit (CIU), was allegedly directly reporting to Singh. Soon after the explosives-laden Scorpio was found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s residence, the case was transferred to CIU, and Vaze was made an investigating officer.Singh has been appointed as the director general of home guards after he was shunted out from the post of police chief on March 17, after NIA claimed that Vaze was the mastermind behind planting the SUV and seized an Innova of Mumbai Police, which was allegedly trailing the Scorpio on February 25.During an investigation, NIA found that Sharma had visited the Mumbai Police commissioner’s office on March 2 and had allegedly met Vaze in CIU office. NIA has been questioning him to find out if he was a part of the conversation with Vaze and Hiran, when the suspended cop had reportedly asked the trader to take responsibility of planting the explosives in his Scorpio.Hiran, who was allegedly not ready to accept the responsibility, went missing on the evening of March 4, after he left his house to meet an officer near Ghodbunder Road in Thane. A day later, his body was found near Retibunder in Mumbra.The probe agency is now conducting an investigation to find out if Vaze was involved in Hiran’s murder and whether he took the help of others to execute his plan to frame or eliminate Hiran. Apart from Vaze, former police constable Vinayak Shinde and bookie Naresh Gor are also in NIA’s custody for allegedly providing logistic support in Hiran’s murder. Meanwhile, NIA took Vaze to the state-run Sir J J Hospital for a routine check up on Thursday morning. Before being reinstated in the police force in last June, Vaze had a heart blockage, which he had not got treated. However, sources close to the investigation said that during his check-up, Vaze did not have any problem while breathing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/encounter-specialist-pradeep-sharma-quizzed-by-nia-for-9-hours-in-mumbai-101617910549728.html

Students who have not been able to complete their assessments due to any reason should also be promoted with a remark “promoted under section 16 of the Right to Education (RTE) Act 2009”.Students who secure lower grades after the overall evaluation should undergo a training process for the skills in that particular class at the beginning of the new academic year. Similarly, schools should not conduct any assessments or exams to assess the performance of students of Classes 1 to 8 this year due to the pandemic and the resultant lockdown. Schools need to prepare report cards of students for the current academic year and distribute them to parents within a stipulated period. MSCERT is also going to come up with a comprehensive programme to address the loss of learning caused during the pandemic and closure of schools.Meanwhile, the state education department is considering all possible options for the conduct of board exams that are scheduled to be held from the end of this month. “Some online service providers also met with the education minister, but it was clear that an exam of this volume cannot be conducted online so soon and the preparations required for a system like that can take a couple of years. While exams will be conducted offline, all sort of contingency plans are being prepared and looked at,” said an official from the education department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mscert-releases-guidelines-for-promoting-class-1-to-8-students-101617910487924.html

Deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal was also summoned by the central agency on Thursday and CBI was recording his statements till the time of going to print. In his statement, Singh submitted the printout of Patil’s chat with him, in which the ACP mentioned meeting Deshmukh, said a CBI official.“Singh has also handed over some other documents as evidence. As of now, we have recorded statements of Jaishri Patil, Singh, Patil and Vaze, and are investigating further,” the official said.CBI had also summoned advocate Jaishri Patil on Thursday to record her further statement, but she informed the agency in the morning that she had to attend the hearing of the appeal filed by Maharashtra government and Deshmukh, challenging the Bombay high court (HC) order which directed the central agency to conduct preliminary inquiry into the corruption allegations.Jaishri Patil, whose statements were recorded on Wednesday too, said she will be visiting the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) guest house in Santacruz (East) on Friday to give CBI her further statement. HC directed CBI to submit a report on preliminary inquiry in 15 days based on her petition.Based on HC’s order, a team of 10 officers – including a superintendent of police – from Delhi visited Mumbai to investigate the matter and filed a preliminary inquiry on Tuesday.On Wednesday, CBI had approached the special National Investigation Agency (NIA) court, seeking permission to record the statement of Vaze, who is in NIA custody for allegedly planting an explosives-laden SUV near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house on February 25. Vaze’s statement was recorded following the NIA court’s permission. Singh had also named Vaze in his eight-page letter to Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in which he had alleged that Deshmukh had asked the suspended officer and two other officers to collect ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants in the city. While directing CBI to conduct a preliminary probe on Monday in a 52-page judgment, HC had observed that the Malabar Hill police had failed to take action on Jaishri Patil’s complaint, which had pointed to a cognisable offence being committed by Deshmukh. HC noted that it could not remain a “mute spectator” to the complaints received against high-level officers and ruled, “It is, hence, certainly an issue of credibility of state machinery, which would stare at face when confronted with the expectations of law and when such complaints are received against high-ranking public officials. This court cannot be a mute spectator in these circumstances.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-records-statements-of-former-mumbai-top-cop-param-bir-singh-and-sachin-vaze-101617910310072.html

09-04-2021||Chandigarh||Capt seeks review of vaccine strategy, calls for flexibility for states||Chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Thursday urged the Centre to give flexibility to states to devise their local strategies for Covid vaccination, within the broad parameters, while seeking a review of the strategy to allow all adults in high-risk areas to be immunised, along with patients with liver and kidney disease below the age of 45. Amarinder made these suggestions in a letter written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, immediately after the latter’s VC meeting with chief ministers of all states to review the Covid and vaccination situation. During the meeting, he apprised the Prime Minister of the situation in the state, and also the steps taken by his government to control and manage the disease. The CM also assured the Centre of all-out efforts by his government to contain and manage Covid. He said the UK variant, which is dominating the second wave in the state, is reported by experts to be more virulent and affecting the youth disproportionately. In his subsequent letter, the CM said his suggestions, some of which had been earlier submitted on March 17 to the PM, the Union home minister and the Union health minister, were based on the state government’s interaction with independent experts. Amid reports of some states facing vaccine shortages, Amarinder also requested the Union ministry of health and family welfare to share the schedule for supply of vaccines with the states over the next quarter, based on their confirmed supply orders. Given that over 80% positive cases found in Punjab are of the UK variant, as per early reports from central laboratories, he also sought strengthening of viral sequencing in the state, which has been reporting around 3,000 cases per day since the last 15 days, with around 8% positivity. The state currently has around 26,000 active cases with recovery rate of 87.3%, with death a matter of concern at 50-60 deaths a day and around 2% Case Fatality Rate (CFR) in the second surge, which struck the state in the latter half of February this year. The Chief Minister also reiterated his earlier request for covering all teachers and staff in all educational institutions for vaccination to enable resumption of physical classes once the surge abates. He also urged the Prime Minister to direct central institutions like IISER, IMTech, AIIMS Bathinda and PGIMER, Chandigarh to increase the RT-PCR testing from Punjab. Further, PGIMER, Chandigarh should be asked to earmark at least 50 Covid ICU beds for patients being referred by the State, he added. “Currently, 55% Health Care Workers and around 90% Front Line Workers have got the 1st dose of vaccine,” the chief minister earlier told the Prime Minister during the virtual meeting, while disclosing that more than 8.9 lakh persons aged above 45+ have taken first dose of vaccination. He said daily vaccinations have increased from 20,000 per day in mid-March to around 85-90,000 per day, with maximum of 1.32 lakh vaccinations on April 3. Giving a sense of the reasons for the surge, the Chief Minister apprised the meeting that the primary driver of the spread appeared to be fatigue/ laxity in following Covid appropriate behaviour, large political, social and religious gatherings, and efforts at normalisation such as opening of schools and Colleges. High positivity was being seen in younger population, he pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-seeks-review-of-vaccine-strategy-calls-for-flexibility-for-states-101617910068429.html

The court will hear the plea on Friday. In its application before the special court, CBI claimed that it needs to look at the records of investigation for probing the allegations made by former commissioner of Mumbai Police Param Bir Singh against Deshmukh. The agency sought an urgent relief, as prime accused Sachin Vaze’s custody with NIA ends on Friday. The court, however, said that if required, CBI could question Vaze while he is in prison during judicial custody. Meanwhile, the court has also asked NIA to submit its reply on CBI’s plea. Vaze was arrested on March 13 after in connection with an explosives-laden SUV found near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s house in south Mumbai on February 25 and the death of Thane businessman Mansukh Hiran, who is linked to the SUV. During the probe, Singh was transferred to a low-key post in the home guard department. Subsequently, he made several allegations in a letter addressed to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray on March 20 against Deshmukh. Upon the allegations made by Singh, the Bombay high court (HC), which was seized of multiple public interest litigations and a writ petition seeking a CBI probe into the accusations, had directed the central agency to conclude a preliminary inquiry in the case within 15 days. On HC’s order, CBI initiated an inquiry on Tuesday.

The schools had remained closed for almost 11 months due to the lockdown and had reopened in February this year, but the state government had to order another closure on March 13 in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases. Before the lockdown in March 2020, the city had around 150 pre-schools. A large number of these pre-schools were situated in Dugri, Civil Lines and South City, and had to bring their shutters down as they were unable to meet the fixed monthly expenses. Many owners said that the exorbitant rent was the main impediment. As per preschool owners, admissions usually begin in March or April but with the state government ordering another closure, parents are unwilling to pay fee for just online classes. The owners say that amid low enrolment, they are finding it difficult to pay the electricity and maintenance charges of the building or even the salaries of their staff. Ludhiana Pre-school Association president Amanpreet Singh Arora, said, “We were hoping that the government would allow us to re-open the schools on April 11, but they announced another closure till April 30. This move will severely affect the admission process in preschools. The owners have to pay salaries to teachers and maintain the school building. If schools remain closed for another month, it will become difficult for them to remain in business and the teachers and maids working here will be rendered jobless.” Ishneet Sharma, director of Childhood Kindergarten Playway School, Punjab Mata Nagar, said, “Last year, before lockdown, I had 70 children enrolled in my school but this year, we have only 18 students. I reopened the school on February 1 as per the state government’s orders and employed three teachers and three maids to take care of the children. But with another closure till April 30, it will be difficult to pay salaries to the staff. People who are running the pre-schools on rented properties are finding it difficult to meet the expenses as their income has been reduced to almost zero with parents refusing to pay for just online classes.” Working parents suffer The closure of day-care centres and pre-schools has added to the woes of families where both parents are working. Most of them are not comfortable leaving their children with helps at home and want to enroll their kids in pre-schools. “But we have been turning them away as we are unable to keep the centres open amid such low enrolment,” said Sharma. Sunil Kumar, a banker, said, “I have two kids and both have been staying in daycare centres. But with the centres closing down, we have no place to leave our kids. My wife and I have been working from home for the last few days to take care of the children.” Teachers switch to other professions Many of the teachers who lost their jobs have switched to other professions to earn a living. Owners of preschools say it will now be difficult to get good teachers to take classes. Anju Kohli, a preschool teacher, said, “I had been working in a preschool for five years and was teaching pre-nursery classes. Due to the pandemic, our pre-school situated in Dugri closed down last month. Since I was left without a job, I started to teach dance online.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lockdown-brought-shutters-down-on-40-of-ludhiana-s-preschools-101617909948578.html

To get into a state of readiness, Faith has requested the government to implement a policy to vaccinate its members at all sites of tourism, travel and hospitality companies. According to Faith, this will send out a strong message that the Indian tourism sector is getting ready to receive visitors in a safe and responsible manner. Subash Goyal, secretary general of Faith, said, “The second wave ofCovid-19 is spreading faster and has started impacting travel business. It could discourage more people from taking their planned trip. This makes it important to break the chain so that travel can be encouraged more.” This can also be the cornerstone of Indian tourism’s tactical communication strategy and will be a big competitive advantage and a key selling point for revival for all segments, a Faith spokesperson said. “Indian tourism is entering the peak holiday season for domestic travel in India, which is historically estimated to generate more than 60% tourism business. In a few months, we will also be entering the October-March season, which is the peak season for inbound travel, accounting for conventionally more than an estimated 70% of the tourism business,” the spokesperson said. According to VFS Global, world’s leading visa services organisation, the last quarter has witnessed intermittent activity for the international travel community, with borders opening up sporadically in step with vaccination drives at various regions. At present, the visa application process (in various categories) for over 40 governments has resumed at select visa application centres across India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/declare-tourism-industry-workers-as-covid-19-warriors-tourism-body-to-govt-101617909528945.html

09-04-2021||Other||Night curfew in Bengaluru, 6 other districts from April 10||BenglauruIn the wake of growing coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Karnataka, chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Thursday enforced night curfew in some districts of the state from April 10 to 20. “Night corona curfew from 10 pm to 5 am will be imposed in Bengaluru, Mysore, Mangaluru, Kalaburagi, Bidar, Tumkur and Udupi-Manipal districts from 10th April to 20th April. Essential services will be allowed,” Yediyurappa said on Thursday. The decision came after Prime Minister Narendra Modi held a meeting with Covid-19 impacted states in the wake of a surge of infections across the country. The night curfew will be enforced in the urban areas or district centres, Yediyurappa said. The state government on Thursday also said it will conduct a door-to-door survey in Bengaluru with an aim to test at least 1 lakh people every day and raise awareness to help contain the growing surge of Covid-19 cases.“There are 8,500 booths in BBMP limits and a team will be formed in each booth to conduct a door-to-door survey. Their mandate will include testing, spreading awareness on isolation guidelines, necessary assistance to Covid infected persons, treatment for home isolated people, stamping, health check-up, ensuring oxygen service for the infected persons etc,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education, said on Thursday.“Though this programme was unveiled last year, it could not be implemented. But now we will ensure this happens. Every ward will have one ambulance, 250 ambulances are available,” Sudhakar added.The statements come at a time when Bengaluru has seen a rapid surge in cases since the beginning of March, touching nearly 5,000 new cases on Wednesday.Bengaluru, which is among the top 10 worst Covid-19 impacted districts in the country, has 38,946 active cases and the rate of the spread is reported to be faster when compared to the outbreak last year, experts said. The city reported 4,422 new cases on Thursday while the number was 6,570 for the state, taking its active case load to 53,395. A total of 36 patients succumbed to Covid-19 in state, including 22 in Bengaluru.“More number of Covid-19 positive cases is reported in Bengaluru and 6 other districts. Though there is surge in number of cases, the fatality rate remains low. The case fatality rate was 0.50% in the state yesterday,” the chief minister’s office (CMO) said in a statement on Thursday. “We prohibited gatherings for fairs and festivals and other religious and social gatherings and ensuring the same is complied with. Action has been initiated to impose penalties on those who do not wear mask and maintain distancing in public places,” the statement added. The positivity rate in Karnataka is hovering around 6%. The higher number of cases is adding to the challenges of arranging increasing demand for hospital beds. In Bengaluru, the occupancy is around 85% in the 1,500 beds available in 11 hospitals. The CMO said he state has ramped up the number of general beds, oxygenated beds and ICUs. “We have more than 42,000 general beds, 30,000 oxygenated beds, 3,000 ICUs and 2,900 beds with ventilators in general hospitals,” the statement added. Yediyurappa said the prime minister has advised states to focus on micro-containment zones.Meanwhile, the state government is hoping to contain the surge with higher vaccination coverage. The state has around 25-30 lakh doses of vaccines and is expecting another 25 lakh doses, according to the state government. “We have taken up vaccination at a large scale. About 6,000 vaccination centres are working daily. Of these, 5,400 are in government facilities and 600 in private facilities. So far, we have vaccinated more than 53 lakh people. We have vaccinated 22.31% of the target population above 45 years of age as compared to the National Average of 13.94% as on 5.4.2021,” the CMO said in a statement. “We have 25-30 lakh doses available in the state (and the) centre has assured to provide 25 lakh additional doses. There is no shortage of vaccines,” Sudhakar said on Thursday.The city administration and state government have targeted apartment complexes, cinema halls, pubs and restaurants to impose restrictions like curtailing capacities and even shutting down establishments that do not enforce Covid appropriate behaviour.However, it appears to have taken a soft stand on political events as parties continue to take out campaign rallies for the three bypolls at Basavakalyan, Belagavi and Maski in the state.Sudhakar said political events should also be organised in accordance with the guidelines or “we all may have to take moral responsibility for the surge”.“In India, SC intervention is for wearing a mask in a car, but zero interference for political rallies & religious congregations which are becoming (a) source of super spreaders. Govt turning a blind eye to this will cost us heavily,” Priyank Kharge, former Karnataka minister and Congress legislator posted on Twitter.Meanwhile, residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) at various apartment complexes in the city have also come out with Covid-19 specific guidelines.At Embassy Pristine, an upscale apartment at Bellandur in Bengaluru, the RWA has put in place a number of measures including suspending amenities not mandated by the government.“All sports facilities, including but not limited to open courts, football, and Kids play area would be closed till 20th April and reviewed thereon,” according to a message by the RWA to the residents of the complex.“Coaches and coaching classes would be suspended till 20th April,” the message added.“We have been asked not to move around too much even within the apartment complex,” said a resident of the complex, requesting anonymity.The RWAs in several apartment complexes in Bengaluru have resorted to formulating their own set of rules as a measure to insulate these spaces from the rising number of Covid-19 cases. This particular apartment block has 19 cases so far and the RWA has asked residents to minimise travel, not entertain guests and even postpone non-essential work among other restrictions.“We are in touch with the BBMP to ensure necessary compliance and request all your help to ensure we do not slip into a containment zone classification,” according to the message by the RWA to its residents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/night-curfew-in-bengaluru-6-other-districts-from-april-10-101617908567788.html

09-04-2021||Noida||Yeida to explore possibility of different Metro modes to Noida airport||Greater Noida: The Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (Yeida) has decided to prepare a detailed project report (DPR) on the unconventional modes of metro connectivity that will link the upcoming Jewar international airport with the rest of Delhi-NCR.Officials aware of the development said the government was considering three modes of metro connectivity -- Metro Lite, Metro Neo and Express Line, each differing from the other in terms of speed, budget, ease of construction methodology, among other parameters. At present, most of the Delhi Metro and the lone line of Aqua Metro follow the conventional mode.Yeida has already roped in the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) to prepare the DPR for the three modes. “We got the DMRC to prepare a DPR of a metro line connecting Noida airport to Greater Noida’s Knowledge Park-II, which is a distance of approximately 35.6 km. We forwarded the DPR to the state government for necessary assessment and approval. The state government gave its observation and asked us to prepare a DPR of the three modes of connectivity. The DMRC will soon start preparing the DPR of the three models,” said Arun Vir Singh, CEO of the Yeida. As per the DPR of the metro line, 25 metro stations have been proposed on the 35.6km route which will require a corpus of ₹7,000 crore. Yeida officials said they are aiming to finish the connectivity project by 2024, when the airport at Jewar is also scheduled to be completed. The UP government is of the view that faster connectivity is a necessity because of the low speed on normal metro link. The speed limit for small vehicles on the Yamuna expressway, where Jewar is located, is 100 kmph and 60 kmph for heavy vehicles. With an average speed of 30-35kmph on the normal metro link, passengers travelling from Greater Noida to Jewar airport will prefer travelling in car to save time.“The state government wants to explore the fastest mode of conveyance from Greater Noida to Noida airport. We have not fixed a deadline to ready the DPR of the three modes. The DMRC will be asked to finish and submit the report at the earliest so that we can finalise on the fastest mode of conveyance and start work without delay. We need to develop the connectivity before the airport becomes functional,” said Singh.“The state government wants a dedicated Airport Express Line or something that will run at a speed of 90 to 110 kmph,” said Singh.Metro Lite, which is light rail urban transit system, and Metro Neo-- a mass rapid transit system, are cheaper alternatives to the conventional metros that smaller cities are opting for to augment public transport.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/yeida-to-explore-possibility-of-different-metro-modes-to-noida-airport-101617906647583.html

We don’t have any vaccine stock available with us. The beneficiaries have to return, and we have also put up a notice informing people. We have already made payments for fresh vaccine stock,” said Dr Shakeel Ahmad, administrative officer from LYF Hospital in Indirapuram.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey said there was no shortage vaccine and pointed out “management issues” at the private CVCs.“We have no shortage of vaccine. There are some managerial issues with private CVCs which have led to this situation. We will hold meetings with them and resolve the issues. It was directed that preference will be given at private CVCs to pre-registered beneficiaries. But private CVCs also allowed walk-ins,” the district magistrate said.“We have made payments, but health department officials say it will take another two or three days to send the stock. Low stocks have been affecting the vaccination drive since Monday, so we have now put up a notice,” said Poonam Singh from administration department of Chandra Laxmi Hospital in Vaishali.Anamika Sharma, officer from the administration and HR department of Amicare Hospital in Indirapuram, said, “There is short supply, and we get limited stock. We administer shots whenever we get vaccine stock. We are not able to buy doses everyday due to availability issues. On Thursday, we had stock to administer doses to only 70-80 beneficiaries. So, other beneficiaries had to return. This is why we put up a notice.”Officials on Thursday said the health department had a stock of 12,290 doses of Covishield and 5,100 doses of Covaxin, and added that more will be procured from the store in Meerut.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/private-centres-in-ghaziabad-say-out-of-covid-19-vaccine-admin-claims-otherwise-101617906587482.html

A case was registered on her complaint and investigation was taken up, said a police officer, who did not want to be named.“When we analysed the email ID, it was found that the culprit was using a VPN (Virtual Private Network) for accessing the email account. After examining the collected information with the help of technical surveillance and cyber forensic tools, the identity of the alleged user was identified and subsequently he was apprehended from east Delhi’s Krishna Nagar,” the officer said.A mobile phone, used for operating the email ID and a social media account, was recovered from him, the police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/17yearold-boy-detained-for-cyber-stalking-woman-101617905509413.html

They will also cease to operate in case resolutions disapproving the ordinance are passed by both the Houses. The ordinance on the air quality management was not introduced in Parliament within six weeks of its convention in October last year.On Thursday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta sought ten days from a bench led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde to place the ordinance on record. Accepting the request, the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, adjourned the matter to April 19.Nudged by the top court, the Union environment ministry had promulgated The Commission for Air Quality Management in National Capital Region and Adjoining Area Ordinance on October 28 last year to implement a consolidated approach to monitoring, tackling and eliminating causes of air pollution in Delhi NCR and adjoining areas.Complaining against disbanding of the commission, teenager Aditya Dubey, had filed an application in the top court which was taken up on Thursday when the government assured the bench about issuing the ordinance in a week.In his public interest litigation (PIL), Dubey alleged that authorities have failed to protect his fundamental right to clean air and health by not controlling air pollution.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ordinance-to-revive-air-quality-commission-in-a-week-centre-tells-sc-101617905510061.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi high court slams sanitation staff for 'hooliganism'||The Delhi high court on Thursday said even though the sanitation workers of the municipal corporations and their unions have a right to protest on the non-payment of salaries, they would not be allowed to create a nuisance or resort to hooliganism by throwing garbage on streets and obstructing other employees from going to work.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said such conduct would not be tolerated and penal action would be taken against the union leaders and members.It disposed of a plea by the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) seeking direction to the city police and the Delhi government to ensure that there is no obstruction in the performance of duties by its officials and employees, including safai karamcharis who are willing to work.During the hearing, advocate Prakash Kumar, representing the president and secretary of the MCD Swachhata Karamchari Union leaders, who gave the strike call, appeared before the court and assured it that they will not resort to any such conduct or call for strike in the future.To this, the high court said, “If there is a grievance, you have a right to raise it and nobody is taking away your right. But you cannot create a nuisance and ‘gundagardi (hooliganism)’. We will not allow this and will come down heavily with an iron hand.”The bench further said, “We will not permit anyone to take law into their hands. ‘Gundagardi’ will not be allowed. Spilling of garbage on streets is not allowed and you cannot restrain others from doing their duties.”The court said since the president and secretary of the union have appeared before it, it does not wish to pursue the bailable warrants issued earlier against them.“We have impressed upon the president and secretary of the union that though they are entitled to exercise their rights as provided by the law to raise their grievances, they do not have a right to create nuisance and take law into their hands by spilling garbage on roads and restraining others from performing their duties,” the bench said.EDMC had earlier said several safai karamcharis unions had called for a strike in March and that they shall be restrained from throwing garbage on streets or hampering the functioning of the corporation.The EDMC, in its plea, had also sought direction to the authorities to provide necessary assistance so that day-to-day operations of the corporation can be run smoothly and no inconvenience is caused to the members of the general public.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/have-right-to-protest-but-not-to-create-nuisance-throw-garbage-on-road-hc-tells-sanitation-union-101617905508749.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt orders private hospitals to increase beds for Covid-19 patients||With the city reporting over 7,000 fresh Covid-19 cases on Thursday, the Delhi government directed private hospitals to increase beds earmarked for the treatment of coronavirus patients, for the third time in a week. Two state government hospitals, Lok Nayak and Guru Teg Bahadur, were also asked to scale up Covid-19 infrastructure.According to an signed by Dr RN Das, medical superintendent of Delhi’s nursing home cell, 115 hospitals with over 50 beds across the city have been asked to reserve 50% of their total ICU and ward beds for Covid-19, or 1.25 times the occupancy on Thursday, whichever is higher.This will add 491 ICU beds and 2,430 ward beds in the private hospitals over Monday’s escalated total, according to the order. The government had ordered 33 private hospitals to reserve 25% of their ward and ICU capacity last Saturday, then again ordered 54 private hospitals – which includes the 33 from the previous list – to reserve 30% of their ward and ICU capacity on Monday. The hospitals are still in the process of increasing the number of beds.“The occupancy of the Covid ICU beds has surged and reached more than 85% in 20 of the 54 private hospitals. Similarly, the occupancy of Covid ward beds has also increased and reached more than 75% in 22 of the 54 private hospitals,” read the order. The private hospitals have been allowed to increase their total beds strength by 25% and use the increased capacity only for Covid-19 treatment.The government also ordered Lok Nayak hospital to increase the total Covid-19 beds from 1,000 as per Monday’s order to 1,500, of which 300 will be ICU beds. And, Guru Teg Nahadur hospital has been asked to increase the number of beds from 500 to 1,000, of which 200 will be in the ICU.Lok Nayak hospital has curtailed outpatient clinics and halved routine surgeries to ensure staff availability for Covid-19 beds. On Thursday, the All India Institute of Medical Sciences also suspended all routine surgeries Saturday onwards.In two other separate orders, the Delhi government asked all its hospitals to re-create holding or triage areas where patients can receive oxygen therapy while completing admission process. “It may be ensured that no patient is kept waiting for more than 10 minutes,” the order read.The Delhi government hospitals have also been directed to utilise dental and AYUSH practitioners for Covid duty.Dr Suranjit Chatterjee, senior consultant of internal medicine at Indraprastha Apollo hospital, said: “The number of Covid-19 cases has increased sharply and there is a need to increase the number of beds. However, the problem this time around is that the non-Covid services have resumed; they are at 70% to 80% of the pre-Covid capacity,” said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-govt-orders-private-hospitals-to-increase-beds-for-covid-patients-101617905507404.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||Woman misleads cops to save sister in Dwarka accident case||Four days after a 79-year-old doctor and his 62-year-old wife were killed after being run over by a car in Sector 11, Dwarka, in south-west Delhi, the police on Thursday said the errant driver was not the woman they had arrested earlier but her sister, a 28-year-old probationary officer of Canara Bank.Both sisters have now been arrested – bank employee Nupur Choudhary on charges of rash and negligent driving that resulted in the death of the elderly couple, and 30-year-old Deepakshi Choudhary on charges of misleading the police and getting herself arrested to save her sister’s job, said deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena.“We have arrested Nupur for rash and negligent driving causing death, while appropriate charges are being added in the case against Deepakshi, who misled us and our probe. Deepakshi and her family members said she owned up to the offence in an attempt to save Nupur’s job. We are investigating the case further to ascertain if there are any other reasons behind the subterfuge,” said DCP Meena, adding that the car is registered in the name of Deepakshi, who has obtained bail in the accident case.On Sunday around 6.30pm, the elderly couple Shanti Swaroop Arora and his wife Anjula Arora were out on a stroll when a grey Baleno car hit them from the front and ran over them on the Masjid Wali Road. The accident was captured by a CCTV camera installed at a mosque across the road.In the six-minute-long video clip recorded by the CCTV camera, the couple is seen walking on the left side of the road; when suddenly, a grey car moving at a slow speed in the middle of the road starts moving towards them and hits them. The man and his wife fall on the road, and the car is seen running them over.The footage also shows a woman driver stopping, taking out her cellphone from the car, and calling someone frantically. Some passersby rescued the elderly couple and rushed them to a nearby hospital, where they died.DCP Meena said that when the police reached the hospital and enquired about the errant driver, a man told them that the accident was caused by his elder daughter. A woman came forward, identified herself as the car’s owner Deepakshi Choudhary and confessed to hitting the couple while driving. She told the police that she was distracted while driving, leading to her losing control of the vehicle.The fresh developments in the case emerged only after family members of the dead couple raised doubts about the arrest and said the woman arrested by the police was not the one driving the car at the time of the accident. The family members told the police that the car was driven by the arrested woman’s sister, the Delhi Police had said in a statement on Wednesday night.HT tried to contact the couple’s family for comment, but the cellphone number available for them was switched off.The police are now probing if the actual driver had a valid driving licence and, if not, whether that was the reason why the sisters had chose to mislead the police. The DCP did not comment on the driving licence angle when asked about it.The colour of the clothes worn by the errant driver and her physique was captured by a CCTV camera at the mosque. The police said the sisters had not exchanged their clothes, but the investigating team had not matched the colour of the sisters’ clothes with the video footage at the time of Deepakshi’s arrest. The DCP insisted that were no lapses on part of the investigation team.“We arrested the woman based on her confession and her father’s statement. But when the dead couple’s family members raised doubts, we verified their allegations that the car was being driven by Deepakshi’s sister and found it true. Accordingly, both the sisters have been arrested,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/elderly-couple-run-over-police-say-errant-driver-was-sister-of-woman-they-arrested-both-now-in-custody-101617905448768.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||10-5 job: Cops focus on crowded areas at night||Delhi Police personnel and district officials are focussing on busy markets, congested neighbourhoods and slums while enforcing the night curfew in the national capital, officials aware of the matter said. They added that the police and district officials were also carrying out awareness drives, and asking people not to venture out between 10pm and 5am until they have the requisite curfew pass or in the event of an emergency.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Tuesday ordered a night curfew until April 30 to limit the spread of the coronavirus disease. Government officials, essential workers, those travelling to airports, railway stations, interstate bus terminals, Covid-19 vaccination centres or hospitals are exempt from the seven-hour curfew. Travel during curfew some of these categories will require e-passes. The order implies that all restaurants, markets, wedding halls, pubs and commercial establishments also have to shut by 10pm.Police and district officials across the city were spotted in markets such as Lajpat Nagar, Connaught Place, Khan Market and Janpath well before 10pm, requesting people to shut shops on time to prevent gatherings. In many congested neighbourhoods and slum clusters, police used loudspeakers mounted on e-rickshaws to inform people about the importance of social distancing.On Wednesday night, Delhi Police filed 489 FIRs across the city, temporarily detained 843 people and issued 731 fines for flouting social distancing norms. In comparison, the police on Tuesday registered 220 cases, temporarily detained 534 people and issued 842 fines.HT spoke to several police officers on the ground who said that unlike the nationwide lockdown last year, the enforcement teams are not stopping every vehicle on the road during the curfew, but were focussed on curbing gatherings.A senior revenue official said that their focus in the first few days was to spread awareness, and not just penalise violators. “Police have been asked to spread awareness and counsel those who are resisting government orders. The idea is to get all places where people gather, such as shops, markets and restaurants, shut by 10pm. We aim to stop people from loitering around. Of course, emergencies and other genuine cases are always considered without any question,” said the official.Police and administration officials are conducting flag marches every day between 8pm and 10pm in New Delhi district, which has some of the city’s most popular markets.“We faced resistance from some store owners in Connaught Place. In Khan Market, there was almost 100% compliance, with shops shutting before 10pm. In Sarojini Nagar and RK Puram markets, we had trouble with street vendors. So today [Thursday], we held a meeting with the street vendors’ association to convince them to wrap up their outlets by 10pm,” said Dr Nitin Shakya, sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) of New Delhi district.In the past two days, the New Delhi district administration has issued at least 20 notices to shops, restaurants and pubs for defying DDMA orders. Such establishments were also warned that if they do not shut by 10pm from Thursday night, the outlet will be sealed with immediate effect and a penalty will be imposed, as per relevant sections of the DDMA Act and the Indian Penal Code, Shakya said.Delhi Police have roped in auto-rickshaw and e-rickshaw drivers to make public announcements in congested neighbourhoods such as Sangam Vihar and Ambedkar Nagar to make people aware of the rules and the importance of social distancing.Joint commissioner of police (southern range) Suvashis Choudhary, said, “Our intention is not to penalise but to work with citizens and stop the spread of the disease. In narrow by-lanes of places such as Sangam Vihar, Ambedkar Nagar or the slum areas, police teams on e -rickshaws are alerting people during the day on the need to avoid gathering. We register FIRs only in cases, where citizens are adamant and refuse to abide by the rules. Much before 10pm, we request people to shut establishments. Using the public address system, we remind them before the deadline. The compliance is good.”Choudhary said police teams on the road at night are also helping citizens who have genuine reasons to be out during curfew hours.On Wednesday, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said the curfew was imposed in the Capital because people were found to be organising parties and other events where Covid-19 appropriate behaviour like wearing masks and maintaining social distancing, were often ignored.“The night curfew has been imposed because there were reports about parties, which cause unnecessary gatherings and put people in close contact. Hence the night curfew is aimed to avoid this situation because if even one is positive among the 50 people, all 50 would test positive,” he told reporters.A police constable, who was on duty outside the Delhi Golf Club on Wednesday night, said, “The difference between lockdown and night curfew is that we are easy on people returning home from work late at night. But if there is more than one person in a car or a group returning late at night after a party, we take action against them for violating the curfew rules.”Deputy commissioner of police (New Delhi) Eish Singhal said by Wednesday night, the police have issued 84 fines and registered 1 case against those defying the curfew orders.Officials in the South district administration said they have tied up with market associations and residents’ welfare associations (RWAs) to focus making people aware and ensure that they adhere to the rules.When contacted, the management of the Select Citywalk, a mall in south Delhi, said the shopping centre has reduced its operations by at least 2.5 hours.“The shopping centre is now open from 10:30 am to 9pm, compared to the usual timings of 10am to 11pm. But, we have allowed food delivery from restaurants, groceries and pharmacies. Information is being shared across our website and social media handles. Regular announcements are also being made,” the mall said in an e-mail response to HT.In central Delhi, which includes parts of old Delhi like Chandni Chowk, Daryaganj, Jama Masjid and Chandni Mahal, where eateries used to stay open even after midnight, police have roped in heads of mosques, temples and other religious places to spread the word about the curfew.Deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh said, “The nightlife in the Walled City is different from other parts of Delhi. We contacted the RWAs, heads of mosques, temples and roped them to inform citizens on the importance of not gathering during the curfew hours. Through their cooperation, we were able to ensure that the shops, which opened till late night are now shut before 10pm. Even during the day, police teams patrol the Walled City area making announcements about the curfew.”On Wednesday night, police in central Delhi issued 25 fines and registered two cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/105-job-cops-focus-on-crowded-areas-at-night-101617905448189.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||BJP protests, wants Delhi govt to buy wheat at 'promised rate'||The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Thursday staged a protest against the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government outside Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s residence for allegedly misleading farmers and not fulfilling its promise of buying wheat at ₹2,612 per quintal in the city.The protest comes a day after senior AAP leader Gopal Rai, who is in charge of the state agriculture department, alleged that the Food Corporation of India has not yet opened counters for procurement of wheat at Delhi’s grain markets at the minimum support price (MSP).The FCI and its Delhi region office on Wednesday had taken to Twitter calling the AAP-led Delhi government’s claims “baseless”. “Allegations made by government of Delhi is completely baseless. FCI Delhi is fully prepared to procure wheat from farmers of Delhi at FSD Narela, Mayapuri & APMC Najafgarh mandi, which have been operational since April 1 & FCI has already procured 158 Qt wheat as on April 7,” tweeted FCI Delhi region, along with photographs of FSD Narela.On Thursday, Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta hit out at the AAP and said that the Delhi government was anti-farmers. “Kejriwal had promised free power and said it will purchase farm produce at a price that is one-and-a-half times more than MSP . He had said that his government will buy wheat at ₹2,612 per quintal. But the government has not even opened a single centre for it. They are also not cooperating with FCI, which is now buying wheat in Delhi on its own,” said Gupta.Gupta demanded that the government either immediately honour the promises made or AAP leader Gopal Rai apologise to farmers.BJP MLA Ramvir Singh Bidhuri, Leader of the Opposition in the Delhi assembly, added that if needed he, along with other party workers, will protest outside Rai’s residence as well to support farmers’ issues.Bidhuri said, “We are standing in complete solidarity with the farmers. The Delhi government has not opened any centres so far to buy wheat. The government does not want any buying to take place at MSP. The Central government agency, which has opened its centres here, is buying wheat at the rate of ₹1,975 per quintal. If the Kejriwal government wants, it can pay the remaining ₹800 per quintal to farmers.”Delhi government spokespersons refused to comment on the issue despite repeated requests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bjp-protests-outside-kejriwal-s-residence-says-aap-should-buy-wheat-at-prices-promised-to-farmers-101617905387381.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||Arrange travel for Covid-19 jabs during night curfew , MCDs urge Delhi govt||The three municipal corporations of the city have appealed the Delhi government to make transport arrangements for those choosing to get vaccinated during night curfew timings.North Delhi Municipal Corporation mayor Jai Prakash said due to the night curfew, there is no public transport available after 10pm. So during the hours of the curfew, he requested that the government makes alternative travel arrangements for those wanting to take the jab at the 24-hour vaccination centres in the city and also for those working in these vaccination centres.“Not everyone is able to get an e-pass permitting them to move around during the curfew hours and even if people do get the pass, how they will be able to get a public transport after 10pm? So I have written to the chief minister urging him to find a solution to the problem of commute of health-care staff and the general public to and from 24-hour vaccination centres during night curfew timings,” Prakash said.He said he will conduct a night patrol on Thursday to understand the issues people are facing, especially related to vaccination, during the night curfew.The north corporation on Wednesday made its Mrs Girdhar Lal Maternity Hospital a 24-hour vaccination centre. It is the first MCD hospital to be converted into a round-the-clock vaccination facility. There are nearly 75 vaccination centres being managed by the three municipalities across the city where till Wednesday, nearly 1.6 lakh people had taken the jab. Apart from these, there are 33 more government hospitals offering similar facilities.“If people are unable to reach the 24-hour vaccination centres during the night curfew hours, either due to the lack of an e-pass or due to the lack of public transport, then keeping these centres open round the clock will be a futile exercise as people will not be getting vaccinated in adequate numbers. So the government should address these issues,” Prakash further said.Narendra Chawla, leader of the house in South Delhi Municipal Corporation (SDMC), said the night curfew might be a required step but the government should also ensure that people are able to reach the 24-hour vaccination centres at their given time slots. “Some arrangement should be made to ensure that people (whose vaccination slot is during curfew timings) do not face problem in reaching the centre,” Chawla said.Nirmal Jain, mayor of East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), also echoed similar views and said the government should take these issues into consideration and work out a solution. “We (representatives of the three municipalities) are planning to meet the lieutenant-governor in the coming days to discuss all these issues,” Jain said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcds-urge-govt-to-make-travel-arrangements-for-those-planning-to-take-the-jab-during-night-curfew-101617905267320.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||No new admissions to primary classes in Schools of Excellence: Delhi govt||The Delhi government has decided to discontinue admissions in primary classes in its Schools of Excellence from this year onwards and instead, focus on converting the schools into specialised branches for a particular discipline —like Science, Arts or Skill Education — officials familiar with the development said.There was no immediate clarity about admissions to senior classes in such schools.Nirupama Abhyankar, deputy director of education (Schools of Excellence), said, “Admissions for junior classes to these schools will not be conducted this year. We are thinking of converting these schools into specialised branches of excellence for higher classes.” The Delhi cabinet on March 22 had approved setting up 100 Schools of Specialised Excellence across the city for students of classes 9 to 12.In 2018, the Delhi government started six Schools of Excellence across the city which are supposed to be model, resource-rich English-medium schools. Before the pandemic struck, the schools conducted admissions to classes 9 and 11 through entrance tests and conducted regular admissions for Nursery to Class 2. However, last year due to the pandemic, the schools did not conduct any admissions to primary classes and only admitted students in senior classes on the basis of merit.Some parents, who were aspiring to get their children admitted to these schools this year, said they were disappointed by the education department’s decision.Shweta Yadav, 26, a resident of Patparganj who wanted to get her three-year-old daughter admitted to the School of Excellence in Khichripur, said, “We got to know that these schools provide learning facilities on the lines of private schools at little to no fees. It seemed like a good option, especially because the perception of government schools in Delhi has changed over the past few years. If admissions to Schools of Excellence don’t happen this year, I will get her admitted to a private school.”M Shariq, principal of School of Excellence, Kalkaji, also said, “We have been receiving queries from parents on the admission process that usually begins in March. We haven’t received any official order yet regarding the admissions.”Confirming that no new admissions will take place in primary classes, a senior education department official said, “The students already studying in these schools will continue and no new admissions will take place. English-medium was not the exclusive quality of these schools and there were various things like pupil-teacher ratio and providing other facilities to students. The bar of these facilities have been raised in other government schools and parents can opt for those schools as well."The principal of another School of Excellence, requesting anonymity, said, “We did not conduct admissions for primary classes last year either, as there was a plan to convert these into specialised schools in particular areas like Science, Arts and Skill Education.”Mamata Dhingra, who teaches Mathematics at School of Excellence, Dwarka, said, “Our school is likely to have a Science specialisation. Work has already started on the laboratories and we too have been consulting on the other necessary resources that will be provided to the school in the days to come.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/no-new-admissions-to-primary-classes-in-schools-of-excellence-govt-101617905147396.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||CBSE increases examination centres by 50% to ensure social distancing||The Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) has added 2,500 more examination centres this year, in India and abroad, in order to ensure social distancing during the Class 10 and 12 board exams scheduled to be held from May 4, officials said, even as the board reiterated that it is not considering any change in the exam schedule, amid demands to cancel the exams in view of the second Covid-19 wave across the country.Around 340,000 students are likely to take the board exams this year.Sanyam Bhardwaj, CBSE controller examinations, on Thursday said the board has decided to set up around 7,500 examination centres in India and abroad this year, in comparison to last year’s 5,000-odd centres.“The increase in centres will help officials to implement other Covid-19 precautionary measures effectively. Besides, we will follow all Covid-19 guidelines as issued by the Union government at the examination centres,” he said.The board on April 1 announced that if a student is unable to appear for the ongoing practical exams because they, or a family member, have tested positive for Covid-19, schools will conduct re-tests for them by June. CBSE last month also allowed the students to submit their requests to change centres for the practical and written examinations.Principals of several schools welcomed the board’s decision to increase the number of examination centres.Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “We have received details about our examination centre in INA, and it appears that students from only one or two schools will be allotted a centre this time. Earlier, students from three or four schools would share one examination centre. We are relieved to know that the board has increased the number of examination centres. It may have been difficult for schools earmarked as examination centres to adjust since only 10 students are allowed in a room this time.”Also Read | Centre says 43 million Covid vaccine doses in stock after shortage alarmJyoti Arora, principal of Mount Abu Public School in Rohini, which is earmarked as a CBSE examination centre every year, said, “The only way to ensure the safety of students during exams is to increase the number of centres. The safety of children is our top priority, and CBSE’s decision to increase centres is commendable.”Earlier in February, the board had announced that the Class 12 exams will be taken in two shifts — 10.30 am-12.30/1.30 pm and 2.30 pm- 4.30/5.30pm — to reduce the number of days exams are conducted, in view of the pandemic.Meanwhile, by Thursday evening, 79,000 students signed an online petition demanding that the CBSE exams be cancelled in view of the country’s spiralling Covid-19 scenario.“The situation in India is getting worse day by the day. When there were only a few cases in the country, they cancelled the remaining board exams, and now when the cases are at a peak they are planning to open schools. We urge the education minister to look into this matter and cancel all examinations to be held this year as students are already under a lot of stress,” the petition read.Bhardwaj, however, said the exams will be conducted as per the schedule. “The board is not considering anything in this regard. Exams will be conducted as per the schedule with all precautions in place,” he said.Last year, the board had to postpone exams in March when the nationwide lockdown was enforced to contain the spread of the infection. The exams were cancelled later, and the results were announced on the basis of an alternative assessment scheme.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cbse-increases-examination-centres-by-50-to-ensure-social-distancing-101617905147999.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal reviews slum rehabilitation project||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Thursday directed officials to expedite the construction of flats under the state government’s ‘Jahan Jhuggi, Wahin Makan’ in situ [on site] slum rehabilitation project.Kejriwal reviewed the progress of the project at a meeting with senior government officials.“Chief minister Kejriwal added that any problems in the implementation of the scheme should be brought to his notice so that they can be effectively removed and families can be shifted to their new homes and can lead a life of dignity,” read a government press statement issued after the review meeting.The project is being spearheaded by the Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (Dusib) and Delhi State Industrial and Infrastructure Development Corporation (DSIIDC). Over 90,300 flats will be constructed across Delhi over 237 acres in multi-storey buildings and each flat is expected to cost the government ₹8 lakh, according to senior government officials.In the first phase, over 52,300 flats will be allotted, 18,000 in the second phase and 20,000 in the third phase.The deadline for the first phase is April 2022, and the entire project by 2025.The statement further read, “DUSIB officials informed the CM that construction of 18,084 flats was underway. These flats are almost ready. Officials in the meeting informed that 34,260 flats are being built by DSIIDC. Of this, 17,660 flats are ready, while 16,600 flats are under construction. Apart from this, the officials informed that 4,833 flats have been allotted to the homeless families living in slums, while the process of allocation of 7031 flats is underway and will be completed soon.”In previous meetings on the project, Kejriwal instructed the officials to ensure the allotment of the flats within 5 kms of where their slums were located.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cm-reviews-slum-rehabilitation-project-101617905087970.html
09-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi: Amid 4th Covid wave, districts intensify micro containment zone strategy||Dharamveer Singh, a 44-year-old labour worker, was isolated in his residence in Hanuman Mandir Gully — one of the many cramped lanes in west Delhi’s Palam neighbourhood — after he tested positive for Covid-19 last Thursday.Two days later, his younger brother, Akash, who lives next door, also tested positive. With that, the two houses were clubbed and turned into one of the 4,200-odd “micro” containment zones in the city.Containment zones are sealed premises or areas that are essentially under a hard lockdown for a certain period, and are placed under increased surveillance by district teams. Essential goods are delivered to doorsteps, and these areas can be de-notified only if no new cases are added for 14 days.With each Covid-19 wave, the Delhi government has intensified its micro containment strategy. Revenue minister Kailash Gahlot said the efforts to create such zones in the city have yielded positive results, adding that even though Delhi is witnessing a fresh spike in cases, there have been no mass clusters or hot spots in the city so far.“In Delhi, we have been following the micro containment zone policy for several months now. The current containment zones are smaller than most of the red zones that were demarcated and notified a few months ago. The policy has allowed the government to cover a large section of active cases, causing the least inconvenience to unaffected people. Due to the effective implementation of the micro containment policy, a higher proportion of people in home isolation are currently in containment zones — hence, much higher surveillance. It has been an effective strategy to ensure Delhi does not see mass clusters and hot spots,” he said.In a meeting, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday urged chief ministers to focus on imposing micro containment zones to tackle rising cases.As on Thursday, Delhi had 23,181 active Covid-19 cases, of which 13,988 were inside containment zones, government records said. This means that these zones cover around 60% of the total active cases — up from 33%-35% in mid-November, when the third wave was its peak in the Capital, showed data.The micro containment strategy was implemented in Delhi during the second wave in September.In November, each containment zone in Delhi on average had three active cases. Currently, each on average has 2.3 active cases, showed government data.The demarcation process is, however, extremely complex, several senior district administration officials said.For instance, Dharamveer lives with his wife, two children and mother. In the house to the right, lives Akash, his wife and their daughter. In the house to his left lives his sister Rama, her husband Kumar, and their two children. While these houses are separate units from the outside, from the inside, they are connected through corridors, shared terraces, and other links.“In this case, it was a challenge to club two houses and leave out the third, the occupants of which — Dharamveer’s sister and her family — were not affected by the disease. Secondly, their house was connected to more relatives’ houses. It did not make sense to put everyone inside a containment zone,” said a senior official.“So, we sealed all access points and shared spaces that connect Dharamveer and Akash’s houses to the residences of other relatives in the same stretch, and clubbed the two into one containment zone. The unit has two active cases (the brothers) and six other residents (their wives, children and mother). All members of the family are under surveillance.”In the initial months of the pandemic, Delhi used to have much larger containment zones — often entire lanes and blocks, which government officials said led to several complaints from people who were not infected, but had to bear the brunt of restrictions.“The old policy was difficult to implement and adhere to. A lot of people started providing incorrect addresses while getting tested for Covid-19, fearing that if they tested positive, their locality would be turned a containment zone. The micro containment strategy has largely resolved these problems,” said a second senior government official.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-4th-wave-of-covid-infections-districts-intensify-micro-containment-zone-strategy-101617905027339.html

09-04-2021||Pune||Shortage affects vaccination drive in Pune, parts of western Maharashtra||Many inoculation centres in Pune district operated partially on Thursday due to the unavailability of vaccines even as Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) officials denied that there was shortage in the city. Of the 427 centres across the district, 54,059 got their vaccine dose, while in the city, 130 centres inoculated 18,480 people on Thursday. In view of shortage of vaccines, Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation announced that there will be no inoculation drive on Friday in the industrial town. PMC, however, will continue the vaccination as it has 25,000 vaccine doses left. “We are trying to procure doses. Once they are available, vaccination will resume,” said Pavan Salve, additional health officer, PCMC. Hadapsar resident Sayali Wagh, 56, had to return without getting her jab as planned since the vaccination centre in Hadapsar was shut. “A notice board was placed outside the centre stating vaccination will not be done today. Officials at the centre said that they are awaiting the doses and asked me to come tomorrow,” said Wagh. PMC officials said that they do not have vaccination stock. “We are procuring excess doses from hospitals today to supply vaccines to hospitals which have zero doses. By Thursday evening, new doses are expected,” said a civic official on condition of anonymity. Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar said at a press meet that Pune city has received over 577,000 doses of vaccines. “There are at present 125 vaccination sites that are actively inoculating beneficiaries. We had 45,000 doses. And there are 25,000 doses remaining with us so far. Some hospitals in the city may not have the doses, but there was enough stock with PMC to continue smooth inoculation,” said Kumar. The vaccine shortage was seen at western Maharashtra also. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said that due to shortage of vaccine doses, the process was paused in Sangli and Satara and centres were reduced at many places. “We are hoping to get more supply of vaccines from the Centre. Once the vaccines are supplied, inoculation can restart smoothly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/shortage-affects-vaccination-drive-in-pune-parts-of-western-maharashtra-101617894286151.html
09-04-2021||Pune||Pune witnesses shortage of Remdesivir drug||Pune: The panic and crisis over shortage of Remdesivir injection continued on Thursday. Long queue of residents were seen at the headquarters of the Chemists Association of Pune on Bajirao road to get the life-saving drug for their families and friends down with Covid. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials have blamed doctors for overprescribing the drug.Ashish Avhad, who was searching for the injection at various stores in the city, said that he is unable to get it for the last three days.“My friend’s father is critical and this drug has been unavailable for the last three days. I have been standing outside the Chemists Association of Pune’s office since 9 am and it is 3:30 pm and I haven’t received the drug. I have visited all major hospitals, but it is unavailable,” said Avhad.Supriya Kajale, relative of a patient, said that she has been waiting for the drug for the past two days.“They are charging ₹5,000 for the drug because of short supply. I need the injection for my 62-year-old father who is tested positive for Covid,” Kajale said.Dinesh Khivasara, assistant commissioner, FDA said that the drug has been overprescribed by doctors. “This drug is important for critical patients. However, every doctor is prescribing it for patients who are with mild symptoms as well. That is why there is a shortage of the drug. The drug needs at least 15 days to manufacture as it has to follow various norms,” Khivasara said.He said that other pharma companies will be manufacturing the drug soon and it will hit the market.“To check hoarding of drugs, we have ensured that all dealers go through us before supplying the drug outside the city,” said Khivasara.Vikram Kumar, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner said that the authorities are in discussion with FDA.“There are about 2,000 doses of Remdesivir that will be made available with PMC on Thursday. And another batch of 2,000 doses are likely by April 9,” Kumar said.In view of tackling the shortage of Remdesivir, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday chaired a meeting with seven manufacturers of the life-saving drug. Tope asked manufacturers to double the production for the state. Food and Drug Administration minister Rajendra Shingane and officials of the health and FDA department attended the meet.Earlier in the day, before the meeting, Shingane said, “We are going to ask manufacturers to increase the supply of Remdesivir and reduce its price.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-witnesses-shortage-of-remdesivir-drug-101617892786016.html

There should be at least 100 people for vaccination,” said Vikram Kumar.“We expect a list of candidates along with their Aadhar cards to be ready when our team visits the campus for vaccination. We will need one waiting room, one for vaccination, one room where vaccinated employees can rest and one room for data entry, “ added Kumar.The PMC and PCMC will tie up with hospitals and have appointed nodal officers to look after the process.Kumar added, “If one company does not have 100 employees above the age 45, then another company can join them, as 100 is the minimum number to conduct a camp,” added Kumar.PCMC’s Rajesh Patil said, “We have already conducted vaccination drives in companies like Telco and Thermax. We have created 15 teams which will conduct camps in companies which fall within PCMC limits.”The companies which fall in rural areas will be taken care of by the Zilla Parishad CEO and district collector.Industries from the Chakan belt have requested the lowering of the age limit for vaccination, as many employees fall between the ages of 18 and 45 years.“Most of the industries in Chakan have employees below 45, and we are willing to get them vaccinated. We request the government to think it over it as it will be an important decision,” said Dileep Batwal, secretary, Federation of Chakan industries.Nodal officers for vaccination at the work place:For PMC Ashish Agarwal: 09764006478Email: Vaccination.campus@gmail.com; punevaccination.campus@gmail.comFor PCMCNilkanth Poman: 99225 01908Email : n.poman@pcmcindia.gov.inVijay Vaware: 7057766222||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-pcmc-offer-full-support-to-industries-willing-to-run-vaccine-camps-on-campus-101617886605265.html
09-04-2021||World||Prince Philip's 4 royal visits to India and a tiger controversy||Britain's Prince Philip – the Duke of Edinburgh, the husband of Queen Elizabeth II, who passed away at the age of 99 on Friday morning, made three memorable royal visits to India in his long years of accompanying the 94-year-old monarch during her nearly 69-year reign.The UK’s longest-serving royal consort joined the Queen in India in 1959, 1961, 1983 and 1997 – during which he made quite an impression with his sense of humour, which often also got him into some controversy.“Deeply saddened at sad demise of HRH Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, an iconic pillar of the British monarchy, regarded by his people and world with the highest esteem and affection. India had the honour of receiving him and HM The Queen on four memorable occasions,” the Indian High Commission in London said in a statement.During his 1961 visit to India, he was pictured with the Queen and the Maharaja and Maharani of Jaipur with a dead eight-foot tiger he had shot while on a hunt. It happened to be the same year he became president of the World Wildlife Fund UK.He also shot a crocodile and mountain sheep on that trip but it was the photograph of the tiger that caused ripples around the world.Later in life, he went on to reinvent himself as an environmentalist and “champion of the natural world” as UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson referred to him in his tribute on Friday.During Prince Philip's last visit to India to mark the 50th anniversary of independence in 1997, he joined the Queen on a visit to Jallianwala Bagh in Amritsar where the royals laid a commemorative wreath at the site associated with General Dyer’s orders to open fire on a large Baisakhi gathering in April 1919.As someone known for his gaffes, among his many infamous ones includes his query of the death toll at the Jallianwala Bagh massacre."Two thousand? It wasn't, was it," he questioned, as he passed by a plaque at the memorial, which read “This place is saturated with the blood of about two thousand Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims who were martyred in a non-violent struggle"."That's wrong. I was in the Navy with Dyer's son. That's a bit exaggerated… it must include the wounded," he is reported to have said.Among his other gaffes included a quip at Indian-origin entrepreneur Atul Patel during a Buckingham Palace reception for hundreds of successful British Indians in 2009: “There’s a lot of your family in tonight.”Ten years earlier, while inspecting a factory in Edinburgh and coming across an old-fashioned fuse box, he said: “It looks as if it was put in by an Indian.”It had become common practice for the UK media to regularly compile a list of the Duke’s many gaffes, many of which were believed to have been made in a light-hearted vein.Philip was born on June 10, 1921, on the Greek island of Corfu, the youngest child and only son of Prince Andrew of Greece and Princess Alice of Battenberg. That heritage made him a Prince of Greece and Denmark, but the following year the family was expelled from Greece after a coup and a British warship carried them to safety in Italy with baby Philip.His childhood was turbulent and in 1930, when he was eight years old, his mother was committed to a secure psychiatric centre after suffering a nervous breakdown, a story most recently covered in the Netflix series ‘The Crown’.When Philip left school in Scotland, Britain was on the verge of war with Germany and he joined the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, the UK's naval academy. He went on to serve with distinction in World War II, seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean.When King George VI paid an official visit to the naval academy in July 1939, Philip was charged with entertaining his young daughters, Princesses Elizabeth – later to be Queen – and Margaret. He made an impression on the then 13-year-old Elizabeth and the couple were to later get married after a courtship through letters.The erstwhile Prince of Greece and Denmark became a naturalised British subject, formally joined the Church of England and gave up his foreign titles. On his wedding day, November 20, 1947, he was made Duke of Edinburgh, aged 26.The couple's marriage was to last 73 years, during which the Queen described him as her “strength and stay”, and they had four children – the eldest and heir to the throne Prince Charles, Princess Anne, Prince Andrew, and Prince Edward. He is also survived by eight grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.As the Queen's consort, his primary function was to support his wife and he accompanied her extensively alongside his own royal charities and patronages until his retirement from royal duties in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-s-4-royal-visits-to-india-and-a-tiger-controversy-101617991603677.html

Inoculating children and young people is considered a critical step toward reaching "herd immunity" and taming the pandemic, according to experts.The companies plan to request similar rulings by other regulatory authorities globally in the coming days.The Pfizer/BioNTech two-shot vaccine is already authorized for use in people as young as 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pfizer-biontech-seek-us-emergency-nod-for-covid-19-vaccine-in-adolescents-101617990105479.html

In February this year, the Egyptian Health and Population Ministry issued a list of potential side-effects from the Sinopharm Covid-19 vaccine-pain, redness, stiffness and itching at the area of the vaccination, increase in body temperature and more.Wuhan Institute of Biological Products, which produces Sinopharm, has been accused of supplying 400,520 substandard doses of diphtheria, tetanus, and whooping cough vaccines for infants in 2018 and also of having forged data related to the production of 113,000 rabies vaccines by the Chinese drug controller, reported Newshub.lk.The World Health Organization's (WHO) Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunisation said recently that the vaccine "lacked data in older age groups and in persons with co-morbidities".To make matters worse, one of the volunteers in Peru died after being injected with the Sinopharm vaccine, while one of the volunteers developed severe neurological side-effects associated with Guillain-Barre syndrome that causes nerve damage and often paralysis, during a clinical trial. All trials of the vaccine have been halted since then.Furthermore, Sri Lankan health authorities are also deeply hesitant to use Chinese-made vaccines for immunising its citizens. although the country has received 600,000 doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, it has decided to use them only on Chinese nationals.According to a survey conducted by the University of Hong Kong, about 61 percent of people do not want to take vaccines made by China, reported Newshub.lk.Several countries have been affected due to shortcomings of China's big promises on its vaccine diplomacy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/criticism-over-use-of-china-made-sinopharm-covid-19-vaccines-continues-to-grow-101617989700980.html
09-04-2021||World||China, Bhutan hold discussions to resolve border dispute||Senior officials of China and Bhutan have discussed a roadmap to expedite their boundary talks and agreed to continue to maintain peace and tranquillity along their border pending final settlement of their dispute, the foreign ministries of the two countries said on Friday.The two countries do not have diplomatic relations but maintain contacts through periodic visits by officials.China, which is yet to finalise border agreements with India and Bhutan, has resolved the boundary line with 12 other neighbours.The India-China border dispute covers the 3,488-km-long Line of Actual Control (LAC) and the two countries have held 22 rounds of Special Representatives-level talks so far to resolve the boundary dispute. The meeting took place in the backdrop of the military standoff between China and India in eastern Ladakh since May last year.Bhutan shares over 400-km-long border with China and the two countries have held 24 rounds of boundary talks in a bid to resolve the dispute.According to a joint statement issued by China and Bhutan on Friday, the 10th Expert Group Meeting (EGM) on Bhutan-China Boundary was held in the country’s southwest Kunming city from April 6-9.The EGM was held in a warm and friendly atmosphere, and held in-depth and fruitful discussions on the boundary issue in keeping with the close ties of friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and China, said the statement issued by the two foreign ministries after the talks.“The EGM discussed a roadmap to expedite the Bhutan-China Boundary Talks. The two sides agreed to continue to maintain peace and tranquility in the border areas pending a final settlement of the boundary issue,” the statement posted on the Bhutan Foreign Ministry website said.The two countries have agreed to hold the 25th Round of Bhutan-China Boundary Talks and the 11th EGM as soon as possible at mutually convenient dates, it said.The Chinese Foreign Ministry also posted the joint statement on its website.In a show of goodwill and friendship, and to support Bhutan’s fight against COVID-19, the Chinese government donated Personal Protective Equipment and medical supplies, it said.The Bhutanese delegation was led by Letho Tobdhen Tangbi, Secretary of the International Boundaries, while the Chinese delegation was led by Hong Liang, Director General of the Department of Boundary and Ocean Affairs of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China.The Boundary Talks between Bhutan and China began in 1984 and both the countries have signed the Guiding Principles on the Settlement of the Boundary Issues in 1988 and the Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity along the border areas in 1998.These two agreements form the basis of the boundary negotiation between Bhutan and China, the statement said.In July last year, China made a surprising claim on Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary in Bhutan at the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Council by opposing funding to the project.Bhutan lodged a demarche to the Chinese Embassy in India over China’s claim over the sanctuary.The GEF Council has reportedly cleared the funding for the Sakteng sanctuary after Aparna Subramani, the World Bank official representing Bhutan as well as India, Bangladesh, the Maldives and Sri Lanka said Bhutan totally rejected the claim made by China.China sought to defend its claims on Sakteng Wildlife Sanctuary, saying the boundary between the two countries is yet to be demarcated and it has proposed a package solution to resolve the border dispute.“China’s position remains consistent and clear. The boundary between China and Bhutan has not been delimited and there has been disputes in the middle, eastern and western sections,” Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin had told a media briefing here.“So, China advocates a package solution to resolve the dispute,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-bhutan-hold-discussions-to-resolve-border-dispute-101617987274048.html
09-04-2021||World||Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali raises delay in vaccine delivery with Jaishankar||Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali on Friday raised the delay in delivery of a million doses of made-in-India Covid-19 vaccines during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar. Kathmandu was expecting the million doses of Covishield vaccine contracted from the Serum Institute of India (SII) last month, and the delay in delivery has affected the rollout of the second phase of the neighbouring country’s inoculation drive, Nepali officials have said. In a separate development, Iran too raised the need to expedite the delivery of Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin doses that it has already paid for. The issue figured in a set of tweets from the Iranian embassy. India’s decision to calibrate vaccine exports to cope with a surge in domestic infections and the expansion of its national inoculation programme has affected several countries, including Nepal, the UK, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Morocco, South Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. Nepal signed an agreement with SII for two million doses, half of which were supplied and used for the first phase of the national inoculation drive. The delay in delivering the second million doses has left people waiting for more than six weeks for a second jab, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity. According to a readout from Nepal’s foreign ministry, Gyawali requested Jaishankar “for necessary facilitation for the supply of vaccines for Nepal to continue administering the second dose of vaccination for people at highest risk”. Gyawali also expressed sincere thanks to the Indian government for supporting Nepal in its fight against the pandemic, including through the gift of one million doses of Covishield. Jaishankar assured Gyawali of “continued support to Nepal in its fight against the pandemic, including through the supply of vaccines”, the readout said. There was no official word on the conversation from the Indian side. The people cited above said the second consignment of one million doses is needed to provide the second jab to frontline workers and senior citizens above the age of 65. The Nepalese side had earlier taken up the matter with SII and the external affairs ministry and sought speedy delivery. Nepal has already made 80% of the payment for the doses and the remaining amount will be paid when the consignment moves out of SII’s facilities in Pune, the people said. The Iranian embassy said in a tweet on purchase of vaccines from India that Tehran had conveyed its needs to the Indian government and Bharat Biotech. Following this, Iran had received the first consignment of 125,000 doses. “Given the cordial relations with #India and understanding the rise of new wave of #coronavirus in both countries, we are doing the necessary talks with Indian authorities to kindly expedite sending rest of the consignment which has already been paid for,” the embassy said in another tweet. External affairs ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi said on Thursday that there was no ban on vaccine exports. “We have always said supply of made-in-India vaccines abroad would continue, taking into account our domestic requirements,” he told a news briefing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-foreign-minister-pradeep-gyawali-raises-delay-in-vaccine-delivery-with-jaishankar-101617989054812.html
09-04-2021||World||Biden's budget boosts US spending on climate action, health | 7 takeaways||Here are seven takeaways from U.S. President Joe Biden's proposed federal budget, released on Friday:* HEADLINE NUMBERS. Federal discretionary spending is up by 8.4% compared to 2021 levels, excluding emergency funding, to $1.52 trillion, with a focus on health, education and climate. About two-thirds of the massive budget is "mandatory" spending for benefits like Social Security and Medicare.* MILITARY AND DEFENSE SPENDING. Making up about half of the U.S. discretionary budget, this would increase by 1.7% to $753 billion. The increase will likely upset progressives, who pushed for cuts to the never-audited Defense Department to fuel other policy priorities. Because it is lower than former President Donald Trump's 2022 projections, it may also anger Republican defense hawks pushing for more spending.* HEALTH AND MEDICAL RESEARCH. The budget includes $8.7 billion in funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, representing what the White House says is the largest increase in two decades. The CDC has suffered from a decade of declining funding, and the agency's muddled response to the coronavirus pandemic may have contributed to the spread of the disease, Reuters reported. The budget also allocates $6.5 billion for a new research agency to direct federal funding to diabetes, Alzheimer's and cancer research, and $10.7 billion to research and prevent opioid addiction, representing a nearly $4 billion increase from last year.* IMMIGRATION. The budget includes $52 billion for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, with about $1.2 billion going to investments in modern border security technology. It lays out spending to rebuild the refugee program, which was slashed dramatically under Trump, and boosts funding to reduce backlogs in the immigration court system and in the processing of asylum and citizenship cases.* CLIMATE. The proposal includes budget boosts of about 20% for the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Science Foundation over last year's enacted levels. A total $14 billion boost on climate spending is expected to go a long way toward reversing Trump's slashing of regulations on fossil fuel producers such as rules on methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and provides $1.2 billion for the international Green Climate Fund as part of Biden's re-entry into the Paris Agreement on climate change.* IMPOVERISHED SCHOOLS. Biden’s budget would distribute a record $36.5 billion to America's neediest school districts through the Title I federal aid program, up $20 billion from the 2021 enacted level. This comes on the heels of the American Rescue Plan Act, which invested more than $122 million in K-12 public schools and allocated funds based on poverty concentration. The budget includes $1 billion for school nurses and mental health programs to address effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.* TRANSIT. The administration is proposing $600 million to buy electric vehicles for government agencies and charging stations, including for the U.S. Postal Service and $8 billion for the Energy Department to invest in clean energy technologies, up 27% over the prior year's funding. It would also boost U.S. passenger railroad Amtrak funding by 35%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-budget-boosts-us-spending-on-climate-action-health-7-takeaways-101617987842014.html
09-04-2021||World||Biden's first budget fuels health, education spending in sharp change from Trump||U.S. President Joe Biden asked Congress to sharply increase spending to combat climate change and gun violence and to support education in a budget that marks a sharp departure from his predecessor, Donald Trump.The $1.5 trillion budget, reflecting an 8% increase in base funding from the current year, would invest billions more in public transportation and environmental clean-ups, slash funding for a border wall, expand funding for background checks on gun sales, and direct a record amount to poor public schools, each goal clashing with the prior administration.Nearly three months into a job consumed by the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, the document offered a long-awaited glimpse into Biden's agenda and kick-starts a potentially grueling negotiation with Congress over what will ultimately be funded.The budget "makes things fairer," Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said Friday. "It injects capital into communities where capital is usually hard to come by."Biden would increase spending by $14 billion across agencies to deal with the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, a shift from the Trump administration's dismissal of climate science.The president would spend millions on dealing with rising numbers of unaccompanied children showing up at the country's southern border from Central America, including $861 million to invest in that region to stop asylum-seekers from coming to the United States.But his budget would provide no funding for the construction of a border wall, the administration said, a signature Trump priority, and would increase funding for investigation of immigration agents accused of "white supremacy."Among the biggest proposed increases in funding is $36.5 billion for a federal aid program for public schools in poorer neighborhoods, more than double the 2021 enacted level, and for researching deadly diseases other than the COVID-19 pandemic that has dominated his term in office so far."This moment of crisis is also a moment of possibility," Biden's acting budget director, Shalanda Young, wrote in a letter to the Senate.Biden would spend $6.5 billion to launch a group leading targeted research into diseases from cancer to diabetes and Alzheimer's, a program that reflects Biden's long desire to use government spending to create breakthroughs in medical research.Biden requested some $715 billion for the Department of Defense, roughly even in inflation-adjusted terms with this year, and a compromise between liberals trying to impose cuts and hawks who want military spending to increase.The money earmarked for the Pentagon aims to deter China, support modernizing the nuclear missile inventory and building "climate resiliency" at military facilities.Known as a "skinny" budget, Biden's proposal on Friday provided only cursory figures on "discretionary" programs and departments where Congress has flexibility to decide what it wants to spend for the fiscal year starting in October.The White House had been delayed in producing the document, blaming resistance from political officials during the handover from Trump and denying that competing interests over issues like military funding played a role.The proposal does not include Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure proposal or changes in taxation, one administration official said. Those changes would be included in a full budget proposal to be submitted in late spring.It does include a 10% increase in funding for the Internal Revenue Service, however, part of push to crack down on individuals and corporations who don't pay their fair share of taxes.Discretionary spending accounted for $1.6 trillion in the 2020 fiscal year, about a quarter of total federal spending. The rest is for areas deemed mandatory including old-age, disability, unemployment and medical benefits.Each of the proposals is just the first step in a budgeting process that will ultimately be decided in the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate, where Democrats hold bare majorities.Biden withdrew his initial pick, Neera Tanden, to lead the Office of Management and Budget after she faced difficulty winning Senate approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bidens-first-budget-fuels-health-education-spending-in-sharp-change-from-trump-101617987593131.html
09-04-2021||World||Pak provincial govt releases ₹3.48 cr for reconstruction of Hindu temple||Pakistan's Khyber Pakthunkhwa Provincial Government has released over ₹3.48 crore for the reconstruction of a revered Hindu shrine damaged by a mob led by some local clerics and members of radical Islamist party Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam in December last year.The provincial government will give ₹3,48,29,000 to Auqaf Department for the reconstruction of the Samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj destroyed on December 30 last year in Terri village of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's Karak district.The attack on a century-old temple and the adjoining 'samadhi' had drawn strong condemnation from human rights activists and the minority Hindu community leaders, prompting the Supreme Court to order its reconstruction. The court directed the provincial government to ensure early completion of the temple.The Khyber Pakthunkhwa government managed the funds for the same from the Stunt Prevention and Rehabilitation integrated Nutrition gain scheme of the Planning and Development Department.The P&D department in a letter to the Finance Department informed that the construction of the shrine would be completed without making the scheme part of the annual development programme of the province.Last month, the Hindu community in the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa decided to pardon the mob that vandalised and burned down a century-old temple in the province after local clerics and members of the minority community held a meeting to resolve the dispute.As per the dialogue, informally called 'jigra', the accused have tendered an apology over the attack and a similar incident in 1997. The Muslim clerics have assured full protection to the Hindus and their rights as per the country's Constitution.Following the incident, India had lodged a strong protest with Pakistan. The Ministry of External Affairs had conveyed its serious concerns to the Pakistan High Commission in New Delhi over the repeated instances of similar incidents and atrocities against the members of the minority community.India had also called out the Pakistan government at the United Nations, saying the country's enforcement agencies stood as "mute spectators" when a historic Hindu temple was attacked.The Samadhi of Shri Paramhans Ji Maharaj is considered sacred by the Hindu community. It was built where he died in 1919 in Teri village of Karak.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pak-provincial-govt-releases-rs-3-48-cr-for-reconstruction-of-hindu-temple-101617985206837.html
09-04-2021||World||Hong Kong: Customs officials raid shop founded by pro-democracy activist||Hong Kong authorities said on Friday they had seized nearly 9,000 Thai cleaning products suspected to have wrong labelling from a shop founded by a pro-democracy activist facing charges under the city's contentious national security law.Customs officers on Thursday raided 25 shops belonging to the chain, AbouThai, and arrested a 33-year-old male director of the group, the government said in a statement.The suspect had been released on bail and further arrests had not been ruled out, it added."The product information marked on the packages of the products involved failed to bear Chinese and English bilingual warnings or cautions," it said, adding the estimated market value of the 8,805 products seized was about HK$400,000 ($51,400).Under Hong Kong's Consumer Goods Safety Ordinance, warnings or cautions on products must be in both English and Chinese and are required to be "legibly and conspicuously shown on the goods".Customs chiefs said the raids were carried out in connection with missing safety warnings on cleaning products, with some only having warnings or cautions in Thai, while others bore warnings or cautions in Thai and English.The company's founder, Mike Lam, is among 47 democrats charged under the city's national security law on a charge of conspiracy to commit subversion and is currently on bail.Crowds queued outside branches of the shop across the city on Friday to show support for Lam, with some saying they believed the raid was politically motivated."I find it unreasonable that the Customs targeted AbouThai. That's why I come here to support. I am quite touched that many people come," said Chris, who declined to give his full name due to the sensitivity of the national security law.The legislation punishes what Beijing broadly defines as secessionism, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail.Local broadcaster RTHK quoted Vincent Chan, from the customs consumer protection bureau, as saying the department condemned any "false accusation" that the raid was an "act of repression".Hong Kong anti-government protesters have queued outside businesses that openly support the democracy movement since anti-government protests flared in 2019.The former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997 with a promise of safeguards for its wide-ranging autonomy. Democracy activists say authorities are chipping away at those freedoms, accusations which officials in Beijing and Hong Kong reject.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-customs-officials-raid-shop-founded-by-pro-democracy-activist-101617985387856.html
09-04-2021||World||Distrust of China brought India, Japan, Australia and US together: Report||Distrust of China’s role in the Indo-Pacific region has “consolidated” the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue (Quad) between Australia, Japan, India and the US for now, as questions remain about its future because of India’s “inconsistent enthusiasm”, the autonomous US Congressional Research Service (CRS) has said in a new paper.The four-nation body - known as the Quad - held its first summit-level meeting in March, virtually, and announced plans to distribute up to 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines in the Indo-Pacific region countries and set up working groups for cooperation on climate change and emerging technology.“Questions remain about the durability of the arrangement if leadership shifts in member countries, whether other countries will be brought into the Quad’s initiatives, and particularly about India’s inconsistent enthusiasm for the grouping,” the report said, adding, “For now, however, distrust of Beijing’s role in the region has consolidated the Quad.”The CRS feeds US congress with the latest and detailed analysis on an entire range of issues from domestic to international and though it does not speak for the legislative body or its members it tends to reflect the current thinking there, which it also shapes and informs through its reports.This CRS report looks at US-Japan relations primarily and deals with the Quad only in a section, as part of Japan’s foreign policy. Tokyo has been at the forefront of establishing the group, with former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe (who governed from 2012 to 2020) as a leading advocate of it.“Japan’s eagerness to pursue the Quad appears driven above all by its concern over China’s increasing power, influence, and assertiveness in the Indo-Pacific region. In theory, engaging India eastward could compel Beijing to divert some of its resources and attention to the Indian Ocean,” the report said.The Quad was born in the aftermath of 2004 Tsunami as the four nations joined hands for relief and rehabilitation efforts in the region. But, it kind of petered out as Australia pulled out. The grouping was formally relaunched in 2017 and after a series of official and ministerial meetings, it held its first summit this year.Prime Ministers Narendra Modi, Scott Morrison of Australia and Yoshihide Suga of Japan joined the US President Joe Biden in a virtual summit on March 12, for their first and historic summit. They are expected to hold their first in-person summit later in the year, possibly on the sidelines of the G-7 meeting, which the UK is hosting in June.The Quad summit, which was called by President Biden as his first major foreign policy initiative, “elevated the group’s profile and expanded its scope of operations,” the CRS report said and added the vaccine plans and other outcomes announced at the summit “could usher in a new chapter in cooperation”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/distrust-of-china-brought-india-japan-australia-and-us-together-report-101617984433820.html
09-04-2021||World||Biden creates commission to study potential Supreme Court expansion||U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday ordered the creation of a bipartisan commission to study potential reforms to the Supreme Court, including whether to expand the number of justices, a key goal of progressive Democrats.In an executive order, Biden said the commission would tackle the "merits and legality" of specific high court reform proposals. Along with the contentious idea of expanding the court, reform advocates have recently pushed for term limits for the justices.A White House official stressed that the commission's members represent the full political spectrum and "is intended to study the arguments both in favor of and against the reforms proposed in these areas."Biden promised to establish the commission after coming under heavy pressure during his presidential campaign to act on reforming the Supreme Court. In part, that stemmed from former President Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans moving quickly to fill liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's seat after her death less than two months before the election. Republicans previously refused to give former President Barack Obama's nominee Merrick Garland a hearing in 2016 when they still controlled the Senate.In his single term, Trump named three justices to the high court, cementing a 6-3 conservative majority.While Republicans have fiercely opposed increasing the size of the Supreme Court, many Democrats and progressive activists say all options must be considered to counter an entrenched conservative majority that could threaten access to healthcare, abortion, and civil rights.Biden, who previously voiced opposition to "court packing," repeatedly refused to articulate a stance on the issue during the waning days of the presidential campaign, saying that people would learn how he felt about the issue only after the election.The commission will be made up of a group of liberal and conservative legal scholars, former federal judges and lawyers who have appeared before the court. It will hold public meetings and have 180 days to report its findings.The number of justices on the high court has remained at nine since 1869, but Congress has the power to change the size of the bench and did so several times before that.Activist groups and Democrats have also broached the idea of imposing term limits for justices. This would likely require a constitutional amendment, though some scholars have proposed ways to accomplish term limits by statute.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-creates-commission-to-study-potential-supreme-court-expansion-101617983033460.html
09-04-2021||World||US authorities probing tragic death of Indian couple in New Jersey||Authorities in the US are investigating the tragic death of an Indian couple, who was found dead in their New Jersey home due to an apparent stabbing.Balaji Bharat Rudrawar, a 32-year-old IT professional and his wife Arati Balaji Rudrawar (30) were found dead at their apartment in the Riverview Gardens complex of North Arlington borough in New Jersey.Officials in the Indian Consulate in New York termed the incident as very tragic and said they were in touch with the family of the deceased.Bergen County Prosecutor Mark Musella said in a statement that the North Arlington Police Department and the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office Major Crimes Unit were investigating the deaths of the two individuals found inside an apartment located at 21 Garden Terrace, North Arlington.Musella said that on April 7, North Arlington Police responded to the apartment at 5:40 p.m. after receiving a 9-1-1 call from a concerned neighbour asking for a welfare check on the residents.“Officers forced entry into the apartment and found a deceased male and female,” the statement said.An investigation is being conducted by the Bergen County Prosecutor’s Office Major Crimes Unit under the direction of Chief Robert Anzilotti and the North Arlington Police Department under the direction of Chief Scott Hedenberg.Family sources said in India that neighbours saw the couple’s four-year-old daughter crying alone in the balcony of their house after which they informed the police.US media outlets said the couple died of an apparent stabbing in their North Arlington apartment. The husband apparently stabbed and sliced his wife in the abdomen as she unsuccessfully tried to fight him off in their living room, a US media report said.“The bodies were found on Wednesday after neighbours saw my granddaughter crying in the balcony and informed the local police who then entered the house," Balaji's father Bharat Rudrawar told PTI in Mumbai."The local police there informed me of the tragedy on Thursday. There is no clarity yet on the cause of the death. The US police said they will share findings of the autopsy report," Rudrawar said.He added that his daughter-in-law was seven months pregnant.“We had been to their house and were planning another trip to the US to be with them again," he said."I am not aware of any possible motive. They were a happy family and had lovely neighbours," he said when asked if he suspected foul play.Rudrawar said his granddaughter is now with a friend of his son, who had several friends in the local Indian community.Balaji Rudrawar, an IT professional from Ambajogai in Maharashtra's Beed district had moved with his wife to the US in August 2015 after they got married in December 2014, said his father, a businessman from the temple town, around 500 km from Mumbai.While Balaji was working there for a prominent Indian infotech company, his wife was a homemaker, Rudrawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-authorities-probing-tragic-death-of-indian-couple-in-new-jersey-101617981940885.html
09-04-2021||World||Amazon clinches win as historic vote to unionize at Alabama warehouse fails||Amazon.com Inc. clinched a victory in a historic election to determine whether workers at its warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama, will become the first in the U.S. to join a retail union.With vote counting still underway, Amazon had 1,608 no votes, which is a majority of the 3,215 ballots cast. The Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union had less than half as many.With Amazon already well ahead in the tally on Thursday, the union pledged to appeal the result.“Our system is broken, Amazon took full advantage of that, and we will be calling on the labor board to hold Amazon accountable for its illegal and egregious behavior during the campaign,” said Stuart Appelbaum, RWDSU president. “But make no mistake about it; this still represents an important moment for working people and their voices will be heard.”Citing documents obtained via a Freedom of Information Act request, the RWDSU accused the company of “corrupting the election” by pressuring the U.S. Postal Service to install a mailbox on Amazon property in an effort to make employees to cast their ballots there rather than someplace more free of company surveillance. Employees have also said that Amazon used mandatory group meetings and one-on-one discussions to predict harmful consequences if they unionized.Amazon has said that it hosted “information sessions” so employees could “understand the facts” about unionization, and told the Washington Post that the mailbox was a “simple, secure, and completely optional” way to make voting easier. The company declined to comment on Appelbaum’s accusations.The National Labor Relations Board is tallying the ballots from its office in nearby Birmingham and beaming the process live to the media via Zoom. Approximately 5,800 workers were eligible to vote, and turnout was roughly 55%.The election officially ended on March 29, but Amazon and the union spent several days reviewing sealed individual ballots for such irregularities as problematic signatures, ripped envelopes and ineligibility to vote. Contested ballots -- which numbered about 500 and were disputed at a 4-1 ratio by Amazon, according to the union -- were to be reviewed later only if there were enough to swing the outcome. (Reuters earlier reported the 500 total.)The fiercely fought mail-in election lasted seven weeks and attracted national attention. The last unionization vote among Amazon employees failed in 2014, when a group of fewer than 30 machinists in Delaware declined to join the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers.A RWDSU victory in Bessemer could eventually force Amazon into contract talks with the union, which is focused on improving working conditions for warehouse employees. The company notes that its $15 an hour starting wage is more than double the federal minimum and that it pays health benefits.Amazon’s sales and profit soared during the pandemic when millions of shoppers stampeded online. The outbreak put a spotlight on the safety and working conditions of essential workers at supermarkets, big-box stores and online fulfillment centers.In Bessemer, employees overwhelmed by the working pace and afraid of catching Covid-19 contacted the union, setting in motion a vote that’s already seen as a watershed for Amazon and organized labor. If the RWDSU prevails, the unionizing drive could spread to other Amazon facilities, some of which are already seeing stirrings of labor activism. A loss for the union would be a setback for the U.S. labor movement, which has been in decline for decades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/amazon-clinches-win-as-historic-vote-to-unionize-at-alabama-warehouse-fails-101617980788033.html
09-04-2021||World||La Soufriere volcano erupts on Caribbean’s Saint Vincent, evacuation underway||An explosive eruption rocked La Soufriere volcano on the eastern Caribbean island of St. Vincent on Friday following mandatory evacuation orders from the local government.Erouscilla Joseph, director of the University of the West Indies Seismic Center, said the ash column is estimated to have risen as high as 10 kilometers (6 miles).“There is heavy ashfall in the near vicinity,” she said. “More explosions could occur.”Joseph said it was impossible to predict whether any potential upcoming explosions would be bigger or smaller than the first one.The volcano last erupted in 1979, and a previous eruption in 1902 killed some 1,600 people.The new eruption followed mandatory evacuation orders issued Thursday for people who live near the volcano. Officials planned to place them aboard cruise ships, send them to nearby islands or take them to shelters elsewhere in St. Vincent that are outside the danger zone.Roughly 16,000 people live in the red zone and will need to be evacuated, Joseph, said.The pandemic could hamper evacuation efforts.Prime Minister Ralph Gonsalves said in a press conference that people have to be vaccinated if they go aboard a cruise ship or are granted temporary refuge in another island. He said two Royal Caribbean cruise ships are expected to arrive by Friday and a third one in the coming days, as well as two Carnival cruise ships by Friday. Islands that have said they would accept evacuees include St. Lucia, Grenada, Barbados and Antigua.“Not everything is going to go perfect, but if we all cooperate ... we will come through this stronger than ever,” Gonsalves said.He noted that he was talking to Caribbean governments to accept people’s ID cards if they don’t have a passport.“This is an emergency situation, and everybody understands that,” he said.Gonsalves added that he highly recommends those who opt to go to a shelter in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, an island chain of more than 100,000 people, be vaccinated.Emergency management teams have been going out to communities in the red zone and providing transportation to safer locations, including prearranged shelters, according to Joseph.“They know who doesn't have transportation because all of this has been canvassed before,” she said, adding that those who board the cruise ship would not be taken elsewhere but would remain there for an unspecified period of time.By late Thursday evening, shelters were filling up as a string of car lights making their way to safer ground twinkled through the darkened mountains.John Renton, a school principal who was in charge of one shelter, said in a phone interview that they had plenty of masks and other personal protective equipment but needed more cots. While talking, he was interrupted by a phone call from a government official asking about the state of things. “We're over capacity,” he responded, noting that the shelter could hold 75 people and was already filled up.Government officials tweeted that the dome of the volcano located on the island’s northern region could be seen glowing by nightfall. The alert issued Wednesday follows days of seismic activity around La Soufriere.Gonsalves urged people to remain calm and orderly.“I don’t want you panicked,” he said. “That is the worst thing to do.”Scientists alerted the government about a possible eruption after noting a type of seismic activity at 3 a.m. on Thursday that indicated “magma was on the move close to the surface," Joseph said.“Things are escalating pretty quickly,” she said of the volcanic activity, adding that it was impossible to provide an exact forecast of what might happen in the next hours or days.A team from the seismic center arrived in St. Vincent in late December after the volcano had an effusive eruption. They have been analyzing the formation of a new volcanic dome, changes to its crater lake, seismic activity and gas emissions, among other things.The eastern Caribbean is home to other active volcanoes. Seventeen of the region's 19 live volcanoes are located on 11 islands, with the remaining two underwater near the island of Grenada, including one called Kick ’Em Jenny that has been active in recent years.The region's most active volcano in recent years has been Soufriere Hills in Montserrat, which has erupted continuously since 1995, destroying the capital of Plymouth and killing at least 19 people in 1997.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/la-soufriere-volcano-erupts-on-caribbean-s-saint-vincent-evacuation-underway-101617980268064.html

The World Health Organization says it's too early to know whether to recommend such vaccine mixing, however, and the European Medicines Agency hasn't advised putting any age restrictions on the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine.French authorities said the British-Swedish pharmaceutical company's vaccine remains central to its vaccination plan strategy, and they urged older populations to keep taking it as France's hospitals battle another surge in Covid-19 patients.“It’s an effective vaccine,” Dominique Le Guludec, president of France’s High Authority for Health, told reporters. “If we want to win the battle against the virus, we must use all weapons at our disposition.”Several European countries decided in recent weeks to limit their use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to older people because of strengthening evidence the vaccine may be linked to rare blood clots in younger populations.Since March 19, France has only offered the vaccine to people over 55. More than half a million French people under that age — including Health Minister Olivier Veran — received a first dose before then.France’s High Authority for Health said Friday that it is maintaining the age limit for now and recommending that younger people who received the AstraZeneca vaccine for their first dose should get booster shots of the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines instead.“It’s a precautionary measure,” Veran said Friday on RTL radio.The health authority also called for more research on the effects of vaccine mixing.Germany on March 30 recommended restricting the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine to people over 60, in most cases. The country’s independent vaccine expert panel last week recommended giving a second shot of the BioNTech or Moderna vaccines to people under 60 who had received a first shot of AstraZeneca's product.Health ministers from Germany’s 16 states are expected to sign off on the recommendation next week.Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokeswoman, said Friday that an advisory group on immunization made recommendations about the AstraZeneca vaccine in February, but didn’t have enough information at the time to determine whether it could be used in conjunction with other vaccines.“There is not adequate data to be able to say whether this is something that could be done,” Harris told a UN press briefing in Geneva.France, which has reported one of the world’s highest virus death tolls, has closed schools and nonessential businesses for a month and imposed nationwide travel restrictions to stem the spread of new virus variants.It's also trying to speed up vaccinations. President Emmanuel Macron acknowledged Friday that the United States “won the bet” on coronavirus vaccines by investing massively and moving fast with experimental treatments.Macron visited a French factory that started bottling and packaging Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines this week, and urged his compatriots to join a “national war effort” to administer and make vaccines. He promised that France would produce 250 million vaccine doses this year for domestic and global use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-asks-people-under-55-who-got-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-for-first-dose-to-take-different-second-dose-101617977919872.html
09-04-2021||World||WHO chief laments 'shocking imbalance' in Covid-19 shot distribution||There is a "shocking imbalance" in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines worldwide and most countries do not have anywhere near enough shots to cover health workers and others at high-risk, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday.More than 700 million jabs have been administered worldwide against the disease, but 87% have gone to high income or upper middle-income countries, with low income countries receiving just 0.2%, he said."On average in high-income countries, almost one in four people has received a Covid-19 vaccine. In low-income countries, it’s one in more than 500," Tedros told a briefing.The COVAX facility has delivered nearly 38.4 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines to 102 countries across six continents, six weeks after it began to roll out supplies, the GAVI vaccine alliance and WHO said on Thursday. It aims to deliver more than 2 billion doses this year but has faced delays."We hope to be able to catch up during April and May. The problem is not getting vaccines out of COVAX, the problem is getting them in," Tedros said, decrying the scarcity of supply.The AstraZeneca shot - the mainstay of the COVAX programme so far - has been hit by safety concerns after reports of blood clots in some recipients.Australia said on Friday it had ordered more alternatives for the AstraZeneca vaccine, setting back its vaccination rollout, and Hong Kong delayed deliveries of the shot amid concern about a possible very small risk of rare blood clots.GAVI CEO Seth Berkley, asked whether COVAX was negotiating for more doses of the vaccine being shunned by some countries, said that the Anglo-Swedish company's supply chain had "picked up".He hoped that the supply of AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India - whose doses are now being kept domestically for use against an accelerating epidemic - would improve over time."As countries decide they are going to prioritise one vaccine or another that may free up doses, and in doing we will try to make sure those doses are made available without delay, if countries are willing to make that happen," Berkely said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/who-chief-laments-shocking-imbalance-in-covid-19-shot-distribution-101617978404063.html

Dr Martin Tobin, a Chicago-area pulmonologist who specialises in the science of breathing, contradicted defence claims that Floyd’s health condition and small amounts of fentanyl in his system caused loss of oxygen.Floyd, a Black man from Minneapolis, died last year after Chauvin, a white police officer, kneeled on his neck. A transcript of the minutes leading to Floyd’s death had revealed that he uttered “I can’t breathe” more than 20 times and was told by Chauvin to stop “yelling”. “Then stop talking, stop yelling, it takes a heck of a lot of oxygen to talk,” said Chauvin after Floyd told him he can’t breathe, according to the transcripts of Minneapolis police body camera footage.Tobin said that the pressure of Chauvin’s knees cut off oxygen in Floyd’s body and led to brain damage within minutes, causing an arrhythmia that caused his heart to stop. “They're pushing the handcuffs into his back and pushing them high, then on the other side, you have the street. The street is playing the crucial part," Tobin said. "It's like the left side is in a vice," he added.Tobin’s testimony undermined the claims made by the defence team which has been hinging on the toxicology report released in June 2020 that said traces of fentanyl and methamphetamine was found in Floyd’s system.Also Read | 'It’s a classic story': George Floyd's girlfriend recounts the couple's drug useWhat is fentanyl?Fentanyl is an opioid administered to treat severe, chronic pain in cancer patients, according to the US National Library of Medicine. In the United States, fentanyl has been classified as a Schedule II drug under the Controlled Substances Act, suggesting it has a high potential for abuse which may lead to severe psychological or physical dependence. Cases of fentanyl-related harm, overdose and death in the US are linked to illegally made fentanyl which is often mixed with heroin or cocaine without the users knowing that.MedlinePlus, an online information service by the US National Library of Medicine, has warned that fentanyl may be habit-forming, especially with prolonged use. “Fentanyl may cause serious harm or death if used accidentally by a child or by an adult who has not been prescribed the medication. Even partially used fentanyl may contain enough medication to cause serious harm or death to children or other adults,” says MedlinePlus on its website.The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has classified fentanyl as narcotics (opioids) drug. According to the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), its street names are Apace, China Girl, China Town, China White, Dance Fever, Goodfellas, Great Bear, He-Man, and Poison and Tango & Cash, as per NCBI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/derek-chauvin-trial-what-is-fentanyl-that-defence-blaming-for-floyd-s-death-101617976343017.html

The plane has continued to face careful scrutiny since it resumed flights.Southwest Airlines removed 30 MAX airplanes from its schedule Friday, while American Airlines removed 17 of its 41 MAX airplanes and United Airlines removed 16 of its 30 MAX airplanes.Boeing said in a statement that it wants 16 MAX operators to check and verify that "a sufficient ground path exists for a component of the electrical power system".American Airlines Chief Operating Officer David Seymour said in a memo to employees seen by Reuters that Boeing "has traced the issue to a production change made in the installation process that occurred after our last aircraft was delivered before the fleet grounding in March 2019."Airlines said they did not have an immediate timetable for when the planes could return to service. American said the issue impacts 17 of its most recently delivered airplanes.A Boeing spokeswoman said the issue was not related to a key safety system tied to both fatal crashes called MCAS, which had led to the wider safety grounding."We are also informing our customers of specific tail numbers affected, and we will provide direction on appropriate corrective actions," Boeing said in a statement.Southwest Airlines said 30 of its 58 737 MAX 8 aircraft were affected by Boeing's notification, but that it is currently only flying up to 15 MAX airplanes per day.Teal Group analyst Richard Aboulafia said it was not clear how big an impact the issue will have."If it’s a glitch that’s either just a false alarm or something easily checked in a day or so, it will be forgotten quickly," he said in an email."But since it’s just a batch of planes, and not all MAXs, it’s probably not related to the design.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/boeing-production-issue-prompts-airlines-to-pull-some-737-max-jets-from-service-101617976870951.html
09-04-2021||World||US: Florida woman, who coughed on cancer patient, gets 30 days in jail||A Florida woman whose image went viral when she coughed on a customer at a Pier 1 store last year in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic has been sentenced to 30 days in jail.A judge in Jacksonville on Thursday also ordered Debra Hunter to pay a USD 500 fine, serve six months probation and participate in a mental health evaluation along with anger management, David Chapman, communications director for the state attorney's office in Jacksonville, said in an email. She was also ordered to cover the costs of the victim's COVID-19 test.Hunter received credit for one day already served in jail. She was arrested last June after she was recorded deliberately coughing on the other customer during an argument with employees inside the store.According to investigators, the victim, Heather Sprague, had begun recording Hunter's heated encounter with the employees. Hunter saw her and made a rude gesture before walking up and saying she would cough on her. And then she coughed on her, an arrest affidavit said.Sprague, who is being treated for a brain tumor, told the judge she spent days anxiously searching for a place where she and her family could be tested for the coronavirus. The tests ended up being negative, she said.Hunter's husband told the judge they had faced numerous hardships leading up to the incident, including losing everything they had in a house fire, FirstCoast News reported.“It was like air being inflated into a balloon, and it finally got to the point where she couldn't handle any more air,” Hunter's husband said in court. “And then she finally rubbed up against something and just popped.“Hunter told the judge her family has paid the price for her mistakes, adding that her children continue to lose friends, and that they don't go out in their community anymore.“I watch as my kids lower their heads and turn the opposite direction, so they won't be recognized or approached,” she told the judge. “And I know exactly what they're feeling because I do the same thing.“Before ordering jail time, Duval County Court Judge James Ruth said she was struck by the fact that Hunter's testimony focused less on how she may have harmed the victim and more on how her actions affected her own family.“Her children didn't create this problem and her husband didn't, and she talked about how it changed her world and she was getting nastygrams on Facebook and things of that nature and they can't go to their country club or wherever,” Ruth said.“But I have yet to see any expression, or a significant expression on her regret about the impact it had on the victim in this case!”Sprague said the encounter left her stunned and fearful.“I worried for the health and safety of my children, and wondered how in the world I could possibly isolate to protect them — in a household of 12 — if I had been intentionally infected,” she said.She told the judge she believes there should be accountability for Hunter's actions, which is why she chose to report the incident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-florida-woman-who-coughed-on-cancer-patient-gets-30-days-in-jail-101617976424258.html

Above an incidence of 200, distance learning was planned for schools again, he added.The incidence figure reached a high near 200 in late December, soon after Germany went from a "lockdown lite" that started in early November, during which schools and stores were open, to a full shutdown.It last stood at 110.4, according to data from the Robert Koch Institute for infectious diseases.However, containment measures in Germany vary from region to region due to the country's decentralised federal system. In some regions, consumers can go shopping as long as they have a negative Covid-19 test, while stores are closed in others.Some, like Berlin, have introduced nighttime bans on gatherings, while others, like Saarland, have allowed restaurants and beer gardens to open outdoor seating."It makes good sense to regulate this uniformly for the whole of Germany, because then there will be clarity and transparency," Scholz told reporters."In this regard, it is a necessary, real step forward if we expand the infection (protection) law to include a regulation for exactly these cases."Short, sharp lockdownMerkel and several regional leaders have called for a short, sharp nationwide lockdown while Germany - Europe's biggest economy and most populous country - tries to vaccinate more people."Rules on social distancing, mask mandates, curfews and social distancing should be regulated at a national level," said Armin Laschet, chairman of Merkel's Christian Democrats (CDU).The number of confirmed coronavirus cases increased by 25,464 in a day, which was 3,576 more than a week earlier, data from the RKI showed on Friday.But the institute cautioned that the figures may be skewed following the long Easter holiday weekend, adding it expected reliable case numbers from around the middle of next week.A meeting of Merkel and the leaders of Germany's 16 states scheduled for Monday, at which they were to discuss an extension to Covid restrictions, has been cancelled, the government spokeswoman said.German health minister Jens Spahn warned that nationwide measures were necessary to break the current wave of coronavirus infections as quickly as possible.He told journalists that there were currently nearly 4,500 coronavirus patients in intensive care in Germany, adding: "If this continues, it will be too much for our health system."Germany's top public health official said a lockdown lasting two-four weeks was necessary to break the third wave."Every day in which we don't act, we lose lives," Lothar Wieler, president of the RKI, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/angela-merkel-to-take-control-from-german-states-impose-restrictions-on-regions-reporting-high-covid-19-cases-101617972537914.html

The finding strengthens the argument that Facebook's algorithms may be in violation of U.S. anti-discrimination laws, it added.Facebook spokesman Joe Osborne said the company accounts for "many signals to try and serve people ads they will be most interested in, but we understand the concerns raised in the report."Amid lawsuits and regulatory probes on discrimination through ad targeting, Facebook has tightened controls to prevent clients from excluding some groups from seeing job, housing and other ads.But researchers remain concerned about bias in artificial intelligence (AI) software choosing which users see an ad. Facebook and LinkedIn both said they study their AI for what the tech industry calls "fairness."LinkedIn engineering vice president Ashvin Kannan said the study's results "align with our own internal review of our job ads ecosystem."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/study-finds-disproportionate-gender-bias-behind-facebook-s-job-ads-101617970212224.html
09-04-2021||World||Queen Elizabeth II's husband Prince Philip: The strength behind the crown||He often grabbed headlines for his gaffes, but Prince Philip was portrayed by royalists as the silent stalwart, who shelved his personal ambitions to support Queen Elizabeth II over seven decades.Born into the Greek royal family -- although he preferred to be thought of as a Danish prince -- the Duke of Edinburgh never wore a crown himself.Yet he was a permanent public presence at the queen's side, who called him her "strength and stay".Like her, his life was ruled by duty and tradition, putting his considerable energy behind numerous charities and carrying out 22,219 solo public engagements since Elizabeth rose to the throne in 1952.But Philip regularly got into hot water for what were politely referred to as "politically incorrect" off-the-cuff remarks -- quips that from anyone else would be seen as downright racist.Also Read: Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, has died, says Buckingham Palace"You managed not to get eaten, then?" he remarked to a British student who had trekked in Papua New Guinea in 1998.And on a historic state visit to China in 1986, the self-described "cantankerous old sod" warned a group of British students: "If you stay here much longer, you'll all be slitty-eyed."There was also his reputation as a womaniser, something that worried the royal family even before he and queen married.They reportedly found the young naval officer "rough, ill-mannered and uneducated" and worried he "would probably not be faithful".The man the queen's formidable mother privately referred to as "The Hun" because of his German Battenberg blood, was quickly suspected of a string of affairs, which would later be resurrected in the hit Netflix series "The Crown".But Philip laughed off talk of philandering -- with Sarah, the Duchess of York's mother often cited as one of his former lovers."For the last 40 years I have never moved anywhere without a policeman accompanying me. So how the hell could I get away with anything like that?" he said.At home, the duke had a reputation for being cold towards his four children, Charles, Anne, Andrew and Edward.But many observers considered Philip to be the glue that held together the royal family.And in a rarely seen softer side, it emerged the late princess Diana addressed him as "Dearest Pa" in letters in which he offered solace over her deteriorating marriage to his eldest son Charles.'Trial and error' Philip, the world's longest serving consort, was blessed with robust health for much of his long life, and conducted his final official appearance in August 2017 at the age of 96.But he was admitted to hospital with various complaints as he advanced into his 90s, most recently for a heart procedure.In January 2019, at the age of 97 and still driving, he was involved in a car accident near the royal estate of Sandringham in eastern England.His Land Rover Freelander overturned and two other motorists were injured.Prosecutors decided not to press charges after the prince, who walked away unscathed, voluntarily surrendered his driving licence.The accident saw him withdraw from public life and he spent much of 2020 in isolation with the queen at their Windsor Castle home west of London, shielding from the coronavirus pandemic.But he made several appearances, including at the wedding ceremony of his granddaughter Princess Beatrice in July, four months before celebrating his own 73rd wedding anniversary.He also attended a military ceremony at Windsor in July when he handed over his ceremonial military role as Colonel-in-Chief of The Rifles regiment to his daughter-in-law Camilla, wife of Prince Charles.Never one to talk about his own feelings, the prince admitted in a rare 2011 interview that he had carved out his own role in the royal family by "trial and error".Asked if he had been successful, he told the BBC in his typical forthright manner: "I couldn't care less. Who cares what I think about it? I mean it's ridiculous."But the queen has been more forthcoming about his worth."He has, quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years," she said in a speech to mark their golden wedding anniversary in 1997.Exile from Greece Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark was born on a kitchen table on Corfu on June 10, 1921, the only son of prince Andrew of Greece -- the younger brother of Greece's king Constantine -- and princess Alice of Battenberg.Aged just 18 months, he and his family were evacuated in a British Royal Navy ship from politically unstable Greece, with the toddler reputedly carried in a cot made from an orange box.The family settled in Paris with young Philip heading to the austere Gordonstoun public school in Aberdeenshire, northeast Scotland, where he became head boy.He pursued his love of sailing and at the outbreak of World War II in 1939 became an outstanding Royal Navy cadet before serving on battleships in the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean.As the war progressed, Philip was mentioned in despatches and promoted through the ranks.By 1945, he was a first lieutenant and witnessed the Japanese surrender in Tokyo Bay with the British Pacific Fleet.Philip had been formally introduced to princess Elizabeth, the future queen, in July 1939.The pair shared a great-great grandmother -- Queen Victoria -- making them distant cousins, and they kept in touch during the war, meeting on a number of occasions.But it was not until July 1947 that their engagement was announced and they tied the knot that year on November 20 at Westminster Abbey in London.'Duty to serve her' The royal couple made their first major tour together -- to Canada and the United States -- in 1951.By now a commander, Philip's naval career was cut short by the death of Elizabeth's father, king George VI, in 1952, which brought her to the throne."Prince Philip was a highly talented seaman," said his contemporary Terence Lewin. "If he hadn't become what he did, he would have been First Sea Lord (chief of naval staff) and not me."Philip once admitted the curtailment of his career was "disappointing" but said, "being married to the queen, it seemed to me that my first duty was to serve her in the best way I could".Yet he remained closely involved with the armed services and the queen marked his 90th birthday in 2011 by appointing him Lord High Admiral -- the titular head of the British Royal Navy and an office until then held by her.He was a keen flyer, clocking well over 5,000 hours of pilot time, and turned his love of horses to competition, first as a polo player and later representing Britain at carriage-driving.He also maintained an interest in science, technology and the environment and for years drove a liquid petroleum gas taxi around London.His greatest legacy may lie in the Duke of Edinburgh's Award scheme, which was set up in 1956 to develop the confidence and skills of young people aged 15 to 25 in Britain and the Commonwealth.His youngest son, Edward, said its importance was likely to be greater due to the effects of the coronavirus pandemic on formal education."I think the role of the non-formal in this present climate is going to be even more important than ever before because it's those skills and experiences which are going to be looked for," he told Sky News televisionPhilip was also patron of a number of organisations, including the World Wide Fund for Nature, and chancellor of the universities of Cambridge and Edinburgh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/queen-elizabeth-ii-s-husband-prince-philip-the-strength-behind-the-crown-101617967007358.html

The explosives were uncovered in an unoccupied area far from any active runway. Turkish military explosives experts conducted a controlled detonation to render the device safe. Flight operations resumed shortly thereafter,” said the official.Qaiser later received telephone calls from his Afghan counterpart as well as chairman of Afghanistan’s Senate Fazal Hadi.During their telephone conversation, the two Afghan leaders said the Pakistani plane was not allowed to land at Kabul airport due to security concerns. They expressed the hope that the Pakistani delegation would soon visit Afghanistan, the Dawn News reported.Qaiser vowed to visit Afghanistan as soon as the security situation improved. He also remarked that Pakistan would continue to play its role for peace in Afghanistan.It was to be the first official visit of the Speaker to Afghanistan on the special invitation of his Afghan counterpart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/explosives-found-near-kabul-airport-plane-with-pak-speaker-turned-away-101617967434924.html
09-04-2021||World||US envoy John Kerry discusses climate challenges in Bangladesh||John Kerry, the special US envoy on climate, said Friday that President Joe Biden was keen to work with Bangladesh in dealing with climate change impacts after the United States' return to the Paris accord.Kerry arrived in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, to hear what the South Asia delta nation has done to cope with weather extremes and rising sea levels ahead of a virtual summit on climate change that Biden is hosting this month.“No one country can solve the problems of climate crisis,” he told reporters, after visiting other vulnerable countries including the United Arab Emirates and India. He said that Biden had returned the US to the Paris agreement on climate change after Donald Trump pulled out in 2017.Bangladeshi Foreign Minister A.K. Abdul Momen, who appeared with Kerry, took the opportunity to ask for US help in repatriating about 1.1 million Myanmar Rohingya refugees from crowded camps in the border district of Cox's Bazar, saying they were destroying vast areas of forests and ecology.“We hope that (the) US's proactive initiative can help them for a safe and dignified return, back to their country for a decent living,” he said.The refugees are victims of persecution in Myanmar, which is now military ruled since the Feb. 1 coup toppled the civilian government, and most say it's unsafe to return.Momen said earlier that Bangladesh believes that adaptation to climate change is not enough and it needs support as promised by others. “It should be Kerry's special target,” he was quoted as saying by the United News of Bangladesh news agency.He said the countries that are mostly responsible for contributing greenhouse gases should also share responsibility of rehabilitating and protecting the people vulnerable to climate change impacts.In the UAE, the government says the impact of warmer weather, less rain, droughts, higher seas and more storms is taking its toll on infrastructure, human health and natural habitat. Kerry heard of similar challenges in talks with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in New Delhi on Thursday, the State Department said.Bangladesh, a nation of 160 million people, shares the same predicament.Some expert warn that rising sea levels could devour much of its vast coastal region, and cyclones and tidal surge destroy agriculture and livelihood for millions. The world's largest mangrove forest, Sundarbans, which straddles the border of Bangladesh and India, is especially vulnerable and its famous Bengal tigers at risk.The State Department said that Kerry and Modi focused on mobilizing finance to support clean energy deployment, cooperation on innovation and scaling up emerging technologies such as for energy storage, green hydrogen, clean industrial processes and sustainable urbanization and agriculture.Biden has invited 40 world leaders for the April 22-23 summit, including Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-envoy-john-kerry-discusses-climate-challenges-in-bangladesh-101617966096900.html
09-04-2021||World||Prince Philip, husband of Queen Elizabeth II, has died, says Buckingham Palace||Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, husband and confidant of the U.K.’s Queen Elizabeth II since 1947, has died. He was 99.The prince “passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle,” according to an emailed statement Friday from the Queen’s officials.Philip’s death comes at a moment of profound change for the U.K. Five years after the vote to leave the European Union, Britain is trying to heal the wounds from the Brexit process, while recovering from the pandemic that pushed the economy into its deepest recession for 300 years.Watch | Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth’s husband, dies aged 99: PM Modi, UK PM reactThe royal family itself has been buffeted by a succession of controversies, most recently over Prince Harry’s departure from royal duties. Harry’s wife, Meghan Markle, said in an interview with Oprah Winfrey in March that an unnamed senior royal had asked “how dark” her unborn son’s skin color would be. That prompted a rare public response from the Queen.As he led the tributes to the Duke of Edinburgh on Friday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said Philip had “helped to steer the royal family and the monarchy so that it remains an institution indisputably vital to the balance and happiness of our national life.”Hard-workingThe duke was one of the hardest-working royals. He powered through various health scares over the years, retiring from public life only toward the end of his life.A former Royal Navy officer and World War II veteran, Philip was required by protocol to walk two paces behind his wife in public. But he successfully carved out a role for himself, tirelessly touring coal mines and hospitals, tiddlywinks championships and sheep shows. He accompanied his wife on more than 250 official overseas visits, meeting heads of state around the world.He also guarded his independence and drove himself as much as possible until he turned over his Land Rover on a country road in January 2019, leaving a woman with a broken wrist. He was persuaded to give up his driver’s license but was spotted later in the year driving a horse-drawn carriage on a road near the Queen’s Norfolk country estate.Personal legacyThe duke never attended university, having joined the Royal Navy straight from school, but was passionately committed to education. His legacy includes the Duke of Edinburgh’s Award project, a personal-development program for young people, and he was made chancellor for life of the University of Cambridge.He was perhaps most famous for speaking his mind in public. His politically incorrect gaffes amused, and sometimes appalled, the nation. While the queen managed never to offend anyone in public, her husband was followed wherever he went by tabloid journalists on “gaffe watch.”He was able to laugh at his own mistakes, once joking about “dontopedalogy” or “the science of opening your mouth and putting your foot in it.” He said he’d been “practicing it for years.”The duke’s supporters contended that his comments were usually bad attempts at humor, as when he asked a blind woman with a guide dog: “Do you know they have eating dogs for the anorexic now?”The duke’s forthright manner sometimes led to strained relations with members of his family, particularly Charles, his eldest son and the heir to the throne. In 1994, Charles told his authorized biographer that his father had bullied him into marrying Lady Diana Spencer.The couple divorced in 1996, after 15 years of marriage. Diana died in a car crash in Paris the following year. Many in the U.K. felt the royal family, and the duke in particular, had treated Diana poorly.In November 2002, Philip issued a public statement following media reports that he had written insulting letters to Diana at the time of her breakup with Prince Charles. The reports were a “gross misrepresentation” of his relationship with the princess, he said.The duke had a close relationship with the next generation. Prince William described him as a “legend” and his grand daughter Eugenie said Philip held the family together. “He really is strong and consistent,” she told a TV documentary. “He’s the rock, you know, for all of us.”Turbulent childhoodThe man who went on to marry the longest-reigning British monarch had a turbulent childhood. He was born Prince Philippos of Greece and Denmark on June 10, 1921, on a kitchen table at Villa Mon Repos, a summer house on the Greek island of Corfu.At Philip’s birth, Greece was experiencing political upheaval. In September 1922, his uncle, Greece’s King Constantine, was forced to abdicate by republicans who resented his pro-German leanings and his dismissal of a popular prime minister.A revolutionary court sentenced Philip’s father to death, though the punishment wasn’t carried out, and the British sent a Royal Navy ship to evacuate the Greek royals. The family fled with the 18-month-old Philip in a cot made from an orange box. Greece was declared a republic two years later.Philip spent his early childhood in Paris, where he became fluent in French. His mother had a nervous breakdown in 1930 and was diagnosed as a paranoid schizophrenic. She was confined to mental institutions for most of the next decade, and during World War II returned to Greece, where she became a nun. His father moved to Monte Carlo and his four sisters went to stay with German relatives.War serviceAs war with Germany loomed in 1939, Philip enrolled as a cadet at the Britannia Royal Naval College in Dartmouth, southwest England.Two years later, while serving on the battleship HMS Valiant, he won praise from superiors for bravery after a nighttime sea battle off Cape Matapan in southern Greece. Philip was in control of searchlights that illuminated enemy Italian ships.In July 1943, he was second in command of the destroyer HMS Wallace and took part in the Allied landings on Sicily. The prince was on board the destroyer HMS Whelp just off Japan when the Japanese officially surrendered on Sept. 2, 1945.During his time at sea, Philip corresponded with the young Princess Elizabeth, whom he called by the pet name Lilibet.They had first met in July 1939 when she visited Dartmouth with her family. She was a shy 13-year-old, he an 18-year-old Royal Navy cadet. They were distantly related, both great-great-grandchildren of Queen Victoria.The future queen’s governess, Marion Crawford, later wrote that Philip was “rather like a Viking with a sharp face and piercing blue eyes. He was good looking, though rather off-hand in his manner. Lilibet never took her eyes off him the whole time.”In July 1947, the couple announced their engagement amid concern among some courtiers about Philip’s foreign roots. In an effort to fit in, he changed his family name from Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glucksburg to the more English-sounding Mountbatten, an anglicized version of his mother’s surname, Battenberg.He renounced his own royal title as a prince of Greece and Denmark in order to become a naturalized British subject and converted from the Greek Orthodox religion to Anglicanism.Britain’s King George VI bestowed on his new son-in-law the titles His Royal Highness Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich. The wedding took place on Nov. 20, 1947, in London’s Westminster Abbey.The bridegroom’s German relatives weren’t invited. Three of his sisters had married German aristocrats in the 1930s. One was photographed sitting opposite Hitler at the wedding of Nazi Reich Marshal Hermann Goering, the commander of Germany’s Luftwaffe.Churchill’s adviceThere was also debate over the issue of what name the royal family should use. The queen, on advice from wartime Prime Minister Winston Churchill, decided she would not take her husband’s name, Mountbatten, and would remain Windsor. It was an important issue for the duke, who later said he felt like he had been “turned into an amoeba.”The married duke continued to serve in the Royal Navy and became a commander with his own ship, while also performing royal duties with his wife. In 1952, the couple were in Kenya when George VI died. It was the duke who broke the news to his wife that she was now Queen Elizabeth II.He also ended his naval career, deciding he could not fully support his wife while spending long periods away at sea. At a banquet celebrating their golden wedding anniversary in 1997, the monarch publicly thanked her husband.“He has quite simply been my strength and stay all these years,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-husband-of-queen-elizabeth-ii-dead-buckingham-palace-101617966369177.html
09-04-2021||World||Japan imposes new Covid-19 related measures in Tokyo ahead of Olympics||Japan announced Friday that it will raise the coronavirus alert level in Tokyo to allow tougher measures to curb the rapid spread of a more contagious variant ahead of the Summer Olympics.Japan's national vaccination drive has lagged and most people in the capital still have not been inoculated as infections have surged.The raised status announced by Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga will allow Tokyo's governor to mandate shorter opening hours for bars and restaurants, along with punishments for violators and compensation for those who comply. The measures are to begin Monday and continue through May 11.Many of Tokyo's cases have been linked to nightlife and dining, though they have recently spread to offices, elderly care facilities and schools, experts say.Suga also raised the alert level for Kyoto in western Japan and the southern island prefecture of Okinawa, where cases have surged in recent weeks. The new status there is to continue through May 5, the end of Japan's “Golden Week” holidays, to discourage traveling.The alert status was raised on Monday for three other areas — Osaka, neighboring Hyogo and Miyagi in the north. They have had sharp increases in daily cases since early March, soon after Japan scaled down a partial and non-binding state of emergency that began in January.The steps come less than three weeks after the emergency was lifted for Tokyo, underscoring the difficulty of balancing anti-virus measures and the economy. Suga's government has been criticized for being too slow in enacting anti-virus measures out of a reluctance to further damage the pandemic-hit economy.Osaka has declared a medical emergency after its hospitals became overwhelmed with new cases and has moved next week's Olympic torch relay there off public roads.Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike, who on Thursday asked Suga's government to boost the capital's alert level, said she is alarmed by the recent rise in virus cases and the possible impact of new variants. She urged residents to avoid nonessential trips and practice social distancing. Koike is expected to issue an order for bars and restaurants to close at 8 p.m.Just over 1 million people in Japan, or less than 1% of the population, have received the first of two vaccine doses, and the surge in cases may cause further cancellations of Olympic-related events.Inoculations started in mid-February for medical workers. Elderly people are scheduled to get their shots starting next week through late June. The rest of the population is likely to have to wait until about July, making it almost impossible for Japan to reach so-called herd immunity before the Tokyo Olympics begin on July 23.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-imposes-new-covid-19-related-measures-in-tokyo-ahead-of-olympics-101617964423758.html
09-04-2021||World||No data yet on changing Covid vaccines between doses: WHO||The WHO reiterated Friday there was "no adequate data" on switching Covid-19 vaccines between doses, after France said under-55s who received an AstraZeneca first jab should get their second from a different vaccine.The World Health Organization has called for studies on so-called mixing and matching between vaccines, but said there was no comprehensive data so far on which it could make any recommendations.The UN health agency therefore recommends that the same product should be used for both doses.In February, the WHO's Strategic Advisory Group of Experts on Immunization (SAGE) issued its recommendations on how the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine should be used, WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris told reporters."There is not adequate data to be able to say whether this is something that could be done," she said."So they were recommending that at this stage, interchangeability of vaccines was not something that we could give a recommendation on."But they did make a research recommendation that this be studied, so that we could understand whether or not it was a strategy that could be used."- French switch -Several clinical trials are looking at the efficacy of combining two types of vaccine.Europe's medicines regulator said this week that the AstraZeneca vaccine could cause very rare blood clots among some recipients, prompting several countries to scale up restrictions on the jab.France on Friday said under-55s who received a first injection of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine should be given a jab from a different producer for their second dose, in a ruling affecting 533,000 people.The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was the first Covid-19 jab to receive WHO's green light, on December 31 last year.The AstraZeneca-Oxford University was the second, on February 15, with SAGE having issued usage recommendations five days before.That February 10 document said on switching between Covid-19 vaccines: "No data are available on the interchangeability of doses of this vaccine with other Covid-19 vaccines."It is currently recommended that the same product should be used for both doses. Recommendations may be updated as further information becomes available on interchangeability."Going forward, the SAGE document also recommended "interchangeability and 'mix and match' studies within and across Covid-19 vaccine platforms".On Wednesday, the WHO's vaccine experts said a link between AstraZeneca's Covid-19 jabs and blood clots was plausible but unconfirmed, stressing that reported occurrences were "very rare"."Based on current information, a causal relationship between the vaccine and the occurrence of blood clots with low platelets is considered plausible but is not confirmed," the experts said.A WHO spokesman added: "We believe the benefit-risk balance is very much in favour of the vaccine."Nothing has changed in our advice -- which is to keep vaccinating."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-data-yet-on-changing-covid-vaccines-between-doses-who-101617965752257.html

Fraudulent and deceptive activity is not allowed on our platforms, including offering or trading fake reviews," a Facebook representative said.The CMA began a crackdown on false reviews from 2019 when it first asked Facebook and e-commerce platform eBay Inc to check their websites after it found evidence of a growing marketplace for misleading customer reviews on the platforms.Facebook has also been under scrutiny by the CMA for antitrust concerns over the technology company's acquisition of GIF website Giphy. It has been under pressure the world over for its data sharing practices as well as fake news and hate speech."The pandemic has meant that more and more people are buying online, and millions of us read reviews to enable us to make informed choices when we shop around. That's why fake and misleading reviews are so damaging," said CMA Chief Executive Andrea Coscelli.CMA's crackdown on Facebook coincides with Britain's efforts to set up a dedicated digital markets unit within the regulatory authority to specifically look at governing digital platforms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-bans-16k-accounts-for-trading-fake-reviews-101617963859433.html

In the meantime, he'll carry on keeping a close eye on the mud.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/as-etna-erupts-and-lights-up-the-sky-mud-pools-to-indicate-its-next-move-101617964319696.html

09-04-2021||World||Activist Greta Thunberg to skip UN climate conference in Scotland||Climate activist Greta Thunberg said she will not go to the United Nations climate conference due to be held in Scotland in November over concerns that inequality of access to Covid-19 vaccines will leave many countries unable to attend."Inequality and climate injustice is already the heart of the climate crisis," the 18-year-old Thunberg said on Twitter."If people can't be vaccinated and travel to be represented equally, that's undemocratic and would worsen the problem."Thunberg hit out at nations she said were unwilling to share vaccines with those that have little access to the drugs."Of course I would love to attend the Glasgow #COP26," she tweeted. "But not unless everyone can take part on the same terms. Right now many countries are vaccinating healthy young people, often at the expense of risk groups and frontline workers (mainly from global south, as usual...)"She was referring to Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Pacific islands and developing countries in Asia and the Middle East.Thunberg shot to fame in 2018 when she began a solitary protest against global warming outside the Swedish parliament in Stockholm, skipping her Friday school classes to demand her government take action on climate change.Within months, more than two million students in 135 countries had set up their own picket lines, joining Thunberg's "School strike for the climate" campaign.Speaking to the BBC for a documentary series, Thunberg said the Glasgow conference, due to run Nov. 1-12, should be postponed.The gathering, formally known as the U.N. Climate Change Conference of the Parties, has already been pushed back by a year due to the global pandemic."This needs to happen in the right way. Of course, the best thing to do would be to get everyone vaccinated as soon as possible so that everyone could take part (in the conference) on the same terms," Thunberg said.A delay, however, should not put off urgent action on climate, she said. "We don't have to wait for conferences nor anyone or anything else to dramatically start reducing our (greenhouse gas) emissions. Solidarity and action can start today."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/activist-greta-thunberg-to-skip-un-climate-conference-in-scotland-101617964503973.html

09-04-2021||World||Armed clashes break out in Myanmar between troops and anti-junta protesters||At least 11 demonstrators were killed in clashes with security forces in a town in northwest Myanmar after truckloads of troops arrived to quell a protest against the ruling military junta, domestic media reported on Thursday.Protesters armed with homemade guns, knives and firebombs fought back against the troops in the town of Taze and more soldiers were brought in, the Myanmar Now and Irrawaddy news outlets said.Fighting carried on into Thursday morning and at least 11 protesters were killed and about 20 wounded, they said. There was no word of any casualties among the soldiers.It took the toll of civilians killed by security forces to more than 600 since the junta seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) activist group.Taze is near the town of Kale, where at least 12 people were killed in a similar clash between troops and protesters on Wednesday, according to news media and witnesses.The incidents could signal a new phase in a struggle in which the opposition has largely used peaceful means of protest despite the lethal actions of the security forces."People will try to defend their own lives and their rights," said a former government minister who belongs to the Committee Representing Pyidaungsu Hluttaw (CRPH), a group of lawmakers representing the ousted civilian government."People will not wait for CRPH to act," the minister told Reuters. "The CRPH cannot stop the possible armed resistance by the people, from the people."The junta could not be reached for comment.SECURITY COUNCILA member of the CRPH, which is attempting to restore the civilian government, will on Friday address an informal, virtual gathering of the 15 U.N. Security Council members in New York, diplomats said.It will be the first public discussion of Myanmar by the Council's members since the coup on Feb. 1.The Security Council has condemned the violence against protesters, but has not defined the military takeover as a coup or threatened any action, due to opposition by China, Russia, India and Vietnam.The United States, which has imposed sanctions on the junta's economic interests, on Thursday added a state-owned gem enterprise to its list of targets.The junta has not baulked at taking on celebrities, and on Thursday arrested Paing Takhon, a popular 24-year-old model and actor who had spoken out against the coup and pledged support for Aung San Suu Kyi, his sister Thi Thi Lwin said.She said eight trucks and about 50 soldiers had come to pick him up at their parents' home in Yangon, where he had been staying as he was unwell from malaria and a heart condition. She did not know where he had been taken.AAPP has said over 2,800 people are in detention for opposing the junta.Suu Kyi, a Nobel Peace Prize laureate and Myanmar's leading champion of democracy over three decades, has been held at an undisclosed location since the coup and charged with crimes that could see her jailed and banned from politics.Her National League for Democracy won an election in November but the military - which has ruled Burma for most of its post-independence history - alleged that it had been marred by fraud.The junta's vice-chairman, Soe Win, was shown on state-run television meeting with military officers in Shan state to detail what he said were more cases of fraud. Many Western governments have dismissed the assertions as nonsense.BLACKLISTED GEMSThe United States, the European Union and others have already imposed sanctions on generals involved in the coup and some of their family members, as well as two conglomerates controlled by the military.The latest U.S. sanctions blacklisted Myanma Gems Enterprise, part of the mining ministry.The move blocks Americans from doing business with the entity, which issues permits and licences to mine precious stones and collects revenues from the sale of gems and jade. The U.S. Treasury Department said it would curb the junta's ability to generate revenues.Myanmar is the world's main source of jade, and a major source of rubies and other rare gems.Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the United States would "keep increasing pressure on the regime’s revenue streams until it ceases its violence, releases all those unjustly detained, lifts martial law and the nationwide state of emergency, removes telecommunications restrictions, and restores Burma to the path of democracy".An adviser to the CRPH told Reuters that at least six lawmakers from the National League for Democracy were now sheltering in India.An Indian police official said they were among about 1,800 people who had entered from Myanmar since late February."MPs are in great danger at the moment in Myanmar. They are being searched, they are being followed by the soldiers," the adviser said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/armed-clashes-break-out-in-myanmar-between-troops-and-anti-junta-protesters-101617959503468.html

09-04-2021||World||Nepal battles worst forest fires in years as air quality drops||Nepal is battling its worst forest fires in years, officials said on Friday, with smoke wafting across its mountains and souring the air as it settles into the bowl that holds capital city Kathmandu.Five people have died so far trying to put out the fires that have been raging since January, said Sundar Sharma, a senior official of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority.Wild fires were burning in at least 60 places across 22 of Nepal's 77 administrative districts, he said, adding to the growing levels of pollution across the country that lies nestled between India and the Tibet region of China.Details on losses from the fires are still being collected, Sharma said. This has been the worst fire season by number since 2012, when the government started keeping records."Forest fires are the main reason for the rising air pollution in Kathmandu and many other places," Sharma told Reuters."Wild fires could hit the peak later this month if the ongoing dry spell continued," he said.Nepal ordered schools to close for four days at the end of March after air pollution climbed to hazardous levels, forcing millions of students to stay home.Forest fires often erupt in Nepal during the January-May dry season, when villagers burn dry leaves in the woodlands to prompt fresh grass growth for their cattle.Sharma said the number of fires this year were 15 times more than those occurring in 2020. He didn't immediately have a reason for the increase.In Makwanpur, 50 km (32 miles) south of Kathmandu, 46-year-old Tara Pakhrin watched the fires on a hill next to her home."The smoke blinded me and I could not see who started the fire," she said.The air quality index (AQI) in Kathmandu was at an unhealthy level of 174 on Friday, according to data published on iqair.com, a site that monitors air quality. An AQI level below 50 is considered good."The pollution levels have come down in many places but this is not adequate enough for healthy breathing," said Indu Bikram Joshi, a spokesman for the Department of Environment.Just over the border in India's Uttarakhand state, forest fires have been burning since October, killing four people, the state government said.In April alone, there have been 657 incidents of forest fires in Uttarakhand, a bulk of them in the state's Garhwal region near to Nepal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepal-battles-worst-forest-fires-in-years-as-air-quality-drops-101617955658290.html
09-04-2021||World||Bhutan, China hold expert group meeting on boundary dispute||Bhutan and China have agreed to hold the much-delayed 25th round of bilateral boundary talks, almost five years after the last meeting was held and in the wake of a fresh claim by Beijing in the eastern sector that borders India’s Arunachal Pradesh state. The agreement was reached at the 10th expert group meeting (EGM) on the Bhutan-China boundary issue that was held in Kunming during April 6-9, according to a joint statement issued by the two countries on Friday. The meeting was held against the backdrop of the dragging standoff between India and China in the Ladakh sector, which began almost a year ago. At the height of the standoff, China claimed for the first time in July last year that it has a boundary dispute with Bhutan in the eastern sector, a region that borders Arunachal Pradesh, which is also claimed by Beijing. Also Read | PM Modi, Xi Jinping on Joe Biden’s 40 leaders’ guest list for climate summitThe joint statement issued by Bhutan and China said: “The two sides agreed to hold the 25th round of Bhutan-China boundary talks and the 11th EGM as soon as possible at mutually convenient dates.” The EGM discussed a roadmap to expedite the Bhutan-China boundary talks, the joint statement said without giving details. Bhutan and China have held 24 rounds of talks between 1984 and 2016 to settle their border issue and, according to discussions in the Bhutanese parliament and other public records of these meetings, the discussions have only centred on disputes in the western and central sections of the boundary. It couldn’t immediately be ascertained if China’s claim in the eastern sector with Bhutan – which was first raised in a statement issued to Hindustan Times by the foreign ministry in Beijing in July last year – had figured in the talks held in Kunming. China had objected to a grant request for Sakteng wildlife sanctuary in eastern Bhutan’s Trashigang district at a virtual meeting of the Washington-based Global Environment Facility (GEF) in June last year. The sanctuary, located in the easternmost part of Bhutan, covers 650 sq km. “The two sides agreed to continue to maintain peace and tranquillity in the border areas pending a final settlement of the boundary issue,” the joint statement said. The EGM was held in a “warm and friendly atmosphere” and it had “in-depth and fruitful discussions on the boundary issue in keeping with the close ties of friendship and cooperation between Bhutan and China”, the joint statement said. Boundary talks between Bhutan and China began in 1984, and the two sides signed the “Guiding Principles on the Settlement of the Boundary Issues” in 1988 and the “Agreement on Maintenance of Peace and Tranquillity” along border areas in 1998. “These two agreements form the basis of the boundary negotiation between Bhutan and China,” the joint statement said. The Bhutanese delegation at the EGM was led by Letho Tobdhen Tangbi, secretary of international boundaries, and the Chinese side was led by Hong Liang, director general of the department of boundary and ocean affairs of China’s foreign ministry. Hong has also led the Chinese delegations that participated in several recent meetings of the India-China Working Mechanism for Consultation and Coordination (WMCC) on border affairs. As a goodwill and friendship, the Chinese government donated personal protective equipment and medical supplies to support Bhutan’s fight against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bhutan-china-hold-expert-group-meeting-on-boundary-dispute-101617960475727.html

09-04-2021||World||Italy set to ease lockdown restrictions in most parts of the country||Italy is set to ease lockdown restrictions, lifting some curbs that have been weighing on the economy in the region surrounding Milan and across the country as the latest virus resurgence slows, officials said.Health Minister Roberto Speranza will likely sign a decree on Friday evening to shift many regions classified as high-risk “red” areas to medium-risk “orange” status, said the officials, who asked not to be named discussing a confidential issue.The development would mean that from early next week more retail businesses could open and people would be given more freedom to move around within their municipalities. Bars and restaurants would remain open only for takeout orders while travel to other regions would still be mostly banned.Prime Minister Mario Draghi is banking on accelerating a vaccination campaign to allow for an easing of lockdown rules. The premier on Thursday confirmed the government’s latest target of half a million daily Covid-19 vaccinations by the end of the month, even with new restrictions on the AstraZeneca Plc vaccine.Lombardy RegionRegions set to benefit from the easing of restrictions include Lombardy, which surrounds the country’s financial capital Milan; Piedmont, around the northern city of Turin; and the central region of Tuscany, the officials said.As many as four regions are likely to be kept on high-risk status: Campania and Puglia in the depressed south, Val d’Aosta in the north, and the island of Sardinia.Italy posted 17,221 new daily coronavirus cases on Thursday, as government experts say the pace of contagion is slowing. The country has recorded more than 3.7 million cases since the start of the pandemic.Draghi also said Thursday that his administration’s next decree for further stimulus measures, involving a request to widen the budget deficit, will probably be greater than the previous amount. The prime minister has already secured approval for a 32 billion-euro ($38 billion) package originally requested by his predecessor Giuseppe Conte.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/italy-set-to-ease-lockdown-restrictions-in-most-parts-of-the-country-101617956782441.html

The nine-percentage point difference is the largest since the fourth quarter of 2012 and in recent years, the Democratic advantages have been between four and six percentage points, according to the poll.While the rise in the Democratic Party affiliation after the victory of the party candidate in the presidential election is not unprecedented, the GOP is facing its smallest share of identifiers since 2018 and its largest deficit to Democrats on party identification and leaning in nearly nine years, Gallup said.The poll figures come as President Joe Biden was inaugurated after facing violent resistance on January 6 when the rioters attempted to disrupt ‘the certification of his victory in the 2020 election'. The first quarter also witnessed a steady decline in the number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases, deaths, expansion of vaccination program and the $1.9 trillion relief package.Also Read | Indian techie, pregnant wife found dead in US after 4-yr-old girl seen cryingGallup routinely measures party identification of the US adults and the political leanings of the independents. “In the first quarter, 30% of Americans identified as Democrats and 19% were Democratic-leaning independents, while 25% were Republican identifiers and 15% Republican-leaning independents. The vast majority of the remaining 11% were independents with no partisan leanings,” as per the poll.The poll also said the level of independent identification is among the highest against any quarter since 1988. However, increased independent identification mostly comes at the cost of the Republican party.The report noted that the GOP enjoyed advantages for incumbent Republican presidents George H.W. Bush following the 1991 US victory in the Gulf War, and George W. Bush in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001 attacks.“The GOP's hopes of regaining control of the House and Senate it lost in the past two federal election cycles may also depend on how well the party appeals to independent voters, the largest bloc in the US., something the Republican Party struggled to do during the Trump administration,” the Gallup report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/democratic-party-affiliations-highest-since-2012-gop-facing-smallest-share-since-2018-poll-101617958344344.html

There is no clarity yet on the cause of the death. The US police said they will share findings of the autopsy report," Rudrawar said."My daughter-in-law was seven months pregnant," he said. "We had been to their house and were planning another trip to the US to be with them again," he said."I am not aware of any possible motive. They were a happy family and had lovely neighbours," he said when asked if he suspected foul play."I was informed by the US authorities that it will take at least 8 to 10 days for the bodies to reach India after necessary formalities," he said."My granddaughter is now with a friend of my son. He had several friends in the local Indian community, which has a 60 per cent population in New Jersey," he said.Balaji Rudrawar, an IT professional from Ambajogai in Maharashtra's Beed district had moved with his wife to the US in August 2015 after they got married in December 2014, said his father, a businessman from the temple town, around 500 km from Mumbai.While Balaji was working there for a prominent Indian infotech company, his wife was a homemaker, Rudrawar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-techie-pregnant-wife-found-dead-in-us-after-4-yr-old-girl-seen-crying-101617957275895.html
09-04-2021||World||Indonesia warns of risk of landslides, floods from new cyclone 'Odette'||Indonesia's weather agency warned on Friday that a second tropical cyclone in the space of a week could trigger floods and landslides in more central areas after cyclone Seroja killed 163 people in eastern parts of the country.Rescuers have been searching for missing people and rushing in aid to islands in East Nusa Tenggara province after Seroja lashed the area with rain, floods and landslides on Sunday.The head of Indonesia's weather agency (BMKG) said a new cyclone, named Odette, was gaining traction and could hit Lampung province on the island of Sumatra, as well as the provinces of East Java and Central Java and the island of Bali."People are advised to remain cautious of heavy winds and rains that could happen in some areas and be mindful of threats of floods, landslides and flash floods," Dwikorita Karnawati told a news conference.While Odette was not expected to be as destructive as Seroja, she warned it could generate tidal surges as high as 6 metres (19.7 ft) in the southern Indian Ocean near Java and Bali, urging fishermen to take precautions.Seroja damaged thousands of homes and displaced over 22,800 people, according to data from Indonesia's national disaster mitigation agency, while 45 people remain missing.President Joko Widodo, who flew to East Nusa Tenggara on Friday to survey recovery efforts, said that while the needs of displaced people were being met in the area he visited, access was being blocked by large boulders."If we look at the field, it's so rocky with big rocks that could complicate our heavy equipment," he said.The weather agency has warned that once-rare tropical cyclones are happening more often in Indonesia.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-warns-of-risk-of-landslides-floods-from-new-cyclone-odette-101617950109162.html

09-04-2021||World||100 days of Brexit: Was it as bad as ‘project fear’ warned?||The warnings were stark. A vote to leave the European Union, the British government said, would trigger an immediate recession, a painful fall in house prices, and a steep drop in exports.It’s almost 100 days since Britain completed its split from the EU -- almost five years after the referendum vote –- and a clearer picture of the consequences of the decision to leave is starting to emerge.The divorce has already had a negative impact on the U.K. economy, the data show, even if it has been largely overshadowed by the coronavirus pandemic.Many of the effects of Brexit will take more time to play out: with Britain outside the EU’s single market and customs union, trade with the bloc has been hampered -- but the full extent of the damage won’t be clear until businesses fully re-open after lockdown.Some of the claims made by the Remain side, “Project Fear” as the British press dubbed it, have proved to be overblown, though. Here’s an early look at how Brexit is shaping up compared with the predictions.The Short-Term HitIn a report published before the 2016 referendum, the Treasury predicted that a vote to leave, followed by the immediate triggering of the Article 50 withdrawal process, would see national income decline by as much as 3.6% within two years, 520,000 more people unemployed, and house prices fall by 10%.It didn’t turn out that way -- not least because the government didn’t invoke Article 50 until March 2017. By June 2018, gross domestic product had risen by more than 3%, unemployment had fallen by 280,000, and the average house price had gained more than 7%.Then came Covid. GDP shrank almost 10% last year, the deepest slump since the Great Frost of 1709. The economy has only partially recovered from the huge losses incurred during the first lockdown last spring, leaving Britain further below pre-pandemic levels of output than any other Group of Seven nation.Higher Cost of LivingIn April 2016, the government sent a leaflet to all U.K. households, urging them to vote in favor of staying in the EU. It warned that leaving would increase the cost of living, because a falling pound would make imports more expensive. (About half of all U.K. imports come from the EU.)That prediction turned out to be prescient. The pound fell by as much as 18% against the euro within two years of the referendum, and remains 12% below its level on the day of the Brexit vote.Consumer-price inflation reached a 5 1/2-year high of 3.1% in November 2017, squeezing living standards. It remained above the Bank of England’s 2% target for almost all of the following two years. But inflation has since slumped because of the coronavirus pandemic.The Treasury predicted that if the U.K. left the EU and managed to reach a trade deal with the bloc, the country’s economy would be between 4.6% and 7.8% smaller in 15 years’ time than if it would have been had it stayed in the EU.Though Britain has only been formally out of the EU’s single market for less than 100 days, the Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that Brexit has already lowered GDP by 1.4% since the referendum. It now expects GDP will be 4% lower in the long-run than had Britain remained in the EU.Dan Hanson of Bloomberg Economics puts the hit at 3%, or as much as 5% if the impact of the government’s restrictions on immigration is factored in.Export PainsThe government said leaving the EU would make it more difficult for firms to export goods to the bloc, and that businesses would face higher costs.This warning turned out to be correct. U.K. companies have had to grapple with additional red tape such as export health certificates to shift goods into the EU. In January, exports to the continent shrank by 41% from the previous month.David Frost, who negotiated the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU and is now minister responsible for Britain’s relations with the bloc, has blamed stockpiling in December and the coronavirus lockdown for the reduction in trade. He says trade recovered to its normal level at the start of February. The data that will confirm or disprove that won’t be published until Tuesday.Finance FleeingBefore the referendum, many in the City of London warned a vote to leave would trigger a wave of job losses. Accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers predicted that as many as 100,000 jobs in financial services would go.In fact, far fewer jobs have relocated to the EU: 7,600 roles had moved as of March, according to EY, a consultancy. PwC didn’t respond to a request for comment.Still, more jobs could go if Britain and the EU can’t reach a deal giving U.K. financial firms broad access to the single market, something they lost as a consequence of Brexit.In the meantime, the City has lost business. Almost all trading of EU shares on U.K. exchanges -- more than 6 billion euros ($7 billion) in daily transactions -- shifted to the bloc in January. And banking giants such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. have moved hundreds of billions of euros to their new or expanded hubs across the bloc.What about the NHS?The Leave campaign made less concrete and specific forecasts about the economic benefits of Brexit -- though one particular pledge stands out: a commitment to re-direct the 350 million pounds a week the U.K. sent to the EU to the National Health Service.That figure was too large given the U.K.’s net weekly contribution to the EU only totaled 250 million pounds once the rebate Britain received from the bloc is included. A significant chunk of that payment also came back to the U.K. in the form of EU public sector spending.In 2018, the U.K. announced plans to boost spending on the NHS by 394 million pounds a week in real terms from 2023, an increase the then Prime Minister Theresa May said would be partly funded by funds that would otherwise have gone to the EU.But the U.K. will still have to send approximately 20 billion pounds to the EU over the next seven years as part of its divorce settlement. And Brexit’s negative impact on GDP and tax receipts is expected to outweigh any cost savings from no longer making contributions to the bloc, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies.Long Term?The full cost of Britain’s decision to sever ties with its biggest and nearest commercial partner is likely to only become clear once the coronavirus restrictions ease and businesses return to normal. The debate is still far from settled.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/100-days-of-brexit-was-it-as-bad-as-project-fear-warned-101617944598879.html
09-04-2021||World||Egyptologists uncover 'lost golden city' buried under the sands||Archaeologists have uncovered the remains of an ancient city in the desert outside Luxor that they say is the "largest" ever found in Egypt and dates back to a golden age of the pharaohs 3,000 years ago.Famed Egyptologist Zahi Hawass announced the discovery of the "lost golden city", saying the site was uncovered near Luxor, home of the legendary Valley of the Kings."The Egyptian mission under Dr. Zahi Hawass found the city that was lost under the sands," the excavation team said in a statement Thursday."The city is 3,000 years old, dates to the reign of Amenhotep III, and continued to be used by Tutankhamun and Ay."The team called the find "the largest" ancient city ever uncovered in Egypt.Betsy Bryan, professor of Egyptian art and archaeology at Johns Hopkins University, said the find was the "second most important archeological discovery since the tomb of Tutankhamun" nearly a century ago, according to the team's statement.Items of jewellery have been unearthed, along with coloured pottery vessels, scarab beetle amulets and mud bricks bearing seals of Amenhotep III."Many foreign missions searched for this city and never found it," said Hawass, a former antiquities minister.The team began excavations in September 2020, between the temples of Ramses III and Amenhotep III near Luxor, some 500 kilometres (300 miles) south of Cairo."Within weeks, to the team's great surprise, formations of mud bricks began to appear in all directions," the statement said."What they unearthed was the site of a large city in a good condition of preservation, with almost complete walls, and with rooms filled with tools of daily life."- 'Tombs filled with treasures' -After seven months of excavations, several neighbourhoods have been uncovered, including a bakery complete with ovens and storage pottery, as well as administrative and residential districts.Amenhotep III inherited an empire that stretched from the Euphrates River in modern Iraq and Syria to Sudan and died around 1354 BC, ancient historians say.He ruled for nearly four decades, a reign known for its opulence and the grandeur of its monuments, including the Colossi of Memnon -- two massive stone statues near Luxor that represent him and his wife."The archaeological layers have laid untouched for thousands of years, left by the ancient residents as if it were yesterday," the team's statement said.Bryan said the city "will give us a rare glimpse into the life of the ancient Egyptians at the time where the empire was at his wealthiest".The team said they were optimistic that further important finds would be revealed, noting they had discovered groups of tombs reached through "stairs carved into the rock", a similar construction to those found in the Valley of the Kings."The mission expects to uncover untouched tombs filled with treasures," the statement added.After years of political instability following the Arab Spring uprising of 2011, which dealt a severe blow to Egypt's tourism industry, the country is seeking to bring back visitors, in particular by promoting its ancient heritage.Last week, Egypt transported the mummified remains of 18 ancient kings and four queens across Cairo from the iconic Egyptian Museum to the new National Museum of Egyptian Civilisation in a procession dubbed the "Pharaohs' Golden Parade".Among the 22 bodies were those of Amenhotep III and his wife Queen Tiye.bam-hha/pjm/sw/kir||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egyptologists-uncover-lost-golden-city-buried-under-the-sands-101617952231234.html

It added the disasters could be avoided only by the US abandoning “hegemonic thinking motivated by self-interest."Despite hopes for a change in tone, relations between Washington and Beijing have remained as fractious under Biden as they were under his predecessor, who riled China with a trade war, support for Taiwan and sanctions over Chinese polices including in Hong Kong and Xinjiang.China's assertiveness in the South China Sea and US calls for more candour from Beijing about the origins of the coronavirus pandemic have further roiled ties.While the new administration has taken no major actions in those areas, it has neither shown any sign of reversing the hardline taken under former president Donald Trump. Congress, meanwhile, is preparing to take up new legislation that would underscore the competition with Beijing in foreign affairs, trade and other fields.Asked Thursday about that pending legislation, State Department spokesperson Ned Price said the administration has been “heartened that there is a good deal of bipartisan agreement when it comes to how we should and could approach the government in Beijing".China has struck back with heated rhetoric and visa bans against US officials and others it deems to have damaged its interests through their criticism of Beijing's human rights record.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-report-accuses-us-of-causing-humanitarian-disasters-101617951528646.html
09-04-2021||World||Pakistan’s steadily diminishing equity with the US may have hit rock bottom||The United States (US) state department spokesperson Ned Price could not have chosen a better word to reflect the Joe Biden administration’s weariness with Pakistan. Asked about Islamabad’s flip-flop on sugar and cotton imports from India, Price said the US “continues” to encourage the two countries to resolve their concerns through direct dialogue. Actually, he could have simply shrugged.Pakistan’s steadily diminishing equity with the US may have hit rock bottom with the Biden administration. “For the first time in over two decades, Pakistan is not a foreign-policy priority for a new US administration,” two former Obama administration officials acknowledged in recent, and sympathetic article, advocating a reset of ties with Pakistan. And this might be good thing to keep in the rearview as New Delhi responds to Pakistan Army chief Qamar Javed Bajwa’s call to “bury the past and move forward”.Also Read | The long, rocky and uncertain story of India-Pakistan peacemakingFormer President Donald Trump wanted to mediate and made it known several times, to New Delhi’s irritation. But Biden is not interested apparently, and his administration has played no role in the newest stab at peace on the subcontinent, according to several people familiar with these developments.Biden has shown no interest in engaging Pakistan. He has not spoken to Prime Minister Imran Khan yet, more than two months after taking office. And that’s despite a direct request from Islamabad. The US President has also not invited Khan to his virtual summit on climate later this month. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Bangladesh’s Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina are among the 40 world leaders who will attend. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has spoken with his Pakistani counterpart Shah Mahmood Qureshi, but the conversation was most unlike how first-calls tend to be. It was an uncomfortable call about the release of Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a man convicted of kidnapping and killing of American journalist Daniel Pearl. Some in Islamabad wonder if Sheikh’s release ordered by the Supreme Court just a week after Biden’s inauguration in January is behind the current chill. US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin spoke with General Bajwa on phone during his travels in the region, but he did not stop by for a visit. He went to India and then skipped over Pakistan for an unannounced visit to Afghanistan.Pakistan’s allies in Washington have been trying, in the meanwhile, to catch the Biden administration’s attention and get it interested in resetting ties with the one-time ally. One of them called for a “rightsized” US-Pakistan relationship focused on economic and cultural interests. Another one called also for economic ties as the new focus but sought a “light government touch”, in other words, US government help.There is no indication the Biden administration — the national security council is driving the South Asia engagement for now in the absence of senate-confirmed assistant secretaries to head the relevant bureaus at the state and defence departments — is interested in a reset. Bajwa’s peace offer, as one American observer said, could be a move to “impress” Biden, win a reprieve and get something that looks like a reset. And no more.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistans-steadily-diminishing-equity-with-the-us-may-have-hit-rock-bottom-101617951654375.html

09-04-2021||World||The world’s wealthiest countries are getting vaccinated 25 times faster||Enough vaccines have now been administered to fully vaccinate about 5% of the global population — but the distribution has been lopsided. Most vaccines are going to the wealthiest countries. As of Thursday, 40% of the Covid-19 vaccines administered globally have gone to people in 27 wealthy nations that represent 11% of the global population. Countries making up the least-wealthy 11% have gotten just 1.6% of Covid-19 vaccines administered so far, according to an analysis of data collected by the Bloomberg Vaccine Tracker.In other words, countries with the highest incomes are vaccinating 25 times faster than those with the lowest.Bloomberg’s database of Covid-19 vaccinations has tracked more than 726 million doses administered in 154 countries. As part of our effort to assess vaccine access around the world, the tracker has a new interactive tool measuring countries by wealth, population and access to vaccines. The U.S., for example, has 24% of the world’s vaccinations but just 4.3% of the population, while Pakistan has 0.1% of the vaccine coverage for 2.7% of the global population. The pattern is repeated across the globe and follows efforts by wealthy countries to pre-purchase billions of doses of vaccines, enough to cover their populations several times over, according to a separate analysis of vaccine deals. The U.S. is on track to cover 75% of its residents in the next three months. Meanwhile, nearly half of countries still haven’t reached 1% of their populations. The disparity calculations don’t include more than 40 countries, mostly among the world’s poorest, that don’t yet have public vaccination data. Those uncharted countries represent almost 8% of the global population.In the U.S., the federal government determines where vaccines are sent. So far, each state has been allocated vaccines based on its population size. While there are differences in access from neighborhood to neighborhood, each state has a fair share roughly proportional to its number of residents. A World of DifferenceThere’s no mechanism to ensure equitable distribution worldwide. If all of the world’s vaccines were distributed based on population, the U.S. would have administered nearly six times its fair share. The U.K. would have used up 7 times its population-weighted allotment (outpacing the EU’s double-share). Topping the list are the UAE and Israel, with nine and 12 times their population-based share, respectively.China has vaccinated its people at a rate that’s roughly in line with the global average — administering 20% of the world’s vaccinations for 18% of the global population. It has also exported vaccines to less wealthy countries, sometimes at no cost.The world’s least wealthy continent, Africa, is also the least vaccinated. Of its 54 countries, only three have have inoculated more than 1% of their populations. More than 20 countries aren’t even on the board yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/the-world-s-wealthiest-countries-are-getting-vaccinated-25-times-faster-101617942167302.html

The current 10 p.m. dining curfew and ban on gatherings of more than four people will be maintained, he said."Signs of a fourth wave of epidemics that we had so striven to head off are drawing nearer and becoming stronger," Chung told a daily meeting on the pandemic. "We will maintain the current distancing level, but actively reinforce various specific measures depending on the situation."The Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) reported 671 new cases for Thursday, a day after the daily tally hit the highest level since early January, with clusters developing from churches, bars and gyms, mostly in the greater Seoul area.Total infections rose to 108,269, with 1,764 deaths so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korea-orders-closure-of-nightclubs-karaoke-bars-fears-4th-covid-19-wave-101617937859614.html
09-04-2021||World||Australian PM holds national cabinet meeting amid vaccine upheaval||Australia is holding a national cabinet meeting on Friday to devise a new COVID-19 vaccination programme after abruptly changing policy and recommending people under 50 take the Pfizer vaccine not AstraZeneca due to the risks of blood clots.The move sees Australia joining countries around the world which have put restrictions on one of the most widely accessible vaccines against the coronavirus over concern about links to very rare blood clots. Australia will now seek tens of millions more doses of Pfizer's product.Plans to vaccinate Australia's 25 million population by the end of October would be pushed back, Prime Minister Scott Morrison said on Thursday in announcing the change."Today we need to work through what the implications are for that changed circumstance," Chief Medical Officer Paul Kelly told cable television station Sky News."Nothing's off the table. We're continuing to talk with multiple vaccine (manfacturers) around the world, particularly those that have completed their trials," added Kelly.Australian authorities switched their recommendation after European regulators reiterated the possibility of links between AstraZeneca's shot and blood clots. More than a dozen countries have at one time suspended use of the vaccine, but most have resumed, with some, including France, the Netherlands and Germany, recommending a minimum age.Australia had ordered 20 million imported doses of the Pfizer vaccine, enough for 10 million people, but had banked on the AstraZeneca product for the majority of shots with biopharma CSL Ltd contracted to make 50 million doses domestically.Pfizer remained committed to delivering all 20 million doses by the end of 2021 and the Australians were already talking to the company about upping its order, Kelly noted.AstraZeneca said in a statement that it respected the Australian decision and was working with regulators around the world "to understand the individual cases, epidemiology and possible mechanisms that could explain these extremely rare events".CSL said it remained committed to meeting its contracted arrangements with Australia and AstraZeneca to make the vaccine "which remains critical for the protection of our most vulnerable populations".As well as the AstraZeneca and Pfizer contracts, Australia ordered 51 million doses of a vaccine being trialled by U.S. pharmaceutical giant Novavax Inc, but local authorities say they do not expect to approve the product until late 2021.Australia also embarked on a home-grown option - as opposed to local manufacture of AstraZeneca's offshore-developed product - with University of Queensland undertaking a trial of its own vaccine. That trial was aborted in December when the product was linked to false positives in HIV tests.After saying Australia had 150 million vaccine doses on order, enough for several times the population, the government said in January that it planned to have four million vaccinated by the end of March, only to have 600,000 by that time."Australians won't forget who is responsible for failing to deliver on what are his own promises and his own commitments," opposition Labor leader Anthony Albanese told reporters on Friday."They should have listened to the expert advice that was given to the government, and indeed to all governments, about not placing all our eggs in one basket".Health Minister Greg Hunt told Sky News the government had intentionally spread its exposure to several vaccines under development because of the unusual nature of the coronavirus."Nobody knew which vaccines would be successful," he said.New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern, who agreed this week to allow quarantine-free visits by travellers from neighbouring Australia, said the country was still assessing the AstraZeneca vaccine, without specifying whether the Australian decision would affect it.The Pfizer vaccine is the only inoculation approved by New Zealand, which says it has ordered enough for its five million population.Australia began vaccinations later than some other countries because of its low number of infections, which stand at just under 29,400, with 909 deaths, since the pandemic began.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australian-pm-holds-national-cabinet-meeting-amid-vaccine-upheaval-101617932874428.html

The second phase of six months will target the elderly, people with comorbidities, and workers in essential services, with the rest of the population following in the third phase."If we didn't have this debacle with the AstraZeneca vaccines, we would have been able to move faster, as we have indicated to the public," Mkhize said as he expressed hope that South Africa would achieve herd immunity against Covid-19 within a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/serum-institute-of-india-refunds-south-africa-for-undelivered-covid-19-vaccines-101617940436571.html
09-04-2021||World||'None': President Biden counts reasons why one may need assault weapons||After declaring gun violence as an epidemic in the country on Thursday, US President Joe Biden reiterated the need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in the country. The President said there is no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine.“We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country. There’s no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine. None,” Biden tweeted through the official account of the POTUS (President of the United States).We need to ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country. There’s no reason somebody needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds in a magazine. None.Biden has repeatedly called for gun control actions and removing liability protection for the gun manufacturers is at the top of his legislative priorities. "The only industry in America, a billion-dollar industry, that can't be sued,” the news agency ANI quoted Biden as saying.“I know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one. But even here, there’s much more common ground than some would have us believe,” POTUS on Friday tweeted with a video.In the video, the President ensured the people that every proposal is in line with the Second Amendment. The Second Amendment, one of the ten amendments of the US constitution comprising the Bill of Rights speaks about the right of people to keep and bear Arms.“Everything that is being proposed today is totally consistent with the Second Amendment. I know that when overwhelming majorities of Americans want to see something change, that will affect their lives, and it still doesn’t change, it can be demoralizing to our fellow citizens. It can feel like our entire political process is broken,” Biden said in the video.Also Read | US advised not to rush Afghanistan peace settlementAssuring the Americans of their safety, he said the government will fulfil its first responsibility, which is to protect the people. Citing the example of the Brady Bill, he assured that the government will get the gun control laws passed. “It took five years to get the Brady bill passed and it took even more years to work to pass the assault weapons ban and it saved lives. No matter how long it takes we are going to get these passed,” he said.The Brady Bill, which was signed into law in 1993 requires the gun buyers to wait for five business days while the authorities perform a background check. The law mandates federal background checks on prospective firearms buyers.In March, the House passed two legislations, one that would require background checks on all gun buyers and extend the time for the FBI to vet those flagged by the national instant check system. The other measure will mandate firearms buyers purchasing from private sellers online or from shows to get their background checked before receiving the weapon, reported New York Times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/none-president-biden-counts-reasons-why-one-may-need-assault-weapons-101617938984467.html

Kyaw Zwar Minn said he was barred from entering the embassy on Wednesday evening by diplomats loyal to the military regime.Last month, the ambassador had called for the release of Myanmar’s democratic leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, who was detained when the military seized power on February 1.A statement read on Kyaw Zwar Minn’s behalf outside the embassy in London on Thursday said the embassy building had been “seized by the military attache yesterday evening. The ambassador has been locked out since then”.British foreign secretary Dominic Raab condemned the “bullying actions of the Myanmar military regime”, and praised the ambassador’s “courage”.Daily protests demanding a return of democracy have rocked the country and brought a brutal response from the armed forces, with almost 600 civilians reportedly killed.US blacklists state-run gems enterpriseThe US treasury department on Thursday imposed sanctions on a Myanmar state-owned gems enterprise in a bid to curtail the military junta’s ability to generate revenues. The move is the latest from the Biden administration targeting the generals.Myanma Gems Enterprise, part of the country’s vital mining ministry, has been placed on the treasury department’s special designated nationals list, the statement said.Also, the Myanmar military arrested leading actor, model and heartthrob Paing Takhon in a dawn raid at his mother’s home in Yangon.

The talks are part of a four-point plan outlined in a letter sent by US secretary of state Antony Blinken to President Ashraf Ghani in February.“The US should adopt a conditions-based approach with the Taliban and not a time-bound approach. The agreement signed by the Trump administration imposed conditions with huge consequences on the Afghan side, which wasn’t even party to the agreement signed last year,” one of the people cited above said. “More time is needed to address the security situation and anyway, the Afghan forces are now in the lead in the operations being conducted on the ground.”The Afghan side believes there has been no change in the attitude of the Taliban, which is behind assassinations and bombings that have claimed scores of lives. “The Taliban have also not cut their links with al-Qaeda or other foreign groups operating in Afghanistan as they were required to do under the agreement with the US,” said the second person.“The removal of sanctions and other restrictions on the Taliban has also reduced the leverage that can be used against them,” the first person added. The US also plans to ask the UN to convene a meeting of the foreign ministers of India, Russia, China, Pakistan, Iran and US to forge a unified approach for a settlement in Afghanistan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-advised-not-to-rush-afghanistan-peace-settlement-101617936077144.html

Brazil's outbreak is spiraling out of control, with vaccines in short supply and Bolsonaro fighting lockdowns.The public healthcare system has shown growing signs of buckling under the caseload, and a survey by the National Association of Private Hospitals (ANAHP) this week suggests even the richest hospitals are running short on critical medicine.Three out of four private hospitals said they have a week or less of supplies for treating Covid-19, including oxygen, anesthesia and essential drugs for intubation, according to the ANAHP survey of 88 member hospitals across Brazil.Bolsonaro's government has minimized the risk of hospitals running out of medicine, as the right-wing leader tries to allay fears of the virus, while railing against state and local efforts to restrict movement."Let's not cry over spilled milk. We're still going through a pandemic that, in part, is being used politically - not to defeat the virus but to bring down the president," Bolsonaro said in a public address on Wednesday. "In what country on earth do people not die? Unfortunately, people die everywhere."Brazil's Senate plans to set up a special committee next week to investigate the government's response to the pandemic, Senate President Rodrigo Pacheco said.A Supreme Court judge ruled on Thursday that the Senate must proceed with installing the committee, which Pacheco had sought to delay despite already having been approved by a sufficient number of senators.While stating he would comply with the court order, Pacheco said it was too early to investigate while Brazil was still dealing with the crisis and that the committee would put members' health at risk as its meetings are held in-person.More than 345,000 people have died of Covid-19 in Brazil, making it the second-deadliest outbreak after the United States, whose population is about 50% greater at about 330 million.Brazil's Supreme Court also ruled on Thursday that state and municipal bans on religious gatherings were legal, in a blow to Bolsonaro, who has called them an attack on religious freedom.As Brazil suffers the worst of the pandemic, the country has become a testing ground for new vaccines.Health regulator Anvisa on Thursday approved the fifth late-stage trial for a coronavirus vaccine, greenlighting a study by Canada's Medicago R&D Inc and GlaxoSmithKline PLC .Anvisa said the companies were authorized to conduct phase 3 trials in Brazil. The companies are recruiting around 3,500 Brazilian volunteers for the study, which will include some 30,000 people, in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Latin America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-sets-record-daily-covid-19-deaths-bolsonaro-s-government-to-face-probe-101617933008613.html

A total of 31.8 million people across the United Kingdom have had at least one dose, while 6.1 million people have had two.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-rollout-in-england-prevented-10-400-deaths-by-march-end-study-101617933025463.html

So this is not undermining what the regulators are saying. The regulators are saying this vaccine is suitable for all age groups but it's up to the individual countries to decide how best to deploy those vaccines," he told Reuters in an interview.While Britain's MHRA medicine regulator did not place age restrictions on the use of the AstraZeneca shot, some saw the JCVI's advice about under-30s, made in the same briefing, as mixed messaging.Conservative lawmaker Iain Duncan Smith said the announcement was "ridiculous" and that there was "the dangerous potential" that people would refuse to have AstraZeneca's shot.Health minister Matt Hancock defended the move, saying the transparency over possible side effects, even very rare ones, should bolster confidence in the system.Britain has continued to use its homegrown AstraZeneca vaccine since it became the first country to start rolling it out at the start of January. Some countries in Europe, including France, restricted its use in older people initially, citing a lack of data, and are now limiting its use in older people.Harnden said Wednesday's announcement had not been taken lightly and it had been right to keep using the shot, even if the advice was now changing."Stopping and starting and changing vaccination programmes is not an easy thing to do, and if you do it, it runs the danger of losing confidence in that programme," he said.Still on trackBritain is leaning on AstraZeneca for a large portion of its vaccine supply, with 100 million doses ordered.But it has also has been rolling out vaccines made by Pfizer, since December, and Moderna since Wednesday. Shots made by Johnson & Johnson and Novavax are also pending regulatory approval in the coming months.Hancock said that with 40 million Pfizer and 17 million Moderna vaccines ordered, there was more than enough shots to cover the 8.5 million people under-30s who needed to be vaccinated. Healthy under-30s are in the last priority cohort to be vaccinated, with most not eligible until the summer."We feel that we've got enough vaccine supply to be able to offer (an) alternative vaccine, without delaying the progress of our immunisations," JCVI's Harnden said, adding Britain was on track to give a first shot of vaccine to all adults by the end of July."It may slip by a week or two, but no more than that," he said.The advice did not change for under-30s who have underlying conditions and are eligible for shots now, meaning only very few people who are due to have a shot in the coming days will be affected by the advice change.Alison Astles, a pharmacist whose 59-year-old brother died of a blood clot on the brain on Sunday, encouraged people to still get their AstraZeneca shots even though it was "very strongly suggested" his death was due to the shot."The sister in me still feels absolutely furious and very angry that this has happened to my brother... But despite what has happened to Neil, and the impact on our family, I still strongly believe that people should go ahead and have the vaccine," she said."Overall, we will save more lives by people having the vaccine than not."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/britain-reassures-on-astrazeneca-after-advising-under-30s-take-other-vaccines-101617929115528.html
09-04-2021||World||Iran says talks switch to lifting US sanctions in one step||Iran’s chief negotiator at nuclear talks in Vienna said the sides were focusing on removing US sanctions in a single step, in a statement of progress that didn’t specify what Tehran was offering in return.“We are negotiating the removal of sanctions all at once, specifying which sanctions and how, their details. All of these have to be precisely clarified,” Abbas Araghchi, who’s leading Iran’s team of negotiators, said on Thursday.The U.S. has so far ruled out unilaterally removing sanctions in order to get Iran to return to enrichment parameters set by the 2015 agreement. The Islamic Republic says Washington must move first as it was the party that abrogated the deal.In Washington, State Department spokesman Ned Price declined to respond directly to the Iranian claim but said the Biden administration’s position remains that the U.S. will remove sanctions only after Iran returns to compliance with the nuclear deal. He said the response “would include lifting sanctions that are inconsistent” with the nuclear accord but declined to say whether that would encompass removing sanctions tied to what the U.S. considers Iran’s support of terrorism.At the same time, Price said the discussions had made progress.“These talks have been constructive,” he said. “Maximalist demands probably are not going to get us very far.”After former President Donald Trump broke away from the landmark nuclear deal and imposed a tough sanctions regime on Iran’s economy in 2018, the Islamic Republic started to gradually increase its activity beyond the limits defined in the agreement.Iran, the European Union, China, Russia and the U.S. have gathered in the Austrian capital to try to end a crisis over the deal’s future, and are scheduled to reconvene on Friday. Iran and the U.S. have said they will not have any direct discussions or contact during the negotiations.“In our view, America has to take its actions in one step, then we’ll verify, and then Iran will follow with its own actions,” Araghchi said. “How verification will happen is another point of our discussion.”This week, India expressed interest in resuming oil imports from Iran once sanctions are eased, with refiners starting to prepare for that possibility, according to a senior oil ministry representative. China, meanwhile, has boosted its purchases from the nation to about 1 million barrels a day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-talks-switch-to-lifting-us-sanctions-in-one-step-101617928440398.html

The shooting happened in the bays in a plant where employees make cabinets.Buske said a motive in the shooting was not clear.The shooter was gone by the time officers arrived, Buske said.Grimes County Sheriff Don Sowell said a male suspect in the shooting was arrested in the tiny town of Iola, about 30 miles (48 kilometers) away from the cabinet plant.The state trooper who was shot while pursuing the suspect was is in serious but stable condition, the Texas Department of Public Safety said on Twitter.Kent Moore Cabinets employees were being interviewed, Bryan Police Lt. Jason James said earlier, and witnesses had identified a suspect. Police were looking for the suspected shooter, James said, but he could not describe that person.“At this site, when law enforcement showed up it was already over with,” James said.The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives has sent agents and dogs to the scene of the shooting, said spokesman Deon Washington.Police asked people to stay away from the business during the investigation.Bryan is about 100 miles (160 kilometers) northwest of Houston that sits on the doorstep of Texas A&M University. The city of more than 86,000 residents is a market, industrial and medical center for the middle Brazos River valley with a economy centered on the university in adjacent College Station and its related agribusiness; computers, research and development. It also is the seat of Brazos County.Kent Moore Cabinets is headquartered in Bryan and employs more than 600 people across the state, according to the company’s website. The company makes custom cabinets and has design centers in neighboring College Station and nearly a dozen Texas cities.A person who answered the phone Thursday at Kent Moore Cabinets’ headquarters said she could not provide any information on the shooting.Texas Gov. Greg Abbott offered prayers for shooting victims and their families.“I have been working closely with the Texas Department of Public Safety and the Texas Rangers as they assist local law enforcement on a swift response to this criminal act.

Once the doses are produced, it is up to each member state to administer the vaccines, Breton said, adding that he was in contact with all EU countries who are "doing the right things" to make sure people will get vaccinated.He said that he had confidence in the AstraZeneca vaccine, saying it is a "good vaccine," adding, it's "extremely important that all of our fellow citizens understand that we are extremely cautious...and when we give it (a vaccine) the green light, we can go."On the subject of whether the bloc would use Russia's Sputnik V vaccine, he said the approval was in the hands of European medical regulators. But he said even if it was approved, it wouldn't change the situation in Europe immediately."Our citizens believed maybe at the beginning that you order and you get, the following day, the vaccine. No, it doesn't happen like that, you need at least 10 to 12 months to transform the facility to adapt to the vaccine. When it will be approved, you will need maybe another 10 months," he explained.According to the World Health Organization's dashboard, as many as 46,694,768 Covid-19 cases have been confirmed in Europe.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-on-track-for-herd-immunity-from-covid-19-by-mid-july-says-vaccine-chief-101617925168423.html

09-04-2021||World||‘It’s an epidemic’: US President Joe Biden announces gun control rules||US President Joe Biden on Thursday announced limited gun control reforms through six actions in the aftermath of three deadly mass shootings -- including the killing of Asian Americans in Atlanta and shoppers at a grocery store in Colorado in recent months -- calling the divisive issue an “epidemic and an international embarrassment”.“Gun violence in this country is an epidemic. We say it again, gun violence in this country is an epidemic,” Biden said at a White House event to announce the executive actions, in the presence of survivors of gun violence and relatives of victims. “And it’s an international embarrassment,” he added.The Justice Department will be required to propose a rule within the next 30 days to stop the proliferation of “ghost guns” that are bought in parts and can be assembled into a weapon within 30 minutes, according to one of the actions.The next will ask the Justice Department to announce a rule that will subject stabilisation braces, which can turn pistols into mini rifles, to registration under the more stringent National Firearms Act. Authorities say the suspect in the Boulder, Colorado, shootings last month -- in which 10 people were killed -- used a pistol with an arm brace that made the weapon more stable and accurate.The Justice Department will also be required to publish a model “red flag” legislation for states, allowing for a person to be denied access to firearms if petitioned by family members or police. The remaining two actions called for increased investment in evidence-based community violence intervention and the publication of an annual report on firearm trafficking, which has not been done since 2000.But Thursday’s announcement underscores the limitations of Biden’s executive power to act on guns. His orders tighten regulations on homemade guns and provide more resources for gun-violence prevention but fall far short of the sweeping gun-control agenda he laid out on the campaign trail.These actions also do not address the issue of assault rifles, which have been used most commonly in mass shootings in the US.The President is backing a legislation passed recently by the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives that seeks to expand background checks for gun deals, cover transactions made on the internet, and close certain loopholes in the current laws.He called for the passage of the bill on Thursday.“This is not a partisan issue among the American people,” Biden insisted.“Every day in this country 360 people are shot, every single day 106 of them die, every day,” Biden said, reeling off numbers. “Our flag was still flying at half-staff for the victims of the horrific murder, primarily Asian American people in Georgia … 10 more lives were taken in a mass murder in Colorado.”A gunman last month killed eight people, including six Asian women, at spas during a string of shootings in the Atlanta area.“You probably didn’t hear between those points in less than one week apart more than 850 additional shootings; 850, that took the lives of more than 250 people and left 500 injured. This is an epidemic, for God’s sake, and it has to stop,” he said.While Biden asserted that he’s “willing to work with anyone to get it done,” gun control measures face slim prospects in an evenly divided Senate, where Republicans remain near-unified against most proposals.Biden announced the measures alongside Vice President Kamala Harris and Merrick Garland, who Biden said would prioritise gun violence as head of the Department of Justice.“We’ve had more tragedy than we can bear,” Harris said, adding: “People on both sides of the aisle want action .... So all that is left is the will and the courage to act.”The US has experienced a significant number of deadly mass shootings at schools and other public venues for decades. Nearly 40,000 Americans die each year from shootings.The US Constitution’s Second Amendment protects the right to bear arms, and state attempts to limit who can buy guns or how they can carry them have been challenged in court by pro-gun lobby groups.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/its-an-epidemic-us-president-joe-biden-announces-gun-control-rules-101617918283845.html
09-04-2021||India||New Delhi hopes trade pact talks will resume at India-EU Summit||New Delhi India on Friday expressed the hope that negotiations with the European Union (EU) on trade and investment agreements will resume at the India-EU Summit to be held in Portugal next month.This was conveyed by the Indian side during a virtual summit between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Dutch counterpart Mark Rutte. The two sides also agreed to upgrade their joint working group on water to the ministerial level and to launch a “strategic partnership in water”. India and EU member states have decided to launch negotiations on separate trade and investment pacts as both sides believe it will be easier to finalise an agreement on investments, while contentious issues related to market access will take more time to be addressed. The EU is also keen to a predictable investment regime as individual agreements with most European states have already lapsed. “The India-EU Summit was discussed, and we expressed the hope that in the summit in Porto, there will be resumption of negotiations for the India-EU trade agreement and the investment agreement,” Sandeep Chakravorty, joint secretary (Europe West) in the external affairs ministry, told a briefing after the summit. “The Dutch prime minister was appreciative of this and said it is important both India and the EU have these agreements in place to incentivise more trade and investments,” he said, adding that the Netherlands is the third largest investor in India and an important player in the EU. On the bilateral front, Modi and Rutte agreed to launch a “strategic partnership on water” in view of strong synergies between the water-related challenges of India and the expertise of the Netherlands, and to elevate the joint working group on water to the ministerial level. The Netherlands is seen as a world leader in water use and management, especially in flood control, inland waterways and waste water recycling. The two leaders also reviewed the ongoing bilateral projects under the Namami-Gange Programme and discussed upcoming joint interventions in projects such as “Water as Leverage” in selected towns in the Ganga Basin and a pilot project on pollution and waste management in a textile industrial cluster in Panipat. The Netherlands, France and Germany have already adopted Indo-Pacific policies and are working to help the EU frame its strategy for the region. Chakravorty quoted Rutte as saying that India will have a critical role in any Indo-Pacific strategy. Rutte also said a Dutch frigate will sail to the Indo-Pacific in the coming months and exercise with the Indian Navy. Covid-19-related cooperation and vaccines were also discussed in detail by the two leaders and Rutte appreciated India’s role in supplying personal protective equipment (PPE), pharmaceuticals and vaccines to other countries. Rutte also noted that an Indian company was present in the Netherlands to set up a European vaccine hub. The Serum Institute of India, the world’s largest vaccine manufacturer, acquired Bilthoven Biologicals of the Netherlands in 2012, and is currently working to make this a hub for vaccine manufacturing. “The two sides favour a well-balanced trade system in pharmaceutical products. Patients and industry have an interest in securing transparent, open and predictable supply chains, and avoiding critical dependencies in active pharmaceuticals and in formulations,” said a joint statement issued after the summit.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-delhi-hopes-trade-pact-talks-will-resume-at-india-eu-summit-101617992895413.html
09-04-2021||India||CBI books former TMC Rajya Sabha MP KD Singh for cheating investors||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has filed a case against former Trinamool Congress (TMC) Rajya Sabha Member of Parliament --- K D Singh and others for allegedly cheating investors by promising villas/plots/apartments through his companies - Alchemist Infra Realty Limited and Alchemist Township Limited, people familiar with the development said. The case was earlier registered by the Uttar Pradesh Police in 2019, which has been handed over to the central agency for further investigation. Earlier this week, a Delhi court granted bail to KD Singh in a money laundering probe of the Enforcement Directorate, which arrested him on January 13 this year. His company is also under investigation for Ponzi scheme irregularities worth over ₹1,900 crore. The ED had, in September 2019, attached his properties worth over ₹230 crore under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). In the latest case, registered on Friday, CBI has claimed that K D Singh, through his two companies cheated 291 residents of Kanpur by making false promises of allotment of plots/villas/apartments. However, the investors neither got any plot/villa nor their received back their money, according to the FIR. The ED probe against Singh and a firm linked to him (Ms Alchemist Infra Realty Limited) dates back to September, 2016 when it filed a criminal case under the PMLA taking cognisance of a charge sheet filed against the company, its directors and others by market regulator SEBI.“Investigation revealed that the proceeds of crime generated by Alchemist Infra Realty Ltd were laundered through the web of companies. Investigations also revealed that the funds mobilised by the firm from various investors were never utilised for the purpose for which they were collected and the same were transferred to bank accounts of other group companies which were mainly paper companies from where they were systematically siphoned off by the accused and used to purchase properties at various locations in the country. All such assets in Punjab, Haryana, Shimla and bank accounts in HDFC Bank worth ₹239.39 crore identified during the course of investigations have been provisionally attached,” the ED said in a statement in January 2019. It has been alleged by the probe agencies that the company launched an illegal collective investment scheme, also called a ponzi or chit fund scheme, and mobilised funds of about ₹1,916 crore from the public in the years preceding 2015. The firm allegedly launched the scheme “without the approval” of the SEBI and led to cheating of gullible investors.K D Singh or his legal representative could not be located for comments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-books-former-tmc-rajya-sabha-mp-kd-singh-for-cheating-investors-101617991275262.html
09-04-2021||India||Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, Assam issues guidelines to celebrate Rongali Bihu||Amid an increase in Covid-19 cases, Assam on Friday issued standard operating procedures (SOPs) to celebrate Rongali Bihu, the Assamese New Year, which begins next week. The order issued by the health and family welfare department stated that the guidelines would be applicable to other occasions like Ram Navami, Ramzan etc. to “ensure people are able to celebrate their much-loved festivals with joy and gusto, simultaneously adhering to Covid-19 protocols”. Rongali or Bohag Bihu, starts in the middle of April and celebrations continue for several weeks, mainly concentrated in cultural functions held all over the state where thousands gather. Last year, the celebrations didn’t take place due to the Covid-19 enforced lockdown. Friday’s order directed all event organizers to seek permission to hold functions and inform about the capacity of the places where the events would be held and how many people are expected to take part. All organizers and volunteers involved with the functions will have to get themselves tested for Covid-19 three days prior to and also after the event. The event sites should be spacious kept open from all sides and there should be adequate space for social distancing among audience at the venues. There should be multiple entry and exit points and organizers must take measures to prevent overcrowding. All visitors as well as participants are to be screened for fever using thermal scanners and anyone having high temperatures should be directed to the nearest Covid-19 testing facility. Use of face masks is mandatory at the venues and the organizers should keep hand sanitizers at the entry points and parking areas. The venues should be sanitized twice-once before the event and again after it is over. On Thursday, Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma stated that the government won’t enforce lockdown or night curfew and people would be allowed to celebrate Rongali Bihu this year. On Thursday, 245 fresh cases of Covid-19 infection were detected across Assam—the highest figure this year. At present, there are 1023 active Covid-19 cases in the state. In view of the increase in Covid-19 cases in other states, the state government has made it mandatory for all passengers arriving from Mumbai and Bengaluru to undergo tests at airports and railway stations.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-assam-issues-guidelines-to-celebrate-rongali-bihu-101617981554519.html

09-04-2021||India||Ask them first: Ravi Shankar Prasad hits back at Rahul over vaccine letter||Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Friday launched a scathing attack on Rahul Gandhi after the Congress leader wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi asking him to allow states to have a greater say in the procurement and distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. In a series of tweets, Prasad also called Rahul Gandhi a part-time politician and a ‘lobbyist’ for pharmaceutical companies. “First he lobbied for fighter plane companies by trying to derail India’s acquisition programme. Now he is lobbying for pharma companies by asking for arbitrary approvals for foreign vaccines,” Prasad wrote on Twitter.Fighting a pandemic is not a one trick game. Apart from vaccination, there needs to be adequate focus on testing, tracing & treating. Rahul Gandhi’s problem is that he doesn’t understand all this and his ignorance is compounded by his arrogance.Prasad then asked Gandhi to stop Congress-led governments in states from stalling the Centre’s vaccination programme. “Rahul Gandhi must know that shortage in Congress ruled states is not of vaccines but of basic commitment towards health care. He should write to his party’s governments to stop their vasooli ventures and concentrate on administering the lakhs of vaccines they are sitting upon,” he further added.India is not facing vaccine starvation but Shri Gandhi is facing attention starvation. Why has Rahul Gandhi not yet taken vaccine?Is it an oversight or he doesnt want it or has he already taken one in many of his undisclosed trips to foreign locations but doesnt want to disclose?The Union minister also questioned the 50-year-old Gandhi for not getting vaccinated. “Why has Rahul Gandhi not yet taken the vaccine? Is it an oversight or he does not want it or has he already taken one during many of his undisclosed trips to foreign locations but doesn't want to disclose?” Prasad asked. Gandhi had visited his grandmother in Italy in December, a day ahead of the Congress Foundation Day, which was also criticised by BJP leaders.Gandhi in his letter to the Prime Minister also sought fast-track approval of other Covid-19 vaccines. He also took a jibe at PM Modi, saying that the vaccination drive should focus on guaranteeing maximum vaccination rather than putting an ‘individual’s picture on the vaccine certificate.’ He also criticised the decision to export vaccines to other nations calling it an ‘oversight.’Several states in the past weeks have complained that they are facing a vaccine shortage. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that the state has 14 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccine which would only last for three days. On the same day, Karnataka health minister Dr K Sudhakar said that he requested the Centre to provide more Covid-19 vaccines in order to control the spread of the coronavirus disease, news agency ANI reported. Sudhakar later clarified that the state is not running short on vaccines on April 8.Andhra Pradesh’s Nellore and West Godavari districts also faced a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines, people familiar with the developments told news agency ANI on Thursday. Jharkhand health minister Banna Gupta and Odisha chief minister Naveen Pattnaik also highlighted vaccine shortages in their respective states.Union minister for health Harsh Vardhan and Union home minister Amit Shah rubbished reports of vaccine shortage, highlighting that all states have received an equal number of doses. Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said that the alarm raised by several states regarding vaccine shortages were attempts to hide their incompetence with connection to conducting inoculation drives. “Hue and cry by certain states about partisanship by the Union government is just a farce, an attempt to hide their own incompetence. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are 2 of the top 3 states based on allocation of Covid-19 vaccine doses,” Harsh Vardhan said in a tweet.The Union health ministry said that more than 9.43 crore (in millions) people have been vaccinated against Covid-19 so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ask-them-first-ravi-shankar-prasad-hits-back-at-rahul-over-vaccine-letter-101617979138632.html

09-04-2021||India||India conveys concern over US Navy’s ‘freedom of navigation’ operation in EEZ||India said on Friday it had conveyed its concerns to the US over an American warship transiting through the country’s exclusive economic zone (EEZ) without prior consent in what was described by the US Navy as a “freedom of navigation operation”.Though the US Navy has conducted similar operations in Indian waters in recent years, they were not publicised, as it happened in the case of the latest operation on April 7. The US Navy’s 7th Fleet issued a press release that said the freedom of navigation operation (FONOP) by the guided missile destroyer USS John Paul Jones “upheld the rights, freedoms, and lawful uses of the sea recognised in international law by challenging India’s excessive maritime claims”.The strongly worded US Navy release didn’t go down well with the defence ministry or the external affairs ministry, especially at a time when the US and India are working jointly to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific through forums such as the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, people familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity.“The USS John Paul Jones was continuously monitored transiting from the Persian Gulf towards the Malacca Straits. We have conveyed our concerns regarding this passage through our EEZ to the government of USA through diplomatic channels,” the external affairs ministry said in a statement.The Indian government’s stated position on the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is that the convention “does not authorise other states to carry out in the Exclusive Economic Zone and on the continental shelf, military exercises or manoeuvres, in particular those involving the use of weapons or explosives, without the consent of the coastal state”, the statement said.The US Navy’s release said USS John Paul Jones “asserted navigational rights and freedoms approximately 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands, inside India’s exclusive economic zone, without requesting India’s prior consent, consistent with international law”.The release noted that India’s position on prior consent for military exercises or manoeuvres in its EEZ or continental shelf was “inconsistent with international law”. It further said the US Navy conducts routine and regular FONOPs and will continue to do so in future, and that such operations “are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements”.The 7th Fleet is the largest of the US Navy’s forward deployed fleets. The US had sent elements of the 7th Fleet to the Bay of Bengal to pressure India during the 1971 war with Pakistan that ended with the liberation of Bangladesh.Every coastal country’s EEZ extends to 200 nautical miles (370 km) from its shores and the country has exclusive rights to all resources in the water, including oil, natural gas and fish. Any military activity in the EEZ requires India’s permission, navy officials said, asking not to be named.“If you have to do anything in our EEZ, you have to notify us and take permission,” Indian Navy chief Admiral Karambir Singh had said in 2019 after a Chinese vessel was repelled after intruding into Indian waters near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.Former navy chief Admiral (retired) Arun Prakash tweeted: “FoN ops by USN ships (ineffective as they may be) in South China Sea, are meant to convey a message to China that the putative EEZ around the artificial SCS islands is an ‘excessive maritime claim.’ But what is the 7th Fleet message for India?”He added in another tweet, “There is irony here. While India ratified UN Law of the Seas in 1995, the US has failed to do it so far. For the 7th Fleet to carry out FoN missions in Indian EEZ in violation of our domestic law is bad enough. But publicising it? USN please switch on IFF (Identification friend-or-foe)!”The development came at a time when the navies of India and the US have just concluded multilateral drills in the eastern Indian Ocean. France, India, the US, Japan and Australia carried out complex maritime drills in the region to enhance interoperability among their navies during April 5-7.The US defence department’s annual freedom of navigation reports posted online show that US warships had conducted “freedom of navigation challenges” in India’s EEZ in 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2019. These operations were conducted mainly to challenge India’s “excessive maritime claims”, the reports said. However, no press releases were issued at the time to publicise these operations.In a statement issued on March 10 along with the freedom of navigation report for 2020, the US defence department said American forces “operationally challenged 28 different excessive maritime claims made by 19 different claimants throughout the world”. India wasn’t among the countries listed in the 2020 report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-conveys-concern-over-us-navy-s-freedom-of-navigation-operation-in-eez-101617975852220.html

The calves---two females and a male--- are being taken from the Centre for Wildlife Rehabilitation and Conservation (CWRC) near KNPTR where they were kept for the past two years to their new home at MTR located nearly 300 km away. The translocation is part of an ongoing effort to increase wildlife at MTR, a national park, which was ravaged for nearly two decades due to insurgent activities and rampant poaching. The two females were rescued by the forest department and Wildlife Trust of India (WTI) personnel from Hatimura (Biswanath- North Bank) and Kuthuri areas whereas the male was rescued from Solmara during the Kaziranga floods that hit in July-August 2019. “These rhino calves have undergone a protocol of rehabilitation for two years before they are trans-located to MTR. On Friday, all three had health check-ups and markings done before they were loaded in individual crates for the translocation,” said a WTI release. The convoy is expected to reach MTR in the early hours of Saturday for the scheduled release of the animals in their dedicated enclosure, where they will be kept for a stipulated period for habituation before their final release in the wilderness of the reserve. “It is the right time to release them, as the calves will be developing horns. The intra-state rhino translocation will help in improving the gene pool and give respite from any epidemics in future,” P Sivakumar, director, KNPTR. Till date 19 rhinos have been trans-located to MTR since 2006 taking the rhino population in the reserve to 44 at present. “The release of flood-rescued and rehabilitated rhinos into MTR is a part of the long-term project where the trans-located rhinos have bred, and their progeny have added to the rhino population of the reserve,” the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/3-rhino-calves-rescued-during-floods-at-kaziranga-to-be-shifted-to-manas-tiger-reserve-101617974352328.html

Even the younger generation should be vaccinated. All above the age of 18 years should be given the vaccine," Rane told reporters here.He said the state government would reach out to all village panchayats as part of its mass vaccination programme and asked elected representatives to help give a boost to the initiative.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remove-age-limits-in-covid-19-vaccination-goa-health-minister-101617970959521.html

"My thoughts are with the British people and the Royal Family on the passing away of HRH The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. He had a distinguished career in the military and was at the forefront of many community service initiatives. May his soul rest in peace," PM Modi tweeted.Buckingham Palace announced the death of Prince Philip. He was 99. His death came just months before his 100th birthday in June. "It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty The Queen announces the death of her beloved husband, His Royal Highness The Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh. His Royal Highness passed away peacefully this morning at Windsor Castle. Further announcements will be made in due course. The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss,” the palace said in a statement.The duke had been admitted to the King Edward VII Hospital in London on February 17 after feeling unwell. On March 1, he was transferred to St Bartholomew's Hospital, also in London, where doctors continued to treat the infection as well as undertake testing for a pre-existing heart condition. After heart surgery, the duke was discharged from the hospital in mid-March.The couple had been living largely in isolation at Windsor Castle because their advanced age put them at heightened risk from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). Prince Philip and the queen received their first vaccinations against Covid-19 in January. Prince Philip was married to Queen Elizabeth II for more than 70 years and became the longest-serving consort in British history.(With inputs from agencies)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/may-his-soul-rest-in-peace-pm-modi-condoles-prince-philip-s-death-101617969233874.html
09-04-2021||India||Not even fear of Covid-19 can disrupt protest, say agitating farmers||The alarming rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi notwithstanding, farmer leaders on Thursday said that nothing, not even the fear of coronavirus, can disrupt their protest against the agri laws.Over the past four months, the farmers have managed to keep their agitation going, withstanding extreme cold, rains, and heat.They devised many ways to deal with these issues - for cold there was ample supply of winter wear, for rain they elevated their beds, and to prepare for the heat, they have started building houses, and arranging for ACs, coolers and fans.Tackling the second wave of Covid-19 won't be very different for them, they said, adding they are prepared with certain basic precautions in place."We have been making announcements from the stage at the Singhu border about the necessity of wearing masks, and washing hands frequently. We are also encouraging the protestors to get vaccinated," said Lakhbir Singh, vice president (Punjab) of All India Kisan Sabha.With multiple health camps at these protest sites, immediate medical assistance is always at the farmers' disposal in case a protestor develops symptoms like fever or breathlessness."If somebody has fever or cold, or any other Covid-like symptoms, then the doctors here take a call. The patient is either admitted to a hospital, or sent back to their village for 8-10 days," said Jagmohan Singh, general secretary of the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Dakaunda).On Friday, India registered a record single-day spike of 1,31,968 new COVID-19 cases. Delhi too, recorded 7,437 fresh cases in its highest single-day spike this year, with the capital's death roll reaching 11,157 on Thursday.According to Swaraj India president Yogendra Yadav, farmers do treat the pandemic with a "certain indifference", but also pointed out that none of the protest sites were Covid-19 hotspots either, making it difficult to challenge the farmers' attitude."If you would notice, each of these places has doctors, clinics. They are not doing Covid testing, but if many people are reporting fever and so on, they would get to know because qualified doctors are there in every single morcha."Some of them have proper hospitals. If there was a surge in fever and breathlessness that would have been noticed immediately," he said.He added that while the habit of wearing masks and washing hands was being cultivated among the farmers, "distancing has not worked", which, he added, was true for most places in the country."Farmers are just like any ordinary Indian citizen… they are just about as careful as other citizens are, or about as careless, as most Indian citizens are," Yadav said.One of the major threats that seems to loom over the farmers movement with the rising number of Covid-19 cases, is the repeat of what happened to the Shaheen Bagh protest last year - they were forced to end the agitation fearing the spread of the disease.This year, Yadav said, however, the situation was different."That time, there was a sense of doom, a sense of 'you don't know what would happen' with corona. It was just the beginning… we didn't know anything at that point."Now, that unspecified sense of doom is not there, and therefore, while at that time the government could use that as a pretext to get the protestors to move away, using that now would be utterly cynical," he said.He added that if the government uses the coronavirus as an excuse to remove the protesting farmers, it would only expose their "hypocrisy" with the election campaigning underway in West Bengal."In that case they should ban election campaigning in Bengal. The first thing they should do is to ban BJP's own rallies, where the home minister is addressing the crowds. The hypocrisy of that would obviously be seen," Yadav said.Thousands of farmers from different parts of the country have been protesting against the three farm laws since the last week of November, 2020.While the government has been projecting these laws as major agricultural reforms, farmers have expressed apprehension that the move would lead to the elimination of the Minimum Support Price system, and leave them at the mercy of big corporates.Ask Paramjit Singh if the farmers are afraid of contracting the disease that has already claimed over 1.6 lakh lives in the country, and he said, "what choice do we have?""Our lives are already on the line. We were afraid of the biting cold, and are afraid of the heat that awaits us, so yes we are afraid of the disease but there is no other option."We are taking precautions at individual levels by wearing masks and avoiding shaking hands with people, but the movement has to and will continue," the Bhartiya Kisan Union (Lakhowal) Punjab general secretary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-even-fear-of-covid-19-can-disrupt-protest-say-agitating-farmers-101617968732476.html
09-04-2021||India||How EC is dealing with grievances during state assembly polls||From exchange of money and other freebies to tampering of electronic voting machines (EVMs) and the use of foul language, the Election Commission (EC) has dealt with representations from several political parties and citizens to ensure free and fair polls in the states of Kerala, Assam, Tamil Nadu and the Union Territory of Puducherry that concluded on April 6, and in West Bengal, where five phases of polling remain. The results of the state polls will be declared on May 2. Of all the states, Kerala, which received 161,579 complaints, has managed to resolve most at the state level, with the intervention of the Commission not being required, while the Union Territory of Puducherry, which saw 1,341 complaints, also settled them at the chief electoral officer (CEO) level. EC received 5,879 complaints from Tamil Nadu, of which only 27 are pending redressal. The number of complaints in Assam was 1,374, but at least two of them were escalated to the Commission. There have been over 19,582 complaints with regard to West Bengal, of which 15,763 have been found valid and 99 cases are pending. According to an EC official familiar with the matter, these polls have witnessed fewer complaints than those held in 2016. “The number of complaints has been fewer this time,” said the official. “Take Bengal for instance, the number of cases of political violence have been lesser than the ones that took place in 2016.” HT on March 3 reported that the Commission decided to hold an eight-phase election in West Bengal on the basis of a report made by central agencies regarding political violence in West Bengal. KeralaOf the 161,549 complaints, the state managed to resolve 158,258 valid complaints, with only 78 still pending. These include campaigning during the ban, property defacement, religious or communal messages and transportation of voters on polling day. Posters placed without permission made a bulk of the cases in Kerala. A second EC official said that the large number of cases in Kerala was also due to individual grievances being more promptly expressed. Also Read | EC sends notice to Mamata Banerjee over ‘central forces’ remarkA third EC official, familiar with Kerala, said that as few as 20 major complaints were received in the state and most of these were resolved at the state level and did not need to be escalated to the Commission in New Delhi. “Traditionally, the people of Kerala are more law-abiding,” the official said. “The Commission ensured that the official machinery was impartial and neutral. An atmosphere was created wherein it was ensured that all the laws of the land were obeyed.”The official added the few complaints received were regarding foul language used against a candidate or personal insults. Very few complaints regarding the use of money or muscle power were received. “Money is not that big an issue in Kerala,” the official said. “The seizures were also higher than last time, leading to a sense of fear and reducing the number of cases.” He added that complaints related to violence were practically non-existent. “There have also been no complaints related to EVM-tampering. The only slightly major complaint received was regarding duplication of entries in the voters list and that was swiftly resolved.”The poll management in Kerala has drawn a contrasting response from the state’s ruling and Opposition parties. “Booth capturing and bogus voting was rampant in some of the party villages in north Kerala. Besides this, we made a fresh compliant to the EC on postal votes. We have information that many postal votes were cast by officials who have allegiance to Left service unions,” said state Opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala of the Congress.But the ruling Left has rejected his contention. “The Opposition leader makes wild allegations twice a day, one in the morning and another in the evening. The latest [complaint] is also part of this. The Congress is worried over its impending defeat, so it is natural for him to make such charges,” said Communist Party of India (Marxist), or CPI(M), acting secretary A Vijayaraghvan.Tamil Nadu In Tamil Nadu, EC has received 5,879 complaints, of which only 27 are pending to be addressed. There were more miscellaneous complaints in Tamil Nadu, followed by grievances over the alleged distribution of money and gifts/coupons. Also Read | Bengal: EC sends notice to BJP’s Suvendu Adhikari for ‘hate speech’ in NandigramIn the most prominent complaint, the Commission took action against Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam leader A Raja and removed him as a star campaigner and barred him from campaigning for 48 hours for making derogatory comments against Tamil Nadu chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami. Raja made a controversial remark about Palaniswami’s mother during an election rally on Saturday and was served a show-cause notice by the poll body on Tuesday. EC said that it is of the view that the “contents of the speech made by you are not only derogatory, but also obscene and lower the dignity of motherhood of women, which seems to be a serious violation of the provisions of Model Code of Conduct”.The Opposition has alleged that the EC did not act against violations by the ruling dispensation. “Money distribution was organised in Tamil Nadu polls by the ruling party and EC turned just spectator,” Congress MP Manickam Tagore said. “EC has lost more credibility than it gained.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s CT Ravi, who is the party in-charge of Tamil Nadu, dismissed the allegations. “The Election Commission has done an excellent job of conducting a free and fair election in Tamil Nadu. It identified 105 expenditure sensitive constituencies and deployed 118 expenditure observers to monitor expenditure by candidates as well as parties. The EC ensured that nearly 60 officers and 3 IGs were transferred. This proves its impartiality.” He added, “The Congress will always find mistakes with others. Earlier it had problems with the judiciary and EVMs. Today it is blaming the Election Commission by making baseless allegations.”AssamIn Assam, of the 1,374 complaints, 411 were dropped, while 961 were found valid. These include complaints regarding liquor distribution, money distribution, paid news, display of firearms, intimidation and religious or communal speeches or messages. Two complaints are yet to be addressed. In the most prominent case, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Himanta Biswa Sarma was reprimanded for a violation of the model code of conduct based on a complaint lodged by Congress on March 30 in which it alleged that Sarma had “openly threatened” to send Bodoland People’s Front Hagrama Mohilary to jail by misusing National Investigation Agency (NIA). “If Hagrama does extremism with Batha, he will go to jail. This is a straight talk. (We) already have lot of evidence. This case is being given to NIA,” read the transcript of Sarma speech as mentioned in the EC notice. While Sarma was initially barred from campaigning for 48 hours, EC reduced the period to 24 hours following an apology from the leader. Following the controversy, wherein an EVM machine was found in the car of a BJP candidate in Assam, the Commission intervened and transferred six officials involved in the matter. The officials had taken a “lift” in a car that belonged to a BJP candidate after the second phase of the polls. The Commission also ordered a repoll in the constituency following the incident. This has, however, trigger a call for more careful and rigorous measures by the EC. “Considering several unwanted incidents already reported with respect to the EVMs and the discrepancy associated with them in several places of the state, it has now become ver essential to ensure protection of the EVMs from rigging by any means, after conclusion of all the three phases of election in the state to protect the interest of democracy,” state Congress president Ripun Bora wrote in a letter to chief electoral officer, Assam, Nitin Khade, on Wednesday. “As strongrooms are already under CCTV camera surveillance with access to the concerned election officers to ensure protection, it would also afford satisfaction to the contesting candidates if the access/link of the surveillance is provided to them and the same will definitely ensure holding of the present assembly election in the state in a fair and impartial manner,” the letter added. The BJP, however, has dismissed the Congress’ call as the party’s typical tactic in the face of an imminent defeat. “We have full faith in the EC and its conduct of the polls. The Congress’s worry stems from the fact that they are losing. They always blame EVMs when they lose, but are happy with the machines when they win,” BJP Assam spokesperson Rupam Goswami said. Puducherry There were 1,341 complaints received with regard to Puducherry, of which 58% were resolved, while 42% were found to be untrue, a official familiar with Puducherry polls said. None of these complaints needed the intervention of the Commission in Delhi either. Of the 1,341 complaints, 474 were regarding distribution of cash to voters. Hindustan Times on April 4 reported that all 30 of the elected constituencies in Puducherry had been earmarked as expenditure sensitive by the Commission. Expenditure-sensitive constituencies are identified by the Commission to ensure that no unfair trade of cash, liquor, drugs or other items takes places in exchange for votes by political parties. In terms of sheer numbers, Tamil Nadu was the worst this election followed by Assam, West Bengal, Puducherry and Kerala. Other kinds of complaints received by Puducherry included canvassing beyond permitted times, distribution of freebies, posters and banners without permission, violation of model code of conduct and supply of liquor. “We received a number of complaints, but all were swiftly resolved,” the official familiar with Puducherry mentioned above said. West Bengal In West Bengal, arguably the most fiercely contested of the five states, complaints, which came in from February 26 to April 8, ranged from displaying posters without permission to display of firearms and intimidation. The Commission also conducted seizures of bombs in the state.A case similar to Assam also occurred with VVPATs and an EVM being found at the home of a Trinamool Congress (TMC) candidate, along with the official responsible for the same ahead of the third phase of polling held on April 6. The official who had “slept over” at the candidate’s house was suspended, along with a sub-inspector, for their negligence. There have been a number of other cases in Bengal, with the TMC and Mamata Banerjee alleging violence, dereliction of duty by police forces and EVM malfunctioning. EC found the allegations to be “factually incorrect, whiteout empirical evidence and devoid of substance”. In a letter dated April 3 sent to chief minister, EC secretary general Umesh Sinha offered a detailed rebuttal of all the allegations made by Banerjee and TMC. “It is self-evident from the perusal of all the reports that the allegations mentioned in your hand-written note are factually incorrect, without any empirical evidence whatsoever and devoid of substance,” the Commission said in its rejoinder. TMC leader Derek O’Brien also appealed to EC to find Prime Minister Narendra Modi in violation of the model code of conduct for misuse of his power and position, for his politically charged speech in Bangladesh. While the Commission is yet to formally reply to his complaint, an official familiar with the matter told Hindustan Times that it is “unlikely to be found in contravention of the MCC”. EC, on Wednesday, also issued a notice to incumbent West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee for violating the model code for her alleged appeal to minority voters to not allow their votes to be split among different political parties. The Commission has given her 48 hours to explain her stand. She was served a second notice on Thursday for her remarks against the central armed police forces. The EC said her statements may create a “wedge of distrust” between the state police and central forces. On Thursday, the Commission also pulled up BJP leader Suvendu Adhikari for his communally charged remarks with reference to Banerjee as “begum”. TMC MP Derek O’Brien said that the EC had acted in an “extremely compromised” manner during the elections. After the EC served the notice to Adhikari, TMC Lok Sabha member Saugata Roy said, “The EC has done the right thing for the first time. Why didn’t he face this action before the polls in Nandigram?” HT reached out to BJP’s Amit Malaviya but did not receive a response immediately.Evaluating the mechanism of complaints and actionsThrough the elections, the EC’s role has come under a scanner. While the BJP believes that the commission has been fair, Opposition leaders have alleged partisanship BJP leader and Union minister Mukhtar Abbas Naqvi said that the Commission took immediate action whenever it was confronted with a complaint. “Look at Assam, the Commission immediately stepped in and took action against the officials. In West Bengal, when Mamta Banerjee violated the RP Act, the Commission again prompt in issuing her a notice.”Naqvi added that social media and access to complaint portals posed a significant new challenge for the EC. “At the same time, their accessibility has also increased. They have managed to effectively ensure free and fair polls.” Congress secretary, media in-charge, Pranav Jha, however, said that the party was disappointed in the way the Commission had dealt with the representations. “We presumed the Election Commission of India to be an independent body,” Jha said “But to our dismay the Commission is unable to enforce its own guidelines. It was shocking to see that in Assam, after first phase polling, it couldn’t stop the BJP from advertising that it won all the seats in the first phase. Worse is that it appeared as news. Same thing was repeated in Tamil Nadu by AIADMK [All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam], an ally of BJP. Icing on the cake was reversal of Himanta Biswa Sharma’s ban from campaigning for 48 hours, on April 3, to less than 24 hours.”Jha added that it seemed EC had one set of rules for opposition leaders like A Raja , Mamata Banerjee and others, and quite another for those belonging to BJP. “I am not even mentioning BJP leaders’ divisive speeches or PM’s campaigning while people are polling in neighbouring areas. It’s indeed dangerous for India’s Parliamentary democracy,” he said. Former chief election commissioner VS Sampath said that in the last six-seven years, access to internet and filing complaints has become easier. “Earlier they had file by post to CEO or district officer and only when CEO felt that the complaint was serious, a show-cause notice would be noticed by EC.”Jagdeep Chhokar of the Association of Democratic Reforms said that anecdotally, one can say that the frequency and intensity of complaints about electoral malpractices appear to have been on the increase in the last few years. “However, some seemingly obvious violations of the model code of conduct do not seem to attract anyone’s attention,” he said. “The onus for this rests entirely with the Election Commission of India, which has to become more vigilant, more active and more transparent. The EC should not only be fair but should also appear to be fair.”(With inputs from Ramesh Babu, Tanmay Chatterjee and Utpal Parashar)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-ec-is-dealing-with-grievances-during-state-assembly-polls-101617968411099.html

In response, Omar Abdullah tweeted, “I am very grateful to everyone reaching out to me here on Twitter to wish me well. I apologise for not replying individually. For the next few days I’m focusing on beating this virus and will be back here after the battle is won.”The news comes on a day when India reported a fresh spike in the number of daily Covid-19 infections with 131,968 cases. Also, the active caseload in India is moving towards the one-million mark and currently stands at 979,608 cases.Also read | 5 states account for over 73% of India's active caseload: GovtOmar Abdullah received his first dose of the vaccine against Covid-19 in Srinagar on Wednesday (April 7). “Got my 1st dose of the Covid-19 vaccine this morning.

09-04-2021||India||Foreigners married to Indians cannot enjoy OCI status after divorce, Centre tells HC||Foreigners registered as OCI cardholders because of their marriage to Indian nationals cannot continue to enjoy that status after their divorce, the Centre has told the Delhi High Court.The submission has been made by the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) while defending the decision of the Indian Embassy in Brussels, Belgium asking a Belgian woman to surrender her OCI card after the dissolution of her marriage with an Indian national.The woman has challenged in the high court a provision of the Citizenship Act - section 7D(f) - under which a foreign spouse of an Indian national would lose Overseas Citizens of India (OCI) status on divorce.Defending the provision, the MHA in an affidavit has said that the section under challenge makes a clear classification based on the intelligible differentia as it applies to foreigners who were registered as OCI cardholders on the strength of their spouse being a citizen of India or an OCI cardholder, and whose marriage has been subsequently dissolved. "The provision has the object of cancellation of registration as an OCI cardholder of such foreigners as they are no more eligible under the Citizenship Act, 1955," the MHA has said in its affidavit filed through central government standing counsel Ajay Digpaul.The ministry has said that the woman was issued a Person of Indian Origin (PIO) card by the Embassy of India, Brussels, Belgium on August 21, 2006 on the basis of her marriage with an Indian national. She had legally divorced her husband in October 2011, and subsequently the PIO card issued to her on the strength of the marriage should have been cancelled, but it was not done at that time, the ministry has said.It has further said that an OCI card was inadvertently issued to her in 2017 even though she was not married to an Indian citizen or an OCI card holder at that time.The ministry has also claimed that the woman's OCI status has not been cancelled yet and she was only requested to surrender the card.It has said that a reasonable opportunity shall be given to her to explain her stand before taking any action to cancel her registration as OCI cardholder.The ministry has said that foreigners like the petitioners may apply for a visa under the prevailing laws and rules to legally stay in India.The woman has contended that asking her to surrender her OCI card has no basis in law and "also violates the twin doctrines of legitimate expectation and promissory estoppel for the simple reason that she was already divorced when she received her OCI card on February 15, 2017.She has said in her petition that she received the OCI card when the Indian government merged the Person of Indian Origin (POI) and OCI schemes."Hence, the concerned provisions of the Citizenship Act by way of which a foreign national married to an Indian citizen loses her right to hold an OCI card in case of divorce have no application to her whatsoever," she has claimed in her plea.She had received her POI card in 2006 and it was valid till August 2021, the petition has said and added that she had divorced her husband in 2011 which was communicated to the Indian embassy in Belgium in 2016.She has also said that she has a daughter, who holds an OCI card, with her ex-husband and since during the prevailing pandemic tourist travel to India is not possible, their only hope of coming here to meet relatives was the OCI card."There is also the very real chance that if the daughter of the petitioner travels to India and is stranded because of some sudden travel restrictions that might be imposed, the petitioner might end up getting separated from her on a medium-term basis," the petition has said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/foreigners-married-to-indians-cannot-enjoy-oci-status-after-divorce-mha-101617957285887.html

09-04-2021||India||Vaccination programme going slow, alleges Rahul Gandhi in letter to PM||Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote a letter to Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday saying the Covid-19 vaccination was going on at a snail’s pace in the country as less than 1% of the population has been vaccinated in three months. He sought the availability of vaccines on the basis of demand a day after Modi defended the country’s vaccine strategy at a meeting with chief ministers.“Our vaccination programme has to move beyond an individual’s picture on the vaccine certificate, towards guaranteeing maximum vaccination,” Gandhi wrote in an oblique reference to Modi’s photo on the vaccine certificates. Gandhi questioned whether the export of vaccines was also an “oversight like many other decisions of this government”.The government this month blamed oversight as it rolled back the decision to cut interest rates on small savings schemes to an over four-decade low.In his letter, Gandhi slammed the Centre for bypassing the states “right from vaccine procurement to registration”. “Additionally, a large section of the poor have been excluded due to the initial mandatory online registration,” he said.Gandhi suggested the vaccine suppliers be provided with the necessary resources to increase manufacturing capacity. He sought an immediate moratorium on vaccine exports and a fast-track approval of other vaccines as per norms and guidelines. Gandhi also suggested that the central allocation for vaccine procurement be doubled from the existing ₹35,000 crore.“Give state governments a greater say in vaccine procurement and distribution and provide direct income support to the vulnerable sections in the disastrous second [Covid-19] wave,” he said.In a series of tweets, Union minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said India is not facing vaccine starvation, but Gandhi is facing attention starvation. “Why has Rahul Gandhi not yet taken vaccine? Is it an oversight or he doesnt want it or has he already taken one in many of his undisclosed trips to foreign locations but doesnt want to disclose?” he tweeted.“After failing as a part-time politician, has Rahul Gandhi switched to full time lobbying? First he lobbied for fighter plane companies by trying to derail India’s acquisition programme. Now he is lobbying for pharma companies by asking for arbitrary approvals for foreign vaccines.”Prasad said fighting a pandemic is not a one-trick game. “Apart from vaccination, there needs to be adequate focus on testing, tracing & treating. Rahul Gandhi’s problem is that he doesn’t understand all this and his ignorance is compounded by his arrogance,” he tweeted. Gandhi demanded that the vaccination programme be opened to everyone who needs it. “Our scientific community and vaccine suppliers worked overtime to develop a solution, but their efforts are undermined by the Centre’s poor implementation and ‘oversight’,” he wrote.On Thursday, Modi backed the current vaccination plans and told states that vaccines would be distributed in priority areas. Earlier this week, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan virtually ruled out the Congress’ demand to give vaccines to those who ask for them. Bhushan said the vaccines will be given to those who need them.Modi on Thursday said that India’s vaccine strategy is similar to other nations. He added some states cannot be prioritised over others while slamming critics. “Those who have the habit of doing politics, let them do so. I have faced much criticism, but we remain committed to serving the people,” he said.Gandhi highlighted the slow rate of vaccination and added it would take years to vaccinate 75% of the population if the vaccination rate is this low. “This will have catastrophic effects and will gravely decelerate India’s economy.”Gandhi blamed the government for “irrationally exporting vaccines” and hit out at Union health minister Harsh Vardhan over his “intemperate” statements against valid vaccine demands by state governments as the nation faces a “vaccine starvation”.Also Watch| Rahul Gandhi slams PM Modi’s ‘Tika Utsav’ call; questions export of vaccinesVardhan on Thursday reiterated there was no vaccine shortage, and the country has over 43 million doses in stock or in the pipeline. He called for “an end to fear-mongering”.Vardhan’s comments came as states like Maharashtra, where Congress shares power, said they were running out of coronavirus vaccines and were forced to shut inoculation centres.To be sure, while overall supplies may be there at the state level, individual centres may run out of stock on account of how the states manage their replenishment.Gandhi questioned the export of vaccines and called the move “an effort to garner publicity at the cost of our citizens”. He questioned Modi’s “cooperative federalism” claim and added the Centre’s “individualised propaganda and centralisation” have deprived the states of their rights to procure vaccines. Gandhi added that the Congress party takes “immense pride in making the country a vaccine hub over last 70 years”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccination-programme-going-slow-alleges-rahul-gandhi-in-letter-to-pm-101617960655497.html
09-04-2021||India||'No plan to curtail train services': Railways||Indian Railways’ top official said on Friday there were no plans to stop train services in view of the coronavirus pandemic, which has led to authorities imposing several restrictions across the country on the movement of people. Railway Board chairperson Suneet Sharma cleared the air around the government body's plan amid rising cases of the infection.Talking specifically about Maharashtra, one of the worst-hit regions by Covid-19, Sharma said there was no request from the state government to curb train services, including those of suburban trains. He also said there was no shortage of trains and the crowd seen on stations was usual during these months.Click here for full Covid-19 coverage"Crowds seen at railway stations is a result of a normal surge seen during these months, wherever there is a surge in demand we will increase trains. There is no shortage of trains for those who want to travel. I assure everyone that trains will be provided on demand wherever the need arises," he said.Watch: Plans to curtail train services? Exodus amid Covid surge? Railways clarifiesCurrently, the Indian Railways is running total 1402 specials train services on an average per day, according to a release issued by the Ministry of Railways. "Total 5381 suburban train services and 830 passenger train services are also operational. Apart from this, 28 special trains are being operated as clones of highly patronized trains with high patronage," it read.When the nationwide lockdown was announced on March 24 last year, the Indian Railways, for the first time since its inception, shut down all its services, leaving thousands of migrants stranded far from their homes.The Railways' clarification comes as the centre and various state governments are imposing new Covid-19 restrictions amid the second wave of infections. States of Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Rajasthan and Gujarat among others have either imposed a statewide night curfew or have announced partial lockdowns in their cities to curb the spread of the infection. The national capital too, imposed a night curfew from 10pm to 5am on April 6.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-plan-to-curtail-train-services-railways-101617959973388.html
09-04-2021||India||When India’s military czar laid out top national security challenges||India’s senior-most military commander has identified building capability to defend against cyber threats, jointness among the three services to extract the full potential of India’s combat power, integration of civil and military technological efforts and building a symbiotic relationship between internal and external security as some of the key focus areas to take on emerging security challenges that could threaten national interests. In a recent talk on preparing the armed forces for current and future challenges, chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat stressed that India cannot fight its next war premised on the experiences and structures of wars it fought in the past, and it was critical to balance today’s requirements with what the country needs to do differently to face future challenges. From proxy war to non-contact, conventional and collusive wars under a nuclear overhang, the country faces multiple threats across the full spectrum of conflict, the CDS said in a detailed talk at the event organised by Vivekananda International Foundation on April 7. He said the changed global environment demanded a change in India’s outlook and policies. While the CDS and Indian military chiefs have often intervened in the public sphere, what stood out in Rawat’s remarks was the candour with which he spoke. “Traditional strategies, which used to account for India’s national security paradigm such as inter-state and intra-state conflict, no longer adequately capture the complex security linkages existing across seemingly disparate issues,” Rawat said. Appointed as India’s first CDS on January 1, 2020, Rawat wears three hats — he is the permanent chairman of chiefs of staff committee (COSC), heads the department of military affairs (DMA), and is the single-point military adviser to the defence minister. Preparing for cyber threats The CDS said China was way ahead of India in technology, and it was capable of launching cyber attacks and disrupting a large number of Indian systems. Rawat said the biggest gap between the two countries was in the cyber domain and India was looking at collaborating with western nations to overcome deficiencies in the critical area. Also Read | Asserted navigational rights off Lakshadweep without India’s permission: US NavyHe said cyber agencies in the military were working to ensure that “the downtime and the effect of a cyber attack” did not last long. “We should be able to overcome cyber attacks and continue with our systems either through an alternative or preventive means through firewalls,” he said. Experts said the cyber threat that India faces from China is not exaggerated and demands urgent attention. Chinese cyber capabilities are well known and the recent intrusions in the power sector by Chinese hackers are a pointer to how India’s critical infrastructure is under threat, said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General DS Hooda (retd). A few weeks ago, Recorded Future, a US-based security consultancy, reported that Chinese groups had intruded into the networks of at least a dozen Indian state-run organisations since mid-2020 in an attempt to insert malware that could cause widespread disruptions. To be sure, India denied any data breach in the attempts made by Chinese hackers to target the country’s power grid. “Our normal response has been to downplay this (cyber) threat and I am glad the CDS has given a realistic picture. This should trigger the crafting of a comprehensive strategy to deal with this danger,” Hooda said. He added that technology support from western nations is welcome to overcome deficiencies in the short term, but ultimately there is no option but to develop indigenous IT systems for use in the critical infrastructure. “Reliance on foreign hardware and software is a serious vulnerability. Indigenisation must be given the highest priority,” Hooda pointed out. The CDS described the cyber threat as alongside biological risks and economic disruptions as major challenges.“Recent events show that many of the biggest threats we face today respect no borders and must be met with collective action, e.g. the Covid-19 pandemic, biological risks, escalating climate crisis, cyber and digital threats, international economic disruptions, protracted humanitarian crises, violent extremism and terrorism, proliferation of weapons of mass destruction,” Rawat said. Also Read | The long, rocky and uncertain story of India-Pakistan peacemakingCyber has, perhaps, come to acquire a pivotal position in any nation’s security architecture, said Air Vice Marshal Manmohan Bahadur (retd), additional director general, Centre for Air Power Studies. “While preparing to acquire offensive capability, it is critical that one’s own systems are protected. While we may be lagging behind China, our nation does not lack cerebral capital to catch up. All efforts must be made to tap the nation’s inherent cyber know-how to protect our vital infrastructure from cyber intrusions,” Bahadur said. Jointness and challenges Jointness, integration and modernisation in line with the changing security environment as well as utmost optimisation of resources is critical, the CDS said. The government expects Rawat to bring about jointness among the three services in a three-year time frame (by January 2023). One of the means to achieve jointness is the setting up of integrated theatre commands for the best use of military resources to fight future battles. “The current CDS system in India is evolutionary and will progressively adopt more means of integration and joint functioning for an integrated system to emerge finally,” Rawat said. Nobody expects the road to theaterisation to be smooth and the ongoing efforts to bring about jointness among the three services are expected to face resistance. Rawat said India as a nation believed in status quo and there was always a hesitation to change. “There is a feeling amongst the three services that army being a very large service — compared to navy and Indian Air Force — will possibly usurp the two entities and everything will become army-centric. I think this is a misnomer because the army, navy and IAF have their own specialties. They will retain their autonomy and integration will only ensure that we have systems that at least operate together,” Rawat said. India is set to begin a formal roll-out of its long-awaited theaterisation plan to best utilise its military’s resources amid growing security threats, with the Air Defence Command and the Maritime Theatre Command set to be launched by May. India will also have three other integrated commands to secure its western, northern and eastern fronts — these are likely to be rolled out by December 2022. In addition, a logistics command is in the works to avoid duplication of efforts and resources. The CDS’s mandate includes bringing about jointness in operations, logistics, transport, training, support services and repairs and maintenance of the three services. Theaterisation is imperative to meet and mitigate future security challenges which as the CDS defined are multi domain and multidimensional, said Lieutenant General Vinod Bhatia (retd), a former director general of military operations. The operational control of all the theatre commands will eventually come under the CDS, with the service chiefs being responsible for raising, training and sustaining their forces. “The CDS has defined an effective way forward, including transition management, wherein till theaterisation is achieved the responsibility of operational readiness will be with the service chiefs and that of defence preparedness with the CDS and COSC. But once theaterisation is achieved, there needs to be a role reversal with the CDS being responsible for operational preparedness and service chiefs for defence preparedness,” Bhatia said. He said apprehensions about theaterisation among the services were natural as there will always be a resistance to change. “The challenge will be to manage the mindsets and the transition. This can best be achieved by a transparent road map taking all stake holders on board,” Bhatia said. Greater emphasis would now be on advancing jointness and integration across the board so as to develop trust among the rank and file and shape the congruent perception to operate efficiently and effectively, the CDS said. Integrating civil and military efforts The CDS highlighted the need to integrate civil and military technological efforts for achieving self-reliance and strengthening the country’s security. He said cooperation between government and commercial facilities in research and development (R&D), manufacturing, maintenance operations, combined production of similar components and sub components on same production lines would optimise commercial and defence industrial base to maximise resource utilisation and reduce manufacturing and life cycle costs for military equipment. Rawat said synergising military and civil efforts was crucial in the backdrop of shrinking budgets. “The contracting envelope of the defence budget makes it imperative to create dual use infrastructure through civil military fusion. We must examine the feasibility of integrating civil-military airports to strengthen aviation safety, airspace management and combat support capabilities. Satellites for remote sensing and reconnaissance, communications, positioning and navigation must also meet requirements of the armed forces with desired in-built encryptions,” the CDS said. He said railway wagons and civil truck trailers must be manufactured for dual use — capable of transporting heavy military equipment including armoured fighting vehicles. The CDS added that construction of communication towers and electricity infrastructure along with rail, roads, bridges and tunnels in border states must be of specifications that facilitate utilisation by the military as well. “Civil-military integration in infrastructure development holds the key to Whole-of-Nation approach towards national security,” Rawat said. Experts said synergising military and civil efforts was vital for national security. India is already lagging behind in civil-military fusion which other countries, especially China, have already embarked on. “The strengths of civil R&D institutions, manufacturing infrastructure and knowledge bank need to be dovetailed with defence capability needs so as to leapfrog with respect to time and technology standards. To achieve this, a top-down approach would be required through formulation of national level directives and policies,” Manmohan Bahadur said. Internal and external security Rawat said in today’s complex world, security has a much broader construct that cover geopolitical interests, internal stability and economic and social security. “It envisages a symbiotic relationship between internal and external security, reinforcing the premise that a country’s external security posture is organically linked to its internal strength,” the CDS said. He said while external challenges could be met by effective diplomacy and adequate defence capability, internal stability required strong political institutions, economic growth, social harmony, efficient law and order machinery, expeditious judicial relief and good governance. “National security stands redefined, deepening from state to individual security and broadening from military threats to issues like economy, environment etc. The coronavirus pandemic has brought to fore the importance of public health in the national security equation,” the CDS said. “In an environment of ambiguity, uncertainty and frequent opacity, the political leadership needs to be provided with comprehensive, complete and evaluated options on matters of national security in the form of a ‘single point advice’, requiring multiple inputs from political, military, diplomatic and intelligence agencies,” Rawat added. The CDS has made a comprehensive pointer at imperatives to deal with threats in the internal and external dimensions, said former army vice chief Lieutenant General AS Lamba (retd). “Recent adaptations of threats such as terrorism, increasing cyber-attacks backed by adversary-led networks, support to insurgency movements, immigration flows etc can be best addressed by the contours of direction by the CDS,” Lamba pointed out.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/when-india-s-military-czar-laid-out-top-national-security-challenges-101617959815348.html

Amid the fresh surge of Covid-19 infections in 2021, authorities across the country have imposed strict curbs to control the spread of the virus. The restrictions like night curfew, weekend lockdowns, the cap on attendees in functions have affected many who were still recovering from the losses of lockdown.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Many states like Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh, Delhi, Rajasthan, Punjab and Maharashtra have imposed a night curfew. Raipur, Bhopal and Maharashtra will go under weekend lockdown from Friday, while Chhattisgarh’s Durg district is under nine-day lockdown since April 6. The state governments have also reduced the number of guests allowed in wedding ceremonies to control the spread.The Covid-19 restrictions have adversely affected these sectors/people:Workers in the informal sector, daily wage workers have again been affected the most. Fearing the tragedy of 2020 and the rise in Covid-19 cases in the metropolitan cities, migrants workers in large numbers are going back to their native states. “We are leaving for our hometown in Uttar Pradesh. As of now, there is a night curfew in place. It is very likely that a lockdown will be put into place. To avoid chaos like the previous lockdown, we are travelling back to our native place. Not sure when, whether we will come back here,” ANI quoted a migrant worker leaving Mumbai for Uttar Pradesh as saying.The jewellery industry in Maharashtra wrote to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray to allow the opening of stores during the upcoming festival of Gudi Padwa that can increase their sales 30-40 per cent. The All India Gem and Jewellery Domestic Council (GJC) chairman said that the lockdown restrictions will impact many artisans and craftsmen who have migrated from different states and will also impact self-employed retailers, reported PTI.Also Read | Rahul writes to PM Modi, asks why govt allowed Covid-19 vaccine exportsConcerned with the new restrictions, the hospitality industry in Maharashtra has formed an umbrella front United Hospitality Forum (UHF) and initiated a campaign #MissionRoziRoti to protest against the curbs. “As of Wednesday, 30 per cent of the hotels and restaurants in the country have shut down permanently due to financial losses. Over 20 per cent of hotels and restaurants haven't opened fully after the lockdown. The remaining 50 per cent continue to run in losses and revenues are below 50 per cent of the pre-Covid levels,” PTI quoted Federation of Hotel and Restaurant Associations of India (FHRAI) honorary secretary Pradeep Shetty as saying.The event management industry is another such sector that is worried about the new restrictions. The curfew led many people to reschedule their wedding ceremonies, reduce the budget of their grandeur functions and the number of guests as per the guidelines. Businesses of band companies, tent companies, banquet hall owners fear their sustainability and how will they pay salaries to their employees.Local traders and retailers in Pune are also protesting against the restrictions as they want the state government to allow the opening of their shops.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-restrictions-jewellery-hospitality-industries-suffer-loss-amid-fresh-curbs-101617956292107.html

Just a day ago, in his meeting with the chief ministers, Prime Minister Modi had proposed to hold Tika Utsav, a drive from April 11-14, so that the maximum number of eligible beneficiaries across states were vaccinated.Also Read | ‘Fatality rate witnessing downward trend’: Union health minister Harsh VardhanRaising questions over the exports of vaccines to other countries at a time when India itself is grappling with the second wave of Covid-19 infections -- the country has been logging over 100,000 daily cases for the past three days now -- Gandhi tweeted, “Is it right to export vaccines by putting the lives of citizens of the country at risk? The central government should help all the states without any bias. We have to work together to defeat this pandemic.”.India has shipped vaccine to 85 countries, some in the form of “gifts”, others in line with commercial agreements signed between the vaccine makers and the recipient nations, and the rest under the Covas Scheme, led by the World Health Organisation.In his meeting with the chief ministers, addressing the issue of alleged vaccine shortage, the prime minister had said the Centre prioritises supply as per the requirement, while suggesting to the states to avoid wastage. It was while urging the states to get maximum people vaccinated against this deadly virus that he proposed Tika Utsav or vaccine festival on April 11-14.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-shortage-a-serious-issue-not-an-utsav-rahul-gandhi-slams-pm-s-idea-101617954354727.html

It said USS John Paul Jones, an Arleigh Burke-class guided missile destroyer, asserted navigational rights and freedoms around 130 nautical miles west of the Lakshadweep Islands. The 7th Fleet is the largest of the US Navy’s forward deployed fleets. The US had sent elements of the 7th Fleet to the Bay of Bengal to pressure India during the 1971 war with Pakistan that ended with the liberation of Bangladesh. Every coastal country’s EEZ extends to 200 nautical miles (370km) from its shores and the country in question has exclusive rights to all resources in the water, including oil, natural gas and fish. Any military activity in the EEZ requires India’s permission, navy officials familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named. Also Read | Pakistan’s steadily diminishing equity with the US may have hit rock bottom“If you have to do anything in our EEZ, you have to notify us and take permission,” navy chief Admiral Singh said in 2019 after a Chinese vessel that had intruded into Indian waters near the Andaman and Nicobar Islands was repelled. There was no official reaction from the navy or the ministry of external affairs when this report was filed. “US Forces operate in the Indo-Pacific region on a daily basis. All operations are designed in accordance with international law and demonstrate that the United States will fly, sail and operate wherever international law allows,” the 7th Fleet statement said. “We conduct routine and regular FONOPs, as we have done in the past and will continue to in the future. FONOPs are not about one country, nor are they about making political statements,” it added. The US Navy regularly carries out FONOPs in the disputed South China Sea. “FoN ops by USN ships (ineffective as they may be) in South China Sea, are meant to convey a message to China that the putative EEZ around the artificial SCS islands is an “excessive maritime claim.” But what is the 7th Fleet message for India?” former Navy chief Admiral Arun Prakash (retd) said in a tweet on Friday.He said in another tweet, “There is irony here. While India ratified UN Law of the Seas in 1995, the US has failed to do it so far. For the 7th Fleet to carry out FoN missions in Indian EEZ in violation of our domestic law is bad enough. But publicising it? USN please switch on IFF (Identification friend-or-foe)!” The development comes at a time when the navies of India and the US have just concluded multilateral drills in the eastern Indian Ocean Region (IOR). France, India, the US, Japan and Australia carried out complex maritime drills in the eastern IOR to enhance interoperability among their navies from April 5 to April 7. On April 7, the US Navy said in another statement that USS John Paul Jones asserted navigational rights and freedoms in the vicinity of the Maldives by conducting “innocent passage” within its EEZ without seeking prior permission. It said this was consistent with international law. The US Department of Defense (DoD) released its annual Freedom of Navigation (FON) Report for 2020 on March 10, 2021. These reports identify the broad range of excessive maritime claims that are challenged by the US government. “This year… US forces challenged 28 different excessive maritime claims made by 19 different claimants throughout the world,” the State Department said in a statement on March 16. DoD’s operational challenges, also known as FONOPs, are designed to challenge coastal state maritime claims that unlawfully restrict navigation and overflight rights and freedoms and other internationally lawful uses of the sea related to these freedoms guaranteed in international law as reflected in the 1982 Law of the Sea Convention, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/asserted-navigational-rights-off-lakshadweep-without-india-s-permission-us-navy-101617954115129.html

Rahul questions Covid-19 jab export, says Congress made India vaccine hub||Though India has the first mover advantage in vaccination, the pace is not enough and at this rate it would take years to vaccinate 75 per cent of the population, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi wrote in a letter addressed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Presenting his seven-point demands, the Congress leader said the government must place an immediate moratorium on vaccine export and open vaccination to everyone who needs it. The other demands of the Congress leader include providing vaccine suppliers with necessary resources to increase manufacturing capacity, fast-tracking the approval process of other vaccines as per norms and guidelines, increasing the allocation of ₹35,000 crore for vaccine procurement, as announced in Union Budget 2021, to double, allowing states a greater say in vaccine procurement and distribution, providing direct income support to the vulnerable sections.Vaccine shortage not 'festival': Rahul Gandhi's dig at PM Modi's Tika Utsav"Historically, India has achieved abundant experience in designing and executing some of the world's biggest vaccination programmes. Yet in the present case, we have managed to fully vaccinate less than 1% of the population in 3 months," Gandhi wrote in his letter.Was the export of vaccines also an "oversight", the Congress leader asked in his letter, referring to the recent order issued by the finance minister on interest rate cut on small savings. The order was withdrawn a day after and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman said it was an oversight.Questioning why state governments have not been given the authority to procure vaccines according to their need, the Congress leader wrote, "Even though public health is a state subject, our states have been bypassed right from vaccine procurement to registration."Crediting his party for building the vaccine framework of India and making the country a vaccine hub, Rahul said the vaccination programme has to move beyond "an individual's picture on the vaccine certificate, towards guaranteeing maximum vaccination".The letter comes at a time when several states are complaining of vaccine shortage and the inoculation drive on Friday stopped at many vaccination centres in Mumbai. However, the Centre dismissed these claims as "fear-mongering" and said the stocks are being replenished on a regular basis and there is no vaccine crunch in any state.According to Centre's data, India has so far exported 6.45 crore Covid-19 vaccine doses to as many as 84 countries. Out of these doses, 1.05 crores have been given as grants to 44 countries, while 3.58 crore doses to 25 countries have been given under commercial contracts and 1.82 crore to 39 countries through World Health Organization (WHO)'s COVAX facility.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/would-take-years-to-vaccinate-75-of-against-covid-19-rahul-gandhi-writes-to-pm-101617953848474.html

The book is written by 'Utkal Keshari' Dr Harekrushna Mahtab. He said, "Today we are reviving the stories of sacrifice and sacrifice of freedom fighters so that our youth do not only know it, but experience it, fill in with new confidence and move forward with new resolutions to do something."Union minister Dharmendra Pradhan and Biju Janata Dal (BJD) MP and son of Harekrushna Mahtab, Bhartruhari Mahtab were also present at the event.The Prime Minister said it is very necessary that the comprehensive and diverse history of Odisha reached the people of the country. "About a year and a half ago, we celebrated the 120th birth anniversary of 'Utkal Kesari' Harekrushna Mahtab ji. Today we are launching the Hindi version of his famous book 'Odisha History'. It is very necessary that the comprehensive and diverse history of Odisha reached the people of the country," he said."Utkal Keshari Harekrushna Mahtab is remembered for his great contributions to Odisha’s progress and India’s freedom struggle. He was passionate about Odisha’s culture," PM Modi said.He said Mahtab was such a person who made history, saw it and wrote it. "In fact, such historical personalities are very rare. Such great men themselves are important chapters in history," he added.PM Modi further said that Mahtab took big decisions as the chief minister of Odisha. "Even after reaching power, he considered himself to be a freedom fighter and he was a freedom fighter all his life," he asserted.He added that Mahtab dedicated his life to the freedom struggle, and even served sentence in jail. "But the important thing is that along with the freedom fight, he also fought for society," he said.PM Modi said the book has been published in the year when the nation is celebrating Azadi Ka Amrut Mahotsav. "This year also marks 100 years of the incident when Harekrushna Mahtab left college and joined in the freedom struggle.

He was released deep in a jungle and brought to Chhattisgarh’s Terrem police station along with the facilitators who went inside the jungle to trace his location.Twenty-two security personnel were killed in the gunfight with Maoists on April 3 before Manhas was taken hostage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/three-health-workers-allegedly-missing-in-chhattisgarh-s-bijapur-101617950754433.html

In a reply, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan issued a statement and said there is no shortage of vaccines in the country and such allegations by states are 'baseless', attempt to cover up their own failure. The minister, in his statement, also said Maharashtra's vaccine coverage percentage has not been impressive.Vaccine shortage not 'festival': Rahul Gandhi's dig at PM Modi's Tika UtsavSeveral BJP ministers rallied against Maharashtra leaders' claims about vaccine shortage and slammed the state for wastage. The bickering went on throughout Thursday as Rajesh Tope accused Union minister Prakash Javadekar of inflating Maharashtra's vaccine wastage figure.On Friday morning, many vaccination centres across Mumbai, including a jumbo Covid-19 facility in Bandra-Kurla Complex, suspended inoculation. As many as 75 of the 120 centres, mainly at private hospitals suspended vaccinations, news agency PTI reported."We are doing everything possible to combat the Covid-19 situation in a better way by increasing of beds and ramping up facilities on war footing," Mumbai mayor said.While the Centre is reiterating that fresh supplies are being made to states and it is a continuous process, Rajesh Dere, the dean of BKC jumbo vaccination centre, said so far since the beginning of the vaccination, the centre has always received buffer stock and never did a situation like this arise when vaccination has to be stopped. "From day 1, we used to get vaccines before a day as buffer stock. Till yesterday, we had a sufficient number of vials for this centre. Last night, we were expecting to get today's dose but it has not come. Now we have only 160 doses," the dean said.From day 1 we used to get vaccines before a day as buffer stock, till yesterday we got a sufficient number of vials for this centre.

09-04-2021||India||The long, rocky and uncertain story of India-Pakistan peacemaking||The history of India-Pakistan relations is one of hope triumphed by trepidation, of lack of trust and intransigence that have made leaderships stop short of turning a new leaf.That’s largely because the interlocutors battle on two fronts — across the negotiating table and in public courts back home. Given the mindsets nurtured over decades, the approach has been of unwavering suspicion. Even when one side dealt straight, the other saw in it a sleight of hand.So when the two armies announced on February 25 the restoration of the November 2003 ceasefire handed down from the Atal Bihari Vajpayee era, the predominant reaction was of doubt and disbelief. Even the most hardened among the optimists found incredulous the possibility of a substantive dialogue process that hasn’t been resurrected from the ruins of the 2008 terror attack on Mumbai.The assault orchestrated by gunmen trained and controlled by Pakistan has continued to haunt bilateral ties; the intermittent tactical engagements thwarted by other cross-border misadventures from Pathankot to Pulwama. The wounds thus inflicted are open and festering.Also Read | India-Russia relations not influenced by ties with other countries: MEAThe sceptics were proved right when the Imran Khan regime put on hold a proposal to import sugar and cotton from India. The move proved abortive as it signified a policy shift away from Islamabad’s stated position of “no engagement” with India till it undid the August 5, 2019 revocation of Jammu and Kashmir’s special status. Pakistan’s “U-turn on the U-turn”There are conflicting narratives in Pakistan of the authors and cancellers of the trade initiative. For instance, noted journalist Najam Sethi refused to believe the federal cabinet’s economic coordination committee (ECC) led by finance minister Hammad Azhar could have moved without the PM’s nod. His prognosis: Khan either played off his “own bat” or misread what the “higher” authorities (read the army) desired. In his view, the PM backed down and Hammad became (the) scapegoat. To Sethi, that explained the U-turn on a U-turn (from the stand against talks with India till it restored the changed status of J&K).“Now the PM says nothing doing until Article 370 is restored. Since that is not going to happen, wait for another U-turn sooner or later,” tweeted the journalist who once served as Punjab’s caretaker chief minister. But his version leaves unexplained as to how could there be a communication gap on such a vital matter between Rawalpindi and the civilian government it patronises. The question is relevant also because it was General Qamar Javed Bajwa, the incumbent army chief, who first made out a detailed case for Pakistan and India to “bury the past and move forward”.The general didn’t make an off-the-cuff remark. He made the point in his March 18 policy-laying address at the Islamabad Security Dialogue: “Stable India-Pakistan relation is a key to unlock the untapped potential of South and Central Asia by ensuring connectivity between East and West Asia....Our mature behaviour in the crisis situation with India manifested our desire to change the narrative of geo-political contestation into geo-economic integration.”The formulation bore a discernible newness. It read like a road map, predicated nevertheless on the “peaceful resolution” of the Kashmir dispute, without which “the process of sub-continental rapprochement would remain susceptible to derailment...” From the Pakistani perspective, limited imports from India made good business and economic sense. The idea ran into a wall in the absence of public diplomacy to contextualise the expedient push with domestic sugar scarcity and a failed cotton crop that has hit the apparel industry. It turned into a mess because the proposal flew in the face of Bajwa’s and Khan’s appeals to New Delhi to create a conducive (the general’s word) and enabling (the PM’s lexicon) environment in Kashmir for the resumption of a constructive-result oriented dialogue.No matter who put the cart before the horse, the civilian regime or the army or both, Sethi’s comment before the ECC’s proposal got junked by the Cabinet, was a neat summing up of the Pakistani flip-flop. He tweeted: “After India killed Article 370, we said it didn’t matter since we hadn’t accepted it in the first place. Then we protested and banned all trade and contacts until it (Kashmir’s special status) was restored. Now we are ready to “normalise” without restoration of Article 370. Great foreign policy strategy (sic)”. The veteran journalist wasn’t alone in flagging what came to be seen as a Pakistani climbdown. There were questions aplenty across the political spectrum and the media on the advisability of Pakistan reverting to “business as usual” without a cogent India revert on its calls for a conducive/enabling environment in Kashmir. Quite obviously, the civil-military establishment had no memory of the incremental peace approach that preceded and followed the 2003 border truce it chose to revive with India.Vajpayee’s statesmanship It was in the middle of Operation Parakaram triggered by the December 2001 terror attack on Indian Parliament, that Vajpayee made his famous April 18, 2003 “hand of friendship” speech in Srinagar. His overture caught many among his cabinet colleagues, unawares, including then external affairs minister Yashwant Sinha, who admitted as much in his book Relentless: An Autobiography.That Vajpayee had prepared the ground before going public with the dialogue offer became evident when the armies on either side started withdrawing troops that were eyeball-to-eyeball for over a year. But border de-escalation wasn’t enough to mobilise public support for another peace bid by the leader twice betrayed — in Kargil after his historic February 1999 bus-ride to Lahore on Nawaz Sharif’s invite and during the 2001 Agra summit with General Pervez Musharraf.Also Read | Pakistan’s failed quest to project soft powerEach time hopes of a dialogue rise, so do efforts at peace. It was an all-party delegation of Indian MPs to Pakistan, including those from the Bharatiya Janata Party, which the PM personally cleared, that lifted tack-two diplomacy from the conference rooms to the public domain. For the three days that their visit lasted, the Indian leaders, notably the Rashtriya Janata Dal’s Lalu Yadav, captured popular Pakistani imagination like never before. Almost overnight, talking friendship became fashionable. The climate for peace so indispensable for any dialogue to sustain was brought about by the saturation media coverage. Newspapers carried banner headlines; TV channels hosted leaders from both countries in discussions moderated by anchor-journalists from India and Pakistan.That happened in August 2003. In November came the formal ceasefire announcement about which General Musharraf had assured the visiting MPs (at a presidential reception) that it could happen with the ‘blow” of a whistle. The backchannels were active all this while between the Indian PM’s principal secretary, Brajesh Mishra and his Pakistani counterpart, Tariq Aziz, who served the Pakistan president in the same rank.A couple of months later came the substantive outcome of these efforts: Vajpayee and Musharraf signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) on January 6, 2004 on the sidelines of the SAARC summit in Islamabad. The agreement was Vajpayee’s most significant foreign policy achievement. Its import lay in Pakistan’s commitment to not permit use of any territory under its control to support terrorism in any manner. Yashwant Sinha, who saw it happening, explained: “(In the joint press statement), India’s readiness to resume the dialogue process...was made conditional on Pakistan’s promise to not allow territory under its control...for violence and terrorism against India. Implicit in it was the admission on Pakistan’s part that the territory under its control was indeed being used for such violence and terrorism..The theory that terror and talks could not go together flows out of this commitment.” To build on the climate supportive of talks, Vajpayee subsequently green signalled the Indian cricket team’s tour of Pakistan for what came to be known as the friendship series. In a call they made on him before departure, he asked the players to “not only win the matches in Pakistan but also the hearts of the people there...”The 2004 general elections were scheduled within weeks of the March-April cricket tour. Looking back, Vajpayee’s decision to delink relations with Pakistan from domestic political exigencies comes across as statesmanship at its prime. The cricketers returned victorious, winning hearts and the matches they played. But the BJP veteran lost the general elections for reasons other than reaching out to Pakistan.The foreign policy template he set cannot but be extolled for its broader objective of subcontinental reconciliation. He was the man who risked waging peace against the eventuality of war.On both sides of Wagah, Vajpayee statecraft and its outcome remain relevant. That is, if the quest for peace and economic prosperity is mutual and seriously strategic — not a one-off tactic. His initial effort set the table for discussing a paradigm shift — from the new borders objective to a no borders approach — to crack the Kashmir imbroglio. Returning to the Kashmir formula The discussions in the Manmohan Singh decade spanned three Pakistani dispensations: Musharraf, Asif Zardari and Nawaz Sharif. Mumbai happened when Zardari offered a nuclear doctrine of no first use to match India’s. The peace formula had, at its core, confidence building measures (CBMs) and jointly run overarching institutions that would give Kashmiris on both sides a way of life to which they get used to. As the late Pranab Mukherjee once told this writer in a private chat: “That’s the best way forward as the Kashmir issue cannot ever be settled vide a bilateral pact or treaty...” The interlocutor’s baton after Brajesh Mishra was held by Satinder Lambah, the former Indian High Commissioner to Islamabad. He said the backchannel agreement wasn’t outdated. It remained relevant, given its focus on the future of the two countries in a regime-agnostic way. Arguing similarly in a New York Times piece in March 2019, Pakistan’s well regarded foreign policy expert, Ahmed Rashid also felt the “way forward” for the two sides was in going back to what was deliberated from 2005-2014.The counsel makes sense as governments are a continuum.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/the-long-rocky-and-uncertain-story-of-india-pakistan-peacemaking-101617948174121.html

"We all have to work towards defeating the pandemic," the Congress leader said.On Wednesday, after the Maharashtra government said its vaccine stock would soon get over, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan dismissed the complaint and said it was a tactic to divert attention from the state's failure in managing the pandemic situation.The controversy over vaccine shortage soon snowballed into a Centre versus non-BJP states debate as Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh leaders alleged that the health minister singled out these two states as they are not BJP ruled.As Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope questioned why Gujarat got almost an equal amount of vaccine doses despite its population and infection rate being lesser than that of Maharashtra, Harsh Vardhan on Thursday said both Maharashtra and Rajasthan have been allocated the highest number of doses, and both are ruled by non-BJP parties.Holding a meeting of the chief ministers of all states and Union territories, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday said there is no need to panic as Centre will be replenishing the stocks continuously.Urging states to get maximum people inoculated, PM Modi said states should observe a 'vaccine festival' between April 11-14 to inoculate the maximum number of eligible beneficiaries. April 11 is also the birth anniversary of social reformer Jyotirao Phule, PM Modi said urging youngsters to help those above 45 years of age to get vaccinated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-shortage-not-festival-rahul-gandhi-s-dig-at-pm-modi-s-tika-utsav-101617946005548.html

Just after landing, the passenger was handed over to police with help of aviation security CISF.The spokesperson of the airline further said, "The matter was reported on landing at Delhi Airport to the police and necessary action has been initiated by AirAsia India based on regulations governing the safety and well being of aircraft and passengers under the disruptive passenger handling policy. As an airline that has consistently emphasised and worked towards the security and well being of our guests and crew, we have a zero-tolerance approach to disruptive behaviour on our flights and strongly condemn incidents of such nature."The Delhi police have registered a case against the passenger under the appropriate section.

The issue of illegal immigrants has become a chronic problem in India. Their deportation was talked about time and again but seldom were any steps taken in this direction,” said Gupta. “Now, how to deport them under the ambit of the law remains to be discussed and soon a decision should be taken on it.”Gupta called for a probe into how the Rohingya arrived in Jammu & Kashmir and who provided them Indian identity documents.The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stop the deportation of the refugees detained in a Jammu prison to Myanmar, noting that the right not to be deported can arise out of the fundamental right to settle in India which is available only to citizens.Also Read | SC rejects plea to stall deportation of Rohingyas from JammuHighlighting the Union government’s stand that the Rohingya posed a serious threat to the internal security of the country, the bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, also dismissed the plea to release them from the detention centre.There are close to 7,000 Rohingya refugees in Jammu & Kashmir.On March 6, on the instructions of the Union home ministry, the J&K administration started a verification drive of the Rohingya community, and moved some of them to a holding centre, pending their potential deportation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/former-j-k-deputy-chief-minister-welcomes-rohingya-verdict-101617939291953.html

"I am seeing this from day one and I have been putting up with all kind of statements. I choose not to open my mouth because I believe serving the people of India is our responsibility," PM Modi said.His comments comes after Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan accused Maharashtra of diverting people's attention from its dismal management of the pandemic by blaming the Centre for vaccine shortage. Shiv Sena, Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) leaders criticised Harsh Vardhan's specific attack, which appeared to be "politically motivated", they said. Apart from Maharashtra, the health minister also pointed out Chhattisgarh's failure in containing the spread of the infection. Both these states are non-BJP-ruled and are contributing the highest number of fresh infections to India's daily caseload.Centre says 43 million Covid vaccine doses in stock after shortage alarmPM Modi said there is no need to panic about the vaccine supply, and more focus should be given to increasing the number of testing.On Thursday, several vaccination centres in Maharashtra, Odisha were temporarily shut as there was no vaccine stock. Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan dismissed the claims and said the Centre is constantly monitoring the stock of the states. States have 4.3 crore vaccine doses wither in stock or are being in transit. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are the two states which have been given the highest number of doses, the health minister said, adding that both are non-BJP-governed states.Hue & cry by certain States about partisanship by the Union Govt is just a farce, an attempt to hide their own incompetence. Maharashtra and Rajasthan are 2 of the top 3 States based on allocation of #COVID19Vaccine doses. Both are non-BJP governed States. pic.twitter.com/ycrBcdJBXGThe information that the health minister shared shows Maharashtra has been allocated 1.06 crore doses of vaccines, while Rajasthan has got 1.04 crore doses and Gujarat 1.05 crore. Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Thursday questioned why Gujarat was given so many vaccine doses.States should not compete regarding the number of infections. "If more positive cases are being reported, test more, without coming under any pressure. "The evaluation that you are doing it badly if there are more cases is not right," PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/wont-say-anything-pm-modi-s-veiled-dig-at-covid-19-vaccine-politics-101617938263856.html

09-04-2021||India||Rafale jets deal ‘middleman’ paid in ‘secret commissions’: French report||Mediapart, a French online journal, claimed in the third part of its Rafale story on Thursday that it was in possession of documents that showed Dassault Aviation, which manufactures the Rafale jet, and its industrial partner Thales, a defence electronics firm, paid “middleman” Sushen Gupta several million euros in “secret commissions” in connection with the ₹59,000 crore deal for 36 jets for the Indian Air Force (IAF).In the third and final part of its investigation into the Rafale deal, the journal claimed that the payments to Gupta were channelled through offshore accounts and shell companies, using inflated invoices for software consulting. Gupta’s name figures in the AgustaWestland charge sheet.According to the journal, the bulk of the payments were made before 2013. “According to an accounts spreadsheet belonging to Sushen Gupta, an entity called simply “D”, which is a code he regularly used to designate Dassault, paid 14.6 million euros to Interdev in Singapore over the period 2004-2013,” the report said. It said Interdev was a shell company with no real activity, and administered by a straw man for the Gupta family.The report said according to another accounts spreadsheet belonging toGupta, which only covers the years 2004 to 2008, Thales paid 2.4 million euros to another shell company.Numerous controls are carried out by official organisations, including the French anti-corruption agency, and no violations were reported, notably in the framework of the contract with India for the acquisition of 36 Rafales, Dassault said in a statement on Thursday, adding that the plane maker acts in strict compliance with laws.“Since the early 2000s, Dassault Aviation has implemented strict internal procedures to prevent corruption, guaranteeing the integrity, ethics and reputation of the company in its industrial and commercial relations. In the context of the Sapin 2 law (anti-corruption law), the company has completed and strengthened its system for the prevention and detection of corruption and influence peddling, both at the level of the parent company and its subsidiaries,” the statement said.Thales did not respond to an HT query on the Mediapart report. The Enforcement Directorate also didn’t comment on the revelations.In the first part of its series that came out on Sunday, Mediapart claimed that Dassault Aviation paid €1 million to Gupta for the manufacture of 50 large replica models of Rafale jets, even though the plane-maker provided inspectors of French anti-corruption agency Agence Française Anticorruption (AFA) no proof that these models were made. The Congress on Monday demanded an independent investigation into the matter, even as law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad termed the report “baseless.”“As middleman for Dassault and Thales, Sushen Gupta, amid the discussions over the Rafale deal in 2015, obtained confidential documents from India’s defence ministry relating to the activities of the negotiating team. The Enforcement Directorate, in its official charge sheet against him, wrote that Gupta had gained ‘sensitive data which should have only been in possession of the Ministry of Defence’,” the Mediapart reported on Thursday.HT is reaching out to Gupta and will update the copy once he responds.The French website claimed that Dassault and European missile-maker MBDA worked hard to remove anti-corruption clauses from the Rafale fighter contract, which was subsequently signed by then French defence minister, now foreign minister, Jean-Yves Le Drian.“In July 2015, in an annexe to the contract concerning the weaponry of the jets, supplied by MBDA, the French side wrote into the text that the two anti-corruption clauses were “Not Applicable”. But the Indians deleted this and reintroduced the anti-corruption clauses,” according to the journal.“Those anti-corruption clauses could have had costly consequences for the industrialists, for they allow for India to rip up the contract and/or to demand compensation not only if acts of corruption are discovered, but also if the seller paid an agent in order to ‘intercede, facilitate or in any way to recommend [the seller] to the Government of India or any of its functionaries’,” the report claimed.François Hollande, who was French president between May 2012 and May 2017 said he was “at no moment informed of these aspects of the negotiation”, and that he, therefore, could “not have approved an eventual removal of these [anti-corruption] clauses,” the website said.It said it contacted MBDA, which replied that it “does not habitually comment on negotiations concerning contracts.”Six months later (after July 2015), in the contract proposed on January 13, 2016 by the French team, concerning Dassault’s supply of the aircrafts, the two anti-corruption clauses were again marked “Not Applicable,” the journal said.“According to a report in The Hindu, the Indian authorities finally approved the removal of the clauses in September 2016, just before the signing of the final contract, at a meeting presided by the Indian defence minister, Manohar Parrikar,” the journal reported.Dassault and Thales paid a lot for Gupta’s know-how in the defence sector, Mediapart claimed. “They hired him at the beginning of the 2000s, at the very moment when India announced it was looking to buy 126 fighter jets. According to evidence from the ED’s case file, the two French firms paid him several million euros over the 15 years leading up to the signature of the contract,” the report claimed.Gupta was investigated by Indian agencies over his role in the AgustaWestland VVIP chopper scam.ED and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) are probing allegations of money laundering in the 2007 contract for the purchase of 12 luxury VIP helicopters for use by top political leaders, including the President, the Prime Minister, and former PMs.The deal was cancelled in early 2014 over allegations of wrongdoing. Among the people named in the charge sheets filed by ED is Ratul Puri, the nephew of former Madhya Pradesh chief minister and senior Congress leader Kamal Nath.In the second part of its investigation, Mediapart reported on Tuesday that the former head of the financial crimes branch of France’s public prosecution services shelved an investigation into alleged evidence of corruption in the Rafale jet deal with India despite the objection of colleagues. Éliane Houlette, former head of the financial crimes branch of the public prosecution services, justified her decision to shelve the investigations as preserving “the interests of France, the workings of institutions”, Mediapart reported.French President Emmanuel Macron and his predecessor, François Hollande, were cited in allegations levelled in the case, the report said.Mediapart has written about the Rafale deal earlier too.In October 2018, it raised questions about the offset contract that was part of the Rafale deal. It said a senior official in Dassault Aviation saw the partnership with Anil Ambani’s Reliance Group as “imperative and mandatory” to getting the “export contract” with India for the Rafale aircraft.The National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) decision to enter a $8.7 billion government-to-government deal with France to buy 36 Rafale warplanes made by Dassault was announced in April 2015, with an agreement signed a little over a year later. This replaced the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime’s decision to buy 126 Rafale aircraft, 108 of which were to be made in India by the state-owned Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd (HAL).The deal became controversial, with the Opposition, led by the Congress, claiming that the price at which India is buying Rafale aircraft now is ₹1,670 crore for each, three times the initial bid of ₹526 crore by the company when the UPA was trying to buy the aircraft. It has also claimed the previous deal included a technology transfer agreement with HAL.The NDA has not disclosed details of the price, but the UPA deal, struck in 2012, was not a viable one, former defence minister Manohar Parrikar has previously said, implying that it would have never been closed and that, therefore, any comparison is moot. Indeed, the UPA was not able to close the deal till 2014, largely over discussions related to pricing of items not included in the initial bid.The NDA government has said that it cannot disclose the details of the price on two counts: a confidentiality agreement with France, and the strategic reason of not showing its hand to India’s enemies; however, it said that the current deal also includes customised weaponry.The Supreme Court heard a public interest case on the deal and in November 2019, said it saw nothing wrong in it.

09-04-2021||India||‘Follow due procedure’: Supreme Court rejects plea to stall Rohingya deportation||The Supreme Court on Thursday refused to stop the deportation of at least 150 Rohingya refugees detained in a Jammu prison to Myanmar, noting that the right not to be deported can arise out of the fundamental right to settle in India which is available only to citizens.Highlighting the Union government’s stand that the Rohingya posed a serious threat to the internal security of the country, the bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, also dismissed the plea to release them from the detention centre.There are close to 7,000 Rohingya refugees in Jammu & Kashmir, numbers that have increased since the late 2000s when they first arrived in the region after escaping from Myanmar, where they were facing religious persecution. India has previously deported Rohingya refugees.On March 6, on the instructions of the Union ministry of home affairs, the Jammu & Kashmir administration started a verification drive of the Rohingya, and moved some of them to a holding centre, pending their potential deportation.“It is true that the rights guaranteed under Articles 14 and 21 (right to equality and life) are available to all persons who may or may not be citizens. But the right not to be deported, is ancillary or concomitant to the right to reside or settle in any part of the territory of India guaranteed under Article 19(1)(e),” said the bench that included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.The bench also pointed out that India is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention, 1951 and thus, the Centre has emphasised that there was no obligation on it to follow the principle of ‘non-refoulment’ to restrain it from expelling a refugee who feared persecution in the home state. “Regarding the contention raised on behalf of the petitioners about the present state of affairs in Myanmar, we have to state that we cannot comment upon something happening in another country,” it added while underlining that a similar plea to stop deportation of Rohingya was rejected by the top court in 2018 as well.The bench, however, has added a caveat that Rohingya in Jammu, on whose behalf the application was filed, “shall not be deported unless the procedure prescribed for such deportation is followed.”Representing the Centre on March 26, solicitor general Tushar Mehta told the court that the procedure to deport Rohingya involved their identification and verification of their citizenship by the Myanmar government.On the last date, the Centre opposed the plea by applicant Mohammad Salimullah while emphasising that India cannot become “the international capital of illegal immigrants”.The government called the Rohingya “absolutely illegal immigrants” who posed “serious threats to national security” and also contended that the right to settle in India could not be asserted by illegal immigrants under the garb of the Constitution’s Article 21, which guarantees the right to life and liberty.Mehta added the Centre has begun the process of deporting Rohingya after receiving a confirmation from the Myanmar government regarding their nationality, and that the apex court should steer clear of the “diplomatic issue” since it fell within the exclusive domain of the executive.Representing the J&K administration, senior advocate Harish Salve had also cautioned the bench against “starting a dangerous trend” by interfering with a subject related to illegal immigrants and diplomatic relations with another country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/follow-due-procedure-supreme-court-rejects-plea-to-stall-rohingya-deportatio-101617927407136.html

He has now been admitted to the Basaguda field hospital for medical examination,” inspector general of police (Bastar range) Sundarraj P said.Some reporters accompanied the facilitators, including representatives of social groups, and recorded a video of his release. Visuals showed armed Maoists with their faces covered freeing the jawan tied with ropes.“The facilitators include Padmashree awardee Dharampal Saini from Mata Rukhmani Ashram Jagdalpur and Telam Boraiyya, senior leader of the tribal community in Bijapur. In the effort to release the jawan, local journalists Ganesh Mishra and Mukesh Chandrakar also played an important role,” the IG said.The Maoists earlier released a photograph of the 35-year-old which showed him sitting alone in what appeared to be a hut. Manhas is a commando with the 210th CoBRA battalion.His family in Jammu had appealed to the Centre to ensure he is released unharmed. He is the family’s sole breadwinner and has a five-year-old daughter.After he was released, his wife Meenu expressed her gratitude to the government and said, “Today is the happiest day of my life. I always remained hopeful of his return.

09-04-2021||India||Covid-19 in India: Hard lockdown ruled out, PM Modi says focus on testing||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday effectively ruled out the imposition of another hard national lockdown, defended his government’s approach to vaccination, and repeatedly and, at length, emphasised the importance of testing, tracing, and Covid-safe behaviour, which, he pointed out, helped India get the better of the first wave of Covid-19 infections in the country, and at a time when it was not even certain that a vaccine would be discovered to prevent the illness.Modi’s comments came at an emergency meeting with all chief ministers, during which he asked for 100% testing in containment zones and the tracing of at least 30 contacts within 72 hours to ensure symptomatic patients can be tracked quickly and further spread of disease can be prevented.With many states imposing partial lockdowns, there were fears in some quarters of a national lockdown, which would have hit a recovering economy hard, and the Prime Minister virtually ruled out the imposition of one.He also asked chief ministers to launch a special vaccination campaign from April 11-14 (meant to coincide with the birth anniversaries of Jyotirao Phule and BR Ambedkar) focused on zero wastage of doses.In the meeting, many CMs demanded more vaccines and suggested inoculation of younger people.The PM maintained that the Centre needs to prioritise vaccines depending on affected areas and suggested the states to reduce wastage of doses for better vaccination management.The Centre can’t just focus on one area, he said; it has to look at every one. He also added that work is on to enhance vaccine capacity.“Factories do not come up overnight,” he said.But time and again, the PM returned to testing.“Don’t take testing lightly. We must talk more about testing than vaccines and maximum emphasis has to be on testing. We must contain the human source of Covid and everyone must be tested in the containment zones,” Modi told the CMs and quipped that during the second wave, “we forgot testing and shifted (focus) to vaccines”.The PM prescribed that tests must be increased to achieve less than 5% positivity rates.The focus should be on reducing the case fatality rate, Modi said. Government officials have repeatedly pointed out that this is the government’s primary focus, and explained that it is the driving idea behind the prioritisation of vaccines.In the meeting, some states raised the issue of shortage of vaccines, but the Union health ministry pointed out that vaccines are not given for an extended period such as a month but for a maximum of 7-8 days.The states were also told that there is no shortage and replenishments will arrive every three or four days.Modi observed that in some states, the administration too is showing signs of weariness, even as people have become casual about following Covid-19-safe behaviour.“People have become casual and in most states the administration can be seen as weary,” the PM said, asking states to focus on the creation of well-defined micro-containment zones and renaming night curfews as corona curfews.Referring to criticism of the government’s management of the vaccine drive, the PM said he has been avoiding politicising the issue.“Those who want to do politics can continue to do so, but all of us must come together to prevail over the disease,” he said. Over the past two days, largely over the supply of vaccines, there have been sharp exchanges between the Centre and the states.On Thursday, Modi seemed to want to put an end to that and said no government should be held guilty for high number of cases.“Don’t think you have done wrong. If testing leads to more positive numbers, let it be. Our target has to be 70% RT-PCR tests,” he said, referring to the gold standard Covid-19 test. He also expressed concern and said he had heard that in many places, sampling was not being done properly.“If you don’t take samples properly, there will be wrong reports. If a person is detected positive, there will be treatment. Otherwise, the person will go undetected.”Asking for more speed in contact tracing to ensure no one remains untested, Modi called upon the young people of India to become role models of Covid appropriate behaviour.He also asked them to get involved in the vaccine drive by ensuring everyone eligible (all people over the age of 45 years) are vaccinated, especially in areas of high disease incidence.“We must also remember that after getting a vaccine, people should still be careful. From Day 1, I have insisted on dawai bhi, kadai bhi (we must take the inoculation and remain vigilant),” he said.The PM also asked states to involve governors and suggested that both the CM and the governor can address all elected representatives and reach out to social influencers such as religious leaders, artists, writers and civil society to build awareness of Covid-19-appropriate behaviour.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-in-india-hard-lockdown-ruled-out-pm-modi-says-focus-on-testing-101617925294364.html
09-04-2021||India||75-yr-old urges others to follow ‘vaccinated, protected’ mantra||With a prick of the injection of just my first dose, all my Covid related worries disappeared, said veteran hockey player Balbir Singh Randhawa, who got the first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine on March 3 along with his wife Bhupinder Kaur, 75, in Amritsar.“There was no reason to be afraid of the vaccine, especially the rumours of getting side-effects which circulated across social media,” Randhawa said. The two were administered the second dose of the Bharat Biotech manufactured Covaxin at the city’s Nayyar Hospital on April 7.Dismissing reports of side-effects as “rumours and myths”, Randhawa said that he had faith in the government, scientists working on the vaccines and the frontline workers. “People in India blindly follow rumours and believe in myths. As a responsible citizen, it is our duty to join hands with government and frontline workers and to step up for getting vaccinated. Being vaccinated, we will not only save our families from getting infected but also help in breaking the chain of infections,” he said.Many of his relatives, who reside in Canada, were hesitant about the vaccines and have now been infected, he said.“We were eagerly waiting for the vaccination drive. Many people aged over 60 were infected and many died. In the second wave of pandemic, more such cases will be reported. As soon as the drive started] we booked an appointment at the hospital, took the Covaxin jab and felt more than relieved,” he said.“The vaccine didn’t have any side effect on my body,” he said. Randhawa suffers from hypertension and diabetes.Before the vaccination drive began, the elderly couple adhered to all Covid-19 guidelines. “To avoid getting infected with the virus, I and my wife ensured that we always wear face masks and maintain social distancing in public places,” Randhawa said.The two also followed an exercise regimen and a healthy diet. “But a constant fear of getting infected was looming over my mind due to age and comorbidities,” Randhawa said.The former hockey player, who played for the Indian Navy’s team for 11 years, is now urging people to follow the “Vaccinated and Protected” mantra.“I urge all the people to get rid of hesitancy as the India-made vaccines are completely safe. Believe in Vaccinated and Protected mantra,” Randhawa said.“We are thankful to the medical fraternity and the government. People should shun apprehensions and get themselves vaccinated,” Kaur urged.Randhawa, however, added that people should not let their guard down even after getting vaccinated.“Despite being vaccinated, I follow every Covid safety guideline, including wearing mask at public places. Vaccine is just another layer of protection against the virus. Till the time everybody gets vaccinated, we must follow Covid appropriate behaviour.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/75yrold-urges-others-to-follow-vaccinated-protected-mantra-101617924431170.html
09-04-2021||India||India, China to hold 11th round of talks||Senior commanders of the Indian and Chinese armies will meet in eastern Ladakh on Friday to negotiate the next steps of a complex disengagement process that was completed in Pangong Tso in mid-February with the pullback of front-line troops and weapons, but is yet to make any headway at other friction points, officials familiar with the developments said on the eve of the dialogue.The 11th round of talks between corps commander-rank officers is expected to focus on outstanding problems with the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) at Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang, the officials said. It will begin on the Indian side of the Chushul-Moldo meeting point at 10.30am, they said.While disengagement began and ended in the Pangong Lake sector in less than 10 days, it appears to have lost its initial momentum going by the absolute lack of progress at other friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC), said a top retired commander, asking not to be named. “I don’t expect much from the dialogue as we are not building enough pressure on the Chinese.”The ministry of external affairs spokesperosn, Arindam Bagchi at weekly briefing on Thursday said, “We would like to see disengagement in the remaining areas, which would lead to de-escalation in eastern Ladakh and that would hopefully lead to restoration of peace and tranquillity and provide conditions for progress of our overall bilateral relationship.During the meeting on March 12 of the Working Mechanism on Coordination and Consultation (WMCC), both sides had agreed to convene the 11th round of the senior commanders meeting.”The 10th round of talks between corps commander-rank officers of the two armies took place on February 20 after the completion of disengagement on strategic heights on both banks of Pangong Tso. Both sides pulled back their front-line troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns under the disengagement agreement.At a marathon 16-hour meeting between senior commanders on February 20, the Indian and Chinese armies agreed to resolve outstanding issues at friction points on LAC in a “steady and orderly” manner, were unanimous that the Pangong Tso disengagement provided “a good basis” for resolving pending problems and decided to take forward the military dialogue to stabilise the ground situation in eastern Ladakh. China on Thursday said it was in contact with India to hold the 11th meeting of military commanders to resolve the tension along the LAC.Responding to a question on the meeting, the Chinese foreign ministry blamed India for the “situation” at the border but denied that the talks have been delayed though the 10th round was nearly seven weeks ago.“China and India are in communication for holding the 11th round of talks. There is no delayed meeting as you cited,” ministry spokesperson, Zhao Lijian said at the briefing on Thursday in response to a question.“I have no information about the upcoming talks,” he said, responding to a related question.“I want to stress that the merits of the situation at (the) India- China border are very clear and the responsibility does not rest with the Chinese side,” he said.“We hope Indian side will work with China to follow through the important consensus of our two leaders, abide by relevant agreements and treaties to de-escalate the tension at the border,” Zhao added.To a question on whether China will consider India’s proposal of restoring the status quo of April 2020, Zhao said: “For the proposal you mentioned I believe it should be talked in the meetings and I already made clear my position on the border issue just now.”The two neighbours have been locked in a standoff since May last year after Chinese troops impeded patrols by Indian forces. A brutal clash at Galwan Valley last June – which left 20 Indian soldiers and at least four Chinese troops dead and was the first incident on the LAC involving fatalities since 1975 – took bilateral ties to an all-time low.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-china-to-hold-11th-round-of-talks-101617924102715.html
09-04-2021||India||‘Was in wrong place at wrong time,’ says Deep Sidhu on R-Day violence||Actor-turned-activist Deep Sidhu, accused of inciting violence during the tractor rally by farmers on Republic Day, told a Delhi court on Thursday he did not incite the crowd at Red Fort that led to the hoisting of a religious flag at the historical monument and that he was merely exercising his “fundamental right” to protest.Additional sessions judge Nilofer Abida Parveen was informed by advocate Abhishek Gupta, Sidhu’s lawyer, that his client is not associated with any of the farm unions that are protesting against the three new agriculture laws and that the actor just happened to be at the “wrong place at the wrong time”. Gupta added that Sidhu was being made a “scapegoat” in the case that has become a “media trial”.“Right to protest is a fundamental right, that’s why I was there. Neither I indulged in violence, nor did I urge anyone to indulge in the violence,” Sidhu said in his submission to the court. Countering his statement, the public prosecutor for Delhi Police said fundamental rights do not mean that one can harm police officials.Sidhu was arrested by Delhi Police on February 9 for his alleged involvement in the January 26 violence.Gupta said Sidhu should be granted relief on grounds of parity as the other accused in the case had been granted bail. The prosecution opposed the bail application.“Hundreds of policemen were injured. Swords, sticks, etc, were used. Protesters tried to crush policemen under tractors. All this started only after hoisting of Nishan Sahib (flag) at the Red Fort, which the accused had instigated... In the name to fundamental rights they created violence,” the public prosecutor said.“He [Sidhu] was even helping the police, he hasn’t been a part of violence. Only people who have indulged in violence can be prosecuted. Mere presence does not make him a part of unlawful assembly... He is being made a scapegoat as he is a known face,” Gupta told the court.“FIR says that people broke the gates and climbed the rampart at 12.30pm. He reached there after 2pm,” the lawyer submitted. The court adjourned the matter for Monday and asked police for transcripts of Sidhu’s speeches.With inputs from PTI||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/was-in-wrong-place-at-wrong-time-says-deep-sidhu-on-r-day-violence-101617917351170.html

In Telangana which reported 965 positive cases for Covid-19 on April 1, the number shot up to 2055 cases by Wednesday night, according to a bulletin released by the state medical and health department on Thursday morning. The number of deaths rose from five to seven in a span of one week. In Andhra Pradesh, the number of Covid-19 positive cases, which was 1,271 on April 1 shot up to 2,558 on Thursday morning. The number of deaths has been steadily increasing steadily from three on April 1 to 11 on April 7, but it came down to six on Thursday. While ruling out fresh restrictions in the state despite a steady rise in the Covid-19 infections across the state, Andhra Pradesh chief minister Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy instructed the authorities to step up tracing, testing and treatment of the patients. He directed that all the 66 Covid-19 hospitals be equipped with all facilities in the event of a surge in the number of cases. He instructed that the private hospitals should not collect exorbitant fees from patients for treatment and there should be no scarcity of beds, oxygen units and ventilators. The Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams announced suspension of Sarva Darshanam (free darshan for common pilgrims) in the Tirumala temple with effect from April 12 on the lines of Shirdi temple in Maharashtra, in view of the spike in Covid-19 cases across the country in the recent times. “Pilgrims who obtained darshan tokens till April 11 evening only would be allowed, after which the queue lines would be closed,” the TTD said in a statement. However, the darshan for pilgrims in the ₹300 paid slots would continue.The TTD said the above decision was taken keeping in view the safety of devotees and any resumption of tokens in future would be formally announced. Another famous temple of Andhra Pradesh – Bhramaramba Mallikarjuna Swamy temple in Srisailam also reported a sudden spurt in the number of Covid-19 cases. According to a temple official, as many as 31 people in the temple administration, tested positive for Covid-19. In Hyderabad, the capital of Telangana, the merchants’ association in Begum Bazar, one of the busiest markets in the city, announced closure of shops in the evening hours with effect from Friday. In a statement, the Hyderabad Merchants Association said several traders were infected with Covid-19 in the last few days and accordingly, it was decided to keep the shops open only between 9 am and 5 pm, as a precautionary measure. “We also told traders not to open shops if they develop symptoms,” said association president, Laxminarayan Rathi, adding that all the shop keepers were asked to practise social distancing without failure and ensure the customers also practised the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-cases-in-andhra-telangana-breach-2-000-daily-mark-with-jump-in-infections-101617909408447.html
09-04-2021||India||Experts see rashes, allergies in Covid surge||BengaluruThe increasing cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in Bengaluru have also shown a higher number of people with relatively newer symptoms such as rashes, allergies, extreme fatigue and even eye infections, experts and medical practitioners said.At least two medical practitioners and members of Karnataka’s technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19 said that newer symptoms, which were not seen last year, were being reported among patients in the ongoing second wave in Karnataka and its capital, Bengaluru.“There is more severity and symptoms are also a little different this time. People are coming with allergies, rashes, fever with rashes, conjunctivitis, eye infection among others,” said Dr CN Manjunath, director of the Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research.He added that although diarrhoea was one of the symptoms last year as well, it has become a strong indicator of the infection in the second wave. He also listed symptoms such as abdominal pain, even vomiting.The symptoms may be on account of mutant strains of the virus, which may be also driving the surge in cases in the city, experts said -- though there isn’t enough genomic evidence to suggest that this is the case anywhere in India. Still, experts believe that much of the surge in Maharashtra is likely being caused by mutant versions of the virus. Bengaluru has seen an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases as people continue to move around freely without wearing masks, following social distancing or any other safety protocols.Bengaluru has been averaging over 3,000 cases for the past week and reported nearly 5,000 new Covid-19 infections on Wednesday, indicating the rapid pace of the spread. Bengaluru’s case load is reaching the levels of Delhi and it is among the top 10 worst impacted cities in the country.Experts said the second wave in Bengaluru could go on for another three more months before it starts to subside, if the experience in Europe and other countries is anything to go by. The vaccination drive has helped reduce the severity of cases among the pool that have been inoculated, but challenges remain in the younger population that may have undiagnosed comorbidities, said experts. The senior population has remained largely indoors since the outbreak of Covid-19 last year, but the working age-groups, between 18 and 45, continue to be at risk, they added.“A large number of elderly people with comorbidities have already got infected. Some of them died and many of them recovered. So, the susceptible pool in the community is now the younger age group. We know that the younger people withstand the virus better and mount a better response,” Dr V Ravi, former head of the neurovirology department at NIMHANS and member of Karnataka’s TAC on Covid-19, said.He, however, added that the younger people were showing newer symptoms like extreme fatigue and diarrhoea.“All mutations have not translated into different clinical phenotypes,” Ravi said, adding that there was absolute evidence of mutation only for UK, Brazilian and South African variants.Karnataka has 29 persons with the UK strain and three with the South African strain, according to government data. A March 2021 study by the Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bengaluru said that the SARS-CoV-2 virus was mutating at a faster rate in Bengaluru than in the rest of the country. The study found 27 mutations in three isolates of SARS-CoV-2 with over 11 mutations per sample, while the national average is 8.4 and the global average is 7.3.A study by Hyderabad’s CSIR-Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology, has found around 7,684 mutations of SARS-CoV-2 in India.The study has been published in the Journal of Proteome Research.In Bengaluru, the severity of the cases has gone up and the same has been acknowledged by health authorities.“Mortality among young, mid-age groups is a cause for concern,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health, family welfare and medical education minister said on Tuesday.Of the 4,719 Covid-19 related deaths reported in Bengaluru so far, over 800 were between the ages of 19 and 50, according to government data.There is an average of 11-19% of those infected who have been shifted to hospitals or Covid care centres in Bengaluru, according to data by the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/experts-see-rashes-allergies-in-covid-surge-101617908627854.html
09-04-2021||India||Over 131,000 new Covid cases logged in India, active cases near 1 million again||India on Thursday reported 131,830 new cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), the third day in a row that the country has set yet another record for single-day infections, as the second wave of the viral outbreak continued a relentless expansion far beyond anything seen during the previous wave of the disease.The number of cases recorded on Thursday was a sharp increase from the 126,260 new infections reported even a day earlier, and represents a surge that has been steadily growing for nearly two months now. Deaths also continued to rise, with 802 new fatalities reported in a span of 24 hours, according to HT’s dashboard.The seven-day average of cases across India has touched 107,963, the highest for any country in the world currently, and has comfortably surpassed the first wave in the country when this number peaked at 96,317 for the week ending September 16.Daily infections, which surpassed 100,000 for the first time this Monday, have now exceeded that mark four times in the past five days. The spike, much faster than last year’s first wave, has caught the authorities by surprise. The government blames the resurgence mainly on crowding and a reluctance to wear masks as shops and offices have reopened.Meanwhile, in yet another alarming trend, the number of active cases in the country is again nearing the million mark. After Thursday’s tally, there are 979,384 active cases in the country. Active cases – those Covid-19 patients still under treatment – is a crucial metric because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system for any region. It is calculated by subtracting the number of recovered patients and deaths from the total tally. During the peak of the first wave, the number of active cases in India crossed the million-mark in September, but started dropping since. This receding trend, however, reversed in February with the start of India’s second Covid wave.At least 10 states – Maharashtra, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Kerala and Punjab – have shown a massive rise in the daily Covid-19 cases from the middle of February, according to data. There were 56,286 new infections in Maharashtra, which continued to dominate the national figures, accounting for 43% of all infections reported in the country on Thursday. It is followed by Chhattisgarh with 10,652 while Uttar Pradesh reported 8,474 new cases. Delhi was on the fourth spot with 7,437 new cases on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-131k-new-cases-logged-active-cases-near-1mn-again-101617908087637.html
09-04-2021||India||At meeting with PM Modi, CMs share vaccination concerns||Maharashtra’s Uddhav Thackeray urged Centre to dispatch more doses and Punjab’s Amarinder Singh sought greater flexibility in deciding eligibility, highlighting issues relating to the coronavirus vaccination during their meeting on Thursday with Prime Minister Narendra Modi.The meeting was held against the backdrop of an unrelenting build-up of a second wave of infections. The spike has stressed resources in several hard-hit states and in recent days also frayed their relationship with the Union government, with a war of words breaking out this week over vaccine supply.“We aim to vaccinate 17.70 million people and for this we need 4million vaccines weekly. At this moment, we are facing shortage due to which many centres have shut. We are going to get 1.7 million vaccines on April 15 but till then our vaccination drive will be interrupted,” a Maharashtra government official cited the CM as saying.Thackeray also asked the Centre to source oxygen cylinders and ventilators from other regions for Maharashtra.The meeting was attended by chief ministers of all states and union territories, except Bengal’s Mamata Banerjee, who was represented instead by the chief secretary. All chief ministers did not speak at the meeting.Singh sent a letter to the PM immediately after the video conference, asking the central government to come up with a locally flexible vaccination strategy that could allow all adults in a high prevalence area to be immunised, as well as those with liver and kidney diseases under the age of 45 to become eligible.“The CM also assured the PM during the meeting of all-out efforts by the state government and in his letter stressed on the fact that Punjab’s wave of infections was being dominated by the UK variant, which has been found in a large number of samples,” an official said, asking not to be named.Singh urged the Union government to share vaccine shipment timelines in advance and asked that genome surveillance to detect the spread of variants be accelerated.Maharashtra and Punjab are among a clutch of several states, mostly under non-BJP governments, that have raised concerns of vaccine shortage or sought permission to give doses to people under the age of 45 – which the current central government vaccination policy prohibits at present.The Prime Minister defended the vaccination strategy, saying it was at par with other countries, and said the centre needs to prioritise vaccines depending on affected areas, while suggesting states to reduce wastage of doses for better vaccination management.Singh told the PM that his administration believes the spread in Punjab has primarily been driven by a public fatigue in following Covid-appropriate behaviour, large political, social and religious gatherings, and the opening of schools and colleges.In the case of Maharashtra, Thackeray told the PM the spike appeared to have been driven by recent rural elections and rise in weddings, as well as a mutant variant. “From the last one and half years, we have been fighting this virus under your leadership. We had even succeeded in curbing this virus as new cases fell to 2,500-3,000 level. However the consequent Gram Panchayat elections and rush in weddings contributed to increase in number of cases. We saw whole families getting infected in parts of Vidarbha. Despite all precautions, Maharashtra had to bear the brunt,” said Thackeray.The chief minister of Uttarakhand, where concerns of the outbreak being fanned further is high due to the Kumbh Mela, held a review with state officials after the PM’s meeting and asked for RT-PCR testing as well as vaccinations to be increased in frequency.Chief ministers of several other states too held meetings with their administration officials following the PM’s video conference and asked for preparations to be made for the April 11-14 “vaccination festival”. Andhra Pradesh chief minister YS Jagan Mohan Reddy set a target for at least 600,000 people to get doses every day in the period, while Telangana’s K Chandrasekhar Rao asked authorities concerned to ensure all frontline workers are vaccinated within the next week.Manipur chief minister Nongthombam Biren Singh and Goa’s Pramod Sawant too decided to mobilise the state machinery for the April 11-14 campaign.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/at-meeting-with-pm-cms-share-vaccination-concerns-101617908028222.html
09-04-2021||India||Centre trying to politicise Covid-19 vaccination drive: States||States have reacted sharply to the Centre’s claim of below par vaccination in Maharashtra, Punjab, Chhattisgarh and Delhi saying the Centre is trying to politicize Covid vaccination in opposition ruled states with Chhattisgarh health minister T S Singhdeo terming this disappointing and unfortunate.Health minister Harsh Vardhan, in a Wednesday letter, flagged low vaccination of eligible beneficaries saying the performance of these states on vaccination was below national average and they were raising Covid vaccine shortage issues to “hide” their vaccination failure and spreading panic among people by demanding vaccination of all without inoculating enough eligible beneficiaries.Following the minister’s letter, union additional health secretary Manohar Agnani said that the performance of these states and UT were below the national average of 85.8% of health care workers vaccinated and needed improvement. Agnani urged these states to undertake immediate necessary corrective actions towards improving the performance of Covid-19 vaccination drive in their regions.Reacting to the two letters claiming that Maharashtra was not able to use the vaccines made available, state health minister Rajesh Tope said his government has told the Centre that it needs 4 million vaccine doses every week as the state seeks to accelerate its vaccine drive, but that the Centre has actually reduced the allocation.“How can a state that has the most number of Covid cases in the country get fewer vaccine doses than Gujarat? Tope asked. Gujarat’s population is half of Maharashtra, their active cases is 17,000. Still Gujarat got 10 million vaccine doses and we got 14 million, he said, claiming Bharatiya Janata Party ruled states such as Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Haryana have got higher vaccine doses than Maharashtra.Trying to strike a balance, NCP chief Sharad Pawar said, the Central government is cooperating with the state government in these tough times. “We all have to come together and fight this menace. The State and Centre both have to come together and find out a way to fight the pandemic.”Singhdeo said he was ‘disappointed’ by Union minister Harsh Vardhan’s statement targeting Chhattisgarh for “incited vaccine hesitancy”.“When we talked on the day he was having meeting with the health ministers, the union minister had said that we are working as a team…his statement does not give me the sense of being part of the same team,” Singhdeo said.“We shared everything – figures, targets, deficiencies at the meeting only and after sharing that if the statement like this comes then it is very disappointing,” said Singhdeo.He was reacting to Harsh Vardhan’s statement that regular comments by leaders from Chhattisgarh on vaccination are intended to spread misinformation and panic and he would urge the state to focus its energies on ramping up health infrastructure rather than on petty politicking.Delhi health minister, Satyendar Jain took a dig at the union health ministry saying the low vaccination rate among healthcare workers in Delhi is because of low turnout at the four Centre-run hospitals in Delhi.“The Centre said that vaccination is less among health care workers in Delhi, but even we can say that it is because the Central government hospitals saw less vaccination. Only 30 or 40% people in Central government hospitals (where Covaxin was provdied) have been immunised. In Delhi government hospitals, 75% have been immunized,” he said.Hesitancy for the vaccine was high in January, owing to the lack of phase III efficacy data for Covaxin and the issue was highlighted by resident doctors from Dr Ram Manohar Lohia hospital, he said.He added that the fight against coronavirus is not a Centre versus state issue and should not be politicised. “I would say our common fight is against the coronavirus pandemic, and it is not a state vs Centre thing. So, we should not politicise the issue, and fight it together.”“The vaccination drive is going well in Delhi; we have received some vials yesterday. The vaccination stock is available for four to five days with us. We will be receiving it continuously as per our demand.”The Centre’s letter mentioned that the coverage among frontline workers and those above the age of 45 was higher in Delhi than the national average. Till Wednesday evening, 73.24% of the registered frontline workers received their first dose as against a national average of 71.1%. And, 40.98% received their second dose as against the national average of 29.97%. The coverage among those above the age of 45 years stands at 18.66% in Delhi as against the national average of 16.71%, said Delhi government officials, quoting the letter.Punjab health minister Balbir Sidhu said that Vardhan’s statements “may demoralise health and frontline workers”. “We all should stay united in this fight and everyone is trying to give its best to end the pandemic. Statements about pin-pointing states by alleging that they are not doing enough, may demoralise the health and frontline workers who are giving their best in these tough times,” said Sidhu, adding that he will write a letter to the Union health minister in this regard on Friday.“We have been demanding vaccination for working population below 45 also as they are the one who are becoming more infectious as they have to go out for jobs and other purposes. But Centre is silent on the issue. We have taken up the issue with PM this evening as well,” Sidhu said.Jharkhand Health Minister Banna Gupta on Thursday reiterated the state’s demand for vaccines saying they are left with stock for a couple of days. “We have stock for the next 1-2 days. We have made a request to the Union Health Minister and I am hopeful that he will provide the vaccines,” he said. So far, six states have informed the Centre about shortage of vaccines leading to slowing down of vaccinations in the state.(With inputs from states bureaus)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-trying-to-politicise-drive-states-101617908027712.html
09-04-2021||India||As Covid-19 cases rise in India, more states impose curbs||Four more states on Thursday imposed restrictions on movement of people, activities, the nature of establishments that can be open (and the duration for which they can be), joining several other regions that have been forced to reintroduce lockdown-like curbs with the second wave of the coronavirus disease raging across the country.While Madhya Pradesh announced a weekend lockdown in all urban areas and a complete lockdown in five districts till April 17, Karnataka announced night curfew in six cities including capital Bengaluru and Mysuru even as Tamil Nadu banned on all religious gatherings from April 10 till April 30 and Uttar Pradesh government clamped night curfews in some districts of the state.There were also reports of migrant workers in some states rushing to their home towns fearing a complete lockdown such as the one imposed by the central government last year, although the Prime Minister made it clear in a meeting with chief ministers on Thursday that a hard lockdown wasn’t even being considered.Through the week, weekend lockdowns have been imposed in parts of Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh, while Delhi, Punjab, major cities in Gujarat and urban areas of Rajasthan have announced night curfews. Almost all states have limited the capacity of restaurants and bars and banned public events.On Thursday, the Madhya Pradesh home department imposed a complete lockdown in five districts. In Chhindwara, the lockdown will come into effect from 6pm on Thursday and remain in force till 6am on April 16; in Betul, Khargone, Katni and Ratlam, the restrictions will be from 6pm to 6am between April 9 and April 17. Madhya Pradesh, which reported 4,324 new cases on Thursday, has already seen its case rate soar to levels far beyond the first wave.In Tamil Nadu, two days after voting was held for the assembly elections, chief secretary Rajeev Ranjan banned all religious gatherings and public celebrations for festivals from April 10. The government also prohibited retail sales in Chennai’s Koyambedu vegetable market, which emerged as a Covid-19 hot spot during the first wave of infections last year.To be sure, the restrictions in the state come after parties across the political spectrum flouted all Covid-safety protocols with impunity with local health departments, the Union health ministry, and the Election Commission all turning a blind eye.The chief secretary also reduced the occupancy at eateries by half and directed that all business established be shut by 11pm. In addition to these social restrictions, the state has also ordered that no passengers will be allowed to travel standing in buses. There were 4,276 new cases in Tamil Nadu on Thursday, the highest single-day increase in the state in 173 days.In Tripura, a day after chief minister Biplab Deb tested positive, the government closed all public gyms and recreation centres located in government buildings. Gatherings for sports events, government programmes in pubic halls and biometric attendance have also been suspended, officials said on Thursday.The Uttar Pradesh government, meanwhile, has imposed a night curfew in Noida. On Thursday, the state set a an all-time record for the most number of new infections reported in the state in a single day – 8,474. The state, along with Odisha and Maharashtra has also restricted the number of people visiting government offices.As reports of migrant workers leaving Gujarat’s most severely affected districts, Surat and Ahmedabad, emerged, the state government clarified that the numbers of those returning to their home states were not high. Gujarat is also among the worst-hit regions in the country, and like MP, the seven-day average of infections in the state has surpassed first wave records.“There are no formal reports which suggest that a large number of migrants are leaving. However, we have asked district authorities to ensure that workers do not face any trouble,” news agency PTI quoted state additional chief secretary, labour and employment, Vipul Mittra as saying.In Ahmedabad, a number of migrant workers, mostly hailing from Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, have been rushing to the city’s Kalupur railway station, said Yogesh Mishra, member of the Zonal Rail Users Consultative Committee.The migrants are apprehensive that they will be stranded or forced to travel on foot if a lockdown is imposed, Mishra said. The waiting list for reserved seats in trains has also increased, he added. The Gujarat high court earlier this week suggested the imposition of a lockdown after a steep rise in cases.Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, however, has ruled out a lockdown in the state, adding that celebrations for the Assamese New Year, Rongali Bihu, next week will be held with precautions.“Last year, we were not able to celebrate Bihu due to Covid-19. It affected lot of people associated with the celebrations. This year, we will hold celebrations and some SOPs (standard operating procedures) will be introduced,” he said.Addressing mediapersons, Sarma said that the state will increase the number of tests to 100,000 daily from the about 50,000 tests on Thursday.“We have decided to increase testing to around 100,000 daily in the next few days. Due to this we are likely to see a rise in number of positive cases,” he said.On Wednesday, Assam recorded 195 new cases in the highest single day-spike this year belying Sarma’s recent claim that “there was no Covid” in the state in a TV interview where he was explaining why masks were redundant in Assam . Of these, 104 new cases were recorded in state capital Guwahati. At present there are 847 active Covid-19 cases in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-cases-rise-more-states-impose-curbs-101617907967713.html
09-04-2021||India||Not in favour of appointment of ad hoc judges, Centre tells Supreme Court||The Centre on Thursday told the Supreme Court that it was not in favour of appointing ad hoc judges in high courts until recommendations for all regular appointments were not made by chief justices of the courts concerned.As on April 1, all 25 high courts in the country had a vacancy of 411 judges -- more than a third of the total positions. There were only 669 judges out of the total sanctioned strength of 1,080. Moreover, there have been no recommendations from high courts for 214 of the 411 vacancies, people familiar with the development said.The bench was hearing a public interest litigation by NGO Lok Prahari that sought appointment of ad hoc judges to tackle the ever-mounting pendency of cases in the high courts.Conveying its views before a bench headed by Chief Justice of India S A Bobde, the government said that the constitutional provision regarding appointment of ad hoc judges should be resorted to only after all the sanctioned vacancies in the 25 high courts are filled.“The pendency of cases is alarming and some urgent steps are required. The stand of the Union is not adversarial. However, the stand is that let all recommendations be made, vacancies be filled up and then provision under Article 224 A (regarding ad hoc judges) should be used,” additional solicitor general (ASG) R S Suri, appearing for the government, told the bench which included justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant.“If all vacancies are filled up, there may not be a need at all to have ad hoc judges. That’s the wisdom of the government. There should be no incentives to appoint ad hoc judges in lieu of making regular appointments. Chief justices of high courts should first make recommendations for filling up the sanctioned vacancies,” Suri added.At this, the top court clarified that the idea behind having temporary judges in the high courts emanated from the necessity of urgently dealing with the massive pendency of cases and that it could not be understood as a substitute for regular appointments.“Regular appointment will go on but ad hoc judges are there to help high courts in the interregnum till the process of regular appointment is not over… on principle, ad hoc judges can’t be in lieu of regular appointments and that’s why we want to keep the Supreme Court collegium in the loop on these temporary appointments. None of us are of the view that this can be used in lieu of making regular appointments,” the bench said.It, however, added that certain guidelines will have to be laid down regarding the volume of pendency when ad hoc judges should be appointed in a particular high court and the procedure to be followed while making these appointments.The bench also asked senior advocate Arvind Datar, who represented the Orissa high court, to convene a meeting with the lawyers of the other high courts and suggest common points about the way forward.“Convene a conference and collate your points and give us a joint perspective on when the high court chief justices should initiate the process, for how long the tenure of ad hoc judges should be and how many judges should be appointed. Also, tell us about the process of appointment,” the bench told Datar, and adjourned the matter to April 15.More than 40 lakh cases are pending before the high courts, according to the National Judicial Data Grid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/not-in-favour-of-appointment-of-ad-hoc-judges-centre-tells-sc-101617906407523.html
09-04-2021||India||Court orders ASI panel to survey Gyanvapi mosque in Varanasi||A Varanasi court on Thursday ordered an archaeological survey of a centuries-old mosque complex abutting the famous Kashi Vishwanath temple, saying the exercise is required to decide on pleas that allege the mosque was built by Mughal emperors after partially demolishing a Hindu shrine.Civil judge (senior division) Ashutosh Tiwari ordered a five-member committee, comprising two Hindu, two Muslim members and an archaeological expert, to oversee the “comprehensive physical survey”. A court-appointed observer will chair this panel.The Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) will conduct the exercise at its expense without any media briefings, the judge ordered. The court fixed May 31 as the next date of hearing.“This court finds that survey by ASI alone can bring truth of the matter before this court. Irrespective of what surfaces, the survey by ASI may go on to help not only to the plaintiffs, but also to the defendants, if their version is indeed true,” the order read.Muslim parties opposed the decision and said they will approach the Allahabad high court.The decision came on a clutch of petitions that claimed that Mughal emperor Aurangzeb demolished a portion of the Kashi Vishwanath temple to build the Gyanvapi Masjid in the 17th century, and demanded that the land on which the mosque stands be restored to Hindu parties.The religious dispute – similar to the one in Ayodhya that was resolved in 2019– is decades old and first reached the courts in 1991, when local Hindu priests sought permission to worship in the mosque area. The hearing was later suspended by the Allahabad high court.But the case gained steam in December 2019 when Vijay Shankar Rastogi filed an application in the civil court as the next friend of the presiding deity of the temple, Swayambhu Jyotirling Bhagwan Vishweshwar. Rastogi demanded that the mosque area be surveyed. Rastogi claimed in his petition that Mughal rulers had demolished a part of the temple and illegally built a mosque. In law, a next friend is a representative of someone incapable of maintaining a suit directly.The petition came roughly a month after the Supreme Court paved the way for the construction of a Ram temple in Ayodhya, resolving a decades-old religious dispute at the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid site. “The survey will bring out facts that we have been saying for so long,” Rastogi said.Abhay Nath Yadav, who represented the Uttar Pradesh Sunni Central Waqf Board, expressed his dissatisfaction and said he would challenge the order in the Allahabad high court. Anjuman Intezamia Masjid Committee, which runs the Gyanvapi Masjid, also opposed the decision. “I am dissatisfied with the decision and will challenge it in the court,” said committee’s joint secretary SM Yasin.The Gyanvapi mosque dispute, along with a similar row in Mathura, was a core part of the Hindutva agenda in the 1980s but largely petered out after 1991, when the then Narasimha Rao government passed a law freezing lawsuits to reclaim any place of worship after India was declared independent in 1947, except Ayodhya.In effect, this meant that seers and Hindu activists put movements in Mathura and Varanasi on the backburner and focused their energies on the Ram Janmabhoomi. But ground mobilisation picked up in 2019 after the Supreme Court favoured the Hindu parties in the Ram Janmabhoomi-Babri Masjid title suit. Last month, the top court agreed to review the 1991 law, boosting the hopes of Hindu activists.The Sunni Central Waqf Board said that the case was barred under the 1991 law. “Even otherwise, we can say as per legal advice that the order of survey is questionable because technical evidence can only supplement certain foundational facts. No evidence has been produced before the court that suggests that there was a prior existing temple at the site of the mosque...this practice of mosques being ‘investigated’ by the ASI has to be stopped,” said said Zufar Ahmad Faruqi, chairman of the board.In its order, the court said it was unable to determine whether the mosque was built illegally after partially demolishing a Hindu shrine. It held that revenue department records – which showed that a mosque stood on the site – was not enough.The court said the five-member panel will find out if the mosque at the site was a superimposition, alteration or addition, and if a Hindu shrine ever existed before the mosque was built. During the survey, devotees shouldn’t be prevented from offering prayers and, if necessary, alternative places within the mosque premises should be provided. The work will be done under strict security and without media reporting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/court-orders-asi-panel-to-survey-gyanvapi-mosque-in-varanasi-101617906347502.html
09-04-2021||India||No names finalised as CJI holds collegium meet||Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde’s final push for the collegium to make its first recommendation of a judge to be appointed to the Supreme Court during his 14-month tenure has fallen short, making him perhaps the first CJI in the judicial history to earn this unsought distinction.The meeting on Thursday failed to finalise any name for appointment to the Supreme Court, in what was possibly the last such meet to be headed by Justice Bobde in his tenure, people familiar with the matter said.Justice Bobde will be the first CJI in the judicial history who will retire without making recommendation for a single appointment in the top court despite having a term of more than a year after the advent of the collegium system in 1990s. He retires on April 23.Even during an unprecedented standoff between the judiciary and the central government over the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) that aimed to redefine the appointment process, the then CJI, HL Dattu, made one appointment; of justice Amitava Roy in February 2015.On Thursday, the CJI had a brief meeting with the other members of the collegium, which includes justices NV Ramana, Rohinton F Nariman, Uday U Lalit and AM Khanwilkar. The meeting took place even as the notification for appointment of Justice Ramana as the next CJI had come through two days ago. The meeting was held as agreed upon by the five senior judges in their last meet on March 17.Some of the names of HC judges were briefly discussed in the meeting but the deliberation remained inconclusive, and no decision was taken on recommending any name to the central government for the elevation, the people cited above said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-names-finalised-as-cji-holds-collegium-meet-101617906227474.html
09-04-2021||India||Supreme Court junks pleas against CBI probe in Maharashtra||The Supreme Court on Thursday cleared the decks for a Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) probe into allegations of extortion against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh, underscoring that “the nature of allegations and personas involved needs an inquiry by an independent agency”.Terming the investigation “a matter of public confidence”, the bench headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul dismissed petitions by Deshmukh and the Maharashtra government appealing against a Bombay high court order for a CBI probe passed on Monday.The bench, which also included justice Hemant Gupta, emphasised during the hearing that the probe by an agency from outside the state was imperative since the personalities involved were the home minister of a state and a former police commissioner (Param Bir Singh).“Will it not be a case of a CBI investigation when personas involved are home minister and a police commissioner? The two personas were closely working together till they fell apart. Both of them hold very important positions and that’s why an independent agency must inquire...it is not a case of a political or a business rivalry. It is a case between a very senior officer and a senior minister,” the bench told senior advocates Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Kapil Sibal, who represented the state government and Deshmukh, respectively.The bench affirmed the high court order, which took note of accusations by former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh that Deshmukh asked policemen, including suspended officer Sachin Vaze, to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants, and other establishments. The allegations followed drama over police investigations into the discovery of an explosives-laden vehicle outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani, and the alleged murder of a man linked to the car. Vaze is the main accused in both cases according to the national Investigating Agency.The top court also took a critical view of the fact that the Mumbai Police did not register an FIR following Singh’s allegations and Deshmukh chose not to step down after a judicial inquiry was initiated under a retired high court judge.“Everything happened at the time when he (Deshmukh) was the home minister. The allegations were levelled when he was the home minister. He battled it out till the high court order was passed. He didn’t even resign after the judicial inquiry was ordered. He resigned only after the high court order. This shows that he was clinging to his office,” said the bench, rejecting an argument that there was no need for an outside agency to probe the matter now that Deshmukh has resigned.Deshmukh resigned on Monday, hours after the order by the high court asking CBI to conclude a preliminary inquiry within 15 days, making him the most high-profile casualty so far in a case that started with the discovery of the explosives and the death of Mansukh Hiran, the man linked to the car.On Thursday, Deshmukh’s lawyer Sibal questioned the propriety of the high court order, saying he would be very happy if the Supreme Court lays down a legal principle that a CBI probe should take place in every case involving allegations against high officials, even if these are unsubstantiated and based on hearsay.But the bench retorted: “We will also be very happy if we don’t come across a case where a police commissioner raises such allegations against a home minister...he was once your right hand and now he made these allegations. Let an independent agency look at it now. If you are clear, you are clear.”The Maharashtra government argued that it had withdrawn general consent to CBI to probe matters in the state, and the high court order would impact the “federal structure”.However, the judges remained unmoved: “There is no issue of federalism here. It is a particular episode and it doesn’t happen every day. So, there is no question of federal structure. They both have been heads of important institutions where things have gone seriously wrong.”The bench further rejected a request by Nationalist Congress Party leader Deshmukh and the Maharashtra government to hand over the probe to a special investigation team that could be picked by the top court. “You cannot pick and choose the agency that should probe,” it said.Responding to Sibal’s objection that his client (Deshmukh) was not even heard by the high court before the order was passed, the apex court said that there was no such requirement in law to hear Deshmukh at this stage since the order was only for a preliminary enquiry.Senior lawyer Mukul Rohatgi was present in the court to represent Singh but he was not required to argue since the bench passed its final order after hearing the counsel for Deshmukh and the Maharashtra government.CBI on Tuesday night registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) into the episode and examined Jaishri Laxmanrao Patil, one of the petitioners before the high court whose plea led to the order. On Thursday, it recorded the statements of Singh, ACP Sanjay Patil, and Vaze.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-junks-pleas-against-cbi-probe-in-maha-101617906047430.html
09-04-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccines: Is there real shortage in Odisha, Maharashtra? | All you need to know||Contradictory claims over vaccine stock have been made since Maharashtra on Wednesday said that its vaccine stocks are depleting as it has massively increased the number of daily vaccinations. Several other states, including Odisha, claimed vaccination shortage. On Thursday, vaccination centres in Maharashtra, Odisha remained shut as those centres ran out of vaccines doses. The Centre has strongly refuted the claims.Here is all you need to know about the present claims of vaccine shortage:> The Centre has reiterated that there is no vaccine shortage in the country. And such a situation will not arise as vaccine distribution in being constantly monitored centrally.> The alarms the states are raising are pre-emptive. For example, Maharashtra on Wednesday said its vaccine stock would last for three days. On Thursday, health minister Rajesh Tope said that Centre has increased its one-time allocation from 7 lakhs to 17 lakhs doses, which presumably will tide over the situation.> Odisha has also written to the health ministry asking for additional allocation of vaccine doses as nearly 50 per cent of the centres were shut on Thursday as there were no vaccines. In Maharashtra too, several vaccine centres were temporarily shut on Thursday.> Vaccine shortage can also take place because of the percentage of wastage. If one vaccination centre records more wastage than another, its stock will naturally be depleted soon. So this shortage also depends on specific vaccination centre.> As all states are now increasing their daily vaccination capacity, their one-time allocation is getting over sooner than before. The Centre has warned states and Union territories against hoarding vaccines.> All states are not allocated an equal number of doses. The doses that the Centre allots to a state or a UT depends on its population, its pace of vaccination.> Supplying vaccines to states is an ongoing process and there is no one-time allocation of vaccines to states and UTs.> The issue became a political one as Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Wednesday issued a statement chastising Maharashtra and Chhattisgarh for "spreading panic among people".> Maharashtra has the maximum number of people vaccinated but the percentage of its healthcare workers, frontline workers, senior citizens inoculated against the virus is not impressive, the health ministry has accused. The Maharashtra government, on the other hand, accused the Centre of allotting fewer doses to Maharashtra in comparison with Gujarat.> India is administering Bharat Biotech's Covaxin and Serum Institute of India's Covishield. Both are ramping up their production to meet the increased demand of vaccines in India after vaccination drive was opened to everyone above the age of 45.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccines-why-maharashtra-odisha-complaining-of-shortage-all-you-need-to-know-101617874637784.html
09-04-2021||India||As forest fires rage in Uttarakhand, spotlight back on colonial-era problem||Around 1,400 such incidents since January in Uttarakhand’s lower hills have put a spotlight on forest fires in the state, where 4,500-hectare forest area was damaged in infernos in 2016 alone. Experts blame pine tree plantation, encouraged by Britishers as part of their focus on commercial forestry, and inaction by successive governments for the failure in controlling the fires.Pine needles are highly combustible and are the main triggers for the fires. Experts say before the colonial period, forests were a major source of sustenance for the locals, who sourced fodder, fuelwood, timber, fruits and construction material from them and had high stakes in protecting and conserving them collectively. The Britishers declared forests as reserved in 1878 and locals suddenly realised their say in the management of their own jungles had been restricted with regulations imposed over community ownership of natural resources.The curtailment of forest rights, indiscriminate logging, especially in Kumaon and encouragement of plantation of trees with commercial value like pine during the colonial era contributed to the loss of a sense of ownership.Officials say the alienation continues and blamed it for the failure in getting community participation in dealing with forest fires. ₹1 or ₹2 per kg is paid for the collection of the needles and is hardly seen as an incentive. The state, which has over 71 % forest cover, annually generates nearly 2.3 million tonnes of pine needles.Forest burning as a form of protestBetween 1916 and 1921, people burnt huge chunks of forest land to register their protest against the Britishers for not allowing them to use forest resources. This was after years of fight for forest rights.Also Read | Uttarakhand HC takes suo moto cognisance of alarming forest firesEnvironmentalist Ajay Singh Rawat said in 1921, 2.5 lakh acres of forests were burnt in Kumaon in 317 incidents and earlier in 1916, as many as 111,000 hectares were burnt in Nanital, Amora and nearby areas by angry locals.Forest burning, as a form of protest, has largely ended. But people continue to resort to such a measure occasionally. In 2018, enraged over a leopard killing a seven-year-old child, villagers in Bageshwar burnt a nearby forest.Invasive pine trees, a major contributor to forest firesPine trees have also kept replacing the local trees, especially oak in Kumaon. The state has unsuccessfully tried to seek permission from the Centre to cut pine trees located at an elevation of above 1,000 metres. For the felling trees in an area of more than a km, permission is needed from the Centre under the Forest Conservation Act.In February, government think tank NITI Aayog vice-chairman Rajiv Kumar suggested the state should gradually replace the pine trees with local treesPine trees need less water, and due to this reason, they have been growing in abundance. They are mostly resistant to forest fires even as other trees are damaged in forest fires. Unlike water-retaining oak trees, pine trees make the land they grow on drought-prone. This is due to the absence of bacteria in its root system, which reduces the water-retaining capacity of the soil. The pine trees also retard the undergrowth, affect the food supply for herbivores, which has the potential to increase human-animal conflicts. Wherever pine grows, it does not allow oak trees to grow.Environmentalist Ajay Singh Rawat, who has written books on forests in Uttarakhand, said the failure of the authorities to take locals into confidence has made it difficult to get mass participation in dealing with fires. He added the British were not farsighted when it came to forest management as they did not have much experience in dealing with vast forests in their country.“They destroyed their forests during the industrial revolution. In India, they introduced the German school of forestry. In Germany, most of the forests were privately owned during the 19th century and in Uttarakhand, forests were transferred to state control in 1878.”Rawat said in Uttarakhand, as the economy was forest-based, people revolted against this new forest policy. “In 1916, Kumoan Association came into existence and it sensitised people against the British forest management. When this seething discontent reached its climax, people started burning forests to mark their resentment in 1921. After five years again, forest burning became part of the freedom struggle and peoples’ movement here.”Rawat said the negative impact of British forest policy and forest fires continued even after Independence. “After 1947, people did not burn forests, but they did not support the forest department in extinguishing forest fires.”Shekhar Pathak, a historian, said the Forest Conservation Act does not allow cutting trees in areas above 1,000 metres. “This has also contributed to the flourishing of pine in higher reaches. The people want to save their forests, but for that forest officials have to come forward to seek their participation in extinguishing forest fires, which need a collective effort of government and communities together.”Forest fires are generally reported from February to June. They usually peak in May and June. Over 90% of forest fires are man-made. The fires impact biodiversity, be it the microorganisms in the soil, wildlife, small insects, birds and people living in and around the forests, affecting the overall ecology of an area.The forest department has also failed to prevent the local practice burning forest floor vegetation from May to June for the growth of fresh grass for cattle.Since the formation of Uttarakhand in 2000, the state has lost over 49,000 hectares of forest land to forest fires. Since January 1, the state has reported 1,150 forest fire incidents that have damaged 1,854 hectares of land.Till Wednesday evening, over 75 forest fires raged and over 93 acres of forest land were damaged over the previous 24 hours. Of the 1,422 forest fires, the maximum (611) has been reported in Pauri-Garhwal, followed by 220 in Tehri, 179 in Almora and 180 in Bageshwar, according to the government.Maan Singh, the nodal officer for forest fires, said nearly 5,000 forest staff is engaged in firefighting. “All possible efforts are being made with the help of the locals to check these forest fires. The main challenge is that the state has over 71 % forest cover and forest fires are taking place in many areas this year due to deficient rainfall and rise in temperature.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-forest-fires-rage-in-uttarakhand-spotlight-back-on-colonial-era-problem-101617861513037.html
09-04-2021||India||How India can overcome the Covid-19 surge||Since February 1, when India recorded the lowest daily Covid-19 infections in over eight months, there has been a steady rise in numbers. This reached an all-time high on April 4 when over 100,000 RT-PCR confirmed cases were reported on a single day, the highest since the outbreak of the pandemic. The record was overtaken on April 6, when the total cases crossed over 115,000 cases.It is important to identify reasons associated with this unprecedented rise in numbers, and examine measures that must be taken to halt the upsurge.The steady fall of Covid-19 numbers since the beginning of 2021, coupled with the news about the availability of two reasonably effective indigenously manufactured vaccines in India and the possibility that at least three more equally effective vaccines were in the pipeline, made people let down their guard, relax and act as if life was back to normal again. As businesses, educational institutions, malls, restaurants and the entertainment industry opened, most people abandoned observing Covid-19 appropriate behaviour. Home quarantine and social distancing measures, coupled with business losses that people had experienced over several months, had brought in an element of fatigue, and they suddenly started to enjoy uninhibited freedom.Also Read | Covid vaccination now allowed at offices. Check details about eligibility, priceRNA viruses keep undergoing duplications and adding mutations to their parental strain because of pressure from host immunity. Due to its recent association with humans, the Sars-CoV-2 that causes Covid-19 may not yet have been fully adapted to the human host. This has led to the speculation that the virus may be evolving continuously towards higher transmissibility. It has already accumulated novel mutations leading to patterns of genomic diversity and behaviour, specific to different regions of the world.Although the majority of the mutations are inconsequential, the three of reasonable concern are those detected in the United Kingdom (B.1.1.7), South Africa (B.1.351), and Brazil (P1). The UK variant, with the potential of high transmissibility, has already been detected in over 10% of the sequenced samples in India, with the most concentrated in Maharashtra and Punjab. It is possible that there could be additional, as yet unrecognised India-specific mutations, whose behaviour needs to be identified.The emergence of multiple variants of concern of Sars-CoV-2 raises the possibility of the immune escape mechanism adopted by the virus. This means that the host immunity may eventually lose its ability to attack a particular variant (or strain) and eliminate it effectively. Current data indicates that the existing lot of vaccines are equally effective with the known new variants. While this is good news, it is important to be on guard since higher infectiousness could lead to the development of viral resistance to both natural and vaccine-induced immunity.Also Read | New Zealand suspends entry for travellers from India over Covid-19 surgeWhat must be done to deny an opportunity to the virus to spread? A combination of scientific and administrative strategies can be considered.First, besides vaccines, it is important to give equal attention to developing novel therapeutic options through genomic approaches. India has already upscaled its infrastructure in at least half-a-dozen centres of international standards that can perform highly efficient sequencing of the genome of coronavirus isolates, obtained from infected individuals. Viral cloning technology could help in designing more effective therapeutic options against Covid-19, particularly for those who get hospitalised and develop severe disease.The second scientific approach is to develop new strategies to create designer therapeutic antibodies, with efficient neutralising ability for the virus just like it was done successfully for treating the Ebola virus infection. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in the United States has already developed an investigational product, REGN-COV2 on similar lines for Covid-19, which was successfully used to treat Donald Trump. More research is needed to develop new products on similar lines that are equally effective against new variants and, more importantly, are affordable.The third is to further jack up the vaccination drive to cover, on an average, five to six million people a day and perhaps adopt a staggered roll-out according to containment zones. Robust data on sero-surveillance, using the more sensitive chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA), is needed to identify hot spots, just as it was done earlier with tangible results. Vaccinating every susceptible individual in these areas, irrespective of age group, and banning all social activities there could go a long way in halting the second wave. The critical question is whether the faster spread of the infection in younger age groups will lead to faster herd immunity, and thus contraction of the pandemic faster.Also Read | PM Modi to interact with chief ministers over Covid-19 surge, vaccination planFourth, it is clear that human behaviour has played a key role in driving the second wave. A more administrative approach would be to adopt strict measures, round up and fine those who violate Covid-19 stipulated behaviour. All establishments must be made more responsive and routinely test their personnel, track the positives and treat them as per the protocol. The authorities may close these establishments even if one person is not tested or the positive person is not quarantined properly.While India has to successfully battle the second wave, it is important not to create panic, but stay calm. The surge will settle soon and what worked before during the first will surely work again — but for that, a mix of scientific, administrative and behavioural changes are essential.Narinder Kumar Mehra is honorary emeritus scientist of the Indian Council of Medical Research and former Dean of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New DelhiThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-india-can-overcome-the-covid-19-surge-101617856832954.html

On Wednesday, the country logged more than 100,000 Covid-19 cases in the past 24 hours for the second time this year, taking the tally to over 12.8 million cases. The active Covid-19 caseload of the country reached more than 843,000 and the daily positivity rate is on a steady rise. The daily positivity rate of the disease, which was 2.29 per cent on March 8, currently stands at 8.04 per cent, the Union health ministry data showed.The ministry on Wednesday said the nation surpassed the US to become the fastest vaccinating country in the world with an average daily rate of more than 3 million vaccine doses.The US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention(CDC) informed that the UK Covid-19 variant is now the most common strain in the country, reported Bloomberg. The European Union health ministers said they will continue talks to resolve vaccination planning, as the EU failed to unify in response to the links between the AstraZeneca Covid shots and blood clots. Germany, France, and Italy have restricted the vaccine for people aged above 60 and have asked the other members to implement the same, reported Bloomberg.Follow all the updates here:No oxygen supply crisis in Madhya Pradesh, says CM ChouhanMadhya Pradesh chief minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said on Thursday that there is no crisis of medical oxygen supply for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients in the state adding that additional oxygen is coming from Bhilai. 37 doctors of Delhi hospital test positive for Covid-1937 doctors of Delhi's Sir Ganga Ram Hospital have tested positive for the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), hospital sources told news agency ANI.Delhi govt orders increase in reserved beds for Covid-19 patients at two hospitalsDelhi government has ordered an increase in total number of beds reserved for Covid-19 patients from 1,000 to 1,500 at Lok Nayak Hospital and from 500 to 1,000 at GTB Hospital.

09-04-2021||India||Covid lapses at farm stir may hit 4 states||The ongoing farmer agitation on the outskirts of Delhi will continue despite a surge in Covid-19 cases in the country, senior leaders of the movement insisted, despite warnings from health experts and government officials that the thousands-strong protest could become a virus superspreader that impacts four states.Some leaders of the Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM) said they will ask farmers to adopt precautions such as masks but many farmers at the protest sites of Singhu, Tikri and Ghazipur expressed disbelief about Covid-19 protocols, said farmers have “higher immunity”, and termed the virus a “government conspiracy”.“Farmers have higher immunity. In our protests since last year, not a single Covid-19 case has happened. Why are only the farmers’ protests seen as a Covid risk? Why are questions never raised over mass election rallies being held in Bengal, Assam and Kerala?” asked Balbir Singh Rajewal, a key member of SKM.Other leaders of the movement also said that events such as a march to Parliament in May and blocking of highways in April will continue as scheduled. Bharatiya Kisan Union (BKU) Dakaunda general secretary Sukhdev Singh, however, said that social distancing will be implemented at protest sites.Hundreds of thousands of farmers have camped outside Delhi since November last year in protest against three controversial central laws that aim to liberalise the farm economy.When the agitation began, the first wave of Covid-19 cases was on the wane. But over the past two weeks, cases have surged across India, which is firmly in the grip of the second national wave, and experts warn that the farm gatherings – where hundreds of families live in cheek-by-jowl trawlers on the highway and where scores of young men and women huddle together – is potentially an unchecked virus hot spot. “Gatherings are increasing the chance of transmitting the infection and that’s why they need to be avoided,” said Jugal Kishore, head of the community medicine department at Safdarjung Hospital in Delhi.To be sure, the caution is not limited to farm events and extend to any high-density event such as religious events, or political rallies.Travelling back and forthThe farm protests are unique because they pose a health risk to four states of Punjab, Haryana, Delhi and Uttar Pradesh as cultivators from all these regions have flocked to the Capital’s borders over the past six months to support the agitation, and keep going back and forth from the protest site to their homes.“So far we have not encountered any Covid case at the protest site but we are concerned about those who visit Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi these days as they might pick up the virus from places outside the protest site,” said Swaiman Singh, a cardiologist from New Jersey who has been volunteering at the Tikri site. It was not clear, however, what level of testing was happening at the site, and whether asymptomatic cases may be going undetected.Of particular concern is Punjab, which has recorded a big spike in cases and deaths in the past two weeks.On Wednesday, the state posted 2,963 cases even as the government clamped night curfew and announced additional curbs, including a ban on political gatherings.“We have a rotational basis for the protests. Ten fresh protestors come every week to relieve 10 people already taking part in the protests. This will continue,” Rajewal said, describing a system that, experts believe, underscores the heightened risk.Punjab govt not worriedThe Punjab government said it had no plans to check the ongoing stir. “There is hardly any rally being done by the farmers and if they are getting together at any place, they are doing it for the genuine demands against the three black laws. We cannot say anything to them as it’s a matter of their future generations,” said Punjab health and family welfare minister Balbir Singh Sidhu.The state health department also maintained there was no direct link between the stir and rising Covid-19 cases. “Our analysis reveals that 70% of cases reported this year are from urban areas. Only 30% are from rural areas that are hubs of farmer protests,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar.Health experts said that farmers may have escaped the scourge of the virus so far because the current surge was driven by urban areas. But they warned that the protest may become a hot spot, especially because testing in the villages was inadequate due to a boycott call given by farmer unions.In Haryana, additional chief secretary, health, Rajiv Arora said the farmer gatherings were a cause for concern.“The situation is under control in Jhajjar and Sonepat, the two Delhi bordering districts where the farmers have assembled in big numbers. But it is certainly a cause of concern. Such gatherings can lead to a wider and deeper spread of infection, particularly in light of the fact that a big number of agitating farmers come from Punjab where the infection and mortality rate is very high. The back-and-forth movement of farmers can also contribute to spread of contagion,’’ he said.State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Dhruva Chaudhary, said any congregation – political, social or religious -- would cause a rise in cases.“People neither appear for testing nor vaccination. If the virus is so dangerous, why did Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar address a condolence meet in memory of Rohtak MP Arvind’s father and why did deputy CM Dushyant Chautala hold a rally ahead of Holi in Palwal? Are the rules only for protesting farmers? We will continue our agitation until our demands are met,” said state secretary of the All India Kisan Sabha, Balbir Singh Thakan‘Higher immunity’In Uttar Pradesh, where farm unions have organised a number of mahapanchayats – large rallies where tens of thousands of farmers participate – farmers said they were not worried. Large numbers of cultivators from the state’s western districts joined the protests in January after farm leader Rakesh Tikait’s emotional appeal.At the headquarters of the BKU in Sisauli town of Muzaffarnagar district, also the birthplace of Tikait, farmers said their resolve to continue the protest was unshaken by the Covid-19 surge. “Our immune system is strong and virus poses no danger to us. The government shouldn’t think of enforcing curbs on us,” said Dheeraj Latoyan, a farm leader.At the three protest sites on the Capital’s borders, the crowds have thinned from the peaks of December-January but thousands remain camped on the highway, and enthusiastic about the future course of the stir.The majority of protesters don’t use masks or sanitisers, and the disbelief about the virus still persists. Several farmers said they do not need a Covid-19 testing facility.“There is no such thing as coronavirus. The government is again doing the same as they did during last year to harass the poor. Their curbs and curfews won’t deter the spirits of protesters,” said Sukhbir Singh, a farmer from Moga.Delhi government officials said they periodically set up Covid-19 test camps near the protest sites that are open to everyone. “We have also periodically set up help desks in the sites to encourage people to get vaccinated. We have ambulances reserved in the sites to help with any kind of emergency situation,” said a senior official.Delhi police officials, meanwhile, said they are not taking any chances. Rajiv Ranjan, DCP (outer-north), under which the Singhu border falls, said all personnel deployed at the sites have received at least a single dose of vaccine. “Almost all the police and paramilitary personnel deployed at the border are vaccinated with at least one dose,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-lapses-at-farm-stir-may-hit-4-states-101617834421837.html
09-04-2021||Today's||The Taste With Vir: Why are vaccines not readily available?||As the Covid pandemic surges all over India, our government has told us that this is our own fault. It is a consequence of our refusal to mask up and engage in Covid appropriate behaviour.To an extent, the government is right. It is nobody’s case that we have all masked up or that we have not congregated in crowded areas.But two questions need to be asked. Is our disgraceful behaviour the primary reason for this sudden surge? After all we were just as irresponsible a few months ago when numbers started going down. So why is the virus spreading so quickly through our society now?I don’t know what the answer to that question is because nobody has told us what is going on with this virus.In the UK, even before the big surge began, the authorities had identified a variant that was more easily transmissible. In India, we are supposed to be working on the answer and though initially, the government spoke in many voices, the official position seems to be that there is no new, more transmissible, variant. Which, you must agree, is a bit odd.And the second question is more rhetorical than serious. At a time when politicians run amok across the country, not bothering about masks and addressing large, tightly packed, crowds at election rallies, do they really have any right to tell us to wear masks? Are they even conscious of the example they set? Why is it okay to impose night curfews and drive restaurants and other establishments into bankruptcy while, as far as politics is concerned, it is business as usual for our netas?And then there is the vaccine problem. Experience has shown us that the only way to halt the spread of the pandemic (or to at least slow it down) is by vaccinating as many people as possible.Also Read | The Taste by Vir Sanghvi: Why I am not travelling abroadWe have been slow to do that in India. You cannot argue with the government’s strategy to vaccinate high-risk sectors first. But the point is not priorities. It is speed. Yes, front line workers needed it first. But did we have to restrict all vaccination to just them for so long? Couldn’t we have spread it out faster?Part of the problem lies with the government’s vaccine czars. You have seen them on TV, smug and seemingly all-powerful. These are the people who wanted to keep such a tight control on everything that they resisted private sector involvement.Failing to recognise the gravity of the problem, and the need to vaccinate as many people as soon as possible, they acted like small time clerks used to do in the heyday of the license-permit-raj. They flung around phrases like ‘vaccine-equity’ as a way of denying more people vaccines, refused to make vaccines available on a pay-for-jab basis and crippled our program.More significantly, they underestimated how many doses we needed. There is now a widespread demand to expand the eligibility criteria which they continue to resist with shows of arrogance.The Health Secretary told a press conference that the government would not give the vaccine to those who wanted it. Instead it would only vaccinate those who “needed it.”So who needs it? People dying in a Covid hotspot? Well, no. Only people that the health ministry considers eligible.Also holding forth at the same press conference was VK Paul whose credibility seems miraculously unaffected by his claim last year that the pandemic would level off by May 16. (This was May 16, 2020!) He made a prediction last year at the daily briefing at the Health Ministry assuring us that by May, 2020, the crisis would have largely passed.He has since apologised and said that he never “ever said that the cases would go down to zero, there is a misunderstanding….” This may be true. But he certainly did forecast the end of the raging pandemic by then.These are the guys who now decide our strategy. So, are you really surprised by what is going on?The reason the Health Secretary, Dr Paul and the others are refusing to extend the eligibility criteria is because we don’t have enough vaccines to do it. They clearly did not expect this wave. Or if they did, they failed to plan for it. In March, the Health Minister told us that “India is in the end game of the pandemic”.He was widely criticised (as it turns out, with justification) but the remark provides an insight into the government’s thinking. The minister and his smug bureaucrats thought it was all coming to an end. Yes, they had missed Dr. Paul’s original May 2020 date but hey! Covid was soon going to end.The current position of the government of India is that there is no shortage of vaccines. Well, may be.But why are Covid centers (including government centers) shutting down in Mumbai? Why are so many hospitals in so many states turning away people, explaining that they have no vaccines?The Centre’s response has been to play politics and blame state governments. This suggests that Delhi believes that state chief ministers are quite happy to not distribute vaccines and let their people die. As a suggestion, this is breath-taking in its mendacity. And it is made worse by the Health Minister’s need to point out that the states that are complaining that vaccines are running out are ruled by the opposition.Even if there was no failure in the planning and ordering enough vaccines (which of course, there was) there is, undeniably, a massive failure in coordination and distribution. So what happens now?Well, I reckon they will start approving new vaccines quickly. But producing vaccines take time. And you can’t buy them off the shelf in the international market. The domestic players know how trapped and vulnerable the establishment it. The Serum Institute has now asked for ₹3000 crores to expand its production facilities, lobbing the ball into the government’s court.The truth is that there are no quick fixes. So, expect more lectures on how it is all our own fault. More thaali-banging type stunts. The odd utsav. And expect more deaths.For more stories by Vir Sanghvi read here||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-with-vir-why-are-covid-19-vaccines-not-readily-available-in-india-101617966242871.html
09-04-2021||Today's||As Covid’s second wave surges in India, history repeats itself||History repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as farce. One year after the imposition of the world’s strictest lockdown, India is now in the grip of a second Covid-19 wave. Aided by new variants, Covid-19 is spreading rapidly as is the penchant of governments for arbitrary mini lockdowns, weekend lockdowns, full lockdowns and night curfews. Hapless migrant workers, left without social security and uncertain job prospects, are once again queuing up at bus and train stations to go back home, their incomes already ravaged by the disastrous choices made last year. Like last year, there are no signs yet of any relief or stimulus in the offing as the economy takes an inevitable hit. Rather than pursuing coordinated policy action, the Centre and state governments are back at war.Yet, consensus has been forged amongst all arms of the State to resort to familiar toolkits — coercive policy through confounding orders (from last-minute lockdowns to making masks compulsory while alone in a vehicle); opacity (critical data — vaccines and reinfection, vaccines and side effects, disease severity, lockdowns and transmission dynamics — are missing from the public domain) and blaming citizens for abandoning Covid-19 caution even as the political leadership has willingly thrown caution to the winds in pursuit of political power. The farce is now unfolding as rapidly as the second wave and its consequences will be tragic.Also Watch | Rahul Gandhi slams PM Modi’s ‘Tika Utsav’ call; questions export of vaccinesWas this inevitable? Absolutely not. The year 2021 is not 2020. Despite many unknowns, India learnt important policy lessons that could have avoided repeating history in 2021. We learnt how to scale up testing, especially when it is demand-led — an implicit lesson for our vaccination strategy. Doctors and patients have a better understanding of treatment protocols. Crucially, we learnt a few things about transmission dynamic, especially that it is spatially clustered. Analysis by Centre for Policy Research on early testing data from Punjab in April 2020 traced 80% cases to less than 2% of the state’s polling booths. Even today, a cluster of states are contributing to the bulk of the case load.Spatial clustering calls for an agile, localised, coordinated health response. From surveillance to treatment and vaccinations (demand for vaccines is likely linked to experience of surges, which is one explanation for the emerging supply constraints), health resources can be repurposed, as China did in Wuhan, to service areas where cases are surging. But this requires the Centre and states to work together through institutionalised coordination mechanisms that simply do not exist. In his meeting with chief ministers on Thursday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi ruled out the possibility of a national lockdown, pushing instead for a localised, micro containment strategy with increased testing and tracing. The infrastructure is in place, the PM said. The challenge is that of governance. But the reality is India needed far greater investments in our public health infrastructure, investments that go beyond protective kits and testing labs. Localised strategies require well-resourced public health systems — enhanced surveillance capacity, increased human resources at the community level and improved data systems. When the first wave began to abate, we had the opportunity to learn lessons and devise policy to respond to a possible second wave (this was never off the table) and future pandemics. Instead we got policy complacency and now a repeat of history.Lockdowns or not, the second wave will have a serious impact on our battered economy. Images of migrant workers making their way home have once again made headlines. Despite the significant economic impact of the 2020 lockdown on the poor, calls for expanded income support were ignored. The finance ministry refused to unlock its purse strings, paving the way for a profit-led recovery. Once again, there are no signs of a relief package even as workers and firms face renewed uncertainty. Crucially, as the second wave spreads, state governments are likely to face differential economic consequences, linked to transmission dynamics and state specific socio-economic profiles. If the Centre were to craft an appropriate response, fiscal support will need to be calibrated to state-specific needs. This will require the ministry of finance to devise an economic strategy, revisit GDP projections for 2021-22 and work closely with states. It didn’t do this in 2020, and has, so far, shown no signs of learning lessons from last year. Inequalities widened in 2020 and the second wave will only deepen this trend, laying bare the farce of equal citizenship.Finally on vaccines, the magic bullet solution India was relying on. India’s vaccine strategy is stumbling precisely because we failed to learn lessons from 2020. Tight bureaucratic control, complete lack of coordination, and a strategy that blames citizens, both for vaccine hesitancy and for demanding universal vaccinations, rather than builds their trust, is dominating vaccination roll out. Much has been said about the need for universalisation of vaccines and better coordination. But it is important to remember that a successful vaccination strategy will require transparency, citizen confidence and trust. Key data need to be collected and made transparent to the public – on vaccination supply, on adverse effects, on reinfection rates. Only then will citizen confidence and trust be built. In the absence of data and transparency, large-scale vaccination will remain an elusive strategy. Trust, confidence, transparency and co-ordination. These ought to be the tools for India as we respond to the second wave. There is still time to course correct. If not, history will repeat itself as farce. A farce India cannot afford.

09-04-2021||Today's||Maoist challenge: Why large armies lose small wars||Debates on the latest Maoist attacks, critiquing or defending security forces and their tactics, miss the strategic picture. As Henry Kissinger said – the conventional army loses, if it does not win. The guerrilla wins, if he does not lose. To that extent, Maoists have been winning against security forces for over a decade now. A tactical playbook follows the trite cycle of postmortem, rolling of heads, threats of a fitting response, usually followed by a massive reprisal. Ironically, the latter is exactly what guerrillas count on. A strategic view helps join the dots.Mao Tse Tung, the ideological fountainhead of the movement, defined revolution as an act of violence by which one class (aka peasants) overthrows another class (landlords). In the Chinese context, the revolution was to overthrow the incumbent ruler. Ironically, Mao’s strategy was influenced more by Clausewitz than Sun Tzu because of his Soviet leaning, training and patronage. In his book, On protracted War, (which borrows heavily from Clausewitz’s On War), Mao identified three phases of the revolution — strategic defence, strategic stalemate and strategic offence.Also Read | As Maoist violence returns, decoding the rise of ultra left insurgencyThe first phase is when the guerrillas are weak and the State is overwhelmingly strong. According to Mao, retreat, defeat and weakness is part of this period. Guerrillas seek to avoid contact and use this phase to build capability, garner local support, national and international alliances. When his weak and fledgling Red Army, the forerunner of the People’s Liberation Army, was encircled by General Chiang Kai-shek’s troops in their stronghold at Jiangxi, Mao retreated 9,000km, in what came to be known as the Long March, over a year, all the way to barren and inhospitable Yan’an to rebuild the Red Army’s fighting capabilities. Much like the Maoist strongholds.In the stalemate phase, guerrillas consolidate a physical enclave where their writ runs and State forces are unable to interfere. This gives them operating room to increase numbers and lethality of their cadres. The enclave, or as in the case of the Maoists, a “corridor”, also allows them free movement and influx of external supplies from countries who are either sympathetic to their ideology or enemies of the State.As the name implies, the stalemate phase consists of a series of undecisive skirmishes which largely benefits guerrillas. For one, home ground gives guerrillas the advantage of terrain, local support, choice of timing and location of engagement. Second, since security forces are usually overwhelmed, it gives guerrillas an additional cache of sophisticated arms, ammunition, communication equipment and other resources. And in some cases, also hostages, who can be a major bargaining chip. Third, it boosts the morale of guerrilla cadres, especially when they have defeated crack and much vaunted government troops. The added benefit is creating legends and narratives around key guerrilla leaders and specific units – in this case, Madvi Hidma and the 1st Battalion of People’s Liberation Guerrilla Army. And most importantly, a humiliating rout compels the state to react with a heavy hand and overwhelming force — most of which is borne by the constituent population, thus cementing their support for the guerrillas. It is in this phase that the Maoist movement is now at, and probably will remain for some time to come.For a government with an image of “strong”responses to provocation, the temptation to launch into a major retaliative operation, possibly with armed forces participation, would be strong. But that would be a mistake.All terror operations are conducted for five audiences. The first is the incumbent government. The objective is to attack State instruments for psychological and political messaging, creating operating room and provoke disproportionate use of force especially on their second audience – the constituent population, thus alienating larger numbers from the State. The third audience is the non-constituent population, which is rest of the country, who are now aware of the seriousness of this problem and want to get involved. People with little understanding of warfare start baying for blood, compelling the government down a slippery slope of militarising the situation. Which in a perverse way, justifies the guerrilla’s cause of fighting the State. The fourth audience are internal cadres and potential recruits who swell because of the success of every operation and reprisals by State forces. The last audience are foreign countries who, at one extreme, will assist with moral and material support and, at the other, by internationalising the cause, reduce maneuvering room for the State.It would be naive to assume that an operation planned with such tactical finesse by Maoists would be devoid of strategic planning for its aftermath. Our armed forces and central armed police forces are stretched on an unprecedented level. We are facing a two-and-a-half-front war right now. While tensions may have abated on the eastern and western fronts, the commitment of troops continues. Troops are also committed in Kashmir, Northeast, in security duties for elections and of course battling the pandemic. Similarly, the mindshare of national strategic leadership is dominated by several pressing political and economic issues at the moment. Besides, brute force alone seldom exterminates guerrilla movements as nations with far larger armies have found to their great expense.Our security forces suffered heavy casualties because their tactical leaders walked into a trap. The strategic leaders shouldn’t walk into another one. And that calls for strategic restraint and maneuvering, rather than hasty resolute action.Raghu Raman is the founding CEO of NATGRIDThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/maoist-challenge-why-large-armies-lose-small-wars-101617956095210.html
09-04-2021||Today's||Pakistan’s failed quest to project soft power||It’s ironic that when Pakistan takes one step forward to project its positive side to the world, the country is pulled several miles backwards by its own political leadership and an obscurantist clergy.Speaking at a public gathering in Islamabad recently, Prime Minister Imran Khan pooh-poohed those who insist that Pakistan needs an image makeover through its soft power. He scoffed at the idea of using soft power as a means to win international goodwill, terming it an “inferiority complex”. “I repeatedly hear that we need to present a soft image of Pakistan. What does a soft image mean? Why do we say this, and if this soft image is established will the world consider us very good?” Dawn newspaper quoted Khan as saying.One doesn’t have to go far from where Khan spoke to find a powerful symbol of Pakistan’s aspiration to project its soft and democratic image. Walking down the Gali-e-dastoor (Constitution Lane) is like visiting a Left-wing art gallery in some Bolivarian country. Except that it is right inside the Parliament house of Pakistan, which is anything but a bastion of the Left.Sepia-coloured prints of old newspaper front pages announcing the imposition of martial law – barbed wires stretched across them to create a sinister effect -- jostle for space with the murals of famous revolutionary Urdu poets like Faiz Ahmed Faiz and Habib Jalib, along with the text of their fiery poetry. The Gali-e-dastoor bears witness to Pakistan’s troubled constitutional history and its perpetual conflict with the military establishment, as also to its aspiration for democracy and civilian rule.Also Read | US sanctions Pakistan-based transnational human smuggling networkIt is an attempt to showcase the country’s softer side and convince the world – especially foreign visitors – that Pakistan is not all about terrorist attacks on school kids, sectarian killings and notorious blasphemy laws; it’s a thriving democracy where civilian control over the country’s institutions is paramount, and freedom of expression is intact. So much so, that even the military’s anti-constitutional misdeeds are on display inside the country’s supreme civilian institution.I was amongst the delegates who were invited from 30-odd Asian countries to participate in the Asia Peace Film Festival (APFF) in Islamabad in 2017. Guests were treated to some of the best films and documentaries from Asia; there were informed debates in open seminars where speaker after speaker emphasised the need for Pakistan to assert its soft power. The three-day jamboree culminated in a conducted tour of the Gali-e-dastoor. In a country that almost always grabs the headlines for all the wrong reasons, it was quite surprising to see the soft side on full display.American philosopher Joseph S Nye is credited with coining the term soft power. He further elaborated the concept as “the ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments.” It is essentially a foreign policy tool deployed as a charm offensive to increase a country’s global influence to achieve favourable results. According to the latest global soft power ranking index published in 2019 by communications consultancy Portland, France is at the top of the list, followed by Germany, with the United States under Donald Trump slipping down to number five. In a separate category of the top ten Asian countries, India ranked at number eight; Pakistan was not even considered for the survey.Impactful soft power initiatives (such as the APFF) in Pakistan are still few and far between, but they are nevertheless happening because, over the years, a liberal section of the power elite has realised that their country has already lost a lot of time and resources in trying to establish itself as the vanguard of the Islamic world. And the state’s patronage of terrorist outfits and religious extremists has not helped Pakistan gain an upper hand either in Kashmir or in Afghanistan, leave alone earning respect and goodwill of the international community.This realisation has led to some positive initiatives by independent groups, aimed at instilling liberal and progressive social values in the youth, especially university students and young professionals. The Islamabad-based think-tank Pakistan Institute of Peace Studies (PIPS) runs several programmes to de-radicalise the youth and to familiarise them with counter-extremism narratives. It also runs a programme called Youth for Interfaith Harmony to encourage tolerance for all religions as well as different sects of Islam. The organisers acknowledge that “religious extremism is a continuing problem” in Pakistan, and the youth need to be shepherded away from the sectarian and narrow-minded interpretation of Islam.While this section of society is desperate to change Pakistan’s negative image by projecting its hitherto ignored rich and diverse culture, the ruling establishment remains either totally indifferent to such ideas or mocks them. Questioning the whole concept of soft power and terming it a sign of “inferiority”, Khan, in one fell swoop, took the wind out of the sails of scores of filmmakers, writers, poets and rights activists who have been lobbying hard to build a softer image of their country.The irony in Khan’s speech, however, was not lost on anyone when he told the filmmakers to create bold and original cinema. A year earlier, his own government had failed to defend renowned director Sarmad Khoosat’s thought-provoking feature film, Zindagi Tamasha (Circus of Life), and deferred its release following the threats of violent protests from the far-right Islamist party Tehreek-e-Labbaik Pakistan (TLP).It did not matter that the film had got plaudits at the Busan International Film Festival for its sensitive portrayal of a religious-looking elderly man who gets videoed while dancing to a raunchy film song at a wedding party, and when the video goes viral, he is subjected to humiliation, social boycott and ignominy. In a sanctimonious and vigilante society, it is rather scandalous, if not outright blasphemous, for an elderly man to swing his hips in an “unmanly” fashion. No wonder Khan thinks being soft is a sign of inferiority.The TLP targeted Khoosat for making what it called a “blasphemous” film that would “deviate the people from the path of Islam”. The threat was so serious and the social media campaign against him so severe, that Khoosat deleted his social media accounts and had to spend almost the whole year in fear.Incidentally, the TLP was also behind the widespread troubles that engulfed the streets of Pakistan in 2018 when the Supreme Court acquitted Christian farm worker Asia Bibi in a case of blasphemy against Islam and its Prophet – a crime punishable by death in Pakistan. Instead of strictly dealing with the thugs controlling the streets, Imran Khan’s government negotiated and signed an agreement with TLP leaders to wriggle out of the crisis.Juxtapose this with the government’s arbitrary clampdown on peaceful and secular activities. Soon after coming to power in 2018, Imran Khan gave marching orders to at least 18 NGOs; the authorities launched a drive against “unfavourable” school textbooks and banned at least 100 of them for allegedly carrying “blasphemous and anti-Pakistan” content. Some of the books were reportedly banned just because they carried the quotes by Mahatma Gandhi rather than Pakistan’s founding father Mohammad Ali Jinnah.On the one hand, the government is deeply suspicious of peaceful civil society organisations, but on the other hand, it treats violent extremist groups with kid gloves. Clearly, the political establishment thinks that Pakistan’s influence in the geostrategic arena will increase only by accumulating hard power – a strong military arsenal supported by extreme Islamist non-state actors and a robust economy; investing in art, culture, cinema and independent think tanks is just a waste of time.This imbalanced approach is holding Pakistan from realising its full soft power potential.Joseph S Nye once lamented that “some of our leaders do not understand the crucial importance of soft power.” Although he said it in the context of America, his words ring true for the political leadership of Pakistan. Taking a leaf out of Joseph S Nye’s books would do no harm either to Imran Khan or to the country he is currently leading.Rajesh Joshi is a New Delhi-based independent journalist and Visiting Professor at Haridev Joshi University of Journalism and Mass Communication, Jaipur (India)The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/pakistans-failed-quest-to-project-soft-power-101617877534201.html
09-04-2021||Editorials||The forest fires in Uttarakhand | HT Editorial||Uttarakhand is battling one of the worst episodes of forest fires since it became a separate state in 2000. According to the state forest department, there have been 989 fire incidents between October 1, 2020 and April 4, 2021, destroying around 1,297.43 hectares of rich, biodiverse forests. Taking suo moto cognisance of the calamity, the Uttarakhand High Court, on Tuesday, asked the senior-most forest official of the state to explain the preparedness of the department and measures that have been taken over the years to control fires, and asked the state government to explore the possibility of using artificial rain to douse forest fires, and directed it to extinguish the fires in two weeks. Since 2000, forest fires have affected over 48,000 hectares in the state. According to India’s State of Forest Report 2019, over 30,000 incidents of forest fires were reported in the country in 2019.Forest fires are not unusual in Uttarakhand, or, for that matter, in any jungle. In Uttarakhand, it usually begins in mid-February, when the trees shed dry leaves and the soil loses moisture due to a rise in temperature, and continues till mid-June. But this year, the situation has been different because of two reasons. One, the lack of adequate rainfall in the winter, leading to dry soil, and, second, the higher-than-expected temperature in March and April, both indicating the impact of the climate crisis. The change in the weather pattern, however, is not always the only reason for forest fires. They are also caused when locals clear land, or by farming-related activities, or sometimes sheer carelessness. A Forest Survey of India study states that over 95% of fire incidents are of anthropogenic origin.Unfortunately, the firefighting capabilities of India’s forest departments are, at best, rudimentary. They don’t have modern equipment, an adequate number of vehicles and enough field staff, which can bolster their rapid response system. In an era of the climate crisis, it’s a challenge for the forest department officers to detect and contain such fires. Along with providing the departments all support in terms of material and personnel support, it is imperative to involve local communities to not just keep an eye on the forests but also in cleaning and burning the fuel load (dry leaves etc) in a controlled manner to prevent large outbreaks in India’s precious carbon sinks. Uttarakhand is a warning of the challenges that lie ahead in preserving India’s fragile natural ecosystems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-forest-fires-in-uttarakhand-hteditorial-101617975792777.html
