27-04-2021||Mumbai||Understanding Mumbai’s downward Covid-19 trend||Amidst an explosive second wave of the pandemic, the number of Covid-19 cases in Mumbai has started showing a gradual, downward trend. From touching a single day high at 11206 cases in the first week of April, the daily case count dropped to 3999 on Tuesday. But this comes with an all-important caveat: The number of tests has declined from 51263 on April 7 to 30428 on April 27. What’s more, the number of deaths has gone up and so has the Case Fatality Ratio (CFR) --- the daily CFR on April 7 was 0.23%; on Tuesday, it was 1.47% --- and, significantly, hospitals across the city are yet to record a reduction in demand for beds. “The lockdown-like measures have definitely worked in the city, but this is also a typical trend in the pandemic waves. You record a sudden surge and then a slump,” said Dr Avinash Supe, member of the task force of Covid-19 deaths. He said that Mumbai’s situation is expected to stabilise by May 15. RISE IN DEATHS In the first week of April, Mumbai’s daily case average stood at 9737. In the following week, the daily average dropped slightly to 8879 and to 8074 in the third week. In the ongoing fourth week of the month, the daily case average has further declined to 5628. On the other hand, the number of deaths has shown a rise. In the first week of April, the average daily deaths were 23. In the fourth week, the daily average is 68. To be sure, the overall CFR has declined marginally between April 7 and April 27, from 2.45% to 2.03%. “The deaths that we are recording now are of people who have been hospitalised when the number of cases was high,” said Supe. “In this wave, we have seen few deaths within a day or two after hospitalisation. Almost 80% of people who have succumbed have battled the virus for a week or two a week in the hospital.” The declining trend in cases is yet to reflect as the demand for beds in city hospitals has not gone down as yet. The civic-run 1,850-bedded SevenHills Hospital, which is an exclusive Covid-19 facility, continues to have full occupancy. “We are still admitting anywhere between 150 to 200 patients every day,” said Dr Maharudra Kumbhar, an officer on special duty at the Seven Hills Hospital. “The reduction in daily demand for beds would be a fair parameter to analyse the situation. But we haven’t experienced any reduction as yet,” he said. “The occupancy in our centres remains full,” said Dr Prince Surana, who runs a 75-bed Covid-19 hospital in Chembur and a 50-bed one at Malad. Both the hospitals have 100% occupancy. “The number of calls asking for beds may have slightly reduced, but the demand for Intensive Care Unit beds and ventilator beds remains the same,” he said. At the NESCO facility in Goregaon, all the 200 ICU beds were full. Of the 2015 ward beds, 1426 were occupied. “We have been admitting 220 to 250 patients daily and the number of admissions has not come down as yet,” said Dr Neelam Andrade, dean of the facility. Another 1,500 beds including 700 beds will be added to this centre on Wednesday. According to Andrade, the demand continues to be high for oxygen and ICU beds. On Tuesday, 1,096 oxygen beds and 51 ICU beds were available in the city, according to the BMC’s dashboard.SLUMP IN TESTS, NOT JUST ON WEEKENDS This indicates that reports about Mumbai turning a corner are premature. But the biggest indicator for this is that the city is now testing fewer people. A state-wide curfew is underway since April 14, and on April 21, the state announced stricter curbs on movement of ordinary citizens. One of the reasons for this downward trend, experts say, is that laboratories are flooded with samples; many only provide home sample collection appointments with a five-to-six-day lag. Doctors say that a large number of patients in the city were prescribed chest CT scans (to detect infection in the lungs), as they could not get appointments for RT-PCR swab tests. “The number of tests may fluctuate, and the numbers drop on weekends. But Mumbai has not reduced the tests drastically,” said Dr Rahul Pandit, a critical care physician at Fortis Hospital and a member of Maharashtra’s Covid-19 task force. However, the numbers don’t bear this out. The average daily tests in Mumbai in the first week of April were 46,315. The average improved slightly to 49,582 in the second week and again dropped to 45,829 in the third week. There has been a steady downward trend in testing in the city: starting April 22, the number of tests has ranged from 41,826 to 30,428 (April 27). Typically, daily tests fall during the weekend. For instance, on April 18 (a Sunday), 36,556 tests were conducted, and on the following day, 45,350 tests were conducted. By comparison, the number of tests conducted in Mumbai on Sunday (April 25) was 28,328. According to Pandit, the daily cases in Mumbai are likely to plateau and stabilise in another two weeks. “But we can’t let our guards down. Covid appropriate behaviour is essential and the number of tests should not decrease at any cost,” he said. Experts have also pointed that aggressive vaccination will help in controlling the third wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/understanding-mumbai-s-downward-covid-19-trend-101619547330961.html
27-04-2021||Gurugram||50 large outbreak areas notified in Gurugram district||As the Covid-19 infections in the district continue to surge, with 3,684 new cases reported on Tuesday, the district administration notified 50 large outbreak areas, officials familiar with the matter said. Non-essential movement will be completely barred in these clusters and rigorous contact tracing will be undertaken, said officials.The maximum number of outbreak areas, under 11 public health centres across the district, were notified under the Nathupur and Chanderloke public health centres, with most of the containment zones under these areas located in condominiums along the Golf Course Road and around MG Road. Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said, “Earlier, we were declaring micro-containment zones, but as we saw that cases are continuing to increase, we will now be declaring macro containment zones, blocking non-essential movement in a whole area from where cluster cases are being reported. Thereafter, focus will be on rigorous contact tracing and testing in the given area.” As per the district administration, large outbreak areas were decided on the basis of geographical areas where localised increase in cases are being reported. The cases may or may not be epidemiologically linked, but for operational purposes, a large outbreak area is one where there are 15 or more cases, while a containment zone is an area where at least five Covid-19 cases are reported, officials said.According to guidelines issued by the district administration, reasonable restrictions on movement of people will be imposed in these areas, along with intensive public health campaigns, sanitisation of entire large outbreak area by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram or other agencies responsible, and operation of only essential shops and commercial establishment in such areas. In case transit through a large outbreak area is unavoidable, then usage of Aarogya Setu application will be a must, along with thermal scanning and symptomatic scanning at entry/exit points. Rapid testing facilities will be made available at exit points for symptomatic persons, said officials. The district administration also directed the Ayush department to distribute immunity boosters to people in the area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/50-large-outbreak-areas-notified-in-gurugram-district-101619546432869.html

27-04-2021||Gurugram||DTCP registers case against ex-MLA, 5 others over development of illegal colony in Sec 77||The department of town and country planning (DTCP) in Gurugram has registered a case against six persons, including a former city MLA, for developing an illegal colony on five to six acres of land in Sector 77.The case was registered under sections 10, 7(I), and 7(ii) of the Haryana Development and Regulation of Urban Areas Act, 1975, at the Kherki Daula police station. The case was registered against Praveen Yadav, Deepak Chugh, Manorama, Mahender Sharma, Sombir Jakhar, and former Gurugram MLA Umesh Agarwal, said the police on Tuesday, adding that an investigation is underway.RS Bhath, district town planner, Gurugram, said that they had received a tip-off that a colony was being carved out on five to six acres of land — an institutional area — in Sector 77. “It was revealed during a probe that a notice was already issued against the previous landowner for trying to carve out a colony there. However, the previous owner had ceased the activities, and later sold the land to the present owners,” Bhath said.The present owners, who were engaged in developing an illegal colony on the land, got a local court notice issued to the DTCP, asking it not to take action against them. “We were alerted by this notice and conducted an inspection. We found that a colony was being developed here, and roads were being laid,” Bhath added.Following this, the DTCP took legal advice from Anil Yadav, additional advocate general, Haryana, who asked the department to report the matter to the local police. “We again conducted a joint inspection with the revenue department and found that two property dealers, and former MLA Umesh Agarwal were promoting the illegal colony. A complaint was lodged with the police, and a case was registered on Monday,” Bhath said.According to the DTCP complaint, “Bare perusal of the said report clearly reveals that the above detailed land was sub-divided into plots by laying roads. Six electricity poles were erected. A house was constructed at Khasra No. 758/2, and a park was developed at Khasra No. 760/1. An office and a tower were constructed at Khasra nos. 756/1/1/2, 757, 758, and 761/1/1/2. At the time of spot inspection, construction of roads was on with the help of JCBs and tractors. Labourers were working there,” as per to the FIR.The DTCP officials said that a road network, electric poles, and an office were constructed on the land. “This is an institutional area and development of an illegal colony can’t be allowed in this area. No permission was taken for developing it. We request the people not to buy plots in such colonies as they could lose money and face penal action,” Bhath said.A representative of the former MLA, when contacted, did not comment on the matter..||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/dtcp-registers-case-against-ex-mla-5-others-over-development-of-illegal-colony-in-sec-77-101619546432103.html
27-04-2021||Gurugram||Sell properties on carpet area, not super area: H-Rera to developers||The Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (H-Rera) in Gurugram announced on Tuesday that apartments and flats in the city would be sold only on the basis of carpet area, and not super area — which has been the norm so far. The authority said that the final decision will be notified within two to three days, following which sale of flats in new projects, ongoing projects, and projects without occupation certificate would be carried out as per the new rules.Dr KK Khandelwal, chairman, H-Rera, said that the Supreme Court and high court have given several decisions, saying that sale of properties on the basis of super area was just cheating the customers, and the authority has decided to take measures to stop this. “Sale of apartments will be allowed only on the basis of carpet area as it is defined, and physically verified. The concept of super area is not defined, and used differently by developers as per their convenience,” said Khandelwal, adding that in case of ongoing projects — where the promoters had allotted real estate units on super area basis, before the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016, came into effect — the developer will now have to define all the components of the super area, and mention it in the builder-buyer agreement.“The inclusion of common area, club facilities, health centre, veranda, and other such areas will not be allowed to be clubbed in saleable areas, as had been done in the past,” Khandelwal added.Carpet area means the net usable floor area excluding the area covered by external walls, service shafts, balconies, verandahs, open terraces, according to the H-Rera Act, which came into effect on May 1, 2017.“In cases where the real estate unit was allotted to the allottee before the Act came into force, the developer will have to disclose all the components constituting the super area,” said Khandelwal, adding that the conveyance deed shall still be registered only on carpet area basis — according to the H-Rera rules.Sameer Kumar, member, H-Rera, said that any sale agreement will have to be based on carpet area after the notification of the order, and any violation would be considered as unfair and fraudulent practice. “Any property dealer, who will be indulged in any sale on the basis of super area or violate the directions issued by the authority, would face action under the Act,” said Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/sell-properties-on-carpet-area-not-super-area-h-rera-to-developers-101619546430780.html
27-04-2021||Gurugram||MP appeals to Khattar govt to impose lockdown amid surge in Covid cases||Taking cognisance of the unabated surge in Covid-19 cases in the district, Gurugram Lok Sabha member and Union minister of state Rao Inderjit Singh on Tuesday asked the state government to impose a curfew in Gurugram to contain the spread of the virus. Singh also said that he has been in talks with the state government regarding imposition of a lockdown for the past four days.“I spoke to the chief minister today and apprised him of the critical situation in the city. If we have to break the chain of infection, then it is important to impose a complete lockdown or curfew. I also suggested that only shops selling essential items be allowed to remain open. The cases are going to increase unless strict measures are taken,” said Singh, adding that he had received information about the long queues at cremation grounds in the city for Covid-19 victims, and this was an alarming situation which could be tackled only through a curfew.“I have been asking for a lockdown for the past four days,” Singh said.For the first time, a senior Uttar Pradesh BJP leader has called for a lockdown in Gurugram. Last week, Haryana chief secretary Vijay Vardhan had proposed a week-long lockdown in Gurugram and Faridabad. State health minister Anil Vij, however, said that no decision has been taken to impose a lockdown there.Meanwhile, Amit Arya, media advisor to Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, said that Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) Section 144 was imposed across the state on Tuesday, which was enforced on the weekend, and it will be ensured that the enforcement is very strict there. “Around 50 large outbreak regions were notified in Gurugram on Monday, and these regions would be treated almost like closed areas. The situation is being continuously monitored, and further decisions will be taken based on local feedback,” said Arya.A few days ago, Gurugram MLA Sudhir Singla had also said that a lockdown is necessary to bring the situation under control. “The total number of critical patients is rising on a daily basis, and a lockdown is necessary to stop it,” Singla had said.Traders in Gurugram have also demanded that a limited lockdown be imposed to save the people. “...There is a lack of oxygen, medicines, and hospital beds, and people are dying,” said Bablu Gupta, president, Sadar Bazar Traders Association. Meanwhile, Rakesh Malik, president, Sector 22 Market Association, said, “What is the point of opening shops when our lives are in danger. The evening curfew is not enough.”The residents are also supporting a limited lockdown or curfew for 10 to 15 days in the city. A Twitter user ‘NCR Citizen’ wrote, “Please sir, everyone must stay home for a week . Lives must be saved.” City-based health officials on Covid-19 duties have also been pushing for a lockdown. “A lockdown must be imposed as the hospitals are full, and the healthcare system is under immense pressure. We need to curtail the infections like Delhi. Movement of people has further allowed the infection to spread,” said a senior health department official, requesting anonymity.Health officials, privy to the matter, said that a proposal for a lockdown was sent to the state authorities last week, and the state chief secretary had recommended a 10-day lockdown on that basis, but the proposal was shot down at the ministerial level.The industry owners in Gurugram, however, are a bit wary of the lockdown and said that if it was at all required, then it should be limited and allow factories to operate. “The lockdown will impact the production and economy, but personally speaking, it is needed as the cases are rising. It can be imposed for some days to contain the spread,” he said.Senior Congress leader Ajay Singh Yadav said that a lockdown should be imposed in highly contaminated areas. “Industrial areas like Manesar, and markets should be allowed to operate with safeguard. The poor will suffer badly if a complete lockdown is imposed,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mp-appeals-to-khattar-govt-to-impose-lockdown-amid-surge-in-covid-cases-101619546372756.html
27-04-2021||Gurugram||Hospitals stop admissions due to oxygen shortage||The ongoing shortage of oxygen supply to hospitals has left Covid-19 patients staring at a medical crisis, with several hospitals stopping new admissions on Tuesday and some even asking families of admitted patients to shift them to other facilities or arrange for oxygen cylinders.Dr Prithvi Raj Aryan, the director of Aryan Hospital on Old Railway Road, said that there was no regular supply of oxygen leading to panic among family members of patients. “We have stopped taking new admission until there is regular oxygen supply. We have been visiting at least four places to refill the oxygen cylinders but are still getting a limited supply, which is not enough for the patients admitted to our hospital,” he said.At present, hospitals in the city are having to send their staffers to one of the three refill stations, two of which are in Manesar and one in Sector 16, in the district to get cylinders refilled with oxygen. However, hospitals said that the supply lasts only for a limited time due to the increased demand. Several hospitals on Tuesday morning called on the district administration to help them, after they ran out of oxygen supply.Dr S Raghunandan, vice-president, Center of Diabetes and Allied Sciences (CDAS), said that they have stopped admitting new patients due to a shortage of oxygen cylinders. “We have 38 Covid patients and most of them are surviving on oxygen support. Our hospital is going through an acute emergency as the oxygen supply left is hardly enough for a few hours. We are arranging oxygen from different places, but the supply lasts briefly. We are in a dire situation and the staff has not slept for the last 48 hours due to the condition of patients,” he said.The managements of Aarvy hospital in Civil Lines and Sector 90, Sethi Hospital in Model Town and Kathuria Hospital on Khandsa Road also said the oxygen supply at their respective hospitals would last only for a few hours.“We are not accepting new admissions until we get regular oxygen supply. We have an urgent oxygen requirement for our patients. We have around 80 patients in a serious condition, with 40 of them in ICU and on ventilator support. Their lives are at risk if oxygen is not made available to them. There has been an acute shortage of oxygen since last week. We got a few cylinders on Monday night with the help of the administration but the situation is again very bad. We are left with no choice but to explain to the patients and their relatives to either shift them elsewhere or to arrange oxygen. We have stock left only for two hours now,” said Dr Vikram Singh, director of Aarvy hospital, said on Tuesday morning.Dr AK Kathuria, the owner of Kathuria Hospital, where four patients died on Sunday due to lack of oxygen, said that the situation has not improved and the same problems persist. “We have stopped admission of Covid-19 patients as we are unable to save their lives without oxygen. A team of staff is running to arrange oxygen throughout the day and hardly 10% of our demands are met,” he said.Officials of the district administration on Tuesday constituted teams, comprising 50 personnel, to coordinate with private hospitals and check the status of oxygen supply. Officials said they are calling each hospital and preparing an inventory of demand and supply to ensure smooth operations.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said, “There are small hospitals that are admitting Covid-19 patients without our knowledge, leading to a shortage of oxygen supply. The supply has been increased and the distribution is done in such a way that all hospitals are getting oxygen supply as per their patient count.”Garg said the district received 35 metric tonnes of oxygen on Tuesday and the situation is improving.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospitals-stop-admissions-due-to-oxygen-shortage-101619546372006.html
27-04-2021||Gurugram||MCG takes charge of oxygen supply, to ensure buffer for emergencies||The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) took over the charge of oxygen supply management in the district on Tuesday, following which senior officials said that one of their main priorities is to arrange a buffer of at least 10 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen to ensure that hospitals and clinics don’t run out of oxygen and there is no loss of life.“The Haryana government has allocated 35 metric tonnes of daily oxygen supply to the city, of which 20 metric tonnes is procured from the INOX oxygen plant in Bhiwadi of Rajasthan and 15 metric tonnes from the Air Liquid Company in Panipat. Teams have been formed for (monitoring supply from) each of the plants and the three oxygen refilling stations in the city,” said MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh on Tuesday.Singh was designated as the leader of a high-level five-member committee constituted by the district administration on Tuesday and would be responsible for the procurement and regulation of oxygen supply to facilities in the district.Officials familiar with the developments said that the MCG is in the process of setting up a dedicated call centre for addressing oxygen-related matters round-the-clock.Singh said that all hospitals and clinics will have to alert the MCG at least four hours in advance, before their oxygen supply runs low, so that the civic body can deliver it to the facilities, within the stipulated time frame.MCG officials said that while the oxygen company in Bhiwadi has tankers to transport oxygen to Gurugram, the same is not the case with the company in Panipat. The MCG team designated for the Panipat plant will arrange tankers through the Regional Transport Office (RTO) for transporting oxygen to the city. The team designated for the Bhiwadi plant may also avail of tankers from the RTO if the need requires.MCG officials said that the vehicles from the Bhiwadi plant will supply liquid medical oxygen directly to 10-12 hospitals that have their own oxygen tanks, such as Medanta, Fortis, Artemis, Max hospital, Park and Metro hospitals, among others while the oxygen from the Panipat plant will be transported to the three oxygen refill stations, two of which are in Manesar and one in Sector 16. From the three refilling stations, oxygen will be supplied through cylinders to the remaining hospitals in the city. There are 43 Covid-19 hospitals in Gurugram.Singh said that all teams deputed in oxygen supply management will work round-the-clock and they have been directed to deal with all oxygen-related matters on priority to avoid a crisis. According to private hospitals, at least six people have died in the city since Sunday due to a shortage of oxygen.To address the shortage of oxygen in Gurugram, deputy commissioner Yash Garg on Sunday had formed an eight-member committee to devise a district oxygen plan for the city. The committee comprised seven officials from the MCG and one from the Gurugram police.In the first meeting of the MCG’s committee on Tuesday, members met Singh at his residence in Civil Lines along with other senior MCG officials to take stock of the oxygen situation in the city.Singh said that the MCG has constituted another team for determining the average oxygen requirement of the district, the individual requirement of hospitals, current availability and projected requirement for at least the next four days. “Depending on these factors, the team will be responsible for making a schedule for distribution and determining the delivery time, as per the requirement. All teams have been directed to ensure the city soon has enough oxygen stock, so that there is always a buffer of 10 metric tonnes of liquid medical oxygen. This will ensure that hospitals and clinics never run out of oxygen and there is always a surplus,” said Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/mcg-takes-charge-of-oxygen-supply-to-ensure-buffer-for-emergencies-101619546371454.html
27-04-2021||Gurugram||G’gram admin urges all medical professionals to help in Covid care||The Gurugram administration has appealed to private doctors, retired medical professionals, and MBBS students to come forward and help in managing Covid-19 cases as the work for increasing bed facilities continues amid the rise in the coronavirus cases, the officials said on Tuesday.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said, “Right now, what we need are medical professionals, hospitals, and oxygen. We will be operating makeshift hospitals in the coming days and are planning to increase the bed capacity drastically. It is an appeal to all the healthcare workers to come forward and help us... We will need more doctors. This is an extraordinary time, which demands such extraordinary measures.”The district administration, through social media, put out an appeal on Tuesday, saying, “The Gurugram administration requests for volunteer doctors, nurses, and MBBS students who are fit and willing to be available to provide services in the public health facilities. We appeal to all such doctors to come forward at this hour of need. You could be a retired government, armed forces medical services, or a private doctor. We will be immensely grateful for your support to help us treat our residents.”The appeal further mentioned that people who wish to contribute and be a part of this mission to serve Covid-positive patients can register themselves on the link: https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1gj1lSw5l7kChkmYSXhop2d886IKjonc0ikuQ_Q-nK8I/viewform?edit_requested=true. Oxygen supply is also being increased along with beds in the district, Garg said. He also appealed to the public to not panic and start finding hospitals if they test positive.“We are following three basic steps: Establishing macro containment zones and ensuring strict enforcement to contain the spread of the virus. Secondly, we are working to increase the oxygen allocation for Gurugram, and adding more beds to our health infrastructure... But while these activities are being carried out, I want to appeal to the people to not panic, while seeking beds in hospitals or monitoring their health conditions at home. I also appeal to them to not stock up basic medicines, oxygen meters, and other medical equipment as the patients who really need these may not get it on time,” Garg added.The officials also said that the district administration and the health department are setting up new hospital beds, but access to the public might get delayed till oxygen allocation of the district is increased. At present, Gurugram has an allocation of 35 metric tonnes of medical oxygen.“We are setting up excess beds amid the rise in the cases, but till our oxygen allocation is not increased, the opening of these new centres is also getting delayed, because if something unfortunate happens to the patients, then it will be difficult to manage the situation,” said a senior official, requesting anonymity.Gurugram crossed the active caseload of 29,000 mark with 3,684 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday and reported 10 deaths. The recovery rate in the district is at 72.74%, while the fatality rate stands at 0.40%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/ggram-admin-urges-all-medical-professionals-to-help-in-covid-care-101619546370790.html

The death toll also rose to 15,009, with 381 deaths, highest since the onset of the pandemic, according to Covid-19 bulletin released by the Delhi government. This is also the 6th day in a row that the Capital has reported over 300 deaths due to Covid-19.The Delhi government tested 73,811 samples in the last 24 hours - 16,121 more than the tests conducted between April 25 and April 26 - which means the spike in cases can be attributed to more tests being conducted in the last 24 hours.The Capital’s positivity rate fell slightly to 32.72%. Delhi had reported 36.24% positivity rate last Thursday, highest since the pandemic began. Delhi's positivity rate stood at 35.02% on Monday. The tally of active cases in the city stood at 98,264.Delhi continues to face severe crisis of medical oxygen, essential medicines like Remdesivir and other medical equipment required to fight Covid-19. The Delhi high court on Tuesday criticised the Delhi government for failing to check black marketing and hoarding of medical oxygen. It ordered the Delhi government to deploy an officer at an oxygen refilling plant and also issued contempt notices to five refillers.

I request Linde India to prepare and send Oxygen to Rajasthan since I received a similar request from CM Ashok Gehlot Monday. Hope this will help save lives of people in Delhi as well as citizens of Jharkhand living in Delhi,” Jharkhand CM Hemant Soren said, after virtually flagging off the tankers. Health minister Banna Gupta said the state has sent 90 MT LMO to Uttar Pradesh (UP) during the past thee days, 80 MT to Haryana, 12 MT to Bihar and 20 MT daily to Jharkhand itself from Linde India’s two plants in Jamshedpur.“The two Linde plants in Jamshedpur produce 2,550 MT and 1,290 MT Oxygen daily, respectively, of which 303 MT is LMO. We have suppled LMO to various states by 35 tankers,” Abhijit, Linde India senior manager, said.Besides, SAIL’s Bokaro Steel Plant on Tuesday sent 64 MT LMO in six tankers on board the fourth Oxygen Express to Bhopal and Jabalpur in Madhya Pradesh from Bokaro. This took the total amount of LMO transported by South Eastern Railway (SER) to 234 MT since April 23. Earlier, LMO was sent thrice to Lucknow (UP) from Bokaro.East Singhbhum DC Suraj Kumar said two more tankers left for UP Tuesday evening from Linde India Plant, apart from the two to New Delhi. “We have three Oxygen plants and six refilling plants. We have procured 800 B type and 120 D type (jumbo) oxygen cylinders from local industries,” said Kumar.Meanwhile, Tata Steel doubled its LMO production to 600 MT from 300 MT daily to supply it to seven states and five hospitals in Jamshedpur.

27-04-2021||Ranchi||State logs over 1,000 deaths in last 26 days||Jharkhand has witnessed an unprecedented surge in deaths due to Covid-19 during the ongoing second wave of the pandemic with over 1,000 fatalities in less than a month as opposed to the first wave last year, when a similar number of deaths was reported over a period of nine months between the months of April and December.The state’s mortality rate, for the first time since the pandemic’s outbreak last year, jumped over the 1% mark on Monday.With a record 124 casualties reported on Monday, the state’s Covid-19 toll climbed to 2,115, including 1,002 fatalities registered between April 1 and 26 this year. The state was reporting over 100 deaths daily for the last three days.The spike in the death toll, however, pushed the state’s mortality rate to its highest ever at 1.02% on April 26 from 0.89% on March 31.Health experts opine that the high number of deaths can be averted by taking preventive measures and timely medical intervention. However, they say that there deaths will spike with the rise in cases.“The number of deaths will largely depend on the number of cases in a given period of time, the infrastructure to match and accommodate the surge without diluting the quality of care,” said Dr RK Jha, former professor and head, department of medicine, Rajendra Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS), Ranchi.He added, “It is also possible that this new Covid-19 strain, Indian and UK variants, both are far more infectious and they create difficulties in detection through the conventional RT-PCR / RAT test. No wonder that many deaths have taken place because of late diagnosis or death outside hospital due to denial of admission to such cases.”“Also there is a need to change the treatment strategies, that is the place and timing of steroid and monoclonal antibodies vis-à-vis newer variants. In last two to three weeks of the second wave, it took a toll without warning as people, in general, believed that the pandemic was over and they fully gave up the cumbersome Covid appropriate behaviour.”Dr Dewesh Kumar, assistant professor of department of preventive and social medicine RIMS, said, “There is wide spread infection. So, with the rise in cases, deaths will also rise. This is a pan-India scenario. The high number of deaths could have been averted had there been adequate preparations. It is suggestive to start taking medicines with the first advent of symptom in order to ward off fatality. Fever, diarrhoea and other symptoms should be taken as a sign of infection. Those who are fit should also follow all dietary and other Covid-19 protocol to keep infection at bay.”State capital Ranchi, which is the hardest hit by the pandemic, reported the maximum 382 out of the 1,002 deaths in last 26 days. Besides, many Covid-19 patients also died in Ranchi hospitals during treatment, but their deaths were counted in their respective districts’ tally.The huge number of deaths, including those from other districts occurring in Ranchi, has resulted in chaos at cremation grounds, as an electric crematorium at Harmu developed snag and the administration was forced to identify another place to dispose of bodies manually in the traditional way.According to the health department’s bulletin of April 27 morning, Jharkhand has so far reported 207,288 cases, including 155,669 recoveries, 49,504 active cases and 2,115 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-logs-over-1-000-deaths-in-last-26-days-101619542410212.html

He said no decision had been taken so far with regard to movement of long-distance express trains.ECR officials said the railway board was monitoring bookings/reservations made for long-distance trains and operation of some of the express trains might also be regulated for want of required number of passengers on them. “Trains passing through Bihar are facing crisis of passengers. Still, they are being run for convenience of the people,” said an official.The trains, whose operation would be suspended, include Patna-Gaya, Patna-Deen Dayal Upadhyay, Muzaffarpur-Patliputra, Muzaffapur-Narkatia, Muzaffarpur-Raxaul, Patna-Barauni, Samastipur-Muzaffarpur, Patna-Danapur-Rajgir intercity, Patna-Bhabua intercity, etc.Oxygen Express skips Bihar The much-talked about initiative of the Indian Railways to transport liquid medical oxygen through Oxygen Express trains would not help Bihar even as hospitals in Patna and in rest of the state are reeling under severe shortage of oxygen. The CPRO said the Oxygen Express trains were not meant to carry liquefied oxygen to Bihar.In the absence of adequate supply of liquefied medical oxygen, authorities in the state have been striving hard to restore operation of defunct oxygen refilling plants or enhance supplying capacity of existing oxygen generation plants and refilling centres across the state.State health minister Mangal Pandey, who had on April 20 claimed that crisis of medical oxygen would be sorted out soon, refused to respond. Talking to media persons, the minister had claimed the state would have sufficient supply of oxygen once the Oxygen Express trains became operational.Covid fund for rly staffThe ECR has set up a Covid fund to help its staff battle with the pandemic, which left at least 50 railway employees dead in the last one year. Kumar said as many as 3,884 employees and officials of ECR had contracted Covid and of them, 1,891 are still under treatment. Efforts are on to set up Covid control helpline centres at all divisions of the ECR. Unprecedented rise in Covid infections Bihar has been witnessing a massive surge in Covid cases over the past one week. “About 10,000-12,000 people are being detected positive for coronavirus everyday across the state. Around 70-90 of them are dying daily. This is official figure. The actual may be many times more,” said Gujan Patel, the Youth Congress chief of Bihar.Curbs announced on market and movement of people by the state government and individuals’ preference to stay indoors to avoid contracting the disease have also resulted in check of people’s movement. With night curfew clamped all over the state, a majority of people are not venturing out for long hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ecrsuspends-23-trains-in-state-cites-poor-occupancy-and-an-explosion-in-covid-cases-101619542291277.html
27-04-2021||Other||Vaccination drive slows down as Covid cases surge||PATNAAmid the unprecedented surge in coronavirus cases, the vaccination drive in Bihar has slowed down in past one 10 days compared to early April when it was moving at a fast pace. Officials blame the slowdown on multiple factors — shortage of medicos at the vaccination centres and infections among health workers, fear among people about lining for hours at vaccination centres to get a jab and erratic supply of vaccines at district hospitals and primary health centres in last one fortnight though it has now stabilised in last few days. In the last 26 days, the daily vaccinations to beneficiaries (aged 45 and above for both doses) have rapidly fluctuated, rising as high as 2.87 lakh on a single day on April 5 to the lowest count of 39,237 on April 16 and 53,311 persons on April 25, as per official data of daily vaccinations released by state health society. From April 1 till 11 April, the total number of jabs administered were above 1.50 lakh per day on an average. On April 5, the total number of jabs administered stood at 2,87,576. On April 10, it was 2,52,835. On April 11, it was 2,06,354. However, after April 15, when corona cases started shooting up, the figures make for a dismal reading, hovering below the one lakh mark, except on April 20 when 1,04731 beneficiaries were given jabs. On April 18, a day after Bihar saw a major spike in Covid cases with 8,690 detected on April 17, the number of vaccination was 84,475 while on 20 April, it was 93,164,. The number started declining once the Covid cases started spiralling. “It is true the vaccination drive has slowed down. A probable reason seems to be the general fear among people against venturing out due to the surge in cases. This a proving as deterrent ,” said a senior health official,engaged in the vaccination drive. “I get calls from people requesting me to give names of vaccination centres where there is less crowd. People these days do not want to spend more time outside for the fear of contracting the virus. We are also getting reports from some districts about general disinterest among people to get vaccinated. This another factor for less footfall at vaccination centres,” he said. “There were certain issues regarding supplies of vaccines in mid-April which impacted rural areas. Besides, when footfall at a centre is very less, one cannot just open vials for one or two persons as it causes wastage of doses. For last one week, we have enough stocks and supplies are going unhindered,” shared another health official, seeking anonymity. The number of peole getting second doses has recorded less fluctuations in the last 10 days, hovering between 15000 and 28000, as compared to figures in early April when the daily vaccinations for second doses varied in the same range. In all, 67,46,734 people have been vaccinated in the state as on April 26, of which 57,23,496 got the first dose and 10,23,238 the second dose too.

The IMA letter, signed by its senior vice-president Dr Ajay Kumar, honorary state secretary Dr Sunil Kumar and others, has sought CM’s immediate intervention as lack of oxygen supply could force closure of around 90 private hospitals in the city, causing risk to the lives of admitted Covid and non-Covid patients. The IMA has said doctors should be involved in the decision-making process on requirement of oxygen, and not the administration, which should solely focus on ensuring availability and preventing black marketing.. “I also work in a private hospital and there are Covid patients there. We have 18 cylinders, but we are getting 10 only. If some hospitals are resorting to any wrong practices, the administration should crack down on them, but other hospitals should not be made to suffer,” said Dr Sunil Kumar. Referring to the April 21 meeting, the IMA has said that 86 hospitals had been notified for Covid treatment in Patna and it was decided to approve them for treatment of serious patients and ensure oxygen supply. “Later, four more hospitals were added in the list on the basis of their applications. Many more hospitals are also applying or have already applied. However, the civil surgeon has told the IMA that no other hospital will be approved for Covid treatment or oxygen supply, which can pose danger to the lives of Covid and non-Covid patients admitted there,” said the IMA letter. It has also expressed concern over the information it has received about appointment of doctors only for three months, which would again cause serious shortages. “We had advised you to start the recruitment on vacant posts without delay and we welcome you order to do it without delay. In view of the pandemic, the available doctors should be appointed through walk-in-interviews on regular posts or contract with special incentives,” the letter says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ima-flags-oxygen-supply-to-select-hospitals-asks-cm-to-step-in-101619542290223.html

He expressed that this would be a demerit for beneficiaries of different programmes of the government, especially for time-bound programmes. According to a social worker, “My opinion on this latest order is 50:50. All state affairs happen at the Secretariat, so the place is like a hornet’s nest in a way. Therefore, restricting visitors is justified. On the other hand, it will be at the disadvantage of the public whose paperworks need government approval.” He opined that instead of completely shutting the Secretariat gates on the public, the government could enforce strict adherence of Covid SOP and allow visitors with genuine cases.The state has recorded 13,238 total Covid-19 cases since the outbreak last year, of which 12,135 are reported to have recovered, according to health officials. However, with the second wave, the total active cases have shot up to 727 as of April 26 in a span of weeks.Covid-19 cases continue to see a spike in India but a marginal drop in infections was reported in the past 24 hours.

27-04-2021||Pune||IMD forecast: Temperature to rise marginally in May||As April ends on a cooler note, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said that the temperature in May will rise marginally for Pune city. However, there will be more frequent weather phenomenon of thunderstorms and lightning in the city as temperature sees a rise. Anupam Kashyapi, head of weather forecasting department, IMD Pune said that the day temperature may see a marginal rise. “The temperature in May is set to rise a little. In the first 15 days, there are chances of day temperature hovering between 40 to 41 but as soon as it rises, there will be local instability in weather systems,” said Kashyapi. He added that this local instability over the weather system may incur moisture from Arabian Sea and result in rainfall spells lowering the temperature. “There are chances of light rainfall along with thunderstorms and lightning after a temperature rise in the month of May but the rise in mercury will be marginal,” said Kashyapi. He further added that this type of weather pattern is normal. “As Pune city does not have a harsh weather pattern, there are always fewer chances of heat waves here. Due to its proximity to the Arabian Sea, there are chances that when temperature rises, the local instability will incur moisture from the sea and cause rainfall.

Earlier, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had written to chief ministers of several other states for the supply of liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) into the national capital for treating critical patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).CM Soren, who is also the president of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha (JMM), tweeted, “On the request of Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, 58 tonnes of medical oxygen was sent to Delhi from the Linde India plant in Jharkhand today. This is a critical time period where one should help each other and with this participation, we will be able to overcome Covid-19”.As Delhi continues to face difficulties in obtaining oxygen supplies, the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) chief announced that his government will now import 18 cryogenic tankers from Thailand and 21 ready-to-use oxygen plants from France.इस मदद के लिए आपका तहे दिल से शुक्रिया हेमंत जी, इसी तरह एक दूसरे का साथ देते हुए हम कोरोना जैसी आपदा को ज़रूर मात देंगे। https://t.co/aoKrlLQPDkAddressing a press briefing, Kejriwal said the government will set up 44 oxygen plants at many hospitals including the 21 imported from France and the Centre will install eight plants by the end of this month.The national capital on Tuesday also received its first Oxygen Express from Chhattisgarh’s Raigarh which was carrying over 70 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen.Also Read| HC asks Delhi govt to take over oxygen refilling unit with immediate effect, serves contempt notice against 5 refillersHowever, Kejriwal’s government is currently facing criticism over its handling of the oxygen crisis.

The court also said the government should take strict measures to ensure that medical oxygen should not cost thousands and lakhs of rupees due to hoarding or black marketing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/thank-you-wholeheartedly-tweets-kejriwal-as-delhi-gets-oxygen-from-jharkhand-101619535421431.html
27-04-2021||Pune||Woman charged with MCOCA found dead at Sassoon hospital||A woman who was booked under the Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime (MCOCA) was found dead at Sassoon General Hospital on Tuesday evening while being under the arrest of Pune police. The woman was under arrest in the case of abetment to suicide of Milind alias Balwant Marathe (60), a resident of Bhandarkar road area of Pune. The case was registered at Vishrambaug police station under Sections 306, 452, 386, 504, 506, 507, and 34 of Indian Penal Code along with Sections 39 and 45 of Maharashtra Money Lending Act. On Tuesday, the Pune police invoked Sections 3(1)(i) and 3(4) off Maharashtra Control of Organised Crime (MCOCA) against the woman and her co-accused Nilesh Umesh Shelar. “She was arrested under MCOCA yesterday (Monday) but also tested positive for Covid-19 yesterday (Monday). So, she was placed under judicial custody and admitted to Sassoon General Hospital. She said she was going for a bath and to wash clothes and once inside, she refused to open the door for a long time. When our people forcefully entered the bathroom, they found the glass tiles on the ventilation window to have been removed,” said Rahul Patil, deputy commissioner of police, Zone-2, Pune. The police rushed to the spot that is located between the morgue and the 11-storey building dedicated to Covid-19 treatment. “There is a metal frame and glass to that window, and it is big enough for a person to pass through. The glasses had been removed and she was found lying under the window. The logical conclusion is that she jumped from there,” said Chandrakant Sangale, assistant commissioner of police, Lashkar Division of Pune police. “We have no idea what happened. We are looking at her body lying near the new building of Sassoon hospital. We were just told that it happened around an hour ago,” said one of her colleagues who was standing near the main gate of the 11-floor Covid wing. The stringent MCOCA was invoked against the woman after an application was made to additional commissioner of police Sanjay Shinde stating that the duo, led by Kale, had committed various crimes including attempted murder, abetment to suicide, extortion, uploading and spreading false videos among other things. “We request with folded hands to all to report that she was murdered, she cannot commit suicide. Her husband has already made a complaint regarding the same when she was arrested. She herself had complained to honourable JMFC about atrocities committed upon her by the police,” said advocate Tosif Sayyed who worked with Kale.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/woman-charged-with-mcoca-found-dead-at-sassoon-hospital-101619538929735.html

In the last three weeks, the Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC), Market yard collected a fine of ₹17, 700 from traders in similar cases of mango fraud. “We are continuing our raids every day and after seizing, the mangoes are confiscated by APMC and auctioned at gate No 1. The traders were selling 10-kilogram boxes for ₹11,800 when the actual price of Karnataka Hapus is ₹8,100,” said Madhukant Garad, administrator and secretary APMC Gultekdi Market Yard Pune. The APMC have warned traders of facing legal punishment if the same type of trading continues. “The mangoes are packed in a box which has a label in Marathi which reads as ‘Ratnagiri Hapus Mango’ which confuses the buyers who believe the mangoes are from Ratnagiri. Traders claim that the farmers in Karnataka are at fault who are packing their mangoes with a label of Ratnagiri. We will continue our inquiry in the coming days as well,” said Garad. The APMC is also investigating whether traders are arranging boxes from Ratnagiri to pack the mangoes. “Every year some traders which are not regular in the Market Yard try to fool buyers and it is a wrong practice. Old traditional sellers do not fall into this type of business,” said Vilas Bhujbal, president, Market Yard Commission Agents.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/three-traders-fined-for-selling-mango-claiming-false-origin-101619538809709.html

This has come down to 58 per cent, as of Tuesday. “Now, per day demand is for 16,000-18,000 injections. Whatever supply we are getting is being distributed to hospitals in accordance with bed capacity. As supply is not meeting demand, there is a backlog,” said Vijay Deshmukh, Pune’s additional collector. From April 11, the Pune collector’s office prohibited the retail sale of the anti-viral drug and began a centralised distribution from a control room in the collector’s office. On April 15, district officials cited the requirement of Remdesivir injections as being 45,000. According to a press statement issued by the district collectorate, 53,900 Remdesivir injections have been distributed till April 26. Remdesivir side effects? Not in Pune, say docsAs demand for Remdesivir is still high, the administration the asked doctors to prescribe the drug judicially. Speaking to reporters, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said, “Doctors should prescribe the anti-viral drug only to those who require it instead of giving it to everyone. It has come to our notice that Remdesivir has some side effects. Which is why, we are saying it should be prescribed judiciously.” Doctors, however, said no major side effects have been reported in Pune so far. “As of today, there are no post-recovery effects seen from Remdesivir. It is not given to patients below 12 years of age, or to those who have the liver or kidneys in a compromised condition,” said Dr Avinash Bondwe, immediate past president (Maharashtra), Indian Medical Association.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/remdesivir-supply-catching-up-with-demand-backlog-as-demand-marginally-drops-101619535569284.html

Besides that, we are collecting bio-waste from Covid centres and hospitals. Patients generate 100gms of garbage, per head, at home, every day.” At present, PMC collects Covid-generated waste, such as disposable plates and water bottles, from Covid care centres and hospitals. As per the SOP, private and PMC hospitals should spray 1% sodium hypochlorite on the garbage and hand it over in a yellow bag to the PMC.PMC has contracted Pasco Environmental Solution to dispose of its bio-medical waste.Patients in home isolation will have to separate wet and dry garbage generated and also spray sodium hypochlorite, before handing it over to the garbage collector. “Most home isolation patients prefer a tiffin system for food, so that reduces the waste generated,” Ghatge said.PMC’s solid waste management department has appealed to all private hospitals, Covid centres and patients in home isolation to follow the SoPs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-issues-sops-for-segregation-disposal-of-waste-generated-by-covid-patients-101619533468944.html

The doctors had requested the family to take her to another hospital as there were no ICU beds available at Apollo and the patient was crashing,” hospital personnel said.The 60-year-old woman was brought to the hospital emergency last night and was in the need of an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. However, there were no ICU beds available.The patient died at around 8 am after which the family and some local goons started vandalising the emergency department. By 9 am, more people had joined in; some carried blades that they used to injure some staff members, others were pushed around in the scuffle and hurt their head.“No one was seriously injured; many needed first aid,” the personnel said.The hospital had to suspend emergency services for around two hours after the incident.“Unfortunately, the patient died at around 8 am after which the patient’s family members resorted to vandalism, destruction of hospital property and assault on our doctors and staff. The situation was brought under control through hospital security staff and the police deployment. While the hospital deeply condoles the death of the patient, it is deeply shocked at the behaviour of the patient’s family against doctors and healthcare workers who are providing untiring services amidst the pandemic,” a statement from the hospital read.Similar incidents of violence and rage are reported from government hospitals across the national capital that are grappling with a shortage of ICU beds, infrastructure, and consumables to treat the Covid-19 patients. With the cases of Covid-19 shooting up in Delhi/NCR, hospitals have been packed to the brim.

27-04-2021||Patna||Bihar: Darbhanga group conducts last rites of Covid patients as kin stay away||A group of volunteers named Kabir Sewa Sansthan (KSS) is setting an example in Bihar’s Darbhanga district by performing last rites of Covid-19 patients whose bodies are either left unclaimed or not handled by the relatives for the fear of contracting the highly contagious disease. The second wave of Covid infection has not only overwhelmed the healthcare infrastructure in several states but also led to the overflowing of crematoriums and burial grounds and the pressure is also telling on KSS.“We had to face a trying situation a couple of days ago, while arranging the funeral of a 45- year old suspected corona victim as only one distant relative [of the deceased] was ready to handle the body. People in the neighbourhood shut their doors. Finally we managed to carry out his last rites 20 hours later,” said KSS founder Navin Sinha.He found himself in a similar situation on Sunday night, when last rites for four Covid patients were carried out, including two unclaimed bodies and two nearly abandoned by their relatives, who watched from a distance, refusing to come close as the pyres were lit.Sinha says KSS has disposed at least two dozen bodies, including three from the Muslim community in the last 10 days. In around 50% of the cases, relatives refuse to participate in the last rites due to the fear factor. The group has handled at least 50 funerals since June last year when the town’s first corona casualty, a Muslim from Panchobh village in Hanuman Nagar block, was cremated.“I have almost lost count... because with every passing day, the number simply keeps growing,” Sinha said, while putting this reporter’s call on hold to attend to some other desperate caller requesting for an oxygen cylinder for a Covid patient. “I divert such calls to competent authorities,” he said. Shortage of oxygen supply for Covid patients is another challenge that hospitals across the country including those in Bihar are grappling with.Bihar registered 11,801 fresh Covid cases on Monday with capital Patna being the worst-hit. According to the daily health bulletin released by the government, the state saw 67 fresh casualties, taking the death toll to 2,222. Among the fresh fatalities, Patna saw the death of 16 patients followed by seven each in Darbhanga, Gaya and Muzaffarpur. Bhagalpur accounted for five deaths besides Nalanda and West Champaran that accounted for four deaths each.KSS has now urged the civic administration and the relatives of dead patients to extend a helping hand.“KSS is a group of nearly a dozen volunteers who started with the aim of helping the administration. [But] It is now becoming difficult to lead in the present situation,” Sinha said, adding, “We are always ready to support the noble cause with help from the district and civic administration.”The response to his appeal has been encouraging. The municipal commissioner personally visited the cremation ground and instructed the civic body staff to increase their participation in the handling of mortal remains and also assist KSS in any way possible. Similarly, the district magistrate (DM) Thiyagrajan SM too asked civic authorities to arrange manpower to help KSS organise the funerals.“On Monday, we cremated five bodies and even their relatives too took part in the rituals while dressed in safety gears,” Sinha said, pointing out the impact of his appeal to relatives to not abandon their dead.Since the very outset of the pandemic, the district administration roped in KSS for disposal of unclaimed bodies, an official in the municipal body said. Founded in 2014, the group initially pooled funds from their own pockets, however, many people later chipped in with monetary support. Civic body too arranged for cow dung cakes for lighting pyres.“It is great humanitarian work in these difficult times when close relatives or even a son doesn’t want to handle a Covid-infected father’s body,” said Vishal Kumar Singh, district programme manager (health). He said administration was providing all assistance to KSS in this endeavour.No one in the group has been infected by Covid since last year when they started handling bodies of infected patients. “Though we have been at risk, our confidence [of handling the bodies without catching infection] has gone up gradually,” Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/darbhanga-group-conducts-last-rites-of-covid-patients-as-kin-stay-away-101619530889097.html

So far, we have buried or cremated over 1,200 victims in Pune city and adjoining villages in the Maharashtra district," Ummat Foundation member Javed Khan told PTI."Many a times, family members or relatives are unable to come, but we ensure that the last rites are conducted with all respect and as per their tradition," Khan said.He said the number of deaths due to COVID-19 has increased in the second wave of the viral infection, and their group members are now working 24X7.Two days ago, they got a call about the death of an elderly member of a Brahmin family, which was in isolation after contracting the viral infection, he said."Our volunteers in PPE kits reached there with a body bag, brought the mortal remains to a crematorium and conducted the last rites as per their rituals," he said.Sharfuddin Shaikh (64), the oldest member of the group, said their work was all about "humanity" and the objective was to give the dead person a decent farewell in the absence of relatives and loved ones."On many occasions, when family members of the deceased cannot make it to the crematorium or burial ground as they are in quarantine, we arrange video calls for them while performing the last rites," he said.Shaikh said that late Sunday evening, they received a call from Talegaon town, located about 35 km from here, about a COVID-19 victim's death."Since the family members were unable to perform the burial, they requested us to help them. We rushed to the hospital, collected the body, performed the burial in Talegaon and returned to Pune city around 3 am on Monday," he said.Asked how they are managing while fasting during the holy month of Ramadan, Shaikh said the Almighty was providing them strength to continue the humanitarian work.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/social-group-in-pune-ensures-dignified-farewell-to-covid-19-victims-101619528083300.html

Sharma added that the central government has allocated 67,000 doses till April 30, but the state has only received 30,000 so far. “We request that the remaining 37,000 doses be given to us immediately,” he told news agency ANI after meeting Union minister of chemicals and fertilisers Mansukh Mandavia in Delhi.Sharma, along with state energy minister BD Kalla and state urban development minister Shanti Dhariwal, had arrived in the national capital earlier today to meet Union ministers and appraise them of the shortage of medical oxygen and essential medicines in Rajasthan.रेमडेसिविर और टोसीलीजुमैब की कमी है। केंद्र ने हमें 30 अप्रैल तक के लिए 67,000 आवंटित किया है। हमें अभी तक 30,000 मिला है। हम कह रहे हैं कि ये 37,000 हमें तत्काल दिया जाए: केंद्रीय रसायन और उर्वरक मंत्री मनसुख मंडाविया से मुलाकात के बाद राजस्थान के स्वास्थ्य मंत्री रघु शर्मा pic.twitter.com/ncshcvnDy4The Rajasthan health minister’s request comes two days after he claimed that the Congress government in the state had placed an order for 175,000 Remdesivir injections from several drug manufacturers this month, but managed to only receive 28,350 of them. Last week, the Jaipur Police arrested three people and detained three others for alleged black marketing of the antiviral drug.

Health minister Sharma said on Sunday that the government had spoken to the Serum Institute of India (SII) for procuring more vaccine doses. “When we spoke to the Serum Institute, we were told it may take till May 15 to fulfill orders placed by the Government of India (GoI) and that they won’t be able to deliver vaccines to Rajasthan before it,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-urges-centre-to-supply-pending-doses-of-remdesivir-tocilizumab-101619526359459.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||At Delhi crematoriums, corpses wait in 20-hour queues to burn||Under the high tin roof, 50 funeral pyres burned fiercely on Tuesday, the hot air filled with smoke, fine ash, and muted sobs of shell-shocked families. Nearby, lying unattended on the floor, and in scores of parked vehicles, more corpses awaited their turn, which relatives were told would come 16 to 20 hours later. Shaking Delhi's spirit and soul, an unimaginable tragedy is unfolding at New Delhi's crematoriums struggling to cope with the deluge of the dead arriving at a frightening pace."I have not seen such a bad situation ever before in my life. People are moving with the dead bodies of their loved ones from pillar to post ... almost all Delhi crematoriums are flooded with dead bodies," Vineeta Massey, the owner of Massey Funerals, told PTI.  By official count, 3,601 people have died this month, of them 2,267 in the last seven days alone in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic which is terrorising and tormenting the city. In all of February, the death toll was 57, and in March 117. As if the trauma of losing a loved one to the virus so suddenly is not enough, there is more grief in store for relatives who are not even able to give them a proper send-off.They arrive at crematoriums with bodies, only to be turned away. They drive to another facility, and yet another, traversing the city with the mortal remains in personal cars or ambulances, desperately seeking a graceful exit for their father, mother, son, or daughter from the material world.The trauma is no less for the relatives of those who died of non-Covid causes but are being swept up in the collective national tragedy driven by the pandemic. Aman Arora, a young entrepreneur from West Delhi's Ashok Nagar, lost his father ML Arora to a heart attack on Monday afternoon. "We rushed him to many private hospitals when he started feeling discomfort in his chest but he was not even checked by the medical staff there. They demanded that we produce a Covid-negative report. He eventually passed away," said Aman. On Monday afternoon, Aman was told by the staff in west Delhi’s Subhash Nagar crematorium to wait until Tuesday morning to perform the last rites.  When Aman realised there was no point in pleading, he arranged for a refrigerator to prevent his father's dead body from decaying. "What could I have done when there was no space? We kept the body in a rented fridge and have come early today (Tuesday)," said Aman, waiting for his turn as many other people milled around silently with dead bodies lying on the floor. Outside, ambulances and cars honked and competed for parking space but inside, all one could hear was the crackling of dry wood from the burning pyres -- all 50 of them roaring simultaneously. A few sobs arose over the sound of the fires, and one could hear the unemotional intonations of instructions being given by the crematorium staff. "Apna dead body uthao aur udhar line mein ja ke khade ho jao (Pick up your dead body and go stand in line)," said a young staffer. A woman in her 40s was so stunned she couldn't make out what was 'nabhi' (navel) or 'chhati' (chest) when a staff member asked her to place sandalwood sticks on the body of her father who had died of Covid.The body was still packed in a white sack, which was placed on the pyre without opening.Holding the sandalwood sticks in trembling hands, she moved around the body before being helped by someone."I didn't even see the face of my father," wailed the woman, who was alone.    Manmeet Singh, a 40-year-old assistant professor, also carried his father Gurpal Singh's dead body in his car to the Subhash Nagar crematorium on Monday afternoon.But the staff politely told him his father couldn't be cremated because the pyre chambers were already full and the CNG crematorium at the center could only accommodate two bodies at one time.It takes about 90 minutes to dispose of one body in a CNG chamber and a PTI correspondent counted 24 bodies waiting in queue for a slot. With no option left, Manmeet left for the MCD crematorium in Pashchim Vihar about six kilometers away and luckily got space with the help of an MCD inspector."If you can't provide oxygen to the patients in hospitals, then at least provide some space in the cremation ground so that people leave the world comfortably," said Manmeet. The ground at the crematorium was full of filth and covered with leftovers of the previous cremation. It was muddy and rotten fruits were scattered all over. Plastic bags, sacks, buckets, mugs littered the ground. But none of that mattered to the relatives. What mattered was enough space to light a pyre.According to rules, said a senior official at the Delhi Health Department, if somebody dies of Covid-19 in hospital, the district administration has to arrange a hearse van, and the hospital is supposed to deploy staff for the disposal of the dead body at the crematorium and graveyard. But the crush of the dead has made it impossible for hospitals to provide hearses. So relatives are simply taking the bodies in their vehicles. "If family members move with the body of their loved ones in their personal vehicles, there are chances of being infected," another government official said.  Ajeet, a staff member at the MCD crematorium, told PTI they have created more than 100 extra makeshift chambers in an adjacent space to accommodate the increasing number of dead people -- both Covid-19 and natural deaths. "I can't move my arms, I am dead tired. The whole day we arrange for cremation and then in the night we have to take care of the pyres so that the fire consumes the bodies properly," said Ajeet.The chaos at the crematoriums has raised questions about the Delhi government's preparedness for the second wave, which Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, had left the healthcare system on the brink of collapse. Many deaths have also been attributed to a severe oxygen shortage for the last 10 days. The fixing of responsibility will happen later.But for now, "this is the time for us to build solidarity and enough compassion for the poor people fighting the pandemic," said Harsh Mander, a former IAS bureaucrat who is now a civil rights activist. "The wealthy and the influential thought that they have an escape route to all this but this pandemic told us that we are all in this together," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/at-delhi-crematoriums-corpses-wait-in-20-hour-queues-to-burn-101619522536735.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi HC says it made no request to Ashoka Hotel to turn it into Covid facility||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said that it did not request the Delhi government to ask The Ashoka to turn its premises into a Covid-19 facility for Delhi high court judges and other judicial officers and their families on a priority basis. The Delhi high court told the Delhi government that it gives a false impression that the request was made by the court. The court ordered the Delhi government to take corrective measures with regard to the order asking for requisitioning beds in The Ashoka. "You think that when people are not able to get a bed, we will ask for 100 beds in a five-star hotel," the court said. The court also said that it gives out a wrong projection about the judiciary. The Delhi government on Monday issued an order asking The Ashoka to convert 100 rooms of the hotel into Covid-19 care centres. The Delhi government also said that it was acting on a request from the Delhi high court. The order was issued by the sub-divisional magistrate of Chanakyapuri on Sunday and said that the facility at Ashoka Hotel will be in association with Primus Hospital. The Delhi HC also pulled up the Delhi government over the oxygen crisis which hospitals are facing on Tuesday. It ordered the Delhi government to immediately place an officer at a said plant and also issued notices to five refillers. It asked the Delhi government to stop black marketing of oxygen cylinders and essential medical devices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-hc-says-it-made-no-request-to-ashoka-hotel-to-turn-it-into-covid-facility-101619524622200.html

The murdered woman’s domestic help was also shot while trying to save the woman, but he is likely to survive, said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east). The crime, which was captured by a CCTV camera, showed the alleged killer taking his own time to fire about a dozen rounds at his wife. According to the DCP, the woman, Saina, was earlier married to Sharafat Sheikh, an alleged gangster and drug dealer who is in jail after being booked under MCOCA and NDPS Act.Saina was arrested a few months ago for her alleged involvement in drug deals, only to be released on bail on Saturday on the ground that she was eight months pregnant with twins. “About a year ago, Saina married a man named Waseem. We are still ascertaining whether she was legally separated from Sheikh or not,” the DCP said. But when Saina was in jail, the DCP said, Waseem entered into an extramarital relationship with her sister. “When Saina was released from jail on bail, Waseem did not meet her. That led to frequent quarrels between them,” the DCP said. Also Read | ‘Your system has failed’: HC asks Delhi govt to take action on oxygen hoardingThe quarrels culminated in a final showdown outside Saina’s house on Tuesday morning. CCTV footage showed Waseem purportedly pulling out a gun and trying to shoot Saina. It was at that moment that Saina’s domestic help, Shahdat, tried to step in but got shot. Thereafter, Waseem can purportedly be seen taking several aims at his wife’s head and other body parts, reloading his gun and then shooting at the collapsed woman repeatedly. In between, he brandished his gun, threatening local residents to stay away during most of the drama. The DCP said that since the suspect was known, his parents were contacted and he was nabbed soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-kills-drug-dealer-pregnant-wife-in-delhi-video-of-killing-surfaces-101619522308090.html

The court also said that if the Delhi government is unable to address the situation then it will ask officers of the central government to take over."Set your house in order. Enough is enough. If you are not able to manage then tell us we will ask the Centre to send its officers. We will ask them to take over," the court said.The Delhi high court told the Delhi government that its system has collapsed and strict measures should be taken to ensure that medical oxygen which comes at a minimal cost should not cost several thousand or lakhs of rupees due to black marketing or hoarding.The court expressed its displeasure over oxygen refillers as well who were not present at the proceedings, while also expressing its displeasure towards the Delhi government for not issuing proper instructions to oxygen refillers."We will ask you to take action against the refillers and issue a contempt notice because they did not appear even after they were called... This cylinder business is a mess. You have to look into it and put your house in order. If they are belligerent, then they will see our belligerence. Keep them in custody if they are playing with people's life like this," it said.The court also ordered the Delhi government to send its officers to the oxygen plants and take over the running of those plants if required. "Post your officer (over there) and let them run it. You have all the power in law to take them in custody," it said.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli while hearing a plea made by hospitals regarding the shortage of oxygen and drugs like Remdesivir said that the Delhi government is not able to deal with the rising cases. "Your system has failed. Black-marketing of oxygen still continues. How are people procuring oxygen? Large-scale hoarding is going and you are not taking action. Take action against them," the court told the Delhi government.Amid the proceedings, Venkateshwara Hospital and Maharaja Agrasen Hospital said that their oxygen reserves will not last for long and will put the lives of patients in peril due to the shortage."This is a huge surge in cases. You are not able to deal with the numbers," the court observed.The Delhi high court's sharp criticism comes after several hospitals reported that they were facing an oxygen shortage.

27-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi setting up 1,200 ICU beds, importing oxygen plants, containers: Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said they are setting up 1,200 additional intensive care unit (ICU) beds and importing oxygen plants and cryogenic tankers from France and Thailand even as the oxygen situation has improved over the last two days. A surge in Covid-19 cases over the last fortnight triggered a shortage of essential resources such as medical oxygen and resulted in a steep increase in deaths.“We do not have as many SOS calls from hospitals now as we got on those three days [last week]. I want to thank the Central government for helping us through this time by providing their top officials, who worked in close coordination with the senior officers of the Delhi government. I thank our Delhi government officials too who have worked day and night to address the crisis,” he said at a digital press conference.The oxygen crisis in Delhi worsened on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. “Hospitals were jam-packed, and I was scared that any major untoward incident may lead to deaths due to lack of oxygen.”Kejriwal said they were arranging 500 ICU beds at the Ramlila Ground in front of Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. “Another 500 ICU beds are being readied at the main Ramlila Ground in front of Lok Nayak Hospital. At the Radha Saomi Satsang facility, we are arranging 200 ICU beds.” Kejriwal said by May 10, they will add 1,200 ICU beds to the Covid-19 infrastructure, which is now totally overstretched.He said the current Covid-19 wave is dangerous because it is more infectious and is making patients severely ill. “That is why the demand for ICU beds has increased manifold.” He said every hospital is treating patients more than its capacity. “All ICU beds are full. The Central government gave us 500 ICU beds at the DRDO [Defence Research and Development Organisation] facility in Delhi Cantt, but all beds got filled in just three hours.” He added it means Delhi has so many serious patients struggling to get ICU treatment. Delhi on Tuesday reported Covid-19 XXXX cases and XXX deaths, taking it tally of infections to XXX and toll from the pandemic to XXXX. Also Read | After testing Covid positive on Monday, Chhota Rajan admitted to AIIMS todayKejriwal said they have been unable to receive their share of oxygen allotted by the Centre due to a shortage of tankers. “The Delhi government has decided to import 18 cryogenic tankers from Bangkok [Thailand], which will start arriving from tomorrow [Wednesday],” he said. Kejriwal said they have sought the Centre’s help to have the Indian Air Force airlift these tankers. “Once these 18 tankers reach the city, the problem of transporting liquid oxygen will be solved, and Delhi will start getting its full quota of oxygen from the Centre…”Kejriwal, who thanked the Centre for giving them five imported tankers, said they would set up 44 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen plants at Delhi hospitals in over a month. “We are importing 21 PSA oxygen plants from France. These are ready-to-use plants and will be installed in different hospitals. In the next month, we will be installing 44 PSA oxygen plants in Delhi. Of these, eight are being installed by the Centre. For some reason, the project was delayed, but now by April 30, these eight plants will be ready. The remaining 36 oxygen plants will be set up by the Delhi government of which 21 are being imported from France and 15 are indigenous.”The Centre provides up to 490 MT of oxygen to Delhi daily, but it has faced a deficit of about 100MT due to transportation issues.Kejriwal said many chief ministers and industrialists came forward to help the Delhi government after he wrote to them seeking support. “Talks have advanced with some of them, but they have requested not to be named. So, I thank all the chief ministers, industrialists, NGOs, and religious organisations who have come out to help us in this crisis.

27-04-2021||Pune||Civic Sanskriti: Mango magic... the treasure troves that sustain us all||While the brilliant Amaltas flowers are a visual delight, it is the Mango that is perhaps the most loved and delicious component of the golden Indian summer.Street carts and bazaar shelves across Pune are filled with thousands of petis of mangoes. How many varieties of mango can you name? Alphonso, Banganapalli, Chausa, Dussheri, Kesari, Payari …Some years ago, my colleague Satish Awate involved students from school-ecoclubs in the Sahyadris, or the northern Western Ghats, to look for as many mango varieties as they could find. Students explored farms, village commons, and nearby areas, mapped the trees and interviewed elders. Awate delights in narrating the unusual varieties and stories the children found. One mango variety tastes like curd, another like shepu (dill leaves). One smells like lemon, another like kerosene and yet another like bed bugs! Some varieties resemble other fruits and confusingly are named for the other fruit – so a mango that tastes like an apple is called safarchand. There are even mango varieties that taste like bananas and pumpkins. Some trees and varieties have historical significance. Babasaheb Ambedkar is believed to have camped below a particular mango tree named Madhgoti in Uravade village not far from Pune and enjoyed its fruits. There is often a distinct mango variety for each preparation – chutney, sabjis and curries, mango rice, pickle, fruit, aam ras, amrakhand, aam papad, and murabba. Some varieties, like the Alphonso, are carefully cultivated and are a major source of income from local sales and exports. Other varieties are highly local and grow in wild or semi-wild conditions. Students of the participating schools recorded over 200 varieties of mangoes from about 60 locations in the Western Ghats. A study of these varieties has been done by CEE with IISER, Pune, to understand how distinct these popular varieties are at the genetic level. Having large varietal diversity in a crop makes it possible to choose or develop varieties that can withstand climate change impacts. Different varieties are able to tolerate drought, high rainfall or extreme heat conditions, or pest attacks. The Western Ghats harbour not only varieties of our favourite mango, but many other types of fruits, vegetables, fodder, medicinal plants, trees yielding timber, grasses or shrubs yielding fibre. These mountainous ecosystems are also the origins of the rivers that drain the Deccan and southern Indian region. This mosaic of wilderness, forests and grassy patches, rivers and streams, village common lands, and farmlands in the Western Ghats is invaluable as a sustaining inter-dependent life force. When we remove a few components, hack some forests here and there, we start to unravel a complex web of life that has taken millennia to evolve. The Western Ghats are one of 36 “hotspots” of biodiversity in the world. A hotspot is both a positive and a negative qualification. As a biodiversity hotspot, the Western Ghats are unique with at least 1,500 species of plants that are not found elsewhere in the world. Unfortunately, the “hotspot” label also indicates that this natural vegetation is highly threatened. This means that the Western Ghats harbour irreplaceable life forms, and they are being lost. For example, scientists and civic groups have questioned the need for projects such as the doubling of the railway line in Mollem National Park on the Western Ghats in Goa to increase commercial cargo handling. With this project and the existing highway and power line projects, a large tract of forest with 60,000 trees would be erased in the Mollem National Park.Covid and lockdowns have hit us hard, but projects with short term gains to a few, and increased risks to both humans and other species seem like Sheikh Chilli cutting off the branch on which he sat! Instead, we need innovative approaches that help to restore the economy and livelihoods while strengthening the natural resource base including biodiversity. It is a call to those who develop and support innovations, help incubate solutions and especially micro enterprises. In the meantime, do try out different varieties of mangoes. Try to plant some mango saplings of different varieties in your neighbourhood. In a lovely connection of Satish’s Western Ghats school eco-clubs project to Pune, students from Baburaoji Gholap School in Sangvi, Pune, raised saplings of 75 mango varieties in their school nursery. These saplings were then planted in institutional campuses in Pune, and at the Botanical Garden at Shivaji University. Kolhapur. Grafts and more saplings could one day be prepared at the Botanical Garden, continuing to conserve these riches from nature. We Punekars are lucky to live close to the treasures of the Sahyadris. Those interested in joining and evolving restoration efforts are welcome to get in touch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civic-sanskriti-mango-magic-the-treasure-troves-that-sustain-us-all-101619519307162.html

27-04-2021||Delhi||After testing Covid positive on Monday, Chhota Rajan admitted to AIIMS today||Jailed gangster Chhota Rajan was rushed to New Delhi’s All India Institute of Medical Science for treatment after he tested positive for Covid-19 on Monday evening, Tihar prison official aware of the matter said on Tuesday.Rajan has been lodged in solitary confinement in one of the biggest cells at Tihar, where he was not even allowed to interact with other prisoners due to security concerns. Officials suspect he may have contracted the infection from some asymptomatic jail officer.At least 170 out of 20,500 prisoners and 60 jail officers have tested positive for Covid-19 over the last four weeks at Tihar amid the second wave of the pandemic in the country, which has overwhelmed hospitals and triggered a shortage of critical supplies needed to save lives.Activist Umar Khalid is among other prisoners, who have tested positive for Covid-19 at Tihar. He has been kept under isolation within the prison complex.Prison officials said the spread of the infection in the most crowded jail complex in the country is such that prisoners like Rajan and Bihar gangster-turned-politician Mohammed Shahabuddin, who was also in solitary confinement, have tested positive. Other prisoners lodged in Tihar share space with other inmates in cells or barracks. But Rajan, Shahabuddin, and Delhi gangster Neeraj Bawana have been under solitary confinement in adjacent cells inside jail number 2.Sandeep Goel, the prison’s director-general, confirmed Rajan’s hospitalisation, but did not wish to offer more details.Rajan, one of India’s most wanted gangsters, was arrested in Indonesia’s Bali in 2015 after being on the run for two decades. He faced at least 68 cases including 28 related to extortion in Maharashtra alone and narrowly escaped an attempt on his life in Bangkok in September 2000.

Right from starters to meals to desserts and beverages, it can be used in imaginative ways. “Mango is a super versatile fruit! Mango can be used in various forms in the recipes. Apart from enhancing the taste of the preoperation, it’s also an excellent source of nutrients for the vegetarians and sustains its texture even after being cooked. Raw mango can be used as kanji, or a variety of delightful salads and once cooked with coconut milk, it’s loved by vegans. Once can experiment with both forms of mango, raw and ripe,” says chef Nishant Choubey who recently put together a menu featuring mango bruschetta, dehydrated mango powder, mango feuille and even the refreshing mango kombucha.For chefs, mango is an all time favourite ingredient to work with, owing to its delightful colour, juicy, pulpy texture and delicious taste. “Be it shake, a cake, a sauce, a dip, a smoothie, a curry – mangoes adds a dash of surprise into everything. With mangoes, the possibilities are endless. It can be used to make a healthy shake or a delicious cocktail like mango margarita or martini.

Flavourful kebabs can also be made with mango and can be paired with everything from vegetables to poultry to red meat and seafood. Food bloggers also have interesting mango preparations to share. Paresh Gupta, Delhi-based food blogger, says, “You can indulge in a chilled bowl of mango firni, while sangria lovers can go for mango sangria. ”Some popular regional mango preparations include raw mango and coconut curry with drumstick from Goa, raw mango launj from Jharkhand/Bihar, kairi Methi ki subzi from Rajasthan, mango rice from Karnataka, mango karhi from Gujrat and mamidikaya pappu (mango dal) from Andhra.Taste a mango first, test it for its texture, flavour and scent, and then let you creative juices flow as you innovate with the fruit in your kitchen “I love making salads with raw mango and even sweet ones. Adding herbs and spices, nuts and legume, one can turn a mango into a delicious and memorable preoperation. In my kitchen, sour mango becomes the sauce for grilled shrimp or lobster and chutney for scallops and crab. And my pyramid bhel is taken to grand heights by the addition of finely minced raw mango.

Not everyone gets the power to help save another’s life. Eligible plasma donors have the power of saving people’s life and they must use it.” These are the words of Delhi based actor and content creator Ankush Bahuguna who has been using his social media amid the second wave of Coronavirus, as a means to amplify plasma requests and connect plasma donors with recipients. Bahuguna, has made videos and reels on social media, requesting eligible plasma donors to step up and help. “If you can save lives, please do it. Kindness is an endless loop. Aap ko kisi ne life main kitni baar help kari hogi bina apna faida dekhe, ab aapki turn hai yeh kindness return karne ki by donating plasma,” he says.Project Plasma is a Fever Network initiative to celebrate the super power of Covid recovered plasma donors, who are stepping forward amid the second wave of Covid, to donate their plasma to save lives of other infected patients.Bahuguna takes care that the leads he posts are verified. Encouraging others to amplify requests regardless of how big or small their followers count is, he says, “I feel at this point every given human being can help. Agar aap plasma nahi donate kar sakte toh help in any other way you can. Volunteer with foundations who are finding plasma donors. Main bhi ghar baith ke phone ghuma kar logo ki help kar raha hun. You can tell people in your group that if they aren’t well and need help with oxygen cylinders, then they can tell you and you’ll call up and verify leads of cylinders or plasma and help them. Because the family of patients in hospital don’t have so much time to call and verify every lead.”Bahuguna’s solution to tackling the dearth of plasma donors is to take a proactive approach. He advises, “We all know someone or the other who has battled corona recently so why is it that we don’t have enough donors? Why don’t we call and encourage them to donate plasma? Open your contact lists, get in touch with your inner circle who has battled covid recently and convince them to step forward and donate. I’ve also called up people who I knew had covid and managed to convince a few to donate plasma.”Requesting eligible plasma donors to donate plasma, Bahuguna concludes, “Jab aapki family ko kuch chahiye hota hai toh you will also hope and wish that strangers show compassion. And that they come forward and help you out. So today, if you have the power to help someone else, please donate the plasma and help them.”You are a superhero if you have recovered from Covid 19 because you have the power to save a life!

27-04-2021||Patna||Patna residents helping Covid-19 patients and senior citizens||Many Patna residents are helping Covid patients and others affected by the pandemic by meeting their essential needs.Playback singer Panna Shrimali (40) has been providing free food to upto 500 Covid-19 patients and senior citizens daily in the state capital since mid-April, when the second wave of the disease led to a sharp rise in the number of infections, overwhelming the state’s health infrastructure.“I accept food requests on WhatsApp number 8677095968. I just ask for Covid-19 test report to verify the authenticity of seekers. After that, we provide them food for 14 days without any cost,” Jagdeo Path resident Shrimali said, and added that senior citizens living alone were not asked to show Covid-19 report.“We came across many instances where senior citizens were living alone as their children were settled in metro cities or aboard. They were solely dependent on domestic helpers, who have discontinued work due to Covid-19 resurgence. We provide medicines and dry ration to these elderly people,” he added.Inspired by his father LP Ray, Shrimali ran a free food service last year as well during the Covid-induced nationwide lockdown. He has a cook and two delivery boys in his team. “I deliver food packets to nearby localities. We use safety gears like masks, gloves and hair caps for health safety.”His initiative has helped city residents such as 60-year old Om Prakash Verma, a resident of Kadam Kuan, who was struggling after his domestic help left due to the surge in Covid-19 cases. “I survived on light and solid meals for five days. Meanwhile, I came to know about Shrimali ji through social media. By his courtesy, I am now getting two meals daily.”Similarly, two sisters Anupama Kumari and Neelima too were feeding 50 patients on a daily basis. Anupama, mother of a 4-month-old infant, started the service last week for Covid-19 patients in need.“My sister and I cook food at my home. As I have to take care of my baby, Neelima delivers food on her scooty. At times we get volunteers for distribution, but that is not often due to fear of infection, distant location and scorching heat,” said the 32-year-old Anupama.The real value of what Anupama and her sister are doing is understood by residents like Lata, who lives near the Boring Canal Road. “I tested Covid-19 positive last week. I got to know about two sisters providing free food service through a friend. ...I got to eat solid food after five days as I was unable to cook due to weakness. I am grateful to both sisters for helping me in tough time.”Anupama has decided not to spend money on birthdays or festival celebrations this year. I won’t even celebrate the first birthday of my new-born. I will use the money to serve needy people this year.”Another resident Vidyabhushan Sharma has started a steam parlour-- designed using stove and pressure cooker-- for the underprivileged near Bhattacharya Road. Sharma recovered from Covid-19 last year.“During my treatment, I realised the importance of steam inhalation for curbing the infection. The price of an electric steamer has increased to ₹1000, which is not affordable for daily wagers. Thus, I have set up a steam parlour to provide free service to them.”Sushma Devi, 66, a city resident said she was helped by strangers instead of relatives after she tested positive along with her husband. “My son lives in Bangalore. I have several relatives in the city but none of them responded after our positive report. Instead, strangers have come up as life savers for us.”However, no effort has yet been made by the district administration to bring together these individual efforts to pool in resources for greater efficiency and impact.The administration on its part has started telemedicine services for Covid-19 patients.“Those Covid-19 patients who are under home isolation can take medical advice on helpline number 0612-2508050 or 6287590552,” said Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandrashekhar Singh.Singh said a separate team was set up to monitor private hospitals following complaints of irregularities in treatment of Covid-19 patients were received.“We have also circulated Covid management handouts to reduce panic among residents. The booklet has details regarding drug uses, diet suggestion, correct method of measuring oxygen level and promoting exercises to increase oxygen level,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/patna-residents-helping-covid-19-patients-and-senior-citizens-101619505684324.html

Sheikhpura Superintendent of Police Kartikeya K Sharma tested positive and has self-isolated himself.Concerned over coronavirus surge and experts prediction that cases may further rise in the coming days, Bihar chief minister Nitish Kumar held a high-level review meeting on the Covid-19 situation during the day and issued an order to further ramp up the testing of samples and ensure timely delivery of reports so that treatment of the infected can start at the earliest. Kumar also instructed officials to take all steps to meet the requirement of medical oxygen for critically ill patients in the government as well as private Covid-19 designated hospitals.Out of total 4,15,397 positive cases since outbreak of the pandemic last year, Patna has the maximum caseload of 92,939. Among fresh fatalities, Patna saw death of 16 patients followed by 7 each in Darbhanga, Gaya and Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur (5) besides Nalanda and West Champaran (4 each).A total of 9,228 patients recovered from the infection since Sunday while 3,23,514 have been cured so far. Bihar has a Covid-19 recovery rate of 77.88%. A total of 80,461 samples were tested in the past 24 hours, while over 2.60 crore clinical examinations for the virus have been conducted in the state so far. On the vaccination front, 1,00,850 were administered jabs Monday while 67,46,734 have been inoculated so far in the state.The Covid-19 scenario in the wake of the second wave is painful in Bihar. In Patna, search for a bed in government as well as the Covid-designated private hospital is a big problem. Inordinate delay in delivery of RT-PCR some times by a week is also adding to the citizens woes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/covid19-cases-keep-rising-in-bihar-with-2-720-new-infections-patna-worsthit-101619502714972.html
27-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra phone-tapping row: IPS officer Rashmi Shukla summoned by cyber cops||Mumbai cyber police have summoned Rashmi Shukla, a senior Indian Police Service officer of Maharashtra cadre, in connection with the illegal phone tapping and confidential report leak matter.Shukla, who is presently on a central deputation and posted in Hyderabad, has been asked to appear before assistant commissioner of police (Cyber) Nitin Jadhav at 11am on Wednesday, April 28, to record her statement.On March 26, the cyber police station had registered a case on the complaint of the State Intelligence Department (SID) against unknown persons for leaking a report submitted by Shukla in August 2020, then commissioner of intelligence, over purported payments for transfers within the police department.The complaint stated that some unknown person had obtained the classified report and information from the department, following which the police registered a First Information Report under Section 30 (fraudulently retaining a message delivered by mistake) of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, Sections 44(b) (failure to furnish information in time) and 66 (computer related offence) of the Information Technology Act, 2008 and Section 5 (wrongful communication of information) of the Official Secrets Act, 1923.Home department officials said that the copy that was reportedly leaked was the SID’s office copy and did not bear Shukla’s signature on it.Earlier, state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte had submitted a report to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, detailing the circumstances in which Shukla created the report. His report said that Shukla intercepted calls of six persons in the name of “public safety” and thus “misguided the authorities”. It said that no transfers of police officials took place between June 27 and September 1, 2020, the period in which the calls were intercepted.Leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis has claimed that Shukla “sought proper permissions from then additional chief secretary (home) and intercepted phone calls of several police officials and politicians.”Also Read | Covid-19: What you need to know todayHe also said that he had a pen drive with 6.3GB of data from the intercepted calls, which contained the voices of police officers and politicians closely related to the home minister and home department.Kunte’s report, however, pointed out that no pen drive was attached to Shukla’s report. It further raised doubts on whether the IPS officer had leaked the report and if that was so, she would be liable for “strict action”.“The leak of the report had led to breach of privacy of the officers whose names have been mentioned in the report. It has also led to their defamation. The so-called deals for the transfers mentioned in the report and actual transfers done by the government differ. This proves that there was no question of any scam in the transfers,” Kunte’s report stated.Meanwhile, Shukla’s report named senior politicians, middlemen and police officers, who allegedly sought transfers and postings of their liking. While the report did not state that any direct transfer of money to these politicians took place, it did refer to “monetary exchange” between police officers and middlemen acting in close connection with politicians.Shukla did not respond to HT’s phone calls and text messages.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-phone-tapping-row-ips-officer-rashmi-shukla-summoned-by-cyber-cops-101619500583373.html

27-04-2021||Lucknow||Covid-19 unsung heroes: Ambulance staff keep the fight going despite threats||The second Covid-19 wave sweeping the country is testing the resilience of essential services providers like never before with the number of infections rising at an alarming rate and several patients requiring urgent hospitalisation. The enormous risks taken by drivers and technicians deployed on ambulances with advanced life support systems are often overlooked as the spotlight is often on doctors and nurses. They are among several unsung heroes making an enormous personal sacrifice to ensure India doesn’t give up in the fight against the pandemic.Meet Santosh Pandey, he drives an advanced life support system ambulance in Uttar Pradesh’s Bahraich district. Pandey says he has not met his wife and three children for the last one-and-a-half months since the resurgence of infections in the second Covid wave.“I don’t know whether I will be able to see my kids and parents again because if I get infected, no one will take my admission [in a hospital]. Even VVIP patients from Bahraich have to wait for admission for hours in the hospitals of Lucknow. I don’t know why patients are kept waiting inside the ambulance for hours,” says Pandey.His wife Archana Pandey (39) said Santosh was a hero for the entire family. “I have seen my husband only on WhatsApp video calls for the last one and a half months and my kids miss him. Santosh may be an ambulance driver for everyone but for my daughter Astha (12), he is a hero who is not even afraid of corona and helping others at a time when people are hiding themselves.”His 14-years old son Anshuman said he misses Santosh, especially during the dinner time. “He used to bring something special for us everyday. I feel like crying whenever I see him on video call.” Santosh’s 12-year-old daughter Astha “wants to become like papa”.Santosh claims to have transported more than 3,000 Covid patients from Bahraich to various hospitals in Barabanki and Lucknow, approximately over three and four hours drive, respectively.“Sometimes, my technician Krishna Kumar and I face hostile behaviour from the attendants of patients and the hospital authorities. A number of times, we have been kept waiting for hours outside hospitals. During this time, attendants lose their temper. But since we know they are under stress, we overlook their misbehaviour,” Pandey adds.Anand Rathore, a technician with a life support ambulance in Lucknow, says, “I have transported over 4,500 Covid-19 patients during the last one-and-a half months. We strive to keep patients motivated so that they can recover.”Anand says at least 12 of his fellow ambulance technicians have died due to Covid in the last one year and over 150 have been infected while transporting patients.“My family comprises my parents, brother and sister-in-law. But I stay back in my office with other colleagues. My brother occasionally visits me, but we meet from a distance as I touch Covid-19 patients daily. So, I don’t want to put my family at risk of Covid-19,” Anand adds, giving a glimpse of the challenges and stress in the daily lives of frontline workers.He is however, very realistic about it. “These are the professional hazards we have to face. We want the attendants to understand that if their patient is at risk, then we are also at risk. Misbehaving with us due to poor management by hospitals is not justified. We face abusive language and even physical threat a number of times for no fault of ours,” Rathore says.Indrajeet Singh, in charge Covid Command Centre ( Ambulances) Lucknow, said sacrifices made by men like Santosh and Anand often go unnoticed. “At a time when the son is not touching his father [due to fear of infection] our drivers and technicians first carry an infected patient in their lap or on a stretcher before they are put into an ambulance. They come into direct contact with Covid patients daily and are unsung heroes of our society; their sacrifices are not praised by anyone. They keep on working wearing personal protection equipment (PPE) kit for hours, despite that they are mistreated both by family members of patients and doctors or staff of hospitals,” Singh said summing up the situation.“Recently one of our ambulances was stopped by some people in old city, where some young men forced our staff to carry a different patient instead of the person who called for them. As a result, the patient who didn’t get the service died. The staff was manhandled, leaving a scar in their minds,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/covid19-unsung-heroes-ambulance-staff-keep-the-fight-going-despite-threats-101619492122702.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Oxygen, ambulance, medicines: Delhiites rally for Covid emergencies||As the Capital grapples with the new wave of Covid, various groups in the city are endeavouring to help Covid patients and their families with medical needs such as prescribed and over the counter medicines, oxygen and more while tackling a sea of SOS calls and messages! Free ambulance service for Covid patients“I once went to a cremation ground last year and was sad to see that there was no one to perform the last rites of those who died due to Covid. I then decided to start this service,” says Delhi-based businessman Charanjeev Malhotra, who started an NGO Sant Shiv Seva, and has been running a free ambulance service in the Capital, which has ferried hundreds of people. “We take Covid-19 patients to hospitals and have also informed cremation ground authorities that if no one claims the bodies then we will perform the last rites. We are not charging anything for our services. I’ve performed the last rites of more than 550 Covid positive individuals till now,” says Malhotra, who had also travelled to Haridwar for asthi visarjan of 317 people this March. Oxygen cylinders for free to those in needPeople in Delhi have been resorting to social media and making desperate calls around the city to find oxygen for Covid-19 patients. It was the struggle of ordinary citizens last year that inspired Mohammed Nauman, a businessman, to start providing oxygen cylinders for free to those in need. Nauman, a member of Delhi-based Asma Esa Foundation, says, “During the second wave, we have ramped up our services across Delhi-NCR, and have over a 100 oxygen cylinders in circulation. In the last month, on an average, we have been getting about 50 calls every hour, and it’s heartbreaking when we are unable to respond to everyone.” The foundation has a core team of eight members and around 60 volunteers around the city. “We have been speaking to various oxygen cylinder vendors to try and source oxygen and deliver it to the patients’ homes. This is a tough time and we are just trying to do our bit for the society,” adds Nauman.Youngsters to rescueAnkush Periwal barely gets any sleep these days because his phone keeps ringing with SOS calls from families of Covid patients, seeking information or help. Part of a team of youngsters who started #TaskForceCorona, he and his team have been providing medicines to those in need. “We provide assistance on the ground with food and medicines. We have a team of 60 dedicated volunteers who search for authentic information on hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen vendors and plasma donors for coronavirus patients,” he says, adding, “We are trying to provide relief to people so that they don’t have to call multiple people during their time of need. We have divided ourselves into various groups, each of which performs one task including arranging plasma, food, hospital beds, RT-PCR tests and ambulance services.”The group recently distributed essential medicines and face masks in the Capital with the help of Assistant Commissioner of Police (UT) Lakshya Pandey. “We are ordinary citizens trying to do our bare minimum. Only when we help each other, will we be able to fight this pandemic,” says Periwal.Author tweets @bhagat_mallikaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-ambulance-medicines-delhiites-rally-for-covid-emergencies-101619491531753.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Free vaccines in Delhi for all adults, says govt||Delhi on Monday announced that it will vaccinate its entire adult population for free once the immunisation drive is widened from May 1, pledging to speed up the process of administering jabs as the Capital’s health care infrastructure remains overrun by a caseload that has been mounting amid an unprecedented fourth wave of infections.In a digital news briefing, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said a purchase of 13.4 million doses has been approved and that his government will make efforts to speed up the process. “We are working on a plan to start large-scale vaccination as soon as possible,” he said. He also urged vaccine manufacturers in the country to reduce their prices and asked the Centre to consider a “one nation, one rate” policy for Covid-19 vaccines.“As we are seeing, Covid-19 has wreaked havoc in the country. There is only one solution to this pandemic and that is vaccination. Delhi government has decided to give free Covid-19 vaccines to those who are 18 and above,” Kejriwal said. The free vaccines will be meant only for the residents of Delhi, even as the detailed plan of the drive was yet to be finalised by the government, according to people aware of the matter.About 20other states have already announced free vaccines for their adult population.The central government has announced that it will expand the Covid-19 vaccination drive to everyone over the age of 18 from May 1, a move many said was prompted by the worsening second wave of infections in the country. Registrations for vaccination in the next phase will open on the CoWIN app from Wednesday. While opening up the drive, the government allowed state governments to directly purchase shots, and let manufacturers earmark 50% jabs for states and private hospitals. It said it will continue to provide vaccines for the immunisation of people over the age of 45 for free.Data shows that countries such as the US and the UK, which were overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases at the beginning of 2021, are now defying alarming trends as vaccination efforts are ramped up. Israel, which has administered the most vaccine doses per 100 people, recently recorded no new daily Covid-19 deaths for the first time in 10 months.On Monday, Delhi reported 20,201 new infections, the lowest in 10 days, but only because daily testing dropped to a 27-day low of 57,690. The city’s positivity rate remained high with over 35% of samples returning positive for Covid-19. Only one state, Rajasthan (37%), had a higher positivity rate on Monday.Delhi on Sunday extended by a week its lockdown, a “last resort” measure put in place to arrest the alarming spread of Covid-19 in the Capital, as the health care infrastructure remained overwhelmed by a massive surge in infections, with complaints of shortages of medical oxygen and hospital beds pouring in from across the city.The chief minister’s office said the free vaccines will be available in all government-run Covid-19 vaccination centres in Delhi while those who opt for private centres will have to pay for the jabs.“Today (Monday) morning, we have given approval to buy 13.4 million vaccines for Delhi. We are trying to procure these doses as soon as possible so people are vaccinated quickly. It has been found that those who have taken the jabs either do not get Covid-19 or have very mild symptoms upon contracting the infection. Mostly, those who get Covid-19 even after vaccination do not require hospitalisation, and even if some of them do get admitted, their condition does not become serious. If everyone gets vaccinated, Corona will be like an ordinary disease,” Kejriwal said. He gave the example of how the UK controlled its surge in Covid-19 cases by conducting mass vaccinations.The Delhi chief minister again flagged his demand for uniform rates for the central and state governments in vaccine procurement. “One of the vaccine manufacturers is offering a rate of ₹400 a dose to state governments, while the other is quoting ₹600. But both the companies are offering their vaccines at ₹150 to the central government. My demand is that the rates should be the same for state and central governments,” he said.He said the manufacturers are earning a lot of profit by selling their vaccines at ₹400 and ₹600 to the states. “This is the time to show humanity. This is not the time to earn profits. Across the country, the Centre and states have capped the prices of various medicines and treatments. I appeal to the vaccine manufacturers to reduce their prices to ₹150. You (manufacturers) have a lifetime to earn profits. This is not the time to earn profits from people when the pandemic has hit the country so hard. I also appeal to the central government to cap the prices of vaccines in the coming days,” he said.He also urged the Centre to consider a vaccination plan for children.“We have seen that a lot of children and adolescents are also getting infected by Covid-19, and some of them have died. So, the time has come to think of them as well. If the available vaccines are safe for them, the Centre should allow it for them. If they are not safe, then other vaccines should also be developed,” Kejriwal said.Reports suggest that while the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine may be approved for children aged between 12 and 15 by next month, younger children appear to remain months away from being eligible for any of the shots against Covid-19.The chief minister also said beds were being increased further in Delhi to treat Covid-19 patients. “I inspected the Covid care centre at Radha Saomi Satsang Baes campus in Chhattarpur which has been opened for patients today from 10 am. Today, it has started with 150 beds, which will be increased to 500 in about two days, then 2,000 and finally it will be ramped up to 5,000 beds. There itself, we are also arranging 200 ICU beds as well. We are increasing Covid-19 beds across Delhi in this way,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/free-vaccines-in-delhi-for-all-adults-says-govt-101619488330737.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Police step in to hold funerals of people who lived alone||When an army Lieutenant Colonel, posted in Leh, called up Delhi Police seeking help with the cremation of his father-in-law, who lived in Dwarka and died on Saturday due to Covid-related complications, a team of policemen came forward to perform the last rites of the elderly man. The police team, in PPE kits, collected the body and took it to the cremation ground, where last rites were performed as per Hindu rituals.Police have made the arrangements of several others who lived alone, or whose families stayed away for fear of the virus. In some cases, families that have contracted Covid-19 are unable to make funeral arrangements for the deceased in their homes; leaving the police to shoulder the responsibility of arranging funerals.In two cases reported on Saturday, police cremated a woman on her brother’s request in Dwarka; and in Karol Bagh, made arrangements for the cremation of an elderly couple who had died of Covid-19.Deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said they had received a call on Saturday, at around 3pm, from Lieutenant Colonel Soumen Mondal that his father-in-law, who lived in Dwarka, died of Covid-19.“Mondal expressed his inability to come to Delhi at such short notice. On his request, the personnel from the Dwarka North police station made arrangements for the cremation of Mondal’s father-in-law Biswanath Pramanik,” Meena said.The DCP said the same evening, a team from Dwarka South police station cremated a woman on her brother’s request. “We received another call that day about a woman, Jai Matnani, dying of Covid. The caller was her brother. He said there was nobody to take the responsibility of her cremation. On humanitarian grounds, we took over that responsibility and her body was immediately shifted to a cremation ground in Dwarka’s Sector 24, where she was cremated as per the Hindu rituals,” the DCP said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-step-in-to-hold-funerals-of-people-who-lived-alone-101619485567310.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi all out of ICU beds, just 11 left for pregnant women||With Delhi continuing to report over 20,000 fresh cases of coronavirus disease every day since the past 10 days (from April 17), the city has run out of dedicated intensive care unit (ICU) beds for Covid-19 patients.The Capital has a total of 20,461 beds earmarked for treating Covid-19 patients, and of these, 4,705 are ICU beds.The government’s Delhi Corona app showed on Monday night that 12 ICU beds were still available in the city. However, 11 of them are in Madhukar Rainbow hospital in Malviya Nagar that caters to only pregnant women with Covid-19.The one other ICU bed was at the Trauma Centre at the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), which was converted to a dedicated Covid-19 hospital last year. According to the doctors at the hospital, however, the bed was unavailable since several patients were in the queue for admission. A resident doctor from the hospital said on condition of anonymity: “Many Covid-19 patients on ventilator support are already waiting in the emergency to get admitted.”The phone number provided on the Delhi government app remained busy, and could not be reached, despite several attempts by HT.The two cellphone numbers provided by Madhukar Rainbow hospital were switched off on Monday night. However, according to calls made previously made by HT, the hospital only admits women in advanced pregnancy who have been diagnosed with Covid-19.The number to the two hospitals that showed the availability of ICU beds in the entire city remained unreachable despite chief minister Arvind Kejriwal asking hospitals earlier this month to ensure that no call went unanswered.“The situation is terrible. We receive so many patients who are brought dead to the emergency department of the hospital. This is because they go from hospital to hospital in search of beds. Every hospital is full,” said a doctor at a private hospital in the city, asking not to be named.The situation has worsened as two of the three big Delhi government hospitals treating Covid-19 patients reduced the number of beds in view of the persisting oxygen shortage.Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, which is the biggest hospital in the trans-Yamuna region, reduced the number of Covid-19 beds from over 900 to 700 on Saturday. According to senior officials, the hospital’s oxygen plant was running beyond capacity due to the high load of Covid-19 patients.“When a hospital is planned, it is thought that 20% to 30% beds will need oxygen supply. But, since we take in only the very sick Covid-19 patients, 100% of our beds require oxygen now. And, 50% to 60% of the beds need high-flow oxygen. This is putting too much pressure on our plant. So, we decided to reduce beds,” the official said.Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality hospital in Tahirpur on Friday reduced the number of beds from 500 to 350. The hospital was allocated a quota of 6,000 cubic metres of oxygen. With almost all its beds occupied by critical patients in need of ICU or oxygen therapy, the hospital was using up between 8,000 and 9,000 cubic metres, hospital officials said.While Delhi government spokespeople were not available for comment on the ICU bed situation, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain, last week acknowledged that the city was running out of ICU beds.“Yes, there is a shortage of ICU beds. We have requested the Centre to increase the number of beds in their hospitals to 7,000. Currently, there are 2,000 beds in Central government hospitals. The Centre will increase 700 to 800 ICU beds soon,” Jain said at the time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-all-out-of-icu-beds-just-11-left-for-pregnant-women-101619485137439.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Chhatarpur Covid-19 facility reopens to desperate appeals||Several Covid-19 patients and their relatives were seen outside the Covid care facility in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur — which was reopened on Monday with 150 oxygen beds — seeking on-site admissions and complaining that government helplines were not responding to their distress calls.The ongoing Covid-19 surge in the city has left hospitals overburdened, and people have been frantically searching for beds with oxygen support. The Chhatarpur centre, which, according to a government order, will admit Covid-19 patients on being referred by a district surveillance officer (DSO), witnessed some heated arguments on Monday when police deployed there denied access to the patients seeking on-site admissions.The facility was launched on Monday morning. In a video press briefing, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said: “I reviewed arrangements in the Radha Soami Satsang Beas Covid facility today. The centre is functional since 10 am. Now it has 150 oxygen beds. In the next two days, it will be increased to 500 oxygen beds. In another four days after that, it will have 2,000 beds and, eventually, 5,000 beds. The centre will soon have 200 ICU beds as well.”The oxygen beds, doctors, medical staff and paramedics are arranged by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), and the Delhi government is entrusted with bearing the cost of boarding and lodging of health care staff, and managing admissions.Within hours of the centre reopening , more than 70 people gathered outside it and stood near the police barricades through which only ambulances were allowed in. Some people had come with their test reports and other medical documents.A senior revenue department official said that for admission to the centre, people who test positive for Covid-19 can call on helpline numbers, and each request will be forwarded to the DSOs for reference.Some patients and their relatives who were denied entry were seen having heated arguments with police.“The oxygen level has dropped to 87. The patient needs a bed. We are here since morning and dialling helplines for more than two hours now. The attempts have been futile. We need help,” said Anoop Kumar Yadav, who along with is brother-in-law Pradeep Yadav, a Covid-19 patient, was present outside the centre.Dipankar Tarafdar, a Covid-19 patient who was at the centre with his 84-year-old father, also a Covid-19 patient with severe symptoms, said: “We waited there for two hours and then realised there was no point. My father’s oxygen level dropped to 60. We had to start looking out for an ICU bed now. We kept calling all the helpline numbers, pleading before the staff at the centre, nothing worked.”A senior Delhi Police officer, who did not wish to be identified, said: “Initially there was some confusion and chaos as patients needed approval from the concerned agency for getting access to the facility. The issue was later resolved. There is adequate police deployment at the centre and things are under control.”Spokespersons of the Delhi government and the Union home ministry did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/chhatarpur-covid-19-facility-reopens-to-desperate-appeals-101619484205115.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Some hospitals say O2 supply improved, others say not quite||After five days of constant alarm and severe oxygen shortages, some hospitals across the city treating Covid-19 patients said channels for the distribution of medical oxygen seemed to have been streamlined, with medical facilities on Monday reporting that supplies reached them on time.“The regularity of supply has improved over the last two days. Earlier we were raising at least two distress calls a day. Now, we had to make only one in the last 48 hours,” said a doctor from Indraprastha Apollo hospital.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, which raised four SOS calls for oxygen on Saturday, said the situation improved on Monday.Hospital chairman Dr DS Rana said, “It appears the supply chains have been streamlined. It was better today and we hope that from tomorrow [Tuesday], systems will improve further.”However, some hospitals said the situation continued to be bad, even though the calls for help were not made publicly.Jaipur Golden hospital, where 20 people died due to oxygen shortage on Friday, tweeted again at noon on Monday: “We are trying to get in touch with INOX since morning to ensure our daily oxygen supply reaches on time. Have not got any response or dispatch note yet. Alerting everyone now in the hope of preventing another sos situation today.”“The hospitals are still in distress. I have seen calls for help from many hospitals on group messages. Yesterday night, a small nursing home nearby rushed to borrow cylinders from us because their supply did not arrive on time. Another bigger hospital had to trade oxygen with us. We gave them some oxygen, and they later gave us some of theirs when their tanker came,” said Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director of Saroj hospital and secretary of the Delhi Voluntary Hospital’s Forum – a group of major private hospitals in the Capital.He, however, added, “The situation is likely to improve from tomorrow [Tuesday]; the Delhi government now has control over the oxygen supply after the court hearings and the deputy chief minister himself is handling the supply of the allocated quota to the hospitals.”Deputy CM Manish Sisodia on Monday evening held a meeting with senior government officials, representatives of private hospitals and oxygen suppliers.The 490MT quota of oxygen allocated to the Capital by the Centre has been divided proportionately among all 150 hospitals in the city treating Covid-19 patients. At their current capacity, the Covid-19 hospitals alone need at least 454MT of oxygen, according to a Delhi government order issued on Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/some-hospitals-say-o2-supply-improved-others-say-not-quite-101619483727940.html

This, however, was largely owing to fewer tests being conducted on Sunday, as reported a day later in Monday’s health bulletin, as labs and health facilities continued to contend with the sheer volume of cases in the city.There were 57,690 tests conducted on Monday as compared to an average of 79,123 tests conducted daily for the last seven days. Monday’s testing numbers were the lowest in the national capital since March 30, when the city tested 36,757 samples.With fewer tests, the positivity rate – proportion of samples that return positive among the total tested – also increased to 35.02% on Monday, meaning more than one in three persons who got tested were positive for the infection.The city also reported its highest toll ever on Monday, with 380 deaths.Delhi has reported over 300 Covid-19 fatalities a day for five days in a row. With a high number of cases, however, the case fatality ratio (CFR) – proportion of deaths among those who test positive – remains low at 1.4%.“All the statistical models indicate that with the current trajectory, the number of cases will likely peak in mid-May. And, the deaths two weeks after that. The descending limb will be long and it will be some time before we reach the January-February levels,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research.He said, “Last year, the curve of the infection was bell-shaped. This year, however, it is almost vertical. And, when there is a steep rise in cases the decline is slower.” With entire families testing positive for the infection in one go, he suggested that cluster sampling be carried out to see whether it is one strain in circulation.The proportion of the U.K. variant (B.1.1.7) in genome samples sequenced from Covid-19 cases in Delhi has risen from 28% in the second week of March to the 50% in the last week, Dr. Sujeet Singh, Director, National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said in a webinar on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-positivity-rate-rockets-past-35-as-tests-fall-to-28-day-low-in-delhi-101619483421119.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||‘Centre, state responsible for O2 supply’: Delhi High Court||Taking note of black-marketing of medical oxygen in view of the surge in demand in the city, the Delhi high court on Monday summoned firms engaged in refilling of oxygen cylinders in the Capital and warned of strict action against those selling it at inflated prices.The court directed the Delhi government to hold a meeting with suppliers and hospitals to chalk out a distribution plan and observed that ensuring regular supply of oxygen to Delhi hospitals was the responsibility of both the Delhi government and the Centre.The bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli also warned states that were allegedly obstructing the supplies to other states.Terming black-marketing of medical oxygen a “major issue in Delhi”, the bench said it will take strict action against the black marketers. The court also mentioned an incident in which a senior advocate informed them that people were demanding ₹1 lakh per cylinder.The court directed the Delhi government to take immediate action. “Oxygen cylinder distribution is your (Delhi government) baby. You have powers, exercise them. If someone is engaging in black marketing, take action. They need to be taken to task. Bring them before us and we will take action,” the court said.“We direct all the refillers of oxygen cylinders in Delhi to be present in the hearing on Tuesday following complaints of non-availability of gas cylinders and black marketing,” it added.The court directed that those engaged in refilling oxygen cylinders must provide details to the government of deliveries made to hospitals and others, failing which strict action will be taken.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, representing the Delhi government, said before taking any action it will need the information from the refillers with regard to the deliveries made by them, but if it sends a show-cause notice seeking such details, it is viewed as harsh.The court then asked Delhi chief secretary Vijay Dev, who was present at the hearing, hold a meeting with suppliers and various hospitals in the city to work out a distribution plan.The court’s direction came after Siddharth Jain, director of INOX, which is a major supplier of medical oxygen to Delhi, informed the court about the difficulties faced by suppliers. He said his factories were working round the clock even when a lot of staff members were down with Covid-19.During the proceedings, the court said it was the responsibility of both the Centre and Delhi governments to ensure that the oxygen is supplied to hospitals in Delhi. “Twenty-one people have died. Human lives have been lost…..You have to work out your allocation. You cannot ask one producer to become a transporter,” the judge said.To this, Solicitor General (SG) Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, said, “It’s not because of me (the Centre) for God’s sake. Please have your (Delhi government) system in place. Please have competent officers.”But the court said it was the responsibility of both the governments.“Same can be said about you (Centre). Same can be said about your (Centre) allocations,” the high court bench said. The court said more than the lack of supply, it was the distribution issues that were causing fatalities.“It’s the job of both the governments. You are giving those places which do not have the tankers. The place which has a tanker, you are diverting it elsewhere. .. What prima facie appears to us is that you are making these allegations… Once you make allocations they should be workable...” it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/centre-state-responsible-for-o2-supply-delhi-high-court-101619482951824.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt may not wait for fresh stock of shots to open up vaccine drive||The Delhi government may not wait for stocks to arrive from vaccine manufacturers to kick-start the third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive from May 1 in the Capital, and will start inoculating those aged 18 and above with the existing stock, senior officials said on Monday.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced that the Delhi government will inoculate all adult residents of the Capital against Covid-19 for free, even as he said that the government on Monday also approved the procurement of 13.4 million vaccine doses from manufacturers.He did not specify which manufacturers will supply these doses to the Capital.Two Covid-19 vaccines are currently in use across the country — Covishield, manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) and Covaxin, made by Bharat Biotech, while a third — Russia’s Sputnik V jab — has been authorised for use. While SII has said it will sell its jab to state governments at ₹400 a dose, while Bharat Biotech announced it will supply the shot to states for ₹600 a dose.A senior state health official said formal orders are being placed with the manufacturers and that the vaccines may take at least two weeks to arrive.“At present, we have enough stocks for at least 10 days. Vaccinations have also taken a hit over the past two weeks because of the spike in Covid-19 cases in Delhi and the lockdown. Around 50,000 people are now getting vaccinated every day as against 100,000 vaccinations on April 11,” said the official.After Kejriwal’s announcement, HT was able to contact eight of the 11 district administrations, who said that there were no specific instructions till Monday evening from the health department on the plan for the expanded vaccination drive.“We have been told that the state health department is going to issue a standard operating procedure for all districts to follow in a day or two. Accordingly, our teams will be activated. There are a few days to go [for the programme to open up] and we are confident of ramping up centres and adding staff. Today, immunisation officers trained some of our additional staff,” said a health official in Central district.Another official in Southwest district said centres will also be opened at government and private offices. It is not clear if they will be allowed at schools and community centres.“On Sunday, the Union health ministry issued fresh guidelines allowing diversification of Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) if they have certain prerequisites mentioned in the guidelines. Increasing the number of centres will not be a problem. We have already identified places and we will have enough medical teams as well,” said the official.At present, Delhi has around 500 vaccination centres spread across 192 hospitals and dispensaries.According to the health ministry’s latest guidelines, even if new centres are opened, it will continue to be mandatory for all government and private vaccination centres to register on the CoWIN portal, regardless of the source of the vaccine doses.“It shall also be mandatory for all CVCs to record all vaccination, issue digital vaccination certificates and report all AEFIs on the CoWIN system,” it said.The eligibility conditions for any health facility for registration as a vaccination centre is unchanged. This means the facility must have sufficient cold chain capacity, enough room for waiting areas and post-vaccination observation rooms, vaccinators, and the ability to manage adverse effects.A government spokesperson said that not all the fresh vaccine doses that arrive will be used to inoculate first-time beneficiaries.“It’s going to be almost a month since vaccination was opened for those aged 45 and above. Before that, senior citizens were vaccinated. So, naturally we are vaccinating even those who are coming for their second dose. Across Delhi, there’s no segregation of vials on the basis of first and second dose. If a person has taken a first dose and the next registered person who walks up to the centre has their second dose scheduled, they will be given the shot from the same vial. So, there is going to be no shortage of vaccines in Delhi, since proper records are maintained, which will help us raise fresh orders from time to time,” said the spokesperson.Till Monday, Delhi has administered 2,992,824 doses of the vaccines, of which 2,414,924 have got the first dose and 577,900 have got both doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-may-not-wait-for-fresh-stock-of-shots-to-open-up-vaccine-drive-101619480798025.html

27-04-2021||Bangalore||Blood banks across Bengaluru struggle to find donors for plasma||Swamy Vivekananda voluntary blood bank near the corporation circle in Bengaluru was crowded on Friday, with desperate family members of Covid-19 patients pleading with strangers to donate plasma after the donors they brought with them could not clear the requisite tests. Two days later, on Monday, the blood bank wore a deserted look after it stopped taking more plasma request.“We have run out of the apheresis kits. Until we get a fresh lot, we won’t be able to restart. We have spoken to companies, but they don’t have any stocks. We can’t say for sure when the supplies will reach us,” said a staff member of the blood bank.Plasma therapy, broadly known as ‘convalescent plasma therapy’, is a procedure to treat Covid-19 patients with the plasma of a person who has recovered from the infection.Several blood banks across the city said they were getting at least 10-15 calls per day for plasma. However, they were facing difficulties in finding donors, which has escalated problems for both blood banks and relatives of Covid patients.At Jeevaraksha blood bank, four plasma apheresis procedures were done on Monday. “There is a high demand for A+ group and most of the people are struggling to find donors. In our system, if anyone takes plasma, they also have to make plasma donation. We see people making frantic calls to get donors every day,” said Abdul Rahaman Shariff, a staff of the blood bank.Shariff said in seven cases, they were able to provide plasma without a donor because some volunteers had made plasma donation at the blood bank, which has now run out of stock.Stating that the blood bank performed at least 26 plasma apheresis last month, Shariff pointed out that the demand for plasma has gone up in the recent times as compared to the first wave of the pandemic. “We have enough kits to last for at least a month. But we also hear that there isn’t enough stock of the kits in the market, as such high demand was not expected,” Shariff said.At Sankalp India Foundation, a Bengaluru-based non-government organisation working for blood donation, volunteers said they were not able to find many donors, adding that they would call any number from which they receive a missed call, in hope that it was a donor. “We are not getting donors and there is a huge demand,” said Akansha, a volunteer at the foundation.At Bengaluru’s Victoria Hospital, its blood bank could only provide plasma to three patients this month since there were no donors, a staff member from the hospital said.With the Karnataka government imposing a 14-day lockdown, hopes of getting more people to donate plasma were also fading away. “There have been advertisements from the government and other campaigns asking those who have recovered from Covid-19 to come forward to donate plasma, but the response has been poor. With the lockdown in place, no one will come out now. The government should allow people to donate and make arrangements for the same during the lockdown,” said a staff member at the Victoria Hospital blood bank.Even though a study by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) across 39 hospitals in September last year had found that Convalescent plasma therapy failed to benefit Covid-19 patients, many doctors in the city swear by the treatment protocol.Recently, cricket icon Sachin Tendulkar, who recovered from Covid-19 after being hospitalised last month, has offered to donate plasma and urged others who have recovered from the infection to follow suit.The latest guidelines, released by the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) New Delhi, ICMR-Covid-19 national task force, and the joint monitoring group under the Union health ministry, said that plasma can be administered in early moderate disease within seven days of the onset of Covid-19 symptoms.As the city finds it difficult to manage the demand for plasma, healthcare professionals are requesting people to come forward to donate. “There is no need to be concerned about safety. We understand the value of every donor and ensure that the procedure is done keeping safety as a priority. But we want more people to come forward and donate,” said Shariff.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/blood-banks-across-bengaluru-struggle-to-find-donors-for-plasma-101619474712250.html
27-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra mulls free vaccine shots only for poor||With four days to go for the vaccination of all adults to kick off, Maharashtra is unlikely to roll the drive out for those in the 18-44 age category in a big way from May 1, owing to challenges related to supply and lack of clarity on whether it would provide free vaccines to all. A day after Maharashtra ministers announced that the government will provide free vaccines to beneficiaries over age 18, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that it may not be possible, adding that the department will move a proposal to provide free vaccine jabs to the poor only.Maharashtra has around 53-55 million people in the 18-44 category and the cost to inoculate them is expected to be around ₹7,000 crore, according to Tope. With vaccines available in short supply, Maharashtra could kick off the drive in a staggered manner, senior government officials said. A panel of senior officials, headed by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, is working on negotiations with manufacturers, ensuring adequate and uninterrupted supply and also deciding the beneficiaries for free vaccines.Meanwhile, Tope said his department is moving a proposal for the state cabinet meeting, that is expected to be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, seeking free vaccines for the poor in the 18-44 category.Tope admitted that there are two views within ministers seeking free vaccination for all. “We have proposed that the economically backward class or the weaker sections of the society should be given free vaccinations at government hospitals. There are two views on this; some are of the opinion that 100% [of vaccines] should be given free of cost, but I do not think it is possible. The vaccination programme for 18-44 ages will require about ₹7,000 crore to ₹7,500 crore. It is not a small amount,” Tope said.Senior ministers are also saying that there is no agitation from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over providing free vaccine shots for all. However, a final decision will be made by Wednesday and announcement is likely before the drive kicks off. On Sunday, minority affairs minister Nawab Malik announced that state will provide free vaccines. Another NCP minister Jitendra Awhad also tweeted the same. Shiv Sena minister Aaditya Thackeray, too, announced free vaccines, but later deleted the tweet. Since then, the party has tread cautiously on the topic. Sena leader and chief spokesperson of the party Sanjay Raut refused to comment on free vaccines, stating that it is the government’s decision.A senior bureaucrat said that the committee under Kunte is also looking at how to manage the funds by diverting it through other schemes. He also added that the start to the vaccination for all adults later this week is expected to remain “symbolic”. “We are still to negotiate with any of the foreign manufacturers only then we will know the cost of the inoculation. The chief minister and finance minister have both said that cost is not a hindrance as vaccination is a priority. Besides the cost, they should be able to provide adequate stock without any delay… The vaccination of 18-44 will start from May 1, but it will remain symbolic due to short supply,” the bureaucrat said requesting anonymity. They state is also preparing to handle the crowds at the centres, for it to not result in chaos or a super-spreader event, considering cases are still high across the state.Speaking about the state’s preparations for May 1, Tope said no manufacturer has committed to delivering stock so far. He said the state will procure stock of Indian companies as well as negotiate cost with foreign brands to bring it around the rates of Indian vaccines, he said. “There could be a law-and-order issue and huge queues at every centre. People want to get vaccinated now looking at the deaths, but the availability of vaccine is a real challenge. None of them [manufacturers] have vaccines now. They are offering stock after a month; that too 10 million every month, but it is very slow,” Tope said.He further added, “We will procure the vaccines available in India, similarly, we will negotiate with the foreign manufacturers, will try and bring it down Indian vaccine prices. We will need foreign vaccines as well to inoculate people faster.”The health department is also planning to procure vaccines to inoculated people the remaining citizens over age 45. Tope said the Centre is not “supporting” the pace of the inoculation state intends to. As of April 25, the state has administered first dose to over 10 million people under the category, while 923,971 people from the category have taken their second jab.Tope said, “A high number of people still remain to be vaccinated in above 45-category. The Government of India is not really supporting to the extent it should have. Our demand [for vaccine] is 800,000 daily, but they are providing 100,000 or 200,000. Many centres are kept closed or we have to function on alternative days. These are vulnerable groups; we have to ensure that they get vaccinated first and faster.“Though, this is a national programme and that Mr [prime minister Narendra] Modi has assured adequate supply for this category, but the rate is very slow. We are proposing to spend to procure vaccines for this category as well. It will expedite the programme so that they are safe. The Cabinet will consider this proposal.”Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already announced free vaccination for all, but there is one-upmanship going on among MVA ministers. “PM has made it clear that Centre will vaccinate all eligible people free of cost. However, the states that want to carry out vaccination in an accelerated manner, they can procure vaccines from the market. There is one-upmanship going on in three ruling parties and therefore, there are such demands [of free vaccines], there are tweets on it and later being deleted. The government should prepare a proper policy as the drive will start from May 1. There is no coordination between the ministers,” Fadnavis said.Maharashtra achieved a landmark by inoculating over 500,000 beneficiaries in a day on Monday. The state is expected to go past 15-million mark soon, the state health department said. the state has vaccinated 14,342,716 beneficiaries. Maharashtra’s previous high was recorded on April 3 when it vaccinated 462,735 people in a day.An epidemiologist who is attached to PD Hinduja Hospital, Dr Lancelot Pinto, said that the Centre and State governments have to work on collaboration to achieve the feat of flattening the curve and achieve herd immunity.“India’s median age is 27, so we cannot achieve herd immunity by only focusing on the 45+ age group. We need to aggressively immunise the young population. Therefore, the governments definitely need to work closely,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-mulls-free-vaccine-shots-only-for-poor-101619474319182.html

They are front-line workers and the BJP is insulting them and putting their lives at risk. The AAP demands that the BJP-ruled MCDs immediately provide safety gear to sanitation workers,” said the AAP’s in-charge of municipal affairs Durgesh Pathak.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “ His (Pathak’s) statement on non-availability of safety gear for sanitation workers is baseless. This is a tactic for diverting attention from the collapse of the health-care system in Delhi and failure of the AAP government in Covid-19 management. Sanitation Inspector offices in all 278 wards of the three MCDs are well stocked with masks, gloves and soaps, among others. They are routinely distributed among sanitation workers and mosquito-breeding checkers.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/mcds-not-providing-safety-gear-to-sanitation-workers-alleges-aap-not-true-says-bjp-101619470372616.html

The separatist conglomerate, in a statement, said prisoners’ families had alleged lack of basic amenities within jails, which had led to serious health problems among prisoners. The statement, which quoted the family of Shahid-ul-Islam, who is currently who lodged in Tihar jail, said he was very ill and exhibiting all symptoms of Covid, including high fever. “But the authorities are neither getting him tested nor taking him to the hospital,” it said.The Hurriyat said that it was extremely worrisome that political prisoners are being treated like this. “Silence of one and all, including human rights organisations, on this issue has led the authorities to show this indifference and inhumanity towards prisoners,” the separatist conglomerate said.“Such is the apathy that Mohd Ayaz Akbar who is in Tihar jail, was not released even for a day on parole despite repeated appeals to see his wife suffering from cancer for the past three years till she breathed her last recently,” it said.The Hurriyat said that the separatist leaders lodged in Tihar jail, Kot Bhalwal jail, Jodhpur jail, Agra jail, Amphala jail, Haryana jail, and other prisons across India were facing grave risk to their lives. The Hurriyat appealed to human rights organisations and civil society members to begin to focus upon the plight of these prisoners in jails and ensure their release before it is too late.They also expressed resentment over the ‘continued arbitrary house detention’ of its chairperson Mirwaiz Umar Farooq even in the holy month of Ramadan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/kashmiri-political-prisoners-at-risk-amid-covid-surgehurriyat-101619471420308.html

The state has also banned the use of liquid oxygen for non-medical purposes.The state has eight oxygen plants, spread across Mandi, Shimla, Sirmaur and Una, with a total production capacity of 3, 800 cylinders that include both D-type jumbo-sized cylinders and B-type medium-sized cylinders. The state government officials are set to hold a meeting with the manufactures in Baddi soon. There are currently three oxygen plants in Baddi, which include Inox, Himalaya and Indo gases. “We have asked all oxygen plants to ramp up production. Right now, there is no shortage of oxygen,” said state drug controller Navneet Marwah.Health minister Rajiv Saizal also reiterated that currently, the state has enough supply of oxygen but added, “Efforts are on to arrange more. The state’s oxygen production is 42.7 metric tonne while the present consumption is 22.13 metric tonne.”The government has also set up an oxygen plant at Deen Dayal Upadhadya Hospital, Shimla, but the plant is currently not operational. The plant has a capacity to produce 432 cubic meters of oxygen. “The plant is on trial run. Oxygen manufactured in the hospital has been sent for testing and we will soon get certification,” said DDU medical superintendent Ravinder Mokta. The hospital, which has a bed capacity of 90, is also stretched beyond limit as it is currently accommodating more than 120 patients. Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College (RPMC) in Tanda is also full to capacity but its oxygen plant is also not yet operational. Chief medical officer Gurdarshan Gupta said the formalities for making the plant functional have been completed. The government had proposed to set up the biggest oxygen plant in Tanda but it is not yet operational. Another plant, with a daily production capacity of 576 cumm, was also proposed to be installed at Jawaharlal Nehru Government Medical College, Chamba, but this too is not functional yet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hp-asks-all-oxygen-plants-in-state-to-ramp-up-production-101619471240101.html

Moga deputy commissioner Harish Nayer on Monday assigned the duty of surveillance of patients isolated at homes in villages and wards. As per the order, the administration has formed a cluster of 10 villages under the supervision of a principal and deployed a teacher per village for surveillance of home isolated patients. As of now, there are 900 patients in home isolation in the district.The teachers and officials of education departments have, meanwhile, objected to the move, saying that they already are performing multiple duties that include enrolment drive, distribution of books and office work.Rakesh Makkar, deputy DEO, secondary education, said, “The education secretary, Karishan Kumar, had also issued orders to all deputy commissioners to refrain from assigning non-educational tasks to teachers. The enrolment drive is also going on and now, they have to supervise all home-isolated patients. The teachers are complaining to us.”A science teacher, said, “We have to remain present at schools from 8am to 2pm. How will we keep eyes on patients at their homes during this time? Apart from this, we are distributing books to students or their parents at schools and also visiting every house to enhance students’ admissions.”Vikrem Dev Singh, state president of Democratic Teachers’ Front, said, “The administration should avoid assigning non-educational tasks to teachers. It affects the quality of education at government schools. Besides, it will hamper ongoing drive of student enrolment.”However, DC Nayer said, “The administration is receiving information about violations by patients at home. We have taken serious note of this and formed teams of teachers. They will regularly keep vigil on these patients and inform the police whenever they find any violation.”He added, “The situation is getting worse. Therefore, it is the duty of all of us to contribute to win this war against Covid-19.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/govt-teachers-principals-in-moga-tasked-with-24-hours-surveillance-of-covid-patients-101619471180203.html

The fireworks that began with a blame game over the selection of then inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh for the special investigation team team (SIT) saw cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa and Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar vent their ire. When chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh ticked them for talking out of turn and making public statements, Randhawa who had questioned the pace of progress on the Badals’ alleged involvement offered his resignation, according to sources. Jakhar, who told this newspaper on Friday that overconfidence and not having political supervision put the government in a tight spot, also offered to quit his post. After the news broke, both Randhawa and Jakhar switched off their phones and remained unreachable. While most other ministers ducked the queries regarding the heated exchange, one senior minister denied that resignations were offered. After the meeting, Jakhar briefed the reporters about the decisions, which was odd as he is not a member of the cabinet. The PPCC chief was accompanied by finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal who usually does the briefing.

Dr Salim Khan, professor and head, community medicine, Government Medical College, Srinagar, said, “The infections are rising exponentially and many patients are falling seriously ill and requiring oxygen and ventilator support. If the scenario continues, we may not be able to admit more patients in view of the limited health infrastructure. A lockdown can help slow down the transmission and in turn reduce the influx of patients to the hospital.”He added that J&K should go for a limited lockdown so that the economy is not affected either. Dr Shafqat Khan, former municipal commissioner, Srinagar, said the only way to fight this battle is to follow the guidelines of masking, social distancing and maintaining hand hygiene.“Intermittent lockdown will slow down human activity. However, it is imperative to disallow large-scale social and religious activities. The Lieutenant Governor (LG) administration has already taken a number of steps in this direction and thrust has been laid on strengthening the infrastructure and allied facilities,” he said. A senior doctor, heading one of the Covid centres in Srinagar, said that a 15-day lockdown is necessary if the cases go up further. “Only then can we crush the curve. The government should rope in all stakeholders to get the lockdown implemented in letter and spirit at the grass-root level. We have still breathing time to strategise; policy makers should take full advantage of the present situation,” said the doctor.Former Srinagar mayor Salman Sagar said that after a timely and beneficial decision to make vaccination free for the 18 to 45 age group, the LG should take into consideration a 21-day lockdown so that the spread is contained and the purpose of attaining herd immunity is served. “All inter-state and intra-state travel should be suspended for a period of 21 days so that any chances of transmission from outside the UT are nullified and we are able to lower the burden on our health infrastructure,” said the former mayor.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/experts-make-a-case-for-extended-lockdown-in-jk-101619471063132.html
27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab cabinet gives nod to new SIT in Kotkapura police firing||Amid growing criticism of the state government’s handling of the sacrilege cases from within the Congress, the Punjab council of ministers on Monday decided to set up a new special investigation team (SIT) to probe the Kotkapura firing case in compliance of the order of the Punjab and Haryana high court. The council of ministers, which met here under the chairmanship of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh, took the decision to set up the fresh SIT to avoid any further delay in the matter, pending an appeal in the Supreme Court. “The appeal may be filed in due course in consultation with legal experts, particularly with regard to the observations and conclusion of the court which were beyond its remit and even, at times, beyond the law,” it said. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, who was part of the discussions on the matter and later briefed the reporters, said the cabinet reiterated its commitment to bring the culprits of the sacrilege incidents and subsequent police firing incidents to justice expeditiously. “There was no discussion on the composition of the SIT,” Jakhar said after the meeting when asked if any names of police officers for the new probe team were discussed. The high court had on April 9 quashed the chargesheets filed by the Punjab Police SIT in the 2015 Kotkapura firing case, pointing out serious gaps in the investigation. It has also directed the Punjab government to constitute a new SIT, minus the then inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who has opted for voluntary retirement from service since. The court, in its 89-page judgment, had said fairness of investigations stands vitiated. The legal setback in the politically sensitive case triggered immediate demands from within the Congress, particularly by dissenters such as former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, who also blamed the chief minister and his legal team for the fiasco.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-cabinet-gives-nod-to-new-sit-in-kotkapura-police-firing-101619470520318.html

One such facility will become operational in Jamia Nagar on Wednesday.The move comes days after Delhi Waqf Board chairman and Okhla MLA Amanatullah Khan convened a meeting of imams and appealed to mosques to render services for battling Covid-19 with the support of residents.Mohd Arif Jamal, the imam of Islah Masjid, said that the mosque along with Jama Masjid, Zakir Nagar, will be starting an isolation facility from the premises of a school in the neighbourhood. The 30-bed quarantine facility will be ready by Wednesday, Jamal said, and the facility is meant for those who do not have adequate space at home to isolate themselves or are in urgent need of medical attention.“Along with members of the mosque committee and locals, we have started work on developing the quarantine facility. The facility will operate out of a school and will open on Wednesday. We are arranging nebulisers, oxymeters, and medicines that will be administered under the watch of doctors from the area,” said Jamal.Patrons of the mosques have volunteered to render medical assistance besides taking care of the day-to-day management of the facility. “A number of doctors from the area have also pledged to dedicate two to three hours daily for the facility. Besides these doctors, we have also reached out to other doctors in the neighbourhood who will step in as and when required,” said Jamal.He said the mosques have already procured beds and the other facilities will be in place by Wednesday.

As the videos of bodies being transported without following due protocols were circulated on social media platforms, the district administration intervened and announced to form a committee for making necessary arrangements to cremate bodies of Covid victims. Bhagwan Shah, 67, had succumbed to virus on Sunday evening at the civil hospital. On Monday, when his family reached the mortuary to take the body for cremation, no ambulance was available. His wife claimed that private ambulance operators were demanding ₹3,500 for ferrying the body to cremation ground in Dholewal. She said as she couldn’t afford a private ambulance, they hired an auto-rickshaw for the purpose in ₹150. She claimed that she was not aware of the protocols for cremating the Covid victims. Kin of another patient, 60-year-old Kanta Rani of Focal Point, took her body on a cart. Her son also claimed that no government ambulance was available and a private operator was demanding a hefty amount. According to Covid protocols, employees or volunteers wearing PPE kits are supposed to ferry the bodies to cremation grounds in ambulance. Taking note of the incident, Ludhiana civil surgeon Dr Sukhjivan Kakkar said he will personally investigate the matter and would take action. Dr Amarjit Kaur, senior medical officer, civil hospital, said the families were mounting pressure on hospital employees to hand over the bodies to them. “However, the bodies of Covid victims cannot be released to families in such a way,” she said, adding that she will inquire into the matter and take action.

Also, only 77 of a total of 1,000 ventilators available in government and private hospitals in the state are in use at present, it was found. While level-II beds have provision of oxygen (not in all cases), level-III facilities provide intensive care to critical patients with a severe infection. “Though the patient influx has gone up in the past couple of days, we still have enough beds. Of a total of 1,500 level-3 beds in private hospitals with facilities of oxygen and ICU (catering to critical) patients, 900 are occupied. In government hospitals, 377 out of total of 545 such beds are in use,” said state Covid-19 nodal officer Dr Rajesh Bhaskar. Whereas of a total of 4,000 level-II beds, 900 are available in government facilities and nearly 2,000 in private hospitals, the figures reveal. Punjab Covid-19 task force head and former PGIMER director Dr KK Talwar said the state has adequate availability of beds for its residents but the sudden influx of patients coming from the national capital has increased load on health care facilities. “Beds are hard to find only in certain hospitals.

27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Obit: Prem Gorkhi breathed life into characters pushed to the margins||Prem Gorkhi, 74, who passed away on Sunday evening, was a leading fiction writer in the tradition of subaltern literature that took root in Punjab in the mid 60s propelled by the ultra-left literary movement. Born to a poor Dalit family in Ladhowal, he came up the hard way. However, he achieved literary success penning several acclaimed books in a life of immense struggle and told his own story in an autobiography titled ‘Ghair Hazir Aadmi’ (The Absent Man).One of the first laments in the memory of Gorkhi came from a younger contemporary Dalit writer of Moga, Gurmeet Karyalvi: ‘Tur Gaya Ghair Hazir Aadmi (The Absent Man has Left). Karyalvi says, “He was the writer of the untouched and as young readers, we would buy Amrita Pritam’s journal ‘Nagmani’ to read his autobiography that was being serialised as well as the column ‘Sarhaknama’ (Story of the Road) by Baldev Singh Sarhaknama. “However, his growing readership was irksome to several writers who came from privileged castes,” says Punjabi poet Amarjit Chandan whom Gorkhi looked up to as a mentor for encouraging him to write about his own people. Bemoaning his loss, editor-writer Swarajbir says, “He had recently started writing a column which readers waited for. His demise is a loss.”Famous storywriter Waryam Sandhu, a co-traveller of Gorkhi and partner in all-night story-telling sessions of 70s and 80s titled ‘Deeva Bale Saari Raat’ (The Lamp Flickers All Night), while paying a fond tribute to him, says, “Another gem is lost!” While many say that regular Nagmani writers like Karpal Kazak and Sarhaknama made it to the Sahitya Akademi awards, Gorkhi was ignored. This perhaps because he lacked management skills, but he leaves behind a strong body of work. His collections of short stories include ‘Mitti de Rang’(1974), ‘Jeen Maran’ (1981), ‘Arjan Safedi Wala’ (1994) and Dharti Puttar (2002). One of the leading Dalit fiction writers, Bhagwant Rasulpuri, says, “Gorkhi came to the fore with new dimensions of caste and class economy, unfolding the social realities layer by layer.”How a letter from Amrita Pritam bailed him outTwo heartwarming anecdotes from his life are that he took his second name from the first crush he had on a Nepali girl when he worked as a young labourer at a petrol pump. He had an unspoken liking for the girl who was addressed as ‘gorkhi’. The writer faced many trials in courts being labelled a Naxalite and was also falsely implicated in a bicycle theft. It was an acceptance letter written by the famous Amrita Pritam for a story he had submitted to her that convinced police that he was a writer and not a bicycle thief!||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/obit-prem-gorkhi-breathed-life-into-characters-pushed-to-the-margins-101619468602195.html

Hundreds of members of the Punjab Anganwadi Mulazam Union observed “black day” on Monday while staging a protest in front of the Sangrur deputy commissioner’s office. They have been holding an indefinite protest near the residence of state school education minister Vijay Inder Singla since March 17. The protesters also tried to jump the gates of the district administrative complex seeking filling of vacant posts in all anganwadi centres and enrolment of children aged 3 to 6. All India Federation of Anganwadi Workers and Helpers Union chief Usha Rani said the policies of the central and state government have forced them to hold protests amid the pandemic outbreak. Also, farmers in a large number continued their protest against the three agriculture laws outside the residence of BJP leader Satwant Singh Punia and raised slogans against the central government. Several devotees of Lord Hanuman on Monday held a bike yatra (procession) in the town dedicated to mark Hanuman Jayanti. Karanbir Sharma, an organiser of the rally, said the tradition of yatra was decades-old but it was organised this time on bikes to maintain social distancing. “The yarta witnesses massive gatherings every year,” added Sharma.

27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Virus surge brings import from Afghanistan via Attari border to a halt||The import from Afghanistan via the Attari-Wagah border has dipped to near zero in the past one week amid a rapid surge in coronavirus cases in India. Officials posted at the Attari integrated check post (ICP), which facilitates India’s trade with Pakistan and Afghanistan, said only a couple of trucks brought dry fruits and licorice for the last 10 days. However, no truck came from Afghanistan on Saturday and Sunday. Land Port Authority of India (LPAI)’s ICP manager Sukhdev Singh attributed the Covid-19 surge in India is a reason behind the drastic dip. Before mid-April, nearly 15 trucks carrying goods came from Afghanistan on a daily basis. The daily count of trucks was recorded more than 50 till mid-March when apple was also being imported from the country. A senior customs official said, “There is less import from Afghanistan due to off-season of dry fruits. We are following all Covid-19 protocols at the time of the unloading of trucks. A health department team gives clearance to ruck drivers at the zero line before they cross over to India.”Anil Mehra, president of the Federation of Karyana and Dry Fruit Association said, “Most of the dry fruit traders are based in New Delhi where a strict lockdown has been imposed. Many of the importers in the national capital have shelved their orders from Afghanistan. Besides, transportation here was also impacted due to a sudden surge in pandemic and Indian traders are not placing many orders.” “Also, we have to keep the wholesale Majith Mandi market in Amritsar closed on weekend due to rising cases. The market opens for just a few hours on weekdays. Many traders are also not placing their orders from Afghanistan due to logistical issues arising in the wake of the second Covid-19 wave,” he added.

27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Night curfew in Punjab from 6pm to 5 am now||The Punjab government on Monday announced fresh restrictions on movement, extended the night curfew by two hours and ordered a strict weekend lockdown in a bid to tackle the surge in coronavirus cases. “Due to continuous and rapid rise of Covid-19 cases in Punjab, the cabinet has decided to impose daily night curfew from 6 pm to 5 am and weekend lockdown from Friday 6 pm to Monday 5 am. Urge you all to stay at home and step out only if absolutely necessary. Seek your full cooperation,” Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh tweeted after the meeting. At present, night curfew is from 8 pm to 5 am. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, who was present in the cabinet meeting, said shops will remain open till 5 pm on weekdays. The cabinet also had a detailed discussion on the oxygen shortage in the state. Earlier, Amarinder urged the Centre to enhance the daily quota of medical oxygen as the state is facing a critical supply situation due to surge in cases. “The situation of oxygen supply in Punjab is extremely critical. I request Union home minister Amit Shah and Union health minister Harsh Vardhan to urgently enhance daily quota and to ensure allotted liquid manufacturing oxygen supplies are released to Punjab,” he tweeted. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the state has left with only 1.9 lakh doses of the vaccine due to the lesser supply of the vaccine from the union government. Out of this available stock, more than 1 lakh doses expected to be used by Monday. He said the Punjab government has already appealed to the Union government to regularise the supply of vaccines in the state||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/night-curfew-in-punjab-from-6pm-to-5-am-now-101619468542920.html
27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sidhu at it again, questions Capt govt’s intent on sacrilege cases||Continuing his attack on the Capt Amarinder Singh government, Amritsar East Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday questioned its “intent and deliberate delay” in cases related to the desecration of Guru Granth Sahib and the subsequent police firing in 2015. In a series of tweets, Sidhu said the choice was either to accept the high court’s judgment or appear against it in the Supreme Court, but the problem all along has been the same – intent and deliberate delay. “It is not about forming another SIT (special investigation team) but what have the SITs achieved in the past six years,” the former minister posted on Twitter, pressing for a fair and time-bound investigation with a fast-track court for a day-to-day trial. The Congress, which had promised action against the culprits in sacrilege-related cases, has been in power in the state for the past more than four years. On April 9, the Punjab and Haryana high court had quashed the SIT report in the 2015 Kotkapura firing case, pointing out serious gaps in the investigation. It has also directed the Punjab government to constitute a fresh SIT, sans then inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who has opted for voluntary retirement from service since. Sidhu, who has directly targeted Amarinder by questioning his role in the legal setback in the sacrilege cases, said that history has shown that re-investigation by the same agency compromises the case, makes the guilty wiser by allowing them a second chance to defend. “Yet if the government decides, it should ensure fair and time-bound investigation, and set up a fast-track court for a day-to-day trial,” he tweeted. He also stressed the need to make the government accountable and transparent in public eye on the emotive issue, which should have been top priority from day one or else this could lead to irreparable damage. Though other Congress leaders, including Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa, have also questioned the government on the legal setback in politically significant case, the former minister’s tirade against the CM in the past one week intensifies the tussle between the two with barely nine months to go for the state assembly elections.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sidhu-at-it-again-questions-capt-govt-s-intent-on-sacrilege-cases-101619468361099.html

27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amid shortage, western command offers help to old revive oxygen plants in Punjab||Responding to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s plea for help in the war-like Covid situation, the Western Command of the army on Monday extended all possible help, including medical staff and medically trained combatants, to Punjab to meet the exigent shortage in hospitals, along with support in reviving the state’s old oxygen plants that are currently lying defunct. “Oxygen allocation from the Centre was currently only 105 metric tonnes as against the demand of 300 MTs daily. Of this, the state is actually getting only 85 MT as the rest is being diverted to PGIMER, Chandigarh,” according to an official statement.Lt Gen RP Singh, GOC-in-C, Western Command, at a virtual meeting of the CM with senior command officials, also offered to provide staff to run the 100-bed Covid facility proposed to be set up in the building loaned to the state government by the CSIR for the purpose. At another review meeting with top officials of the state government and medical experts, Amarinder said the government was also approaching the Union home ministry to provide manpower and ICU beds through the Border Security Force (BSF). Technical and specialist cover will be provided by the Command Centre, Lt Gen Singh told the chief minister,r during their VC, adding that 15 trained nurses had already been sent to Patiala to support the civic staff. Further, experts will be sent to visit the defunct oxygen plants at existing industrial units to assess their status and extend whatever support needed for their restoration. Though their resources were stressed on account of requirements also from other states, including Delhi, Haryana and Jammu & Kashmir, the army officials said they will extend all possible help to Punjab to tackle the situation. Not proposing lockdown: Capt The CM said later at the internal review meeting that the state government was making all efforts to secure medical oxygen to supplement its depleting stocks. While he was not proposing lockdown, which leads to exodus and economic woes, the CM made it clear that the other stringent steps were being taken to manage the escalating crisis. He directed the health department to follow up with the Centre for vaccine supplies as the state presently had only 1.76 lakh Covishield and 22,000 Covaxin doses in stock. Reacting to reports of threats of strike by certain organisations of health and medical workers, Amarinder made it clear that this will be met with dismissal. “We cannot tolerate this kind of nonsense in a war-like situation,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-shortage-western-command-offers-help-to-old-revive-oxygen-plants-in-punjab-101619468239829.html
27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Covid surge: Cabinet approves recruitment of 473 staff nurses||To effectively combat the Covid-19 emergency situation across the state, the Punjab cabinet granted approval for recruitment of 473 staff nurses in Rajindra Hospital, Patiala, and Guru Nanak Dev Hospital, Amritsar, through a written test. These posts will be taken out of the purview of the Punjab Subordinate Service Selection Board. A spokesperson of the chief minister’s office said the basic pay of these newly recruited staff nurses would be ₹29,200 per month. These posts were created under the state government’s plan of restructuring to bring far more efficiency in the functioning of the medical education and research department. 2.15 lakh students to get smartphonesThe cabinet also approved the modalities for the distribution of mobile phones to nearly 2.15 lakh students of Class 12 for the academic session 2021-22 under the “Punjab Smart Connect Scheme”. The state government has allotted a budget of ₹100 crore to the school education department for the scheme for the current financial year. As many as 1,75,443 regular students (boys and girls) studying in Class 12 in government schools were given mobile phones last year. The spokesperson said that realising the benefit of imparting online education remotely to the students through the distributed smartphones, particularly in the adverse pandemic situation last year, the government decided to extend the scheme to the students to be admitted in Class 12 of the academic year 2021-22. Nod to amend service commission regulation To further speed up the process to fill nearly 1 lakh vacancies in various departments, boards, corporations and agencies of the state government, the cabinet also gave post-facto approval to amend Part-II B of the Punjab Public Service Commission (Limitation of Functions) Regulation, 1955, by putting these posts into commission’s purview. The Punjab Public Service Commission had brought to the notice of the state government that departments have sent their requisitions to it for direct recruitment of those vacancies that were earlier covered under Class III rules and which have been notified.Nod to develop, operate circuit housesTo improve efficacy of available resources and optimise the utilisation of assets, the cabinet gave approval for redevelopment, operation and maintenance (O&M) of circuit houses at Amritsar, Ludhiana and Jalandhar in public private partnership (PPP) mode. A spokesperson of the chief minister’s office said that Punjab Infrastructure Development Board (PIDB) being the nodal agency of the state has been authorised for taking necessary action in this regard. The general administration department (GAD) intends to develop and operate circuit houses at Ludhiana and Jalandhar in PPP mode to be operated as circuit houses-cum-hotels. The department operates 10 circuit houses in Amritsar, Jalandhar, Ludhiana, Bathinda, Ferozepur, Faridkot, Patiala, Gurdaspur, Chandigarh and Shimla. In addition, there are two Punjab Bhawans in New Delhi and Chandigarh. These circuit houses were developed for stay of government officers/officials visiting different district headquarters for official work. “However, over a period of time on account of recurrent expenditure on maintenance and updating of the facilities of circuit houses led to financial burden on the state government. The quality of services has also gone down significantly,” an official spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-surge-cabinet-approves-recruitment-of-473-staff-nurses-101619468059814.html

27-04-2021||Delhi||Cops ask court to release remdesivir vials seized from black-marketeers, give them to hospitals||A local court is reviewing a plea by the Delhi Police’s crime branch to allow the release of 93 vials of seized remdesivir so that they can be given to health care facilities or patients, amid a critical shortage and rampant black-marketing of the antiviral drug, which some doctors have prescribed for Covid-19 treatment.Police officers aware of the matter said the Rohini court is likely to decide on the matter after a drug inspector verifies the authenticity of the drugs. The matter is likely to be heard on Tuesday.“We have requested the court to release the seized remdesivir injections to any hospital or NGO so they may reach the patients in need,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj.Apart from the crime branch, which seized 93 vials of the drug in three raids between April 21 and 25 from seven alleged hoarders, the south and west district police teams seized nine more vials and arrested five people in connection with the matter on Sunday.Police units of the two districts are also likely to move court for the release of the nine seized vials.“We will soon move an application, seeking the court’s permission to give the seized injections to the drug controller, hospitals or any NGO,” said Atul Kumar Thakur, DCP (south).Amid the unending spate of Covid-19 hospitalisations, the Capital has been hit by a severe shortage of several drugs used to treat Covid-19 patients such as remdesivir, faviprarir and ivermectin, a scarcity that has been exacerbated by hoarders and black-marketeers, with the drugs being at rates 10-15 times their retail value. For instance, HT reported on Monday, a dealer in north Delhi offered to sell a customer a vial of remdesivir, which retails at between ₹900 and ₹3,500, at ₹25,000.“Social media is flooded with SOS messages and contact details of people selling the injections. The problem lies there itself. Patients or their family members bargain with these sellers. The bidding starts at around ₹25,000 for a vial and often stretches to ₹70,000 or ₹80,000, depending on a customer’s desperation,” said a senior police officer.The district police, crime branch and other Delhi Police units have now been directed to keep a vigil on such racketeers.For instance, the seven people arrested by the crime branch were selling each injection for between ₹25,000 and ₹40,000.“Interrogations revealed that they were getting the remdesivir from contacts in Punjab and Haryana. The crime branch teams have been conducting raids in the two states to arrest other racketeers,” Bhardwaj said.The police have also cracked down on hoarders of medical oxygen, which has been critically short in the city as well, forcing hospitals and patients to plead authorities for urgent supplies.On Saturday, a local court sanctioned the release for medical use of 48 cylinders containing 2,300 litres of medical oxygen that the southwest district police seized on Friday from a person in Dashrath Puri near Sagarpur.“Any hospital or NGO that needs the oxygen may approach us with a request letter, along with an affidavit attesting that they will return the cylinders after use. The cylinders will remain with us as case property,” said Ingit Pratap Singh, DCP (southwest).Considering the severity of the pandemic, case property seized in these cases, which may save lives, can be released in favour of the rightful owner or, alternatively, it may be handed over to someone who may need it, said senior advocate Vikas Pahwa.“These injections can also be sold to government hospitals and nursing homes. A magistrate has the power to decide this application at the preliminary stage of the case itself,” he said.Meanwhile, the police on Monday evening arrested two people, one of whom is a nurse who works at a private hospital in Rohini, for allegedly illicitly selling remdesivir injections.Deputy commissioner of police (Rohini) Pranav Tayal said they arrested Sudhir (who goes by a single name) and seized two vials of the injection. He was to deliver the two for ₹60,000 each to the complainant.“The role of the nurse emerged upon further investigations. She has been apprehended because Sudhir bought the injections for ₹38,000 each from her,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-ask-court-to-release-remdesivir-vials-seized-from-black-marketeers-give-them-to-hospitals-101619465828726.html

Admitting that the state government needed more doctors to deal with the massive surge in the Covid-19 infection, Vij has also requested the Haryana Indian Medical Association (IMA) to come forward and help the state in this “Corona crisis.” “Haryana IMA is humbly requested to come forward...We want to create extra Covid hospitals at places of need and for that we are in need of more doctors. Please come forward,” Vij had tweeted on Monday morning. After reviewing the state-level Covid monitoring committee meeting, the health minister said the state government employees suffering from Covid infection would be provided the cashless treatment facility in private hospitals. The government has decided to deploy 20 vehicles each of Dial 112 in all districts so that these vehicles can be used as ambulances and facilitate critical patients to reach the hospitals on time. The big industries, vij said, have been directed to convert industrial oxygen into medical oxygen to meet the needs of the state. In order to overcome the shortage of oxygen cylinders in the state, industries would have to deposit their cylinders with the concerned deputy commissioners, otherwise their cylinder stocks will be acquired. The home minister further said that all the private and government hospitals of the state have been directed to set up their own oxygen plants so that oxygen shortage can be avoided in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-crisis-final-year-mbbs-pg-students-to-be-deputed-in-haryana-says-vij-101619467700162.html
27-04-2021||Mumbai||IIT KGP: Video emerges of prof allegedly abusing SC, ST students, institute promises action||An associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT KGP) who verbally abused students purportedly belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities and those with physical disabilities during a preparatory class is likely to face institutional action after videos of her online classes went viral on social media, following which student bodies sought her termination for alleged casteist slurs. The recordings, which are under review of the institute, were posted on Sunday afternoon anonymously on the confessions page of IIT KGP, an informal group of students on social media. The clips are of online preparatory classes taught by Seema Singh, a professor of English from the department of Humanities and Social Sciences, which were attended by several students and parents. In it she can be heard repeatedly hurling abuses at them. The Mumbai chapter of the Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle (APPSC)—a student organisation with chapters in various IITs -- demanded that the professor be terminated and booked under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. “She is in complete cognisance of her actions and proclaims immunity from any disciplinary actions and consequences,” said APPSC in a statement. IIT Kharagpur registrar Tamal Nath said that the institute was reviewing the veracity of the videos and the claim that she made casteist slurs, brought forward by student bodies. “The incident has come to our notice. We are reviewing the veracity of the claims. The institute does not tolerate such behaviour. Action will be taken,” he said. Singh remained unreachable for comments.The institute’s director Virendra Kumar Tewari also did not respond to calls, messages and emails. “[Tewari] has expressed his support to the students and their parents during an online meeting on Monday evening. Meanwhile the professor concerned has been referred to a review committee,” an official from the institute said on the condition of anonymity. The official confirmed that the video was of the preparatory classes taken for students belonging to SC/ST communities and persons with disability (PWDs). However, the students that HT reached out to refused to comment on the video as they were afraid of possible repercussions. HT has not been able to independently verify the video.IITs offer preparatory courses for two semesters to aspirants of SC and ST communities as well as PWDs. The preparatory courses are offered against vacant seats reserved for the students who missed out on admissions through the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE). At the end of the two semesters, the students can either take the JEE again or seek admission based on their performance during the preparatory course. In the video clips, Singh can be heard verbally abusing both students and their parents for not attending classes, and keeping their cameras switched off during the class. Singh also castigated a student for sending an email stating that they would not be able to attend the class for a few days due to the death of their grandparent. “The professor at IIT KGP is all-powerful… What I have to do, I will do. You can go to ministry of women and child. Go to ministry of SC, ST and minorities (sic). Nothing can prevent me from doing what I have to do to you,” Singh can be heard telling the students in one of the clips. It was not immediately clear whether the recordings were of the same class, or of different classes. “The words used by her such as “dumb” and “bastard” have casteist connotations, especially since she uses them in plural. There is an inherent assumption that students belonging to the reserved categories are somehow lacking merit,” said a member of the APPSC, IIT Bombay chapter. The APPSC has also demanded that a permanent SC, ST, Other Backward Classes cell be set up at IIT KGP and other IITs, which will act as anti-discrimination cell to take action against “structural forms of caste discrimination”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iit-kgp-video-emerges-of-prof-allegedly-abusing-sc-st-students-institute-promises-action-101619467699115.html

The daily requirement of oxygen in government and private hospitals in Amritsar is around 30 MT whereas the allocated quota for Punjab is too less. Amritsar is presently receiving oxygen supplies from Panipat in truck-tankers, which is not a reliable system of uninterrupted supply,” he said. “I urge you (PM) to consider accepting the help offered by Pakistan. Arrangements should be made for the purchase and transportation of oxygen from Pakistan via the Attari-Wagah border,” reads the letter.The supply of imported oxygen can cater to Gurdaspur, Pathankot, Bathinda, Jalandhar, Tarn Taran and other districts of Punjab, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/aujla-writes-to-pm-bats-for-importing-oxygen-from-pak-101619467400511.html
27-04-2021||Mumbai||Aadhaar card must for walks beyond limit: Aurangabad high court||Mumbai: The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay high court said on Monday that it was averse to directing the supply of anti-viral drug Remdesivir and medical oxygen to specific districts, and asked that the state and Centre ensure timely supply following the laid down distribution plan. The division bench of justices Ravindra Ghuge and Bhalchandra Debadwar was hearing a suo motu public interest litigation on the Covid-19 situation in Northern Maharashtra and Marathwada region. “We are not intending to grab share of Remdesivir injections, medical oxygen from any other district in Maharashtra. In our order, we ask the state and centre to follow their distribution policy and ensure timely supply,” the bench stated. Last week, the Nagpur bench of the Bombay HC had directed the state government to provide 10,000 vials of Remdesivir within eight hours of passing the order, and also pulled up the Centre for reducing the supply of medical oxygen from 110 metric tonnes (MT) to 60 MT from a Bhilai-based oxygen manufacturer, causing a shortfall of 100 MT of medical oxygen to Nagpur and other Vidarbha districts. The Aurangabad bench of the Bombay HC issued further directions on movement of people during the holy month of Ramzan and also made it mandatory for everyone who ventured out beyond the hours permitted during the lockdown (7am to 11am), to carry their Aadhar card, failing which an offence would be registered against the errant persons. “Barring relaxation of four hours, any person using vehicle during restriction period shall carry Aadhar card with him, failing which concerned road traffic police would register offence against such persons. We do not find any difficulty that even doctors and medical staff should carry their Aadhar card with them.” The court made an exception from 5pm to 8 pm for Ramzan and directed the police authorities to not take action suggested by the court against such persons. The court however added that the exception would be applicable only till Ramazan not beyond it. The directions which are an addition to the existing SOPs are applicable to citizens, officials and public representatives of 13 districts from Marathwada and North Maharashtra. The HC also came down heavily on politicians who were providing parallel medical services like the state and also pulled up public representatives who shielded lockdown rule violators. The Court also directed a clamp down on black-marketing and profiteering resorted to by some individuals while facilitating the funeral rites of Covid-19 victims. The division bench observed that while within the court premises everyone wears masks and exercises precaution, beyond its walls there is anarchy as people did not wear masks and three to four people are seen riding on a motorcycle. “We as citizens, if we show some loyalty to our place and decide not to go out, it would help. We see college students in Aurangabad are loitering on road despite colleges are closed. Before blaming government, society should also do its duty,” said the bench. “Prima facie makes us form view that residents under our jurisdiction need to practice restraint and discipline,” noted the bench and said, The PIL was instituted by the bench following numerous reports of the problems being faced by people during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. “It is reported that person in charge of funeral ghats are seeking bribes for performing the last rites. In some places kerosene or petrol is used for setting the funeral pyre. Wood that is being used for performing the final rites is being sold at exorbitant prices which amount to black marketing. All divisional commissioners are to erect electric crematoriums. There shall be a constant check of the concerned authorities to ensure that the relatives of the dead person and monies are not extracted from them for performing funeral.” On the allegation of ‘illegal’ procurement of Remdesivir by an Ahmednagar MP which was being distributed parallel to the state government facilities and a prayer seeking confiscation of such injections, HC said it would deal with the aspect on April 29. “Meantime, respondent authorities are at liberty to take effective steps, as they would have taken in the event of such eventuality and do what a call of duty demands them to do,” said the bench. With regards to media reports of adulteration of the Remdesivir drug and unauthorized seeling of the same the bench said, “Person involved in adulteration of Remdesivir injections shall be booked under the relevant provisions of IPC and criminal offences shall be registered against them.” The court added that if any employee of state or state instrumentalities was involved in such acts criminal offences be registered against such persons.

27-04-2021||Mumbai||Nod for online assessment for UG medical practicals||Days after the National Medical Commission (NMC) clarified that exams for undergraduate medical courses should continue without any delay, the authorities have allowed virtual invigilation by external coordinators for practical exams. In a statement released late last week, the Postgraduate Medical Education Board (PMEB) of NMC has allowed this concession after many medical universities approached the apex authority with complaints of several teachers declining to be external examiners.“The board has therefore decided to permit examiners from outside the state to participate in the practical examination process through video conferencing. The two internal examiners, who may be from the same institute or from different institutions under the same university, should be physically present,” said a statement released by the PMEB on April 22.Last week, days after the Maharashtra state government postponed second and third year UG medical exams owing to increasing Covid-19 cases, the NMC released an advisory for medical institutions asking them to conduct second-year exams as well as supplementary exams for first and second semesters offline.“The universities are advised to adhere to the existing norms for conducting theory exams. However, considering the risk stratification of the areas where medical colleges are located, all necessary precautions, including staggering of small batches must be adhered to,” stated the circular dated April 19, released by the Undergraduate Medical Education Board of NMC. However, after receiving contradictory views from several states regarding conducting of physical exams for students in the current scenario, NMC also released a disclaimer in its latest circular. “The concerned universities may decide the time and the method of the examination taking into consideration the pandemic situation in the area,” stated the latest circular.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nod-for-online-assessment-for-ug-medical-practicals-101619467339144.html

Despite the drop, the city may not see relaxation of curbs, indicated Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) officials, maintaining they are preparing for the third wave. On March 23, the city had reported around 3,500 cases. Starting March 24, the city saw cases between 5,500 and around 11,000. The positivity rate which was around 10% in March went up to 26%. However, for one week, it is between 13% and 17%. Also, the testing has gone down in the past couple of days, from around 45,000 to 50,000 it went down to as low as 28,328 tests on Monday, but the positivity rate has remained stagnant. Mumbai reported 71 deaths on Monday. The city’s case tally is 631,484 and toll is 12,861. The recovery rate is 86%, with 544,958 recoveries. The fatality rate in the city is 2.03% and there are 72,230 active cases in the city. Dharavi, the city’s former hot spot, reported 25 cases on Monday taking the total to 6,350. There are 970 active cases in Dharavi and 5,036 have been discharged. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal in an interview with CNBC TV 18 on Monday said, “Restrictions are common for the entire state of Maharashtra. But still in many parts of the state, especially Vidarbha, cases are still increasing. Unless things become better in the state, the government can’t think of easing restrictions. This is because you cannot have an island of fewer restrictions...We have seven jumbo centres in the city that have around 9,000 beds, and now we are working to have four more jumbo centres. We are preparing for a third wave, if it comes in June, July or August.” Chahal said second wave started on February 10, 2021, and the total number of cases reported in this is 3.09 lakh followed by deaths at 1,319. This, Chahal added, means mortality rate for second wave is 0.4%, which is lowest in the world. Chahal shared this message in his broadcast message hinting that BMC is on bed capacity augmentation mode despite cases going down. Industrialist Anand Mahindra tweeted: “More good news from Mumbai that people—around the world—should see. A report from BMC Commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal. Evidence that crisis management skills are alive & well. Thumbs up for the preparation for any 3rd wave.”HT reported on Monday that Maharashtra Covid-19 task force member Dr Shashank Joshi said the flattening of the curve has started in the city. Meanwhile, Reliance Industries in a statement on Monday said that it will manage 650 beds at NSCI Worli Jumbo Covid-19 centre. At Seven Hills Hospital in Marol, it will add 25 additional ICU beds.

27-04-2021||Mumbai||BJP says MVA failed to utilise central aide; Congress calls it a lie||A day after leader of Opposition in state Assembly and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis said the Central government provided oxygen supply of 1,784 metric tonnes (MT) to Maharashtra, state Congress called it a “blatant lie”. The Congress said the Centre has been giving only 345MT oxygen a day to the state, while the list of companies released by Fadnavis comprises ones which are in Maharashtra producing oxygen for years.Maharashtra Congress’s general secretary and spokesperson Sachin Sawant said besides its own production capacity of 1,250 MT, Maharashtra is getting 345MT oxygen a day from four states after the Central government’s intervention. “We have been getting 110MT from Bhillai (Chhattisgarh), 50MT from Bellary (Karnataka), 125MT from Jamnagar (Gujarat), and 60MT from Vizag (Andhra Pradesh) in addition to our own generation of 1,250 MT every day. This takes the total daily supply to 1,595MT, but Fadnavis has been claiming that the Centre has been providing 1,784MT oxygen daily to Maharashtra. Fadnavis, in his bid to give the credit to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has lied and misguided the people of Maharashtra,” Sawant said.Fadnavis on Sunday tweeted a list of plants from which Maharashtra has been getting oxygen and added, “Thank you Hon PM@narendramodiji for such strong support to citizens of Maharashtra. Maharashtra got allotment of 1,784MT oxygen supply which is more than double as compared to any of the major states including Gujarat, UP, Karnatka, MP.” On Monday, while interacting with media after inaugurating a jumbo Covid centre at Andheri, he said, “Leaders from Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government keep targeting the Centre, but it’s a fact that Maharashtra has been given more than double the allocation than any other state. Similarly, Maharashtra has been given 435,000 vials of Remdesivir and 1,100 ventilators by the Centre.”The Congress trained guns on the BJP for its claim that MVA government failed to install pressure swing adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants from ₹201 crore allocated by the Centre in January this year. “Of 153 plants planned by the Centre, 33 are under the process of erection, but none of them are completed yet. The plants are being installed by Central Medical Supply Store controlled by ministry of health and family affairs. It is the failure of the Centre for not being able to erect even a single plant, despite of which BJP is targeting the MVA government,” Congress spokesperson Atul Londhe said.He also demanded action against BJP leader Prasad Lad under the Disaster Management Act for spreading false information and alleging corruption in the government.On Sunday Lad had slammed the Uddhav Thackeray government for its failure in utilising the funds allocated by the Centre for PSA plants. “Modi government had in January 2021 released ₹201 crore to set up 10 oxygen plants in Maharashtra. Five months on, the state government could not even utilise it properly when oxygen is much needed to treat Covid-19 patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bjp-says-mva-failed-to-utilise-central-aide-congress-calls-it-a-lie-101619467219034.html

A decision to this effect was taken at a meeting presided over by the director general of police (DGP) Manoj Yadava on Monday. Emphasising on creating back-up facilities for police personnel, the DGP said that these Covid Care Centres will either be established in welfare centres or newly built quarters in police lines. Keeping in view the district strength, commissioners of police (CPs) and district superintendents of police (SPs) will setup the facilities within three days. These facilities will be for immediate relief till the time the infected personnel can get admitted to Covid hospitals. In addition, tele-medicine facilities will also be provided at the centres. As many as 46,965 police personnel have taken their first dose of vaccine, while 27,296 have taken the second dose. During the meeting, the DGP and all other senior police officers mourned the demise of Ashok Dahiya, DSP posted at Badli in Jhajjar district. He was infected with Covid and was under treatment at Badsha AIIMS.

27-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra students urge government to cancel HSC exams||A few days after the Maharashtra government announced the cancellation of Class 10 (SSC) exams in the state, students of Class 12 (HSC) are now requesting the government to give them a similar relief. Over the past few days, several students have taken to social media requesting that HSC exams be cancelled in view of the surge in Covid-19 infections and the resultant lockdown in the state. On Sunday, the Maharashtra Students Welfare Association, a statewide body of students, wrote to state education minister Varsha Gaikwad to consider alternate methods of assessment and cancel offline exams. “HSC exams have already been postponed several times. If the situation worsens, in the coming days, postponement or conduct of offline exams will not be a good option,” states the letter. Students have requested the education department to consider alternate methods of assessments, such as internal assessments, online exams or promoting all students to the next class. “The safety of students is of foremost importance as the government has been saying repeatedly. Then why is it not cancelling exams when it is almost certain that physical exams cannot be held in such circumstances?” asked a student. Over 1.7 million students write SSC exams in the state every year while around 1.5 million appear for HSC exams. “If CBSE decides to cancel Class 12 exams, it will be easier for the state board to do so as then there would be equivalence. Hence everyone is waiting for a decision,” said an official from the state education department.On April 12, the state government had postponed HSC exams to the end of May and SSC exams to June. However, following CBSE’s decision to cancel Class 10 exams and a similar decision from ICSE, IGCSE and IB, there was growing pressure to cancel exams from students and parents to ensure equivalence across boards which is key at the time of admissions to colleges. On April 20, Class 10 exams were declared cancelled by the state government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-students-urge-government-to-cancel-hsc-exams-101619467169000.html

27-04-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination Day 101: No end to chaos, woes in Mumbai||Nalin Mehta, 58, who went to take his second dose at a private hospital in Parel on Monday was turned away, saying that vaccines are in short supply. Ten kilometres away, Mohit Patil had to stand in a queue for two hours at the Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo centre to take his second dose. This was the scene across Mumbai, on the 101st day of the vaccination drive which kicked off on January 16, as many above the age of 45 rushed to get their doses. The reason: the government has announced that in its third phase from May 1, all citizens aged above 18 years would be allowed to get vaccinated. “It will be chaos and mad rush from May 1 once the new set of people is allowed,” said Patil. He was taking his first dose as many of his neighbours were testing positive. The relatives of 73-year-old Bharti Shah were anxious as her second dose appointments have been getting cancelled at private hospitals for the past seven days. “She had stopped her blood thinners for four days, but it extended to eight days. Our family doctor warned that she should take her vaccine fast as she cannot afford to be without the tablets for days together,” said her daughter Pinky Parikh. “We went to multiple centres but they were either closed or there was a waiting period of four hours. As my mother suffers from a lung ailment, it was not possible for her to stand for so long,” added Parikh. On Monday, many centres turned citizens away citing lack of vaccines while many who were open also exhausted their stock by the day. Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal talking to the media said, “In the past eight to 10 days, there have been hiccups in the supply and it has been erratic. This has made people restless. In addition, there were many who did not make up their minds for the past few months, but are now rushing to get vaccinated.” Chahal said the situation will be eased as the whole process is decentralised. “We have 227 wards and we will open vaccination centres in each ward. Each ward has a population of approximately 50,000 people and this will speed up the process,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-day-101-no-end-to-chaos-woes-in-mumbai-101619466979110.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||Test report not essential for hospitalisation: Govt tells Delhi High Court||A patient with “steady” symptoms of Covid-19 does not need an RT-PCR test report to get admitted to a hospital in Delhi, the government submitted to the high court on MondayAnuj Aggarwal, the additional standing counsel of the Delhi government, told a bench of chief justice DN Patel and justice Jasmeet Singh that the government issued an order on April 23, directing the hospitals that all cases of moderate to severe influenza-like illness should be provided treatment in an area dedicated for suspected cases, and no patient should be denied treatment.“It has been informed that many patients with clinical presentation of Influenza-like illness with RT-PCR negative are reporting to hospitals with moderate to severe disease. Dedicated Covid-19 hospitals are denying them admission for want of a positive RT-PCR test. Hospitals are hereby directed that all cases of moderate to severe influenza-like illness should be provided treatment as per protocol in a dedicated area to be kept for suspected cases,” the Delhi government order read, adding that no patient requiring medical aid should be denied treatment”.The submission by the Delhi government came during a hearing on a petition by Jaideep Ahuja seeking directions to the government to order hospitals not to insist on Covid-positive reports to hospitalise patients who show symptoms of the disease.The petitioner told the bench that the Uttar Pradesh government has a direction that hospitals should not insist on RT-PCR positive test reports for admitting patients.The petitioner cited two instances when patients, both lawyers, were not admitted to hospitals because they did not have the Covid-19 positive report despite showing severe symptoms of Covid. The reports of both the patients were held up at the labs and were not available to them.Advocate Anuj Aggarwal, who was representing the Delhi government, told the court that an order has been issued and hospitals have been strictly asked to comply with the directions.Following this, the bench asked the government to widely publicise the order and ensure that it is scrupulously followed by the hospitals. The court also requested the Delhi government to increase the number of RT-PCR testing centres and to put in place the necessary infrastructure to streamline the sample collection process.The direction was issued by the court after several lawyers told the bench that they were facing difficulty in getting tested as labs were saying they will carry out sample collection after 2-3 days. They contended that the number of daily tests have gone down to around 60,000 from the over one lakh tests that were being conducted earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/test-report-not-essential-for-hospitalisation-govt-tells-delhi-high-court-101619465822379.html

The Congress has expressed its discontent over the unilateral announcement, while leaders in the Shiv Sena are not very happy with the act of the NCP leader, insiders said.Malik, while speaking to media on the Sunday, said the state government has taken the decision to provide free vaccination to all above 18 years. He said the decision was taken during the state cabinet meeting last Tuesday with chief minister (CM) Uddhav Thackeray, who gave his nod for the same. Sena leader and environment minister Aaditya Thackeray, too, on Sunday tweeted about the announcement, but deleted them within minutes saying official announcement will be declared by the empowered committee. He said, “I have deleted the earlier tweet as to not cause confusion about the vaccination policy of Maharashtra that would be fully ensuring fast, efficient vaccination and would leave nobody behind,” he said.Congress leader and revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat on Monday expressed his discontent over the announcement, calling it an attempt of grabbing credit. “The Congress has been demanding free vaccination for all since the beginning. We have put up the demand with the CM, and as part of the cabinet, we are part of the deliberation over it. It is uncalled for to announce it for the sake of credit. The Congress is not happy over the unilateral announcement,” he said.When asked for his reaction, Malik on Monday said, “I would not like to comment on Balasaheb Thoratji’s statement.”The Congress believably conveyed their discontent to CM Thackeray. “There is a coordination committee of senior leaders from all three ruling parties. The policy of free vaccination for all is being framed and the group has already had a couple of meetings over it. The CM wants it to be announced on May 1, Maharashtra Day, after formally discussing it in the cabinet meeting in the next two days. In such a backdrop, the premature announcement was uncalled for,” said a Congress leader.The leader added that Aaditya deleted his tweet to avoid breach of protocol by announcing a policy without its formal approval. Sena’s chief spokesperson Sanjay Raut said CM Thackeray will announce the decision.Meanwhile, leader of Opposition in the legislative Assembly Devendra Fadnavis said the state government should chalk out a policy instead of making an announcement out of one upmanship. “People will be flocking for the vaccine in the third phase beginning from May 1 and the state government should chalk out a strategy for it. Instead of that, cabinet ministers are busy making announcements, sending out tweets and then deleting it. There is no coordination within the state cabinet. Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his Mann Ki Baat on Sunday, has already announced to vaccinate all free of cost, no question arises of free vaccination by the states,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/free-covid-vaccine-ncp-s-move-spells-trouble-in-maharashtra-govt-101619466559609.html

The Government Railway Police, Kalyan, have registered a case and are investigating the matter. The complainant, Dilip More, said the argument started after he was charged ₹13 for a samosa paav at the station canteen. More argued with the canteen boy stating that the actual price was ₹11. “On Sunday, I alighted at platform no 2 of Ambernath station along with a friend. We went to buy samosa at the railway canteen. However, the canteen employee charged ₹2 extra for it, so we questioned him. Following an argument, he attacked me with a blade on my right hand, while another worker slapped me.” He then approached the GRP. Shardul Walmiki, senior police inspector, GRP, Kalyan, said, “We have registered a case under section 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) of the Indian Penal Code against Mangal Singh Khushwa, who works in the canteen.”More, an arts graduate, stays in Vangni along with his wife and daughter.

The duo was produced before the court after their custody ended. Fifteen Covid-19 patients were charred to death after a fire broke out on the second floor of the four-storey private hospital in the early hours of Friday.Shah and Pathak were arrested for culpable homicide and other offences after the authorities found that the hospital’s licence was not renewed.“We told the court that we had to search for more [hospital] documents, and hence, the extension of the police custody was needed. In the meantime, a five-member committee headed by Palghar collector Dr Manik Gursal has been formed to probe the incident,” said senior police inspector Pramod Badakh, from crime branch, Mira Bhayander Vasai Virar (MBVV) commissionerate (zone 3). A few fire brigade and Vasai civic body officials are likely to be questioned on the issuance of fire audit certificate, despite the fire sprinkler system not working, said a police source. No official from the civic body or the fire brigade inspected the fire audit certificate, although the check is mandatory after every six months. The fire licence had to be renewed in September 2020, but was renewed only last month, said the police. Also, the hospital converted to a Covid-19 centre in February 2021 without informing the Vasai civic body, said the police.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-hospital-fire-director-and-ceo-to-stay-in-cop-custody-till-wednesday-101619466499019.html

The latest casualty was reported on the night of April 25 at Mangurla village, which falls under the Mukutban range of the Pandharkawda forest division in Yavatmal district. The victim was a four-year-old tigress, pregnant with four cubs, who had been ensnared in a wire trap. Patrolling forest guards found the animal in a cave adjacent to a nullah, with her paws chopped off, around 10.30pm on Sunday. The carcass was sent for an autopsy on Monday morning, the results of which are awaited.“The animal got caught in a wire trap and made its way back to her cave, where she probably passed away from the injuries,” said district forest officer Subash Puranik, under whose jurisdiction the area falls. This year’s tally of tiger deaths is also more than the 14 deaths recorded in the state during all of 2020. At least 11 of the fatalities recorded in the last four months of last year can be attributed to incidents of poaching and suspected poisoning, officials said.In Pandharkawda forest division itself, this is the third incident of poaching reported in a month. On March 23, the carcass of another four-year-old tigress (T7), had been found ensnared in a wire trap at the Maregaon forest range. “Just last week, we rescued another tigress from Tipeshwar Wildlife Sanctuary who had been caught in a wire trap. The animal is currently in a cage recovering from injuries and will be released soon,” said Puranik.The highest number of tiger fatalities this year has been reported from the vicinity of Umred Karhandla Wildlife Sanctuary, which lies in Nagpur and Bhandara districts, where a tigress and her cub were found dead due to suspected poisoning earlier this year. Officials, however, emphasised that there is no indication of an organised poaching syndicate in the state.“Tiger deaths have been mainly due to wire snares used by locals to protect their fields from deer or to catch a wild boar. Sometimes, a tiger may inadvertently get caught as well. This year, we have also lost four tigers due to suspected poisoning, and at least three cubs due to territorial fights. There are also some natural deaths,” said BS Hooda, additional principal chief conservator of forests (APCCF) (wildlife), Nagpur.Kishor Rite, a member of the state board for wildlife, called the trend worrying. “Such a steep rise in tiger deaths calls into question the preparedness of teams on the ground. There is a standard operating procedure which needs to be followed in these cases. Maharashtra has made some progress in dealing with organised poaching syndicates that use more effective steel traps. But the use of wire snares by local populations is rampant and needs to be urgently addressed,” said Rite||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tigress-dead-in-yavatmal-toll-at-17-in-maharashtra-this-year-101619466378965.html

Shetty’s uncle has been admitted to the hospital since the past fortnight. He was told to shift the patient or make arrangements for oxygen.Meanwhile, the patient checked with Thane Municipal Corporation’s (TMC) war room that claimed there was enough oxygen with the said hospital and there was no need to shift. “All through the day, I was busy going back and forth with the hospital staff and TMC to understand the situation. The hospital also gave me in writing that there was an oxygen shortage. However, the treatment was going on,” said Shetty.Meanwhile, Dr Hrushikesh Vaidya, medical director of Horizon Prime Hospital, said, “There is a perennial shortage of oxygen everywhere. We are facing a similar situation, and hence, alerted the patient’s relatives. Those who wish to shift, we are giving them that option.” Vaijanti Deogekar, TMC health officer, said, “We are in the process of conducting an oxygen audit of all the hospitals and Covid centres. In the next three days we shall complete the audit, after which the oxygen issue will be resolved.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hospital-claims-oxygen-shortage-tmc-says-supply-sufficient-101619466318983.html
27-04-2021||Delhi||With travel curbs keeping families away, funeral organisers step in to perform last rites||With the death toll from Covid-19 remaining above 300 for the past five days amid the continuing surge in cases, and in view of the restrictions on travel imposed by several countries, many families are unable to perform the last rites of their loved ones, and are instead relying on funeral organisers in the national capital to ensure that their dear ones get a decent farewell.The funeral service providers are not just assisting families in making the arrangements, but in most cases, are also performing the rituals in the absence of family members.The second wave of Covid-19 pandemic across the county -- and the fourth wave in Delhi -- has turned out to be the deadliest one yet with over 25,000 people testing positive for the virus daily and nearly 300 persons dying every day over the past few days.On Sunday, Delhi recorded 350 deaths, while on Saturday it was 357, and on Friday, 348. The average number of Covid-19-related deaths, according to the state health bulletin, in the past week was 304.Given the grave situation, the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention has issued a non-binding advisory asking people to not go to India even if they are fully vaccinated. Apart from the US, the UK, Singapore and New Zealand have also imposed fresh restrictions on travellers from India or issued advisories against travelling to India following the massive spike in Covid-19 cases. Gulf countries Oman, Kuwait, the UAE and Iran, as well as Canada, have imposed restrictions on passengers arriving from India and will allow only citizens to enter.Several funeral organisers across the city said there has been a surge in the number of requests they are getting for services from people residing abroad or currently stuck in other cities. Officials at Messy funerals, a service provider in Civil Lines, said their phone has been ringing off the hook the past week.Vineeta Messy, the owner of the company, said they have recently completed the last rituals of two elderly persons, aged 76 and 82, who had succumbed to the virus at their home in Indirapuram, Ghaziabad. “Their children are in the US and could not come to India. We got a call from them and when we reached their home, only the domestic help was there with the bodies. We collected the bodies and performed the funeral rituals. We also live streamed the ceremony to the children. There have been so many such requests recently,” she said.“It is difficult to console the family members of a deceased when they are not being able to see the departed one last time,” Messy said.Funeral organisers are offering packages -- ranging from ₹5,000 to ₹20,000 -- which cover services such as organising a hearse van to pick up the body, and arranging materials for the rituals and priests, and finding a crematorium or burial ground where the finals rites will take place. Some of them also provide free service to families who cannot afford the packages.According to several funeral service providers, the number of requests for their services has increased manifold, particularly from foreign clients, in the past two weeks. The requests are coming from the US, the UK, Canada, and even the UAE, organisers said.“Earlier we used to get hardly 50 calls a week for any sort of assistance. But these days, we are getting around 300 calls a day seeking help. We don’t have the resources to cater to all requests. We wish we had more ambulances and staff to serve everyone,” said Daljit Singh of Antim Yatra.The funeral service providers are also getting frequent calls from Covid-19 positive families who cannot participate in the final journey of their loved ones. Cyril Joseph, the owner of the JCJ Funerals in Kalkaji Extension, said they recently performed the funeral of a Covid patient from CR Park whose entire family was also Covid positive. “It was heartbreaking that they could not accompany their father on his last journey. We collected the body and performed the last rites, while live streaming the ceremony to the family. The next day, we also had to pick up the ashes and hand it over to the family,” he said.Antim Yatra, a funeral company in Jantar Mantar Road, will also immerse the ashes of a Covid-19 victim on behalf of a family on Tuesday. “Father of two elderly persons died of Covid and both children also have Covid. We finished the last rites of their father and on Tuesday, we will immerse the ashes by ourselves. This is not a lone case --- there are several such families who are helpless to do anything,” said Singh.For such helpless families, there is no closure. Akshit Sharma, 25, who works with a multimedia company in Pune and is presently Covid positive, had to rope in a funeral service to cremate his aunt who succumbed to the virus in Delhi. “My aunt, 58, always lived alone in Delhi. She never got married or had children. We were like her own kids. It feels devastating that we could not see her for the last time or be there for her last rituals since my family is also Covid positive at present. My father is in a bad shape after losing his sister. We have requested a local temple to keep her ashes till we are able to immerse them,” he said.Officials at several burial grounds and crematoriums also said they have performed several such “lonely” last journeys. Mohammad Shamim, the supervisor of Delhi’s biggest burial ground at ITO, said, “There have been several cases when none was there to even help us put the body in the grave. It feels really bad seeing people die such lonely deaths.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-families-away-due-to-travel-curbs-funeral-organisers-perform-last-rites-101619465816442.html
27-04-2021||Mumbai||4 Covid patients die at Thane hospital; kin allege oxygen shortage||Following the death of four patients at Vedant Hospital in Vartak Nagar, Thane early on Monday morning, relatives of patients alleged these deaths were due to lack of oxygen supply in the hospital. Thane district collector has initiated an inquiry into the incident by forming a special committee, led by IAS officer and Bhiwandi Nizampur City Municipal Corporation chief Pankaj Ashiya. The team will consist of officers from the district and the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC). The relatives gathered at the hospital premises since around 4am and demanded an inquiry into the deaths. Sadhna Patil, relative of 57-year-old Vijay Patil who lost his life on Monday morning, said, “My brother-in-law was admitted to this hospital on Saturday afternoon as he was not feeling well. His Covid test report arrived on Sunday afternoon stating he was positive. When we spoke to him on Sunday night, he said he was okay. But around 4am, we got a call from the hospital staff using the patient’s mobile to inform that my brother-in-law expired. We were shocked and reached the hospital at the earliest, but there was no response or information regarding his health from the hospital staff till 10.30am. We repeatedly called them and also requested them to let us in, but to no avail.” With the presence of mourning relatives, the hospital had to beef up its security around 11am. Additional police were at the spot and civic officials visited the hospital. By noon, all the bodies were taken to the crematorium. Thane district collector Rajesh Narvekar said, “An inquiry committee has been formed. It will first collect information about patients who lost their lives and the health status since they were admitted at the said hospital. They will find out the reason for their death and the precise time, they will also inquire if their death is related to oxygen supply. If yes, we will find out who is responsible for the same. Moreover, if any medical negligence was involved in the death and the committee will inquire as to who is responsible for the same. It may also look into other details if necessary as part of the inquiry.”Dr Ajay Singh from Vedant Hospital said, “We have an oxygen facility in the hospital. After checking our internal resources if we feel the need for additional oxygen, we ask TMC. We did the same on Monday and made use of the oxygen facility, there was no shortage. In a span of 12 hours, four patients have died and these are Covid-related deaths. We are ready to submit all details or necessary documents to the committee.” Like Patil, there were three others who lost their lives around the same time. “My aunt, Aruna Pashte, 67, was admitted on Sunday evening. We were told by night that her oxygen was around 95 and her condition is stable. However, around 2am we received a call that the patient is critical and on oxygen. Around 4am, we were told she died,” said Roshan Pashte. Eknath Shinde, urban development minister and guardian minister of Thane city, has ordered all government and private hospitals within Mumbai Metropolitan Region to conduct fire, electric and oxygen safety audit. This has to be done under the supervision of the district collector and municipal commissioner through a third-party expert body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/4-covid-patients-die-at-thane-hospital-kin-allege-oxygen-shortage-101619466200163.html
27-04-2021||Chandigarh||No shortage of oxygen in Haryana: Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Monday said there was no shortage of oxygen supply in Haryana.The CM, who was speaking at the sidelines of a meeting with Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (PGIMS), Rohtak, authorities, said the state had sent a proposal to the Union government demanding 240 tonnes of oxygen. “Industrialist Naveen Jindal will also provide us five tonnes of liquid oxygen per day from his manufacturing plant,” Khattar said, while adding that 650 more beds will be provided for Covid patients at PGIMS, Rohtak. “Currently, PGIMS has a facility of 350 beds, which will be increased to 1,000 beds. We will provide 1,250 more beds at different medical colleges in the state. We have identified two spots with a capacity for 500 beds each,” he said.On patients preferring to go to private hospitals, Khattar said the working of private hospitals was being monitored and that they should refrain from admitting more patients than their capacity. The CM said the government had set a quota on the availability of Remdesivir and private hospitals were being closely monitored to check black marketeering of the medicine.The CM also stopped at the oxygen plant at Panipat Refinery to take stock of the situation. “A site has been finalised for setting up a 500-bed Covid hospital on the premises of the Indian Oil Corporation’s Panipat refinery, adjoining the oxygen plant. The hospital will have 500m direct connectivity for round-the-clock oxygen supply directly from the plant,” Khattar said. Haryana seeks 40 MT O2 supply from Jharkhand

The maximum temperature, meanwhile, stood at 34.5 degrees Celsius, one degree above normal.IMDs Colaba station also saw above normal minimum temperature on Monday at 27.7 degrees Celsius. “There has been an increase in the temperature as well as humidity in the past couple of days. There is a low-level discontinuity across all of Maharashtra, and coastal regions in the north-west had cloudy conditions, which led to accumulation of heat at night,” said a spokesperson from IMD’s regional forecasting centre in Mumbai.IMD officials also said that there is a slight chance of rain in Mumbai and Thane districts this week, under the influence of a weather system passing over parts of central India. “Isolated rainfall and thundershowers may be felt in the eastern part of the state. Mumbai may get some drizzle this week, which may cause a day or two of high humidity,” said the spokesperson.“A north-south trough runs from Marathawada to south coastal Tamil Nadu across north interiors of Karnataka, Telangana and Rayalaseema in lower tropospheric levels.

It also mentions the case involving a fake call centre on Mira road and several others.Ghadge alleged that because he refused to drop the case against the 22 in the KDMC case, four false cases were registered against him.Ghadge has furnished details of the FSI case along with his complaint.According to the complaint, Singh bought 21 acres in Sindhudurg district in someone else’s name. He also alleged that Singh was using two government residences at one time, which amounts to criminal misconduct.Inspector Ghadge said that all these complaints were also previously made by him on September 21, 2015, March 17, 2016, May 30, 2016 and June 8, 2016, but that no action was taken. He added in the letter that he has also filed five write in the Bombay High Court in this regard over the years.Singh was removed as commissioner for what the state government claimed was his mishandling of the Antilla explosives case, and the murder of Mansukh Hiran, the man in possession of the vehicle in which the explosives were found, outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Hiran reported the vehicle stolen around a week before it was found with the explosives in late February. He himself was subsequently found dead. Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze has been named as the main accused in both cases by the National Investigation Agency. After his removal as commissioner, Singh wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that the state’s home minister Anil Deshmukh instructed Vaze to extort money from restaurants and bars in the city. He also approached the courts with his complaint, following which the Bombay High Court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, a move that forced Deshmukh’s resignation.Singh is already facing two enquiries being carried out by DGP Sanjay Pandey.In the first, Pandey is checking whether there was any dereliction of duty on part of Singh in not apprising the government about the Antilia bomb scare . The second inquiry pertains to corruption allegations made against him by police inspector Anup Dange.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/inspector-accuses-ex-mumbai-top-cop-param-bir-singh-of-cheating-corruption-101619465304456.html
27-04-2021||Other||Antilia case, Hiran murder: Papers found in cop’s Mumbai home, office says NIA||The National Investigation Agency (NIA) on Monday on Monday conducted searches at three places related to suspended Mumbai Police inspector Sunil Mane, who is in in the federal agency’s custody since his arrest on April 23, in connection with the Antilia explosives scare and the subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran. NIA sources said that the agency has recovered some “incriminating” documents and articles from the three places. The agency also seized Mane’s red Hyundai Creta from his building premises at Malad residence.A senior officer attached to Mumbai crime branch said an NIA team visited Mane’s former desk and cabin at unit 11 of the crime branch at Kandivli. Mane was in-charge of the unit till March 23.“The search was a part of NIA’s ongoing investigation and the officers in the unit cooperated with the agency,” the crime branch officer added.Another NIA team conducted searches at the local arms unit at Marol where Mane was posted at the time of his arrest.NIA officers said they recovered some documents and material from the Marol office and Mane’s residence during the search, which they are scrutinising.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio – with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note – was found abandoned near industrialist Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence Antilia. A case was registered at Gamdevi police station on the same day.Assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze was originally investigating the Antilia case. But after reports emerged of his links with Hiran – who was in possession of the SUV and had reported it stolen on February 17 – Vaze was removed from the probe. Hiran went missing on March 4 and a day later his body was found in Retibunder creek at Mumbra. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car in November and returned it to Hiran before the Antilia incident came to light on February 25.NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and Vaze was arrested on March 13. The agency took over the murder case on March 24 and Vaze was named the main accused in Hiran’s killing too.To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred police commissioner Param Bir Singh, alleging mismanagement of the case. He subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister, alleging that home minister Anil Deshmukh had instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai Police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars, restaurants and hookah parlours. When no action was taken, Singh approached the courts.The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, the central agency conducted the inquiry and registered an offence against Deshmukh on April 24.Meanwhile, NIA sources said the six new handkerchiefs, which were found stuffed in Hiran’s mouth when his body was recovered, were purportedly purchased from a vendor outside Kalwa railway station on March 4.The source said NIA has seized CCTV footage capturing a person purchasing the handkerchiefs and he looked like Vaze.NIA has already secured the CCTV footage in which Vaze is seen travelling from Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Terminus towards Thane by train in the evening of March 4, although he maintained that he was at the criminal intelligence unit (CIU), which he headed at the time. NIA and Maharashtra anti-terrorism squad (ATS) officers – who were probing the cases before the federal agency took over – claim that Vaze had met Hiran at Thane before the latter was allegedly kidnapped and smothered in a car at Gaimukh Chowpatty on Ghodbunder Road. His body was later dumped in the creek.The NIA officer said the agency has found technical evidence suggesting that Mane was present in Thane when Mansukh was allegedly smothered. The agency has been scrutinizing Mane’s phone call details to find out who he was in touch with before and after the Antilia scare and Hiran’s murder.NIA has claimed that Mane was purportedly part of the conspiracy hatched to eliminate Hiran. He was present at CIU office on March 3, when Vaze purportedly tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden Scorpio. According to another NIA officer, Vaze had also assured the trader that he would get him out on bail in a few days. The plan to eliminate Hiran was allegedly hatched after the 48-year-old trader refused to take the blame and get arrested in the case.Apart from Vaze and Mane, NIA has also arrested Vaze’s former colleague at CIU, assistant inspector Riyazuddin Kazi, former policeman Vinayak Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Gor in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/antilia-case-hiran-murder-papers-found-in-cop-s-mumbai-home-office-says-nia-101619465959150.html

Chief medical officer (Lucknow) Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “The issue is dealt by the Balrampur hospital administration who decided utilising the resources.”In the letter, the MP also highlighted what he described as the sorry state of treatment in King George’s Medical University.The MP’s letter also said a couple of heads of department never did duty in the wards, but they were busy highlighting themselves in the media.“A number of beds are lying vacant in these departments so there is a need to do the audit of bed occupancy of the last 20 days,” he said.He also said a number of beds were lying vacant on the fourth floor of the Covid hospital in KGMU, where patients can be admitted after arranging oxygen supply for them.Meanwhile, insiders and family members patients alleged only seven of the 28 ventilators in Balrampur Hospital were operational.A resident of Golaganj, whose mother is admitted in Balrampur Hospital in a serious condition, said, “I am surprised that despite having a number of ventilators, the hospital is operating just seven of them. The patients who require ventilators are left at the mercy of God. It seems human lives have no value.”A hospital insider said, “Yes, as many as 28 ventilators arrived in the hospital last year after the onslaught of corona, but they are lying unused because no one was trained to operate them, and no one wanted to take responsibility for operating these ventilators during such testing times.”People familiar with matter said Lokbandhu Hospital had 18 ventilators but only four of them were operational because the hospital did not have the trained manpower to use these hi-tech ventilators which could save a number of lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/ventilators-gathering-dust-mp-writes-to-yogi-adityanath-101619465311283.html
27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccine shortage hits drive in Haryana’s Panchkula district||As the district is witnessing a sharp surge in Covid-19 cases, the vaccination drive has slowed down due to shortage of supply.The district health department has administered 1,35,118 doses to date, of which 27,388 persons have received the second dose.Despite a promising start, the vaccine drive has been lagging in the district. Authorities attribute this slowdown to a shortage of vaccine supply and health workers getting overworked and infected with the virus.The authorities are now unsure whether they will be able to expand the vaccination drive among persons in the 18-45 years of age category.Number of jabs reduced to one-thirds In the beginning of April, over 3,000 persons were vaccinated daily at around 35 vaccination sites; the number reduced to around 1,000 in the last two days, and even the sites are limited to 14, with only one site for the entire urban Panchkula.“Covishield is almost over. We are left with around 2,000 doses, which will get over in a day or two. And we have kept Covaxin for people requiring a second dose. We are left with around 11,000 doses,” said Dr Meenu Sasan, immunisation officer, Panchkula.She added that they were awaiting a stock of vaccines by April 28.When asked about the reduction in the number of sites, Dr Meenu said this would ensure “the existing doses of vaccine can be used judiciously without much wastage. At the moment, every dose of vaccine matters.”“Also, most of our staff is testing positive,” she added. This month, 37 health workers have tested positive.A lot of chaos was witnessed at the community centre in Sector 12 A, which is the only vaccination centre for urban Panchkula. “The load has increased manifold as people from other cities are also approaching Panchkula for vaccination. There is no need to panic,” Dr Meenu said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccine-shortage-hits-drive-in-haryana-s-panchkula-district-101619465120032.html
27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Speeding challans see ninefold jump this year in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh traffic police have issued 14,804 challans for speeding this year, up from 1,636 fines imposed in the corresponding period in 2020. The ninefold jump points towards better enforcement and comes at a time when uniform speed limits have been notified for the city roads to further facilitate awareness and implementation.Palak Goel, deputy superintendent of police (DSP, traffic administration), attributes the jump to the installation of automatic number plate recognition systems and issuing of traffic violation information slips since May last year. “We appeal to all motorists to stick to the speed limits for their own safety, or else action will be taken,” she says.Meanwhile, the number of challans issued in April has seen a drop as traffic police are awaiting the installation of signage with new speed limits before resuming the drive. Even last year, the number of challans had plunged to just four in April amid restrictions on vehicular movement due to the Covid-19 lockdown.As far as the new speed limits are concerned, not all people are on board. Harman Sidhu, president of the NGO ArriveSafe NGO and member of the UT Road Safety Council, has written to the administrator to increase the speed limits. “A 5% cut in speed can lead to a 30% reduction in road fatalities, as per the World Health Organisation. All roads don’t have pavements and to drive on sector roads at 40km/hour while pedestrians are also walking on the same stretch can lead to many accidents,” he said.Light motor vehicles and two-wheelers are fined ₹1,000 for the first offence while medium and heavy vehicles are fined ₹2,000. For subsequent offences, the fines are ₹1,500 for two-wheelers, ₹2,000 for light motor vehicles and ₹4,000 for medium and heavy vehicles. Even the driver’s licence is suspended for three months on second and subsequent offence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/speeding-challans-see-ninefold-jump-this-year-in-chandigarh-101619464700585.html

Dedicated Covid-19 hospitals are denying them admission for want of a positive RT-PCR test. Hospitals are hereby directed that all cases of moderate to severe influenza-like illness should be provided treatment as per protocol in a dedicated area to be kept for suspected cases,” the Delhi government order read, adding that no patient requiring medical aid should be denied treatment”.The submission by the Delhi government came during a hearing on a petition by Jaideep Ahuja seeking directions to the government to order hospitals not to insist on Covid-positive reports to hospitalise patients who show symptoms of the disease.The petitioner told the bench that the Uttar Pradesh government has a direction that hospitals should not insist on RT-PCR positive test reports for admitting patients.The petitioner cited two instances when patients, both lawyers, were not admitted to hospitals because they did not have the Covid-19 positive report despite showing severe symptoms of Covid. The reports of both the patients were held up at the labs, and were not available to them.Advocate Anuj Aggarwal, who was representing the Delhi government, told the court that an order has been issued and hospitals have been strictly asked to comply with the directions.Following this, the bench asked the government to widely publicise the order and ensure that it is scrupulously followed by the hospitals. The court also requested the Delhi government to increase the number of RT-PCR testing centres and to put in place necessary infrastructure to streamline the sample collection process.The direction was issued by the court after several lawyers told the bench that they were facing difficulty in getting tested as labs were saying they will carry out sample collection after 2-3 days. They contended that the number of daily tests have gone down to around 60,000 from the over one lakh tests that were being conducted earlier.Para on testing numbers in Delhi.Expert quote.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/test-report-not-essential-for-hospitalisation-govt-tells-delhi-hc-101619464579436.html

It will be manned by the Western Command personnel and jointly run by the civil administration and the Army. The technical and specialist manpower will be made available from the Command Hospital, Chandimandir. The decision was taken during a virtual meeting between Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh and Lieutenant General RP Singh of the Western Command. The CM said though at present the Covid bed capacity available with the state was sufficient, the situation might change rapidly and thus there may be a requirement for additional beds. Lieutenant General RP Singh assured the CM of necessary assistance.OPD, emergency shifted from civil hospitalMeanwhile, the district health authorities have shifted the out patient department and emergency services from the civil hospital, Phase 6, to the Employees State Insurance (ESI) Hospital in the Industrial Area, Phase 7, with immediate effect. The move will help make space for 40 more Level-2 (oxygen support) beds at the civil hospital, taking the total to 100. At present, all 220 Level-3 (ICU beds with ventilator support) are occupied at private and government facilities in the district, while oxygen beds are also nearing saturation. “A special ward will be set up at the civil hospital to accommodate Covid patients as private hospitals have already run out of the beds. The number of beds will be made available according to the availability of oxygen, doctors and paramedics,” said civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur.Deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the administration also has around 200 beds at their disposal for setting up an L2 facility at Chandigarh University, Gharuan, subjecte to the availability of doctors and paramedics. Meanwhile, the administration has asked private hospitals to expand their L3 bed capacity, he said. None of the nine government hospitals in the district has ICU beds.District admn constitutes oxygen audit teams In the wake of unprecedented demand for oxygen, the district administration on Monday also constituted 15 oxygen audit teams. Dayalan said an oxygen monitoring committee is already operational and the new teams will give regular updates to it . Comprising three members each, including medical and police officials, the teams will work 24x7 to ensure daily audit of all Covid hospitals in the district. They will liaison with hospitals and ensure that they maintain two-hourly oxygen saturation chart of every patient so that requirement per patient is assessed and the monitoring committee can keep a tab on medical oxygen consumption of each hospital. The teams will also ensure timely shifting of recovered patients from L3 to L2 or L1 facilities, so that more L3 beds are available for critical patients. ‘No crisis-like situation in Panchkula’A day after Panchkula district reported 100% Covid bed occupancy, deputy commissioner Mukul Kumar designated Mamta Sharma, estate officer, Haryana Shehri Vikas Pradhikaran, Panchkula, as the nodal officer for bed and oxygen supply management in the district. Executive engineer, HSVP, NK Payal will assist her.“So far, there is no crisis-like situation, as beds are available and no problem has been reported. However, we are making a plan to deal with the situation, in case the number of cases rise,” said Sharma.According to data shared by the authorities on Monday, all 62 ventilator beds were occupied in the district, while 12% oxygen and 37% non-oxygen beds were still available.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/army-to-set-up-100-bed-covid-facility-in-mohali-101619464464070.html
27-04-2021||Chandigarh||Covid surge: Hospitals stretched to the limit in Chandigarh||The UT hospitals are scrambling to push the health infrastructure to cope with the increasing number of Covid-19 patients, especially those who require treatment in the intensive care units.The three Covid-19 dedicated hospitals have been able to add ICU beds in limited numbers, which may not be able to cater to the impending crisis especially when the influx of patients from neighbouring states, including the crisis-hit national capital of New Delhi, is increasing.Out of 126 ICU ventilator beds earmarked for Covid-19, only 19 remained vacant on Monday evening.The Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) has only been able to push the capacity of ICUs from 45 last year to 72 till Monday evening, while the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH) in Sector 32 has been able to add 24 more ICU beds to the 49-bed ICU facility.“We have been stretched to our upper limit. If we increase more beds and divert more resources to Covid management, our non-Covid resources will be affected harshly,” said Jagat Ram, the director of PGIMER.“We have diverted the ICUs from non-Covid areas for the management of Covid-19 patients. Managing ICUs is a major task as it requires dedicated workforce because of direct supervision. It requires round the clock availability of doctors and nurses to cater to one or two patients who are in ICU. So there is a limit to which we can go up,” Dr Ashok Kumar, official spokesperson of the institute said.Similarly, at Government Multi-Speciality Hospital, Sector 16, all six ICU beds which were installed in pre-Covid times have been earmarked for positive patients now with no additional infrastructure being created on this front in the pandemic.‘OTs being turned into ICUs’The medical superintendent of Nehru Hospital Extension, Dr Vipin Koushal, said that creating ICUs required at least 160 square feet space and that they had even turned operation theatres to accommodate more beds.Yashpaul Garg, CEO, Chandigarh Housing Board, and in-charge of Covid-19 management at GMCH-32 said they had started hiring more staff including doctors and nurses on an urgent basis to deal with the crisis.UT health secretary Arun Gupta said that every resource available was being utilised for creating more infrastructure: “Oxygen beds are available in good numbers, but there is a limit to creating critical care beds as it requires more workforce and resources.”Social activist and president of Second Innings Association, RK Garg, said that the city needs more ICU beds immediately.‘Professional bodies should set up Covid care centres’The administration has requested retired doctors who want to volunteer at Covid care centres in Chandigarh to send an email and/or call the UT health secretary or the adviser.Adviser Manoj Parida on Monday also called up professional organisations of chartered accountants, advocates and public sector undertakings to set up small Covid care centres across the city.Parida said, “Our community centres are available. Some bhawans can be used. Philanthropists can fund a few of these, meant for the poor only.” The centres, with 10 or more beds, would be run under the supervision of health workers from private or government hospitals, Parida added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-surge-hospitals-stretched-to-the-limit-in-chandigarh-101619464460523.html
27-04-2021||Mumbai||State mulls free vax shots only for poor||With four days to go for the vaccination of all adults to kick off, Maharashtra is unlikely to roll the drive out for those in the 18-44 age category in a big way from May 1, owing to challenges related to supply and lack of clarity on whether it would provide free vaccines to all. A day after Maharashtra ministers announced that the government will provide free vaccines to beneficiaries over age 18, state health minister Rajesh Tope said that it may not be possible, adding that the department will move a proposal to provide free vaccine jabs to the poor only.Maharashtra has around 53-55 million people in the 18-44 category and the cost to inoculate them is expected to be around ₹7,000 crore, according to Tope. With vaccines available in short supply, Maharashtra could kick off the drive in a staggered manner, senior government officials said. A panel of senior officials, headed by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, is working on negotiations with manufacturers, ensuring adequate and uninterrupted supply and also deciding the beneficiaries for free vaccines. Meanwhile, Tope said his department is moving a proposal for the state cabinet meeting, that is expected to be held on Tuesday or Wednesday, seeking free vaccines for the poor in the 18-44 category.Tope admitted that there are two views within ministers seeking free vaccination for all. “We have proposed that the economically backward class or the weaker sections of the society should be given free vaccinations at government hospitals. There are two views on this; some are of the opinion that 100% [of vaccines] should be given free of cost, but I do not think it is possible. The vaccination programme for 18-44 ages will require about ₹7,000 crore to ₹7,500 crore. It is not a small amount,” Tope said.Senior ministers are also saying that there is no agitation from chief minister Uddhav Thackeray over providing free vaccine shots for all. However, a final decision will be made by Wednesday and announcement is likely before the drive kicks off. On Sunday, minority affairs minister Nawab Malik announced that state will provide free vaccines. Another NCP minister Jitendra Awhad also tweeted the same. Shiv Sena minister Aaditya Thackeray, too, announced free vaccines, but later deleted the tweet. Since then, the party has tread cautiously on the topic. Sena leader and chief spokesperson of the party Sanjay Raut refused to comment on free vaccines, stating that it is the government’s decision.A senior bureaucrat said that the committee under Kunte is also looking at how to manage the funds by diverting it through other schemes. He also added that the start to the vaccination for all adults later this week is expected to remain “symbolic”. “We are still to negotiate with any of the foreign manufacturers only then we will know the cost of the inoculation. The chief minister and finance minister have both said that cost is not a hindrance as vaccination is a priority. Besides the cost, they should be able to provide adequate stock without any delay… The vaccination of 18-44 will start from May 1, but it will remain symbolic due to short supply,” the bureaucrat said requesting anonymity. They state is also preparing to handle the crowds at the centres, for it to not result in chaos or a super-spreader event, considering cases are still high across the state.Speaking about the state’s preparations for May 1, Tope said no manufacturer has committed to delivering stock so far. He said the state will procure stock of Indian companies as well as negotiate cost with foreign brands to bring it around the rates of Indian vaccines, he said. “There could be a law-and-order issue and huge queues at every centre. People want to get vaccinated now looking at the deaths, but the availability of vaccine is a real challenge. None of them [manufacturers] have vaccines now. They are offering stock after a month; that too 10 million every month, but it is very slow,” Tope said.He further added, “We will procure the vaccines available in India, similarly, we will negotiate with the foreign manufacturers, will try and bring it down Indian vaccine prices. We will need foreign vaccines as well to inoculate people faster.”The health department is also planning to procure vaccines to inoculated people the remaining citizens over age 45. Tope said the Centre is not “supporting” the pace of the inoculation state intends to. As of April 25, the state has administered first dose to over 10 million people under the category, while 923,971 people from the category have taken their second jab. Tope said, “A high number of people still remain to be vaccinated in above 45-category. The Government of India is not really supporting to the extent it should have. Our demand [for vaccine] is 800,000 daily, but they are providing 100,000 or 200,000. Many centres are kept closed or we have to function on alternative days. These are vulnerable groups; we have to ensure that they get vaccinated first and faster. “Though, this is a national programme and that Mr [prime minister Narendra] Modi has assured adequate supply for this category, but the rate is very slow. We are proposing to spend to procure vaccines for this category as well. It will expedite the programme so that they are safe. The Cabinet will consider this proposal.”Leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis said Prime Minister Narendra Modi has already announced free vaccination for all, but there is one-upmanship going on among MVA ministers. “PM has made it clear that Centre will vaccinate all eligible people free of cost. However, the states that want to carry out vaccination in an accelerated manner, they can procure vaccines from the market. There is one-upmanship going on in three ruling parties and therefore, there are such demands [of free vaccines], there are tweets on it and later being deleted. The government should prepare a proper policy as the drive will start from May 1. There is no coordination between the ministers,” Fadnavis said.Maharashtra achieved a landmark by inoculating over 500,000 beneficiaries in a day on Monday. The state is expected to go past 15-million mark soon, the state health department said. the state has vaccinated 14,342,716 beneficiaries. Maharashtra’s previous high was recorded on April 3 when it vaccinated 462,735 people in a day.An epidemiologist who is attached to PD Hinduja Hospital, Dr Lancelot Pinto, said that the Centre and State governments have to work on collaboration to achieve the feat of flattening the curve and achieve herd immunity. “India’s median age is 27, so we cannot achieve herd immunity by only focusing on the 45+ age group. We need to aggressively immunise the young population. Therefore, the governments definitely need to work closely,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-mulls-free-vax-shots-only-for-poor-101619464278801.html

The MC plans to come up with three additional sanitary landfill sites at the Dadumajra dumping ground by 2036. It is currently operating Phase 1 of the SLF, which was set up in 2007 and commissioned in 2012. The site covers 10 acres and will reach, as planned, an average height of about 10 metre. Given the large quantity of waste arrival, this phase has almost run out of capacity.The construction of the second phase of the SLF is currently being carried out at a cost of ₹17.85 crore and is expected to be completed by February 2, 2022.A Gujarat-based company, Varun Constructions, was awarded the contract for setting up the new SLF site at Dadumajra for dumping of non-recyclable solid waste. by the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL).The site, which lies next to the current dumping site in Dadumajra and the waste processing plant, will be spread over eight acres and developed over a year at a cost of around ₹12.40 crore.The MC, through CSCL, has already begun the Mining of Legacy Waste and Recovery of Land Project at the dumping ground.“The landfill is a crucial component of achieving total waste segregation in the city, in its entire cycle, from collection to processing and disposal. The site will be used specifically for dumping non-recyclable dry waste, which will neither be reused nor processed at the waste processing plant,” said a CSCL official.Scientific development of the site will ensure that no damage is caused to the environment and people living nearby are not inconvenienced. “The site will be surrounded by a 4.5m tall and 10m deep boundary wall and waste dumped there will remain covered. The site design incorporates systems that will leave no scope for seepage of water into the dumped waste or the ground beneath and no foul smell will generated,” the official added.The city’s urban and the rural areas generate about 450 metric tonne (MT) of municipal solid waste (MSW) per day, which is estimated to increase to 788 MT by 2036.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/new-sanitary-landfill-to-cost-chandigarh-mc-3-73-crore-annually-101619463799307.html

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP also claimed in the letter that the Balrampur hospital administration was not admitting patients in the hospital due to “lack of manpower” and “spoiling” the name of the chief minister by not using these ventilators for saving lives. “Instead of lying unused, these ventilators must be used for saving lives which is the need of the hour,” he further said in the letter. No official of Balrampur hospital was willing to come on record over the issue. Chief medical officer (Lucknow) Dr Sanjay Bhatnagar said, “The issue is dealt by the Balrampur hospital administration who decided utilising the resources.” In the letter, the MP also highlighted what he described as the sorry state of treatment in King George’s Medical University. The MP’s letter also said a couple of heads of department never did duty in the wards, but they were busy highlighting themselves in the media. “A number of beds are lying vacant in these departments so there is a need to do the audit of bed occupancy of the last 20 days,” he said. He also said a number of beds were lying vacant on the fourth floor of the Covid hospital in KGMU, where patients can be admitted after arranging oxygen supply for them. Meanwhile, insiders and family members patients alleged only seven of the 28 ventilators in Balrampur Hospital were operational. A resident of Golaganj, whose mother is admitted in Balrampur Hospital in a serious condition, said, “I am surprised that despite having a number of ventilators, the hospital is operating just seven of them. The patients who require ventilators are left at the mercy of God. It seems human lives have no value.” A hospital insider said, “Yes, as many as 28 ventilators arrived in the hospital last year after the onslaught of corona, but they are lying unused because no one was trained to operate them, and no one wanted to take responsibility for operating these ventilators during such testing times.” People familiar with matter said Lokbandhu Hospital had 18 ventilators but only four of them were operational because the hospital did not have the trained manpower to use these hi-tech ventilators which could save a number of lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ventilators-gathering-dust-mp-writes-to-yogi-101619462418436.html

He also appealed to the people to ensure a compliance with the Covid rules set by the government and the administration, yet again.“Extensive arrangements have been made at the administration level to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The health department is monitoring persons infected with the virus. A control room has been set up by the administration along with various helpline numbers for medical services, information related to prevention of Covid-19, and plasma donation... and an app has also been launched for patients in home isolation. A team of doctors will give them free health counselling,” said Garg, adding that there are various government portals through which the bed availability in the district or other information related to the infection can be availed.Covid-19 awareness vehicleGarg also said that a Covid-19 awareness vehicle has been travelling to urban and rural areas in the district, informing people to get vaccinated, follow night curfew, stay in their homes, wear masks, maintain social distancing, conduct sanitisation, among others.He also said that a sound system has been installed in the awareness vehicle, through which the people are provided with detailed information about Covid-19 through pre-recorded messages. These vehicles are essentially waste collection vehicles of Ecogreen, the concessionaire of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), for door-to-door collection of waste in Gurugram. Speakers are fitted on top of these vehicles that play minute-long pre-recorded audio about information on Covid-19 in urban areas and villages. The MCG launched this service in April 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-dc-appeals-to-people-to-stay-indoors-follow-covid-norms-101619461038990.html

27-04-2021||Lucknow||More offers of oxygen support come in amid Covid challenge in UP||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday called for doubling the health resources to fight Covid-19 while reiterating that oxygen supply to the state was being augmented from various sources even while the number of active cases under treatment crossed the three-lakh mark with the state recording 33,574 new cases and 249 more deaths, which was the highest single-day fatality count in Uttar Pradesh.At the same time, the total recoveries showed an upward trend, going past the eight-lakh mark with 26,719 more patients being discharged in the last 24 hours statewide, according to official data.The state’s total Covid-19 caseload stands at 11,20,176 now.Dwelling on more help on the oxygen front, the chief minister said the Tata and Reliance groups had offered to supply oxygen to UP.The officers concerned should negotiate with them to speed up the process of supply, he said at the Covid review meeting he held virtually with officials.He also asked for increasing the number of oxygen tankers and seeking help from the central government.He also told the officials to keep a close watch on all Covid-19 hospitals in the state and immediately provide them with oxygen as and when they required it.The chief minister once again noted that oxygen supply was being augmented daily with supplies from Roorkee and Kashipur (Uttarakhand), Modinagar (UP), Bokaro (Jharkhand) and the state’s MSME units.He warned the officers concerned that once the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCCC) allotted a hospital to Covid positive patients, it must be ensured that they find admissions in those hospitals, or else the officers will be held responsible and face action.“Considering the intense transmission rate of the virus this time, there is a need to increase the health resources for Covid-19 at least by double. The health department and the medical education department should prepare a work plan for increasing beds. Now, two more CHCs (community health centres) each should be added to the Covid management list in each district,” he said.Since OPDs (outpatient departments) were closed in hospitals, it was necessary to promote online consultation, publicise the lists of doctors for Covid and non-Covid consultation for the convenience of the people, he added.The chief minister asked the state health minister to monitor the supply of Covid medicine kits to home isolation patients across the state. All Covid patients in home isolation must get the kit containing medicines for at least one week, he said.“Through the CM helpline, the administration must keep in touch with the home isolation patients to track their condition,” he said.He also said many Covid recovered patients wanted to extend a helping hand.“So, encourage such people to come forward, make a list of them. There could be doctors, paramedics etc. Rope them in, they could be deployed at hospitals,” he said.He reiterated that there was no shortage of Remdesivir and other such Covid-19 drugs. Since the state was getting their supply every day, they should be provided free of cost to patients in government hospitals and at concessional rates in private hospitals, he said.Talking about vaccination, he said so far 97,83,416 people had got the first dose of the Covid vaccine and more than 20 lakh had been given both doses. Thus, a total of 1,17,83,880 doses had been administered in the state.“Prepare well for the vaccination drive that is scheduled to begin from May 1,” he said to the officers concerned.Apart from publicising the Covid safety protocols, health specialists should be engaged in spreading awareness about foods that boost immunity and techniques to increase the oxygen level in blood, the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/tata-reliance-groups-have-offered-oxygen-supply-to-up-yogi-101619459718193.html

27-04-2021||Pune||Oxygen audit: PMC rectify lacuna in five hospitals||Pune: After the Nashik tragedy, Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has found lacuna in oxygen supply system in five civic-run hospitals during the audit of oxygen tanks. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao has formed a seven-member committee to check fire audits of medical centres in Pune zilla parishad, Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations. The committee will work under the chairmanship of Pune Metropolitan Region Development Authority (PMRDA) chief executive officer (CEO) Suhas Divase, upper district collector Vijaysinha Deshmukh, Pune district chief medical officer, assistant director of town planning, PMC and PCMC fire chief officer and executive engineer of Public Works Department ( electrical division). With the rise in Covid cases, hospitals are increasing oxygen and ventilators beds which are putting extra pressure on existing systems of hospitals like electrical and fire systems. Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner said, “We are carrying out audit of the medical oxygen supply system installed at various hospitals in the city. We have given priority to PMC-run seven Covid hospitals. The audit is carried out with the help of a private agency. The problems identified are addressed immediately. We have started work to repair regulators, set up new points, tanks installations.” Dr Sanjiv Wavare, PMC assistant medical officer, said, “The seven hospitals are COEP jumbo Covid hospital, Baner Covid hospital, Dalvi hospital, Naidu hospital, Laigude hospital, Bopodi and ESIC hospital. There are no major problems as all these hospitals have installed new oxygen tanks recently.” Private hospitals responsible if they fail compliance Corporation has given instruction to private hospitals treating Covid to carry out audit of their medical infrastructure. Khemnar said, “We have issued an order to private hospitals to conduct a medical oxygen system audit. After corporation hospitals, PMC health department will cover private hospitals and the latter will be responsible for patients’ safety.” The city’s oxygen demand, according to PMC authorities, has gone up to 300 metric tonnes per day. PMC-run hospitals require 42 metric tonnes of oxygen per day and rest is to for private hospitals. Pune city has around 190 small and big hospitals treating Covid patients with allocated bed capacity of 10,991. The entire district has 475 Covid hospitals with 27,542 allocated beds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/oxygen-audit-pmc-rectify-lacuna-in-five-hospitals-101619455997788.html

27-04-2021||Pune||Drive from May 1: Second-dose beneficiaries to get priority over pvt hospitals, says PMC||Pune: Despite the Centre’s decision, those above the age of 18 years are likely to face hurdles in immediately getting the Covid vaccine dose in Pune from May 1, as the municipal corporation, according to mayor Murlidhar Mohol, may not provide vaccines to private hospitals. Hospitals have now been empowered to purchase the doses directly from manufacturers. Mohol, speaking to media on Monday after reviewing preparations for the universal vaccination programme starting from Saturday, said health officials have informed PMC that the Centre is likely to issue guidelines that the civic body need not provide vaccines to private hospitals, because the hospitals have been empowered to purchase the vaccines directly from manufacturers. “They (health department authorities) have also informed me that maybe a parallel vaccine distribution system could be put in place for which the guidelines could be made. Currently, Pune city has over 73 private hospitals and so if they get the vaccine directly from manufacturers, or the parallel system, then we could have that stock for better distribution at our centres,” said Mohol. According to the mayor, preference will be given to those slotted for their second dose. “Even though all above 18 years of age would now be eligible to get the vaccine starting from May 1, we still have a large number of people above the age of 45 years, who are currently eligible and who have not yet got their second dose, including 0.2 million senior citizens. We will prioritise the beneficiaries who are due to get their second dose.” The city had been leading in vaccinating all above the age group of 45 years who were eligible, until recently, though an irregular supply of vaccines led to a roadblock and the district could not achieve its set target of 0.1 million vaccinations lakh daily. Both leading Covid vaccine manufacturers – Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India - revealed prices for private hospitals and state governments, with Serum making it clear it may not be able to fulfil requirement of for every state on an immediate basis. PMC is awaiting guidelines on the universal vaccination drive. PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar said, “We are still awaiting government directions from the Centres on those above 18 years of age vaccination, regarding what quota would be allowed to us and about crowd management too. The guidelines say that only those registered beforehand will be allowed to get the vaccine.” Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman of the hospital board, IMA Pune chapter, said, “IMA can volunteer and purchase vaccines and then redistribute it to smaller hospitals and its members to decentralise the process. We can also volunteer to vaccinate marginalised groups like mentally or physically challenged people, or even the labour class, if the government can subsidise the cost of those vaccines. However, currently, the biggest challenge is vaccine supply. Today there is no regular supply of the vaccines for the eligible age group.” Pune city has 217 vaccinations centres. Of these, 15 government centres provide Covaxin, 104 give Covishield. Twenty-five private hospitals give Covaxin and 73 give Covishield. Pune city has vaccinated about 770,333 as of Sunday and still many more await their second dose. It has been three months since the Centre began vaccinating frontline workers (FLWs) across the country. It started from February 2. However, even as 62,257 FLWs got their first dose, only 21.8% have taken their second dose as per the PMC. Only 17,106 FLWs have taken their second dose while over 57,000 senior citizens have got their second dose. About 74% of the health care workers have got their second dose.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/second-dose-for-beneficiaries-to-be-prioritised-from-may-1-awaiting-guidelines-from-centre-pmc-101619450297192.html
27-04-2021||Noida||Rise in prices of raw materials hits Noida’s garment sector||Rising prices of raw materials and packaging items have hit the garment industry in Noida. Exports dipped from ₹20,000 crore in 2019-20 to ₹15,000 crore in 2020-21 and 20% of people employed in the sector have lost their jobs.Lalit Thukral, president of the Noida Apparel Export Cluster (NAEC), said the pandemic made the situation worse for the ready-made sector. Garment production, both for domestic market and export, was halted for four months between March and June 2020.“When the situation improved to some extent, the garment sector in Noida didn’t make enough business like it did before the pre-Covid era. As a result, during the 2020-21 fiscal, apparel exports suffered a loss of more than 25% as compared to the export figures in the previous financial year,” he said.He further said the steep rise in the price of yarn and cotton, which are part of most apparels, has made things worse. “Yarn’s price per kg increased by more than 22% for 30s combed (combed cotton is a softer version of regular cotton and more expensive), 21.3% for 34s combed and 21.9% for 40s combed during the second half of 2020-21 fiscal. Exporters enter into a price agreement with buyers at least six months before supply. Now, while the mills are increasing the prices frequently and arbitrarily, the buyers or importers are not willing to increase the prices. Besides, duty concession to competitive countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, etc. because of their Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with importing countries make the situation precarious for the Indian exporters, mainly from Noida,” he said.Thukral also said that the government has recently introduced Refund of Duties and Taxes in Export Products (RoDTEP) from January 1 this year in place of the erstwhile Refund of State and Centre Taxes and Levies (RoSCTL). “The main objective of RoDTEP is to promote the labour-intensive industry and provide a level playing field to exporters, who have been at a disadvantage on account of the FTAs enjoyed by our competitors like Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Pakistan and Vietnam. But since RoDTEP, which has reduced the refunds available for traders, does not apply to the apparel sector, our exporters are unable to competitively quote the rates to importing countries. We have requested the government to factor the RoSCTL rates in RoDTEP and release it on priority basis to provide a level-playing field to the exporters,” he said.Manoj Sahu, another exporter, said the major reason for the increase in yarn and cotton prices is due to the massive surge in the export of the raw materials. “The rise in the price of raw material has forced garment exporters to shut down their companies, resulting in large-scale unemployment and subsequently India losing export to other countries. The government should immediately call a meeting of the stakeholders associated with cotton production and apparel exports to resolve this issue and stabilize the raw material prices,” he said.He further said that the withdrawal of duty free import of trimmings and embellishments on February 1 this year has also adversely affected the apparel export business in Noida. “The scheme was a lifeline for exporters as it allowed them to import trimmings and embellishments up to 5% of export duty. We have requested the central government to not only restore but also allow duty-free import with a one-time bond facility for clearing the courier shipments as clearance of these items under a bond for each small import is very cumbersome, and causes delay and adds to the cost,” he said.Meanwhile, concerned about the possibility of a lockdown due to a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC) has urged the government to exempt factories from lockdown and requested an ‘essential service’ tag for the labour-intensive apparel export industry.A Sakhtivel, the AEPC chairman, said that to ensure uninterrupted manufacturing at factories, the council has written letters to the union ministers of health, home, textiles and commerce and industry, besides the chief ministers of some states.“The industry supports over 13 million workers directly and many more indirectly in rural and backward areas and largely comprises micro, small and medium enterprises. It will be severely impacted if the lockdown is imposed again,” said Sakhtivel.Requesting the government to exempt the apparel export industry from a lockdown and consider it as an essential service sector, the AEPC chairman also said that such lockdowns create widespread disruption and not only have short-term impacts but also affect the health of the industry in the long-term.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/rise-in-prices-of-raw-materials-hits-noida-s-garment-sector-101619115771415.html
27-04-2021||World||Iran nuclear talks resume in Vienna amid new complications||World powers resumed high-level talks in Vienna on Tuesday focused on bringing the United States back into the nuclear deal with Iran, in their first session since comments surfaced from the Iranian foreign minister alleging that Russia once tried to scupper the pact.The Russian Foreign Ministry has not responded to requests for comment on the remarks from Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif, made in a seven-hour interview with a think tank associated with the Iranian presidency that leaked over the weekend.Ahead of the main talks, Russia's top representative Mikhail Ulyanov said he'd met on the side together with officials from Iran and China, but did not mention anything about Zarif's comments.“We compared notes and exchanged views on the way ahead towards full restoration of the nuclear deal,” he tweeted. “It was a very fruitful meeting.”Following the main meeting with his counterparts from China, Germany, France, and Britain — the other parties to the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, or JCPOA — Ulyanov tweeted that they were “guided by the unity of purpose.”“Which is full restoration of the nuclear deal in its original form,” he wrote. “It was decided to expedite the process.”China’s delegate Wang Qun told reporters on his way out of the talks that discussions would continue on Wednesday.Asked in Berlin about Zarif's remarks, German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said that the talks in Vienna are “anything but easy" but have been constructive so far.“My impression from the talks is that irrespective of (how) things developed in the past, everyone seems to be working to keep the JCPOA alive,” he said.The US is not at the table because it unilaterally pulled out of the deal in 2018 under then-President Donald Trump, who restored and augmented American sanctions in a campaign of “maximum pressure” to try and force Iran into renegotiating the pact with more concessions. President Joe Biden wants to rejoin the deal, however, and there is a US delegation in Vienna taking part in indirect talks with Iran, with diplomats from the other world powers acting as go-betweens.The deal promises Iran economic incentives in exchange for curbs on its nuclear program. The reimposition of American sanctions has left the country's economy reeling, and Tehran has reacted by steadily increasing its violations of the restrictions of the deal, such as increasing the purity of uranium it enriches and its stockpiles, in a thus-far unsuccessful effort to pressure the other countries to provide relief.The ultimate goal of the deal is to prevent Iran from developing a nuclear bomb, something it insists it doesn’t want to do. Iran now has enough enriched uranium to make a bomb, but nowhere near the amount it had before the nuclear deal was signed.The comments from Zarif, who himself helped negotiate the original 2015 nuclear deal, have the potential to complicate the Vienna talks, which are currently focused on how the US would roll back its sanctions — and which ones — and how Iran would return to compliance.In the interview, reviewed by The Associated Press, Zarif describes Russia as wanting to stop the nuclear deal before it was struck under the Obama administration in 2015, suggesting Moscow wanted to keep Iran at odds with the West.Iran's Foreign Ministry has called the leak of the recording “illegal,” but hasn't disputed its authenticity.The Vienna talks began in early April, and there have been several rounds of high-level discussions, while expert groups have been working on proposals on how to resolve the issues around American sanctions and Iranian compliance, as well as the “possible sequencing” of the U.S. return.The comments from Zarif are just the latest complication that the diplomats have to deal with.Among other things, an attack suspected to have been carried out by Israel recently struck Iran’s Natanz nuclear site, causing an unknown amount of damage.Tehran retaliated by beginning to enrich a small amount of uranium up to 60% purity, its highest level ever.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-nuclear-talks-resume-in-vienna-amid-new-complications-101619542342814.html
27-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Spain to impose 10-day quarantine on travellers from India||Spain said Tuesday it will impose a 10-day quarantine on all travellers arriving from India in response to the emergence of a fast-spreading coronavirus variant in the country.The measure, which will take effect on Wednesday, will apply to people who travelled via third countries since there are no direct flights between India and Spain, government spokeswoman Maria Jesus Montero said."This is a measure which our country has already adopted towards passengers from countries where a virus variant has been found," she told a news conference following a weekly cabinet meeting.Spain has imposed a 10-day quarantine on passengers arriving from Brazil, Peru, and Colombia as well as nine nations in Africa including South Africa and Mozambique.Meanwhile, Foreign Minister Arancha Gonzalez Laya announced that Spain would later this week send more than seven tonnes of medical aid to India to help it deal with its surge in Covid-19 infections.Spain has also been hard-hit by the pandemic, recording nearly 78,000 deaths from around 3.5 million cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-spain-to-impose-10-day-quarantine-on-travellers-from-india-101619542214711.html
27-04-2021||World||France, Germany plan billions in Covid-19 pandemic recovery spending||France and Germany together laid out plans for billions in spending from the European Union's pandemic recovery fund aimed at fighting climate change and boosting the use of digital technology across the economy.The finance ministers of the EU's two biggest economies on Tuesday underlined their joint determination to use the spending to transform Europe's economy and get the continent growing again as it lags behind the US and China in rebounding from the pandemic recession.Under the fund's formula, France should get around 40 billion euros ($48 billion) while German Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said his country planned about 30 billion euros ($36 billion) in spending. Scholz said that half the money would go to environmentally friendly projects and a quarter to spreading the use of digital technology. He said the fund would build on domestic relief and stimulus measures already passed by the German governmentHe called the fund “a groundbreaking step for Europe.”French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire urged the European Commission, the EU’s executive branch, to quickly evaluate the plans so that money can start flowing to members states from the 750 billion euro ($906 billion) fund as early as July, noting that the U.S. and China have recovered faster. He said that since the fund was approved “we have lost too much time” and that “Europe must remain in the race.” Last year, France’s economy shrank by 8.3% amid the virus crisis, the worst slump since World War II, according to national statistics institute INSEE.They said the new spending, funded by shared debt, would avoid mistakes made in the wake of the 2008-2009 global financial crisis and recession, when countries focused excessively on cutting spending and closing deficits. Le Maire said “today the priority is clearly to invest massively, not to consolidate public finances. We have drawn lessons from the past.”Spain’s Cabinet also approved its proposal for how it wants to invest the recovery funds. Spain, which has suffered heavily from the pandemic, is set to receive 140 billion euros ($166 billion) — half in direct payments and the other half in loans — from the EU's recovery plan, second only to Italy. In line with EU priorities, Spain’s left-wing government has placed a heavy emphasis on creating a greener economy while boosting productivity for an economy that shrunk by 11% last year.The money comes with pressure from Brussels to address problems identified by the European Commission's review of members states' economic policies. Spain, for instance, is being asked to overhaul labor laws, tax practices and pensions. Countries with low tax regimes such as Ireland or Cyprus are under pressure to discourage aggressive tax planning by multinational companies.Italy's 221.1 billion euro ($267.3 billion) recovery plan includes steps to reduce its backlog of court cases, considered a drag on businesses that can't get commercial disputes resolved quickly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-germany-plan-billions-in-covid-19-pandemic-recovery-spending-101619537352999.html
27-04-2021||World||Fully vaccinated Americans can go unmasked outdoors, CDC says||Fully-vaccinated Americans can be unmasked when exercising, dining and socializing outdoors in small groups, federal health officials said, and can gather indoors with other fully vaccinated people and family members without masks or social distancing.But masks should remain on anywhere there’s a large gathering, including ballparks, malls or church, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Tuesday. And the agency urged that vaccinated people be mindful around those with a higher risk for severe illness.“Today is another day we can take a step back to the normalcy of before,” Rochelle Walensky, the CDC chief, said at a news briefing announcing the changes. She cited a “really hopeful decline” of about 21% in the 7-day average for cases.The new recommendations, which represent one of the most significant relaxations of guidelines since the pandemic began, are complex and wide-ranging. They come with almost 30% of Americans fully inoculated and with increases in the daily Covid-19 caseload starting to slow. Many public-health experts have advocated the change, saying it follows the science.Under the new rules, fully vaccinated people can attend a small outdoor gathering maskless or dine at an outdoor restaurant with others, whether they’re fully vaccinated or not. They can also get together indoors with unvaccinated people of any age from one other household without masks or social distancing, according to the agency.Additionally, inoculated Americans don’t need to be isolated or get tested if they’ve been around someone with Covid-19, unless they have symptoms. If so, get tested and stay home, the agency urges.But the guidance also includes some reservations.The CDC urges all Americans to wear masks when attending medium or large-size gatherings, such as live performances or sporting events, and during visits to malls and full-capacity places of worship. And the agency encourages people to be mindful when around those with an increased risk for severe illness from Covid-19, including those with diabetes and some types of cancer, lung or kidney disease.“You will still need to follow guidance at your workplace,” the CDC said, adding that the fully vaccinated “should continue to follow guidance to protect themselves and others, including wearing a well-fitted mask, when indoors or in an outdoor setting or venue where masks are required.”You’re considered fully vaccinated two weeks after receiving the final vaccine dose of the two-dose vaccines made by Pfizer Inc.-BioNTech SE and Moderna Inc., or a single dose of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine.It’s long been understood that indoor environments present the highest risk of virus transmission. SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, spreads largely through aerosolized viral particles. The size of a space, how many people are in it, length of exposure and air circulation all factor into how easily viral particles might spread.Infection OddsThe odds of infection are much smaller in outdoor settings, but numerous factors, such as social distancing, vaccination status and duration of face-to-face exposure can play a role in determining the likelihood of transmission.In recent weeks, a growing chorus of public-health advocates and medical experts have been calling for the US to relax its rules on outdoor masking.Earlier this month, the New England Journal of Medicine published a blog questioning whether it’s time to do away with such mandates written by Paul Sax, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.Follow the ScienceFormer Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb wrote in an opinion piece in The Wall Street Journal on Monday that the Biden administration should end outdoor mask edicts.“I think it’s best when public health mandates come out that they really follow the science,” he said. “Transmission doesn’t happen when people are outdoors by themselves walking around.” He still recommends wearing masks outdoors if you’re not vaccinated, having a face-to-face conversation with someone you don’t know, or in a crowded place.“For awhile, the mask outdoors has been more a marker of supporting public health,” he said. “Covid isn’t going away any time soon, so we have to find ways we can live with it more easily. Not wearing masks when you are outdoors by yourself could be one thing that could help with that.”However, other health experts say outdoor mask wearing can contribute to a sense of social solidarity in combating the virus, and are a visual reminder of the need for caution even as vaccinations increase and illness recedes.“There’s no clear rule that can be applied,” said Krystal Pollitt, an assistant professor of epidemiology at the Yale School of Public Health. “There are so many things to take into consideration to best evaluate risk. We still need to be vigilant.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fully-vaccinated-americans-can-go-unmasked-outdoors-cdc-says-101619541634561.html

27-04-2021||World||Russian court restricts activities of Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's anti-corruption foundation||A court in Moscow ruled Tuesday to restrict the activities of an organization founded by imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny pending a decision on whether it should be outlawed as an extremist group.The Moscow City Court's ruling on Navalny's Foundation for Fighting Corruption came amid a sweeping crackdown on Russian President Vladimir Putin most prominent critic, his allies and his political infrastructure.The Moscow prosecutor’s office petitioned the court this month to label the foundation and Navalny's network of regional offices as extremist groups and effectively outlaw their activities, exposing members and supporters to lengthy prison terms.If the court grants the request, it would be a crippling blow to Navalny's beleaguered team. He has been in prison since January, and many of his aides and associates were arrested or face criminal charges.On Monday, the prosecutor's office ordered Navalny's offices in dozens of Russian regions to suspend their activities, prompting them to effectively shut down. The Tuesday ruling on the foundation just barred it from performing certain activities.Ivan Pavlov, a lawyer representing the foundation, said the organization is no longer allowed to use the media or the internet to distribute content or to organize rallies and public events, take part in elections or use bank deposits.Restrictions on the foundation, however, will not disrupt its work, director Ivan Zhdanov said on social media, arguing that most of the restrictions don't apply to the anti-corruption organization's activities.“Some nonsense,” Zhdanov tweeted. “(These) aren't going to influence our work in any way.”Navalny’s foundation opened 10 years ago and has since targeted high-ranking Russian officials with exposes on corruption, many in the form of colorful and widely watched YouTube videos.One of its latest posts, which has received 116 million views, alleges that a lavish palace on the Black Sea shore was built for Putin through an elaborate corruption scheme. The Kremlin has denied there are any links to Putin. TheAlong with the foundation, Navalny set up a vast network of regional offices in dozens of Russian regions when he was campaigning to run against Putin in the 2018 presidential election. He eventually was barred from running but kept the infrastructure in place.The regional sites began their own investigations of graft by local officials and recruited activists, some of whom later ran for public offices themselves. The locations also were instrumental in organizing nationwide rallies in support of Navalny this year.Navalny himself was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin — accusations that Russian officials reject.The arrest triggered protests across Russia that proved to be the biggest show of defiance in years. However, they didn’t stop authorities from putting Navalny on trial for violating the terms of a suspended sentence while he was in Germany. The sentence stemmed from a 2014 embezzlement conviction widely that Navalny has characterized as politically motivated. He was ordered to serve 2½ years in prison and last month was transferred to a penal colony notorious for its harsh conditions.The foundation and the regional offices have been targeted regularly with raids, fines and detentions of activists before, but the extremism petition takes the pressure to a new level, Navalny's allies have said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-court-restricts-activities-of-navalny-s-anti-corruption-foundation-101619528207576.html

27-04-2021||World||Full Covid-19 lockdown adds to financial strain in Turkey||As cases and deaths soar, Turkey’s president has instructed people to stay home for nearly three weeks and shut down many businesses as part of the country's strictest Covid-19 measures yet.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan did not announce a stimulus package to offset the economic impact of the new restrictions. With Turkey's double digit inflation, sinking national currency and businesses in trouble, many Turks already have been struggling financially.Gozde Aslan, a newspaper seller in Istanbul, said the lockdown would be difficult to weather.“We have to bring food to our homes, and we live in a period where everything is very expensive,” she said. “May God help us.”Erdogan announced Monday that a “full lockdown” would begin Thursday and last until May 17. Residents will be required to stay home except for grocery shopping and other essential needs, while intercity travel only will be allowed with permission. Restaurants are allowed to deliver food.Some businesses and industries will be exempt from the shutdown, including factories, agriculture, health care and supply chain and logistics companies. The Interior Ministry also published a list of exempt individuals, who include parliament members, health care workers, law enforcement officers and many others.Aslan’s husband and business partner, Baris, said the Turkish government's decision came late but was correct. He added: “It’s a very difficult decision for the shopkeepers, for the working people. For this, the state should provide great assistance.”Earlier this month, Erdogan announced an extension of short labor payments for registered workers whose hours were cut due to pandemic restrictions. Some payments previously were made to small businesses.Shoe store manager Burcin Yilmaz lamented that he would again have to shut his business. During the past three months, several baerby shops that had been open a long time shut down for good, he said..“We have to close down and wait and see what happens in the end,” Yilmaz said.Erdogan said daily confirmed cases would have to rapidly drop below 5,000 for Turkey “to not be left behind” as many European countries start reopening."Otherwise, we will inevitably face a heavy price in every area, from tourism to trade and education,” the president said.Opposition lawmakers blasted the government Tuesday. The leader of the main opposition party, Kemal Kilicdaroglu, called on Erdogan to propose a social aid package that would help closed businesses and day laborers in Turkey’s informal economies. He also said urged the suspension of debt enforcement proceedings for some time.While agreeing with the necessity of a lockdown, Kilicdaroglu said, “People need to eat. They need to live.”The government has been distributing tons of onions and potatoes this month with much fanfare. Many see it as a clear example of how much Turks are suffering from rising food prices and poverty. The World Bank, in a report published Tuesday, said Turkey's poverty levels rose from 10.2 percent in 2019 to 12.2 percent in 2020.In March, the Turkish government split the country into four risk tiers and lifted weekend curfews and allowed indoor dining in many provinces. Coronavirus infections rose again before long, putting most Turkish cities into “very high-risk” categories.Facing record numbers of confirmed cases, Erdogan in mid-April announced a partial lockdown during the month of Ramadan, bringing back weekend curfews, extending evening curfew hours and closing down restaurants for in-person dining.Confirmed cases averaged around 60,000 per day during the peak week this month. The country recorded its highest daily death toll on April 21, with 362.The latest Health Ministry statistics reported Monday showed 37,312 new confirmed cases and 353 deaths. Turkey's total death toll in the pandemic stands at 38,711.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/full-covid-19-lockdown-adds-to-financial-strain-in-turkey-101619525046579.html
27-04-2021||World||Iran orders probe into leaked Zarif audio 'conspiracy'||Iran's president has ordered a probe into the "conspiracy" of leaked audio in which the foreign minister says the military was too influential in diplomacy, a government spokesman announced Tuesday.President Hassan Rouhani ordered the investigation to identify who leaked the "stolen" three-hour-long recording by top diplomat and member of his moderate government Mohammad Javad Zarif, the spokesman said.The tape, which comes ahead of presidential elections in June, has dominated the discussion in the Islamic republic since its publication by media outlets outside Iran on Sunday."We believe this theft of documents is a conspiracy against the government, the system, the integrity of effective domestic institutions, and also against our national interests," government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters."The president has ordered the intelligence ministry to identify the agents of this conspiracy," he added.The file was "stolen for clear reasons", he said, without elaborating further.Foreign ministry spokesman Saeed Khatibzadeh did not deny the authenticity of the recording but said on Monday that it was cut from a seven-hour interview that included "personal opinions".Zarif did not comment on the controversy, but published on Tuesday a brief audio message on Instagram, saying "I believe you should not work for history... I say that don't worry about history so much, but worry about God and the people".He did not specify when he recorded this message.The leaked remarks sparked harsh criticism from conservative media and politicians, with the mention of Iran's slain general Qasem Soleimani hitting a nerve.Soleimani, considered one of the prominent architects of Iranian regional policy, was killed early last year in an American drone strike in Baghdad, ordered by former US president Donald Trump.The leak and probe come ahead of presidential elections on June 18, which will see the moderate Rouhani step down after two terms in office and after conservatives fared well in parliamentary elections last year.'Character assassination'The ultra-conservative Vatan-e Emrooz newspaper published a large black and white picture of Zarif on its front page, with the headline "Despicable" written in red."Diplomacy must follow the path of increasing the system's power," it said, criticising Zarif's comments regarding the military.It added that his stance confirmed that "America's constant demand about negotiating Iran's regional power and missile capabilities" stemmed from Iranian diplomats' "wishes and cooperation with this demand".Javan daily said Soleimani was "physically assassinated (upon) the order of the most wretched creature of the world... America's president".But Zarif had "assassinated (Soleimani's) character".Ultra-conservative Kayhan daily inferred that the audio may have been leaked by Rouhani's government to force "Zarif into (political) suicide" in a bid to save itself from the judgement of "public opinion".It said Zarif, while being "sacrificed like a simple pawn", had broken rules of "confidentiality" and provided Iran's enemies with "intelligence and ammunition" for their psychological war against the country.For their part, the reformist papers sought to question which faction stood to gain from the leak.Shargh daily on its front page wrote "Who leaked it, who benefited?"||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-orders-probe-into-leaked-zarif-audio-conspiracy-101619520977150.html

Apple will have the chance to argue its case against any EU suspicions before regulators take a final decision. The EU is also probing Apple over e-books and payments.Spotify complained in 2019 that Apple unfairly squeezes its music streaming service with ever-changing rules and a large sales commission on the app store. It has said it was forced to “artificially” increase monthly subscriptions for its premium service to cover the extra costs.Apple’s regulatory woes have intensified in recent months as software developers criticize the the levies Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google charge outside developers for using their digital distribution platforms. App executives urged the U.S. Senate last week to tackle Apple’s control over the App Store.Apple declined to comment on the EU probe, referring to a 2019 blog post where it said Spotify was trying to keep “substantial revenue that they draw from the App Store’s customers without making any contributions to that marketplace.”The European Commission also declined to comment and Spotify didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.The Financial Times reported earlier on the EU’s complaint against Apple.The EU is separately fighting Apple’s victory in a 13 billion-euro ($15.7 billion) tax dispute, in an effort to restore a landmark decision that took aim at Apple’s taxation structure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apple-set-to-get-eu-antitrust-complaint-over-spotify-101619519432174.html
27-04-2021||World||Myanmar’s junta rebuffs Asean plan to end violence||Myanmar’s military government rebuffed a plan by Southeast Asian leaders to help end violence in the country, saying any “suggestions” would need to fit with the junta’s stated roadmap and come after “stability” is restored.Leaders of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, including coup chief Min Aung Hlaing, appeared to reach a five-point “consensus” on Myanmar during a special summit in Jakarta on Saturday that included an “immediate cessation of violence” following the military takeover on Feb. 1. It also said the bloc would appoint an envoy to mediate talks between “all parties” in Myanmar.But in a press release on Monday, the military’s State Administration Council only said the “suggestions” made by Asean leaders “would be positively considered” if they facilitate the junta’s own platform and “served the interest of the country.”“Myanmar informed the meeting that it will give careful consideration to constructive suggestions made by Asean leaders when the situation returns to stability in the country since priorities at the moment were to maintain law and order and to restore community peace and tranquility,” the junta said in the release, which was also presented to the Asean Secretariat in Jakarta.The Myanmar statement lowers expectations that the dialogue process will prompt the military to release Aung San Suu Kyi and other detained civilian leaders, or alter a plan to hold a fresh election in early 2022 following a yearlong period of emergency rule. The move to appoint a special envoy is unusual for Asean, which traditionally has avoided direct interventions into domestic political disputes, and had been welcomed by Myanmar’s opposition.Armed AttackOn Tuesday, an armed ethnic group in Myanmar known as the Karen National Liberation Army seized a military outpost near the Thai border in a sign civil conflict will continue even as the junta pledged over the weekend to end the violence.The KNLA, the armed wing of Karen National Union (KNU), -- the oldest ethnic armed group in Myanmar -- attacked a military border post in Thaw Le Hta near Thailand’s northwestern town of Mae Hong Song, resulting in several casualties, Saw Taw Nee, head of KNU’s Foreign Affairs Department, said by phone Tuesday.Since overthrowing the civilian-led government, the junta has killed more than 750 protesters throughout the country with nearly 3,500 others detained or sentenced to prison, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners.There was no immediate comment on Tuesday’s attack from the Myanmar military.Saw Taw Nee said more than 30,000 residents have fled to safe zones since the national army, or Tatmadaw, conducted deadly air strikes in March. At the time, fighter jets came out in retaliation for an attack by the group on a military base in which 10 soldiers were killed and another eight were captured.Earlier this month, close allies of Myanmar’s detained civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi joined with ethnic groups to form a new unity government, escalating the chances of a prolonged conflict with the junta. As part of its formation, members were also pushing for the formation of a union army to take on the military. Saw Taw Nee said at the time that such an army is “essential,” though it would take time as negotiations are ongoing.“The junta is making people live with fear in the mainland as well as in KNU-controlled areas,” he said. “We, the KNU, accept forming the federal army in principle, but it is not realistic it will be formed in a short period of time.”“Only when the rights we are asking for can be guaranteed will the federal army become a reality,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmars-junta-rebuffs-asean-plan-to-end-violence-101619518564046.html

He said that each of these generators will enhance the capacities of the hospitals by allowing them to produce oxygen for 10 years from ambient air.The French president in Facebook post said that France is aware of India's situation and said that both countries will remain united in these times of crisis. "No one is untouched by the pandemic which we are going through. We know that India is going through a difficult period. France and India have always been united. We remain united to provide our help. France will send medical equipment, ventilators and 8 oxygen generators to India. Each generator will make a hospital self-sufficient for 10 years by producing oxygen from ambient air," Macron said in his post.He also said that solidarity is one of the core principles of France and remains at the center of friendship between both nation. "Solidarity is at the center of our nation. This is also at the center of friendship between our countries. Together we will win," he further added. Macron assured that French ministries are working with several industries to meet India's needs.Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to US president Joe Biden and discussed procurement of materials required for manufacturing and production of vaccines. The United Kingdom, Ireland, Germany and Australia will also send oxygen production plant and ventilators to help India's hospitals which are facing a hue crisis due to surge in cases. China, Taiwan and Pakistan have also expressed solidarity with India in its fight against Covid-19. India recorded 323,144 cases on Tuesday which pushed the countries tally to 17,636,307.

27-04-2021||World||Hong Kong to reopen bars, nightclubs for vaccinated residents||Hong Kong will ease social-distancing restrictions by allowing bars, nightclubs and karaoke parlors to re-open and operate past midnight only for vaccinated residents starting Thursday, as the government intensifies efforts to boost the city’s lackluster inoculation drive.Staff and customers must have had received at least a first vaccine dose for the venues to open their doors, Food and Health Secretary Sophia Chan told a briefing on Tuesday. Patrons will need to sign in using Hong Kong’s LeaveHomeSafe app.The new rules will allow bars and nightclubs to remain open until 2am, she said. Tables will be limited to just two people, with four people allowed in karaoke rooms.The government is also studying a new mobile app venues can use identify customers’ vaccination status, Chan said.“This vaccine bubble is a very important public health measure,” Chan said. “We can have a safe relaxation. But on the other hand, we can also mitigate the risk associated with the relaxation.”While vaccine supply is abundant in Hong Kong, only about 11% of the population has gotten vaccinated with at least one dose, amid public distrust of the government and concerns about the efficacy of Chinese vaccines. The low inoculation rates could hamper the city’s efforts to reach the herd immunity crucial to fully reopening, prompting authorities to expand access to all adults and come up with measures favoring the inoculated to encourage more people to get jabs.Restaurants will also be allowed to relax table limits and operating hours if staff are vaccinated, said Chan, but only in designated “zones” for inoculated customers.Measures will be further relaxed for restaurants whose staff have had both vaccine doses and a waiting period afterward of 14 days, Chan said.Capacity at companies’ annual general meetings with shareholders will also be relaxed to 50 people at indoor venues and 100 people at outdoor sites, Chan said. Participants aged 16 and above have to have completed their first vaccine doses, she said.Pubs have been ordered shut since November but some have managed to operate until 10 p.m. by getting a license to serve food, while nightclubs have stayed closed. The ease in measures for those vaccinated comes after Hong Kong announced its long-awaited plans to introduce a quarantine-free travel bubble with Singapore next month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hong-kong-to-reopen-bars-nightclubs-for-vaccinated-residents-101619513225791.html

The changes represent a step toward normality for Washington, DC, residents and long-term hope for the city's vital tourism and convention industry, which has been devastated by the pandemic.Mayor Muriel Bowser announced Monday that starting on May 1, gyms and fitness centers can operate at 50 per cent capacity, and live music will be permitted in gardens and outdoor spaces. Restaurants will be permitted to seat 10 people per table outdoors, up from the previous limit of six per table. However, the 25 per cent capacity limit for indoor dining will remain unchanged for now. Retail businesses can increase admittance from 25 per cent to 50 per cent capacity. Houses of worship can increase to 40 per cent capacity, though Bowser said the government was still encouraging residents to attend virtual or outdoor services for now.Earlier in April, Bowser had announced some other changes that will also take effect in May. These include allowing entertainment venues like concert halls and movie theaters to increase to 25 per cent capacity and allowing public pools to open this summer at 50 per cent capacity. The Smithsonian network of museums had previously announced that several museums and the National Zoo will reopen on a staggered schedule over several weeks during the month of May. The National Air and Space Museum's Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Virginia, will reopen on May 5. The National Museum of African American History and Culture, National Portrait Gallery, Smithsonian American Art Museum and Renwick Gallery will reopen on May 14. The National Museum of American History, National Museum of the American Indian and the National Zoo will reopen on May 21.All Smithsonian facilities will required timed entry passes to limit the crowds; the passes are free and available from the Smithsonian website. As of Monday, Washington's daily infection rate has dropped to 14 cases per 100,000, the lowest number since last fall. But Bowser still preached caution, saying residents needed to remain patient as the vaccination programme continued. “The way we get open is to crush the virus and get people vaccinated,” she said. “So we're trying to do all of those things — moderate the restrictions where they're warranted and safe, but really focus on crushing those numbers of infections and getting people vaccinated.” Bowser said that approximately 237,000 residents had received at least one vaccine dose, out of about 500,000 adults in the District of Columbia. The government will also begin offering vaccinations to residents as young as 16, she said. City Health Director Dr. LaQuandra Nesbitt acknowledged that vaccine reluctance remained an issue, but called on residents to encourage skeptical friends and relatives to take the step. “It's time for people to start having talks with their friends and say, Hey, we're not hanging out with you unless you get vaccinated,'” Nesbitt said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-dc-to-loosen-covid-19-restrictions-this-weekend-amid-fall-in-cases-101619512887388.html

27-04-2021||World||PLA sets up army, air force joint defence system in western theatre command||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has for the first time inducted the army’s air defence units in its air force command chain in a region that borders India to form a combined air defence system.The new joint system is part of the western theatre command’s (WTC) focus on war preparation and exploration of the establishment of a joint air defence system, the PLA’s mouthpiece PLA Daily reported on Tuesday.The WTC is responsible for the border with India and continues large-scale deployment in the region - despite partial disengagement - amid the year-long border friction with India in eastern Ladakh.The mouthpiece called the new formation “a solid step… taken in the joint combat and joint training”.The new system was tried out at a drill in the western theatre, the report said without sharing details of the location.The high-level exercise was a drill for checking combat readiness of the army’s air defence forces, but the orders, during the drill, were given by the PLA air force command stationed in the area - a likely first for the PLA.According to a senior officer of the Air Force dtaff headquarters of the WTC, more than 10 army air defence force units have entered the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) command chain in WTC to share early warning information, to test combat readiness, to participate in major exercises, and to form a “preliminary alliance”.“The integration of air defence across services and arms is a solid step to deepen joint operations,” the PLA Daily article said.The WTC’s air force took the initiative to implement joint operations and organised troops from ground defence, radar and communications to “work together with army commanders to tackle key problems, unify information interfaces, and formulate relevant standards and specifications”.The formation of the joint command is in line with a military training order issued by President Xi Jinping, who also heads the Central Military Commission (CMC), in January.The order said that military training this year will focus on actual combat training to raise combat readiness, joint command and joint specialised training, new equipment and force training, and operational system of systems integration training.Xi had then said the PLA must be ready to “act at any second” as the armed forces had kicked off the year’s military training and drills in January.“(The PLA must) increase the integration of new equipment, new forces and new combat realms into training and combat systems,” Xi was quoted in reports as saying.Following the formation of the new system, the changes in training modules have enabled the joint combat and joint training at all levels to be launched and improved simultaneously, Tuesday’s PLA Daily article said.In the final analysis, whether an army can win modern wars is determined by the level and effectiveness of joint training, it added.Last week, state media reported the PLA had deployed advanced rocket launchers with an artillery brigade stationed above 17,000 feet in the WTC.The front-page article published in PLA Daily said the brigade is located 5,200m above sea level in the Xinjiang region, but did not share the exact location.India and China have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the nearly year-long friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The 10th meeting of senior military commanders was held on February 20 after the two sides completed the withdrawal of frontline troops with armoured formations and artillery from the banks of Pangong Lake.But the two sides were unable to make progress on efforts to disengage from other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains.The 11th round of military talks held on April 9 failed to resolve the differences.At the end of the talks, Beijing said the Chinese military will maintain diplomatic communication with its Indian counterpart to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the border region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pla-sets-up-army-and-air-force-joint-defence-system-in-western-theatre-101619510485306.html
27-04-2021||World||US Senate delays bill to strengthen competition with China||A cornerstone of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer’s legislative package to make the U.S. a stronger competitor against China may be delayed as a key committee postponed consideration of the bill.“It needs some time for consensus to build,” Senator Roger Wicker of Mississippi, the top Republican on the Commerce Committee, said on Monday. He added that the panel would likely take up the legislation, called the Endless Frontier Act, after the Senate returns in May from a recess.Wicker said more than 200 amendments had been filed. In addition to the complications that would come with dealing with such a large number of proposed changes and additions, some Republican senators had concerns about the substance of the legislation, according to a person familiar with the matter.Congressional Republicans have expressed wariness over the proposal’s cost.The delay would set back Schumer’s plan for quick action on the measure. The committee’s chair, Maria Cantwell, a Washington State Democrat, put off work on the bill. She did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Monday evening.The delay could also affect funding for increased U.S. production of semiconductors amid a global shortage. Senator John Cornyn, a Texas Republican, is planning to push for the Endless Frontier Act to include money for his CHIPS for America legislation, according to a person familiar with the matter. The bill became law earlier this year but was never funded. President Joe Biden has called for as much as $50 billion for the initiative.The legislation, which was introduced by Schumer and Senator Todd Young, an Indiana Republican, would allocate $100 billion over five years to bolster U.S. research and development to counter China. It would also provide $10 billion to establish regional innovation hubs -- a provision intended to shore up support for the bill among lawmakers from across the country.With both parties showing an increasing willingness to confront China economically, there are no shortage of proposals for how to best do that. But the huge number of amendments may in and of itself proved to be too much to resolve before the bill was scheduled to be put together on Wednesday.The Senate is scheduled to be out next week and return the week of May 10.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senate-delays-bill-to-strengthen-competition-with-china-101619480325061.html
27-04-2021||World||Washington DC police hit by 'extortion' attack, FBI to probe 'unauthorised access'||The Washington, D.C., police department said Monday that its computer network was breached, and a Russian-speaking ransomware syndicate claimed to have stolen sensitive data, including on informants, that it threatened to share with local criminal gangs unless police paid an unspecified ransom.The cybercriminals posted screenshots on their dark web site supporting their claim to have stolen more than 250 gigabytes of data.The District of Columbia's Metropolitan Police Department said in a statement that it had asked the FBI to investigate the “unauthorized access.” There was no indication that any police operations were affected, and the department did not immediately say whether it had been hit by ransomware.The Babuk group, a relatively new ransomware gang, said on its website that it had “downloaded a sufficient amount of information from your internal networks” and gave the police three days to contact it or "we will start to contact gangs in order to drain the informants."Screenshots it posted suggested it has data from at least four computers, including intelligence reports, information on gang conflicts, the jail census and other administrative files. One of the images, apparently of network locations accessed by the criminals, showed a text document on one computer entitled “How To Restore Your Files.”Such documents generally include instructions on how to contact the ransomware criminals, whose standard operating procedure is to exfiltrate sensitive data from networks they infiltrate as they sow malware that, once activated, encrypts data. Only after receiving payment do the criminals provide software keys that unscramble the data.So far this year, 26 government agencies in the U.S. have been hit by ransomware, with cybercriminals releasing online data stolen from 16 of them, said ransomware analyst Brett Callow of the cybersecurity firm Emsisoft. Ransomware victims don’t always pay, often preferring the arduous task of rebuilding networks from backups.The D.C. police department said it was taking the threat seriously.“We are aware of unauthorized access on our server. While we determine the full impact and continue to review activity, we have engaged the FBI to fully investigate this matter,” the department statement said. An FBI spokeswoman had no immediate comment.A worsening global epidemic of ransomware attacks is considered a national security threat by many, doing tens of billions of dollars in damage. U.S. law enforcement is relatively powerless to counteract it as most of the criminals enjoy safe harbor in Russia and other nations with weak rule of law.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/washington-dc-police-hit-by-extortion-attack-fbi-to-probe-unauthorised-access-101619504639348.html

A total of 11 Indians were among the dead.“The attackers died but the police attention was on those who motivated them," Rohana said.He said a total of 702 persons were in custody with 202 of them being remanded. 83 more are being detained for questioning at the police’s CID and the Terrorism Investigation Division.Rishad's lawyers claimed that the arrest was politically motivated as the special presidential panel to probe the Easter Sunday attack had not named them for aiding and abetting Islamic extremists.Nine suicide bombers, belonging to local Islamist extremist group National Thawheed Jamaat (NTJ) linked to ISIS, carried out a series of blasts that tore through three churches and as many luxury hotels in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday on April 21, 2019.In May last year, Riyaj was arrested for making contacts with suicide bombers and given bail in October. Rishad was arrested in October and given bail in November over the misappropriation of state resources.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/easter-sunday-attacks-former-sri-lankan-minister-brother-to-be-detained-for-90-days-101619504169295.html
27-04-2021||World||China’s industrial profits surge as economy booms, prices rise||Profits at Chinese industrial firms soared in March, supported by a booming economy and rising factory gate prices, as well as statistical distortions from last year’s low base of comparison.Industrial profits climbed 92.3% in March from a year ago, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday, retreating from the dramatic increase of 179% in the first two months of the year, but still outpacing the 20.1% gain in December.The statistics bureau said the steady recovery was partly due to faster production and sales, but warned of a number of risks clouding the outlook.“There are still greater uncertainties in the global epidemic developments and the international environment, and the recovery between industries is still uneven,” Zhu Hong, an economist with the bureau, said in a statement. Rising commodity prices are also pushing up costs for businesses, she said.The economy posted record growth in the first quarter, with signs of a more balanced recovery underway. Growth in industrial production remained solid in March, though the pace moderated from previous months. Producer prices climbed in the month by the most since July 2018, boding well for profits.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-industrial-profits-surge-as-economy-booms-prices-rise-101619491955428.html

27-04-2021||World||China announces measures to prevent foreign spying in companies||China’s top spy agency announced measures to fight infiltration by “hostile forces” in companies and other institutions, state media said, in the latest sign of businesses getting caught in the competition between Beijing and Washington.The new rules allow Chinese security authorities to draw up lists of companies and organizations considered susceptible to foreign infiltration and require them to take security measures, the official Xinhua News Agency said Monday, citing a senior official with the Ministry of State Security.“Overseas espionage and intelligence agencies and hostile forces have intensified infiltration into China, and broadened their tactics of stealing secrets in various ways and in more fields, which poses a serious threat to China’s national security and interests,” Xinhua said.The rules were issued amid increasingly tense relations between China and the West, as Washington seeks to counter Beijing’s increasing economic and security clout. The powerful Ministry of State Security has played a central role in that struggle, most obviously with its high-profile detentions of foreign citizens such as Canadians Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who are awaiting verdicts after spying trials.State-owned enterprises have been increasing counterintelligence supervision on personnel traveling overseas since at least 2019, the Global Times newspaper reported separately Monday, citing an unidentified staff member in charge of foreign affairs at the headquarters of a central SOE in Beijing.Five Eyes“Staff going on business trips to foreign countries, such as countries of the Five Eyes alliance -- the U.S., U.K., Australia, Canada and New Zealand -- have been told to strictly report their travel destinations, agendas, and meetings with foreign personnel, and they must get approval from their direct superiors before the applications are reviewed by the headquarters,” the person was quoted as saying.The enterprise has also strengthened pre-departure anti-spying education through seminars and short movies, where cases of foreign intelligence work are shown, the state enterprise staff told the newspaper. The company has required staff “involved in sensitive fields or those holding important files” to leave their devices such as mobile phones, laptops, and USB drives at home before going abroad.“For visits to countries that have been categorized as high-risk in terms of spying activities, we will evaluate if the trips are necessary and would advise against going if they are not essential,” the staff member was quoted as saying.The regulation didn’t specify which industries or companies would be on the list, but it said the list will be drawn up based on the level of confidentiality that the industry involves, the degree of foreign involvement and whether there have been previous incidents that endangered national security, according to the Global Times.To carry out anti-espionage missions and eliminate the hidden dangers of foreign espionage, the regulation also gives national security organs access to buildings, internal materials, electronic kits, facilities, or computers and information systems of the companies involved, the report said.China’s state security authorities will make further efforts to “organize and mobilize all social forces to jointly prevent and curb espionage activities and other acts hurting national security to strengthen the national security shield,” Xinhua said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-announces-measures-to-prevent-foreign-spying-in-companies-101619489881355.html

27-04-2021||World||Covid-19: USTR holds talks with Pfizer, Astrazeneca over increased vaccine production, IP rights waiver||United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai has held a virtual meeting with AstraZeneca and Pfizer leadership to discuss increasing vaccine production and a proposed waiver to certain provisions of the WTO's agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) for the Covid-19 pandemic.The United States so far has remained non-committal on the World Trade Organization's (WTO) move of India and South Africa over this.The White House on Monday told reporters that no decision has been made yet, even as top American lawmakers urged the Biden administration to support the move at WTO to provide TRIPS waiver to Covid-19 vaccines."As the US approaches vaccinating our population, we cannot simply stand by as over a 100 countries struggle to vaccinate theirs. We must push Pfizer and Moderna to offer licensing to the rest of the world so they can develop vaccines and advocate a trips waiver at the WTO," Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna told PTI.Reiterating that the Biden-Harris administration’s top priority is saving lives and ending the pandemic here at home and around the world, Tai expressed her deep sympathy for the people of India.She highlighted the announcement that the United States was examining options to share AstraZeneca vaccine doses with other countries as they become available, an official statement said.Tai's meeting was with Dr Ruud Dobber, executive vice-president of the biopharmaceuticals business unit and head of the US business at AstraZeneca.She had a separate meeting with Dr Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer."Ambassador Tai and Dr Dobber discussed increasing vaccine production, global health issues and the proposed waiver to certain provisions of the WTO's Agreement on TRIPS for the Covid-19 pandemic," the USTR said in a readout of the meeting.“United States Trade Representative Katherine Tai today (Monday) met virtually with Dr Albert Bourla, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer, to discuss increasing vaccine production, global health issues and the proposed waiver to certain provisions of the WTO's Agreement on TRIPS for the Covid-19 pandemic,” it added.Ahead of a May 5 meeting of the WTO’s General Council, Senator Tammy Baldwin joined a group of 10 senators and sent a letter to Biden, urging him to publicly support a temporary patent waiver for Covid-19 vaccines that would allow countries to manufacture treatments locally, expediting the global vaccination effort, saving countless lives and crushing the pandemic.“Your administration has the opportunity to reverse the damage done by the Trump administration to our nation’s global reputation and restore America’s public health leadership on the world stage,” the senators wrote.“To bring the pandemic to its quickest end and save the lives of Americans and people around the world, we ask that you prioritise people over pharmaceutical company profits by reversing the Trump position and announcing US support for the WTO TRIPS waiver,” they added.The proposal to temporarily waive the WTO’s intellectual property rules was put forward by South Africa and India in October, and will be a focus at the body’s meeting early next month.Over 60 former heads of state and 100 Nobel Prize winners signed a letter last week to Biden backing the effort.In a poll conducted by the Data for Progress and Progressive International, 60 per cent of American voters backed the waiver, including 50 per cent of registered Republicans.In February, more than 400 prominent US health, faith, consumer, labour, development and other organisations wrote to Biden, urging him to reverse Trump’s block on the waiver.Khanna said the Biden Administration should call on Pfizer and Moderna to provide an intellectual property waiver for six months to a year as India grapples with this crisis.“It will buy them an inordinate amount of goodwill in one of the largest emerging markets. The White House should also convene Indian business leaders to make the case for why this is in these companies’ long-term strategic interest,” he said.“India has their own IP and they are also manufacturer of vaccines. Some of it has been delayed. The last time we really communicated about this at a high-level was from our USTR, Katherine Tai, but I don't have any updates to that," White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki told reporters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-ustr-holds-talks-with-pfizer-astrazeneca-over-increased-vaccine-production-ip-rights-waiver-101619493987909.html

Their ambassadors to the United State met Monday with a senior member of the US congress to argue their case, and to tap into and broaden support for their case among lawmakers.Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhi tweeted Monday that he and his South African counterpart, Ambassador Nomaindya Mfeketo, met with Congresswoman Karen Bass, (Africa American) chairperson of the House subcommittee on Africa and Global health and discussed “healthcare issues & need for equitable distribution of affordable Covid vaccines and therapeutics”, the last part of which is the sum ad substance of the joint WTO proposal.There was no response from the South African embassy for a request for comments.Also Read | Pentagon working on war footing to begin delivery of supplies to IndiaTheir meeting on Capitol Hill came on a day intense activity on India-US ties, with President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi speaking about the second wave of Covid 19 cases in India. Modi told Biden “about India’s initiative at the WTO for a relaxation in the norms of the Agreement on TRIPS (Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Right) to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries”, according to a readout of their call released by the external affairs ministry.US response was best captured by the White House readout that had no mention of it. Asked about it at a briefing on background, a senior administration official said “It was discussed briefly. We are looking at it, but I have nothing to say about our position right now.”But pressure is mounting on the Biden administration from a growing number of its Democratic allies on the Capitol Hill. “This temporary, targeted TRIPS waiver is a critical tool in overcoming this once-in-a- lifetime pandemic,” a group of 10 Democratic senators of the party’s progressive wing wrote to President Biden recently, adding, “Your Administration has the opportunity to reverse the damage done by the Trump Administration to our nation’s global reputation and restore America’s public health leadership on the world stage.”The Indian-South African proposal was moved at the WTO last October. The United States and other high-income countries, most of who have since built up large stockpiles of vaccines, therapeutics and related technologies, have prevented the world body from even discussing the proposal, which has been backed by more than 80 member countries.Also Read | Biden pledges US help for India’s Covid fightTammy Baldwin, one of these 10 senators, said Monday, “While wealthy nations are able to purchase more shots, international efforts to get the vaccine to the rest of the world, like the World Health Organization’s so-called COVAX effort (a WHO-led effort to provide vaccines to all), are falling woefully short of increasing the global supply to a level that is needed to stomp out the virus and save the lives of Americans and people around the world, we ask that you prioritize people over pharmaceutical company profits by reversing the Trump position and announcing US support for the WTO TRIPS waiver.”Atman Trivedi, a former state and commerce departments official who is now managing director with international consultants Hills & Company, said, “The ten progressive senators’ letter may move the needle, especially as the devastation in India serves as a poignant reminder that many parts of the world have yet to vaccinate their people.”While publicly defiant in the face of mounting pressure, the Biden administration is understood to be debating the issue internally, especially as more and more Americans get inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-still-cagey-about-wto-waiver-india-and-south-africa-plough-on-101619496563082.html

Previous posts on Chinese social media websites had been blocked as well.Zhao on Sunday night became the second woman ever to win the coveted award at the Oscars, as her film Nomadland -- about marginalised Americans roaming the West -- bagged best picture and its lead, Frances McDormand, won best actress.According to a Reuters report, a live-stream of the Academy Awards in Shanghai hosted by alumni of Zhao’s alma mater ran into China’s censors, with the organiser saying access to his virtual private network (VPN) service was blocked for nearly two hours.“One of the exceedingly rare pieces of coverage, on private news site 163.com, actually used the occasion of her victory as an opportunity to not-so-subtly assert one of China’s most important — and contentious — geopolitical priorities,” the Hollywood Report said in an article.Beijing’s anger on Zhao stems from an interview she gave to the Filmmaker magazine in 2013 where she said China is “…a place where there are lies everywhere”.Until the speech resurfaced recently, Zhao and her work had been praised even by Xinhua.“The evocative feature film, Nomadland, the latest effort by insightful Chinese female director, Chloe Zhao, is sweeping the awards circuit in the United States, putting her on the fast track for Oscar contention… Zhao has a unique vision which is serving her in good stead now,” Xinhua wrote in a gushing piece in December.Twitter-like Weibo was initially flooded with posts praising Zhao on Monday morning, while others decried censorship.“Chloe Zhao becomes the first Asian diaspora/Chinese female filmmaker to win the best director Oscar in history,” wrote an entertainment blogger, before the tweet was deleted. “China’s public opinion control is outrageous. After Chloe Zhao’s starling Oscars win, there is not even a fart on Weibo,” wrote an outraged userState-backed opinion on her quickly changed after the interview was found and shared on Chinese social media.Later on Monday, the nationalistic tabloid Global Times published reports on Zhao’s victory, almost grudgingly praising her work.Zhao’s acceptance speech showed her Chinese cultural roots when she quoted the classic Chinese philosophical ethos that people are born with goodness and kindness within them.With inputs from agencies||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-censors-chloe-zhao-s-historic-oscar-win-101619488572931.html

The virtual meeting lasted roughly an hour, according to a senior administration official, and came before a June trip by Harris to the country.Harris spokeswoman Symone Sanders said the leaders discussed the need for long-term economic growth to create jobs and stop the flow of migrants to the U.S., which has caused an early political and humanitarian crisis for President Joe Biden.The aid package includes $255 million in relief funds to mitigate the damage from persistent drought as well as food shortages and the Covid-19 pandemic, according to Harris’ office. The money would also fund safety precautions for refugees and asylum seekers and provide health and disaster-relief services to people in those three countries.Another $55 million in Department of Agriculture funds would go to strengthen Guatemala’s farming industry and expand access to daily meals and literacy programs in Guatemala and Honduras, Harris’ office said.Biden chose the vice president to lead the diplomatic response to the migration crisis by engaging with Central American governments.The president has said that the U.S. must address so-called “root causes” of migration such as poverty and violence in Central America to solve the problem.But congressional Republicans as well as former President Donald Trump say Biden’s reversal of Trump’s hard-line immigration policies encouraged more border crossings, a charge the administration rejects.The administration is also pressing Central American governments to crack down on corruption and crime, which officials say are the main impetuses for migration, and take immediate steps to secure their own borders.Guatemala pledged to increase the number of security personnel at its borders to stop migrants from Honduras and El Salvador from continuing north, Sanders said. The two governments also promised to deepen law-enforcement cooperation against narcotics traffickers and human-smuggling rings.Guatemala also plans to open so-called Migrant Resource Centers jointly with the U.S. for people to apply for asylum or refugee status, or seek an immigrant or work visa, before making the journey to the border.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-pledges-additional-310-million-in-aid-to-stem-crisis-at-border-101619486627217.html
27-04-2021||World||Tesla says it appears driver was at the wheel in crash||Tesla said Monday scrutiny of wreckage from a fatal crash in Texas indicates that someone was at the wheel, contrary to an early report that the driver's seat was empty.During an earnings call, the electric car maker defended itself anew against a report that a Tesla had been fooled into driving with no one behind the wheel, with tragic results."It was claimed to be autopilot, but this is completely false," Tesla chief Elon Musk responded while fielding questions.Tesla has been working with federal and state investigators, and a study of the wreckage indicated there was someone at the wheel at the time of the impact, according to vice president of vehicle engineering Lars Moravy."We were able to find that the steering wheel was indeed deformed, leading to a likelihood that someone was in the driver's seat at the time of the crash," Moravy said on the call.Tesla's auto-steer feature was not engaged, and all the seat belts were found to be unbuckled after the crash, according Moravy.Tesla came under renewed scrutiny last week following a report its cars could be fooled into driving with no one behind the wheel, with two senators demanding a vigorous federal probe of the crash.The accident, which killed two people, involved a Tesla Model S that caught fire after hitting a tree late on April 17 near Houston. Investigators found no one in the driver's seat of the vehicle, local police said.The developments added to questions about the high-flying electric car maker led by the mercurial Musk, who said last week that data logs show Autopilot was not engaged during the Texas crash.On its website, Tesla describes Autopilot as a driver enhancement system that, despite its name, requires a human operator."Autopilot enables your car to steer, accelerate and brake automatically within its lane," the website says. "Current Autopilot features require active driver supervision and do not make the vehicle autonomous."But engineers from Consumer Reports "easily tricked" Tesla's Autopilot to drive without anyone in the driver's seat, "a scenario that would present extreme danger if it were repeated on public roads," the magazine said on its website last week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tesla-says-it-appears-driver-was-at-the-wheel-in-crash-101619483854148.html
27-04-2021||World||Covid-19: Australia to consider proposal to suspend flights from India||Australia is set to consider a proposal on Tuesday to suspend flights from India to prevent more virulent coronavirus variants entering the country following a surge in positive COVID-19 cases in the world's second-most populous country.Queensland state has urged the federal government to halt all flights from India due to the high risk of potential COVID-19 outbreaks from highly contagious virus variants in the country's hotel quarantine system."I sent a letter to the Prime Minister at the end of last week asking for the suspension of flights coming in from India ... and I know that the federal government is considering it today," Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk told the Australian Broadcasting Corp on Tuesday.Australia's national security committee will meet later on Tuesday to consider halting flights from India and will also unveil measures including sending medical supplies to help India, Australian media reported.The prime minister's office did not immediately respond to requests seeking comments on the reports.Last week, Australia announced it would cut the number of its citizens able to return from India and other red-zone countries to contain the risk of more virulent strains of COVID-19 spreading.India has ordered its armed forces to help tackle the COVID-19 crisis, as nations including Britain, Germany and the United States pledged urgent medical aid to try to contain an emergency overwhelming the country's hospitals.On Monday, India reported more than 352,000 new COVID-19 cases, a global record for the rise in daily cases for the fifth straight day, eclipsing even the United States at the height of its pandemic last year. More than 2,800 deaths were recorded over the last 24 hours, an all-time high.Australia closed its borders to non-citizens and permanent residents last March to prevent the new coronavirus reaching the country. All returning travellers have to undergo a mandatory two-week hotel quarantine at their own expense.The quarantine system has largely helped Australia to keep its COVID-19 numbers relatively low, with just under 29,700 cases and 910 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-australia-to-consider-proposal-to-suspend-flights-from-india-101619486244428.html
27-04-2021||World||Brazil health regulator's technical staff recommend against Sputnik V vaccine||The Brazilian health regulator's technical staff on Monday recommended against approving imports of the Russian-made Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine requested by governors battling against a deadly second wave of the virus.The recommendations by Anvisa's technical staff will be taken into account by the regulator's board, which will announce its decision later on Monday. Anvisa had previously said there were "critical issues" surrounding the vaccine's effectiveness and safety that needed clarifying.Ana Carolina Moreira Marino Araujo, general manager for health monitoring, said that taking into account all the documentation presented, data acquired at in-person inspections and information from other regulators, Anvisa's technical staff said "inherent risks" were too great at this time.A crucial issue was the presence in the vaccine of the adenovirus that could reproduce, a "serious" defect, according to Anvisa's medicines and biological products manager Gustavo Mendes.Brazil's vaccination program has been blighted by a series of delays and procurement failures, turning the country into one of the world's deadliest Covid-19 hotspots this year and pushing the national health system to the brink of collapse.Brazil has registered 14.4 million confirmed cases of the virus and almost 400,000 deaths since the onset of the pandemic over a year ago, much of that in the last few months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazil-health-regulator-s-technical-staff-recommend-against-sputnik-v-vaccine-101619484327228.html
27-04-2021||World||Canada PM Trudeau survives confidence vote as opposition party backs budget||Justin Trudeau’s government survived a confidence vote, avoiding an election for now, as its first budget in two years passed in Canada’s legislature with the support of a left-leaning opposition party.In a Monday evening vote, lawmakers from the New Democratic Party backed Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland’s plan to help the Canadian economy recover from its pandemic-induced losses. The vote in the House of Commons was 178 to 157 in favor.In her first fiscal plan as finance chief, Freeland’s budget outlines almost C$500 billion ($403 billion) in spending with a return to small deficits by 2025. It also earmarks C$101 billion for new programs over a three-year period.The centerpiece of the budget is C$30 billion over five years to establish a national childcare strategy, with the goal of offering daycare spaces at C$10 a day.The budget’s approval means Canadians likely won’t be going to the polls this spring, though Trudeau may try to force an election at some point this year in a bid to regain the majority his Liberal Party lost in 2019. The prime minister has promised that all adult Canadians who want a Covid-19 vaccine will be able to get one by September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-pm-trudeau-survives-confidence-vote-as-opposition-party-backs-budget-101619484654512.html
27-04-2021||World||US homeland security launches review of extremism within agency||The Department of Homeland Security on Monday announced an internal review to assess the threat of violent extremism from within the agency, part of a broader administration focus on domestic threats following the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.Senior DHS officials will immediately begin the review, which is aimed at preventing, detecting and responding to extremism within the ranks of a sprawling agency that includes the Coast Guard and the nation's immigration enforcement organizations, Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in announcing the effort.DHS, which was formed in response to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, calls domestic violent extremism the “most lethal and persistent terrorism-related threat” facing the nation following a series of deadly incidents in recent years.“As we work to safeguard our nation, we must be vigilant in our efforts to identify and combat domestic violent extremism within both the broader community and our own organization," Mayorkas said.DHS plans in the coming days to issue new policies for reporting internal threats and suspected extremism.The agency did not cite any specific incidents in announcing the review. Past known cases include that of a Coast Guard lieutenant who was accused of being a domestic terrorist and convicted on weapons and drug charges last year.Prosecutors said the lieutenant, who was sentenced to more than 13 years, was preparing to carry out a mass attack to act out white nationalist views. At his sentencing, the Maryland resident said he never planned to hurt anyone and apologized for his actions.In February, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered military leaders to spend time talking to their troops about extremism in the ranks after a number of former and current service members took part in the Jan. 6 insurrection. The rioters — supporters of former President Donald Trump — had hoped to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election."Those of us who know DHS well know that the number of problematic officers within DHS is small," said Thomas Warrick, a former senior official at the agency who focuses on ways to reform it as a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. “But even a small number is corrosive. It undermines the trust of the American people and the entire mission of the department and its components.”Shortly after President Joe Biden took office, DHS issued a rare terrorism bulletin warning of the lingering potential for violence from people motivated by antigovernment sentiment after the election, suggesting the insurrection might embolden extremists and set the stage for additional attacks.The agency also directed state, local and tribal agencies receiving annual DHS grants to direct 7.5% of the funds toward addressing the threat from domestic extremism.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-homeland-security-launches-review-of-extremism-within-agency-101619481686150.html

27-04-2021||World||Thailand starts stricter Covid-19 shutdown, but experts say not enough||Thailand's government slapped restrictions on travel from India on Monday over concerns of imported coronavirus cases and closed more venues in Bangkok, even as it came under fire for not doing enough to contain a spike in infections.The government has ordered parks, gyms, cinemas and day-care centres in its capital, the epicentre of the latest wave of infections, to shut from April 26 until May 9.It has also introduced a fine of up to 20,000 baht ($635) for not wearing masks in public, with even the prime minister falling foul of mask-wearing rules.But unlike last year, malls and restaurants have been allowed to operate with earlier closing times, fuelling concerns this could quickly lead to more infection clusters and prompting calls for the resignation of the country's health minister.Comparing the government's COVID-19 response to playing a game of Whac-A-Mole, Thira Woratanarat, a professor at Chulalongkorn University's Preventive and Social Medicine, warned "shutting places and activities one at a time would not be enough".People should prepare for more clusters especially in work places, food courts and public transportation, he cautioned in a post on Facebook.Thailand has managed to keep its caseload lower than many countries, but the latest outbreak has resulted in 57,508 infections and 148 deaths in just under 30 days. It reported 2,048 new cases on Monday, of which 901 were in Bangkok."They shouldn't wait until there is a new outbreak to come up with regulations," said Ungkana Kesornphud, who owns a massage shop in Bangkok.The president of Thailand's Thoracic Society, Nithiphat Chiarakun, also urged the government to take "decisive measures to stop the movement of people as quickly as possible".An online petition on Change.org calling for the resignation of health minister Anutin Charnvirankul had garnered over 160,000 signatures in two days.Anutin has said he will not resign.The city of Bangkok fined Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha 6,000 baht ($190) after he posted a photo of him not wearing a mask during a meeting.The photo was later removed.Thailand plans to procure more vaccines from several producers with a vaccination goal of 300,000 doses per day to inoculate at least 50 million people by end-2021, the prime minister posted.Thailand has a population of about 66.1 million.INDIA TRAVEL CURBSThailand will consider additional restrictions later this week, Apisamai Srirangsan, a spokeswoman for its coronavirus taskforce said at a briefing, after the country announced curbs on travel from India where infections have set a global record for a fifth straight day.The Thai embassy in New Delhi said in a statement that certificates of entry for non-Thai nationals travelling from India will be suspended until further notice.The Civil Aviation Authority of Thailand (CAAT) denied reports that private jets carrying wealthy people from India were flying into Thailand."We confirm that no chartered flights from Indian millionaires have sought permission from the CAAT to come to Thailand," it said in a statement over the weekend.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-starts-stricter-covid-19-shutdown-but-experts-say-not-enough-101619483897240.html
27-04-2021||World||US population growth slowed sharply over 2010-2020: Census||US population growth fell over the past decade to the second-slowest pace in history, the Census Bureau reported Monday, after Donald Trump's tough crackdown brought immigration to a near halt.The official 10-year count estimated that 331,449,281 million people lived in the world's third-most populous country on April 1, 2020.That was a 7.4 percent rise from 2010, when the official population stood at 308,745,538, the Census Bureau said.The 10-year expansion was significantly slower than the previous decade, when the population grew by 9.7 percent, and was barely above the record low of 7.3 percent over 1930-1940, when the United States and the world were mired in the Great Depression.The population growth rate accelerated with the "baby boomer" birth surge after World War II, but since the early 1950s has been on a fairly steady decline.That was only interrupted for a few years in the 1990s when millions of migrants, mostly Mexicans, entered the country without documents and stayed.Since then, data shows the dropoff has been sharp.In the past decade, researchers have said that the deep, year-long economic slump from the 2008 financial crisis contributed to the slowdown, with a lower birth rate and with many Mexican migrants returning to their country.In addition, after he became president in 2017, Donald Trump sought to sharply cut legal immigration and halt illegal immigration completely.The region showing the largest growth since 2010 was the south, followed by the west.Arid, heavily desert Utah in the west had the fastest growing population of the 50 states, gaining 18.4 percent, while mountainous West Virginia in the east fell by 3.2 percent.The Census Bureau only released the broad numbers for the country and individual states Monday, to serve as a basis for reapportioning seats in the 435-member US House of Representatives.In all, 13 states will either gain or lose seats, with California, the largest by population, losing one of its 53, while Texas, the second-largest, adding two to its current 36.Others gaining one seat are Colorado, Montana, North Carolina and Oregon. Other losers were Illinois, Michigan, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virginia.The census was taken under a cloud of politics, with Trump trying to reverse past practice and force the agency not to count undocumented or non-citizen residents.His push against immigration is also thought to have made many people afraid to respond to census takers.The census was also hampered by the Covid-19 outbreak."Trying to count people in a global pandemic made it even more challenging," said Ron Jarmin, acting director of the Census Bureau.The bureau plans to release details on age, race and other characteristics of the population in the coming months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-population-growth-slowed-sharply-over-2010-2020-census-101619481639081.html
27-04-2021||World||US to share AstraZeneca shots with world after safety check||The US will begin sharing its entire stock of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines with the world once it clears federal safety reviews, the White House said Monday, with as many as 60 million doses expected to be available for export in the coming months.The move greatly expands on the Biden administration's action last month to share about 4 million doses of the vaccine with Mexico and Canada. The AstraZeneca vaccine is widely in use around the world but has not yet been authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration.The White House is increasingly feeling assured about the supply of the three vaccines being administered in the US, particularly following the restart of the single-dose Johnson & Johnson shot over the weekend. The US has also been under mounting pressure in recent weeks to share more of its vaccine supply with the world, as countries like India experience devastating surges of the virus and others struggle to access doses needed to protect their most vulnerable populations.“Given the strong portfolio of vaccines that the US already has and that have been authorized by the FDA, and given that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorized for use in the U.S., we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next several months," said White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients. "Therefore the US is looking at options to share the AstraZeneca doses with other countries as they become available.”More than 3 million people worldwide have died of Covid-19, including more than 572,000 in the US. The US has vaccinated more than 53% of its adult population with at least one dose of its three authorized vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and J&J, and it expects to have enough supply for its entire population by early summer.About 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have been produced but have yet to pass review by the FDA to “meet its expectations for product quality,” Zients said, noting the US regulator is recognized as the “gold standard” for safety around the world. That process could be completed in the next several weeks. About 50 million more doses are in various stages of production and could be available to ship in May and June pending FDA sign-off.The US has yet to finalize where the AstraZeneca doses will go, Zients said. Neighbors Mexico and Canada have asked the Biden administration to share more doses, while dozens of other countries are looking to access supplies of the vaccine.“We’re in the planning process at this point in time," said White House press secretary Jen Psaki, when asked where the doses would go.The AstraZeneca doses will be donated by the US government, which has contracted with the company for a total of 300 million doses — though the company has faced production issues.The administration's move to share vaccines drew praise from nongovernmental aid groups, who encouraged the White House to develop plans to share even more doses.“The Biden administration’s decision to begin sharing AstraZeneca vaccines is welcome news and an important first step towards the US sharing more of its massive vaccine stockpile," said Tom Hart, acting CEO at The ONE Campaign. "The Biden administration should build on this welcome first step and start sharing more vaccines as soon as possible.”In part because the AstraZeneca vaccine is not expected to play a significant factor in the US virus response, the White House was also moving to share raw materials for the production of the AstraZeneca vaccine with India, which has emerged as a global hotspot for the virus, by diverting some of its orders to the vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India.Zients told the AP that the Biden administration was working to satisfy other “key requests” from the Indian government, namely for personal protective equipment, tests, therapeutics and supplies of oxygen and respiratory assistance devices.“The administration’s identified US commercial suppliers of therapeutics that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering of the Covid-19 patients in India,” said Zients. “We’ve identified rapid diagnostic tests and supplies and PPE, and additional ventilators that are available to transferred to India.”Epidemiologists from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were also expected to soon travel to India to assist the country with its virus response.The additional quality review before the US shares the AstraZeneca doses were in order because of issues at the facility that produced them, White House officials said.AstraZeneca’s doses in the US were produced at an Emergent BioSolutions plant in Baltimore that has come under increased regulatory and public scrutiny after botching batches of the J&J vaccine. The US pressed J&J to take over the plant and, as part of the effort to ensure the quality of newly produced vaccines, directed the facility to stop making the AstraZeneca shot. AstraZeneca is still looking to identify a new US production facility for its future doses.The US government ordered enough for 150 million Americans before issues with the vaccine’s clinical trial held up clearance. The company’s 30,000-person US trial didn’t complete enrollment until January, and it still has not filed for an emergency-use authorization with the FDA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-to-share-astrazeneca-shots-with-world-after-safety-check-101619481484016.html
27-04-2021||World||Germany, China to increase cooperation on climate change||Germany and China have agreed to step up their cooperation in combating climate change in an effort to help keep global temperatures from rising by more than 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit) by the year 2100.Countries are running out of time to achieve that target, laid down in the Paris agreement more than five years ago, because global temperatures have already increased by about 1.2 C since pre-industrial times, scientists say.“We need to do everything possible to lower greenhouse gas emissions faster than planned so far,” Svenja Schulze, Germany's environment minister, said on Monday.“Along with the big industrialized countries we also need China for this,” he said.China has become the world's largest emitter of planet-heating gases, overtaking the United States, which now ranks second. It has pledged to stop adding carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, to the atmosphere by 2060 — a decade later than the US and the European Union.The agreement comes ahead of the two countries' Cabinets holding a bilateral meeting Wednesday.Schulze said she and her Chinese counterpart Huang Runqui discussed how Beijing can bring forward the year when it will start reducing emissions and cuts its use of coal, a particularly polluting fossil fuel. Germany aims to phase out the burning of coal for electricity by 2038.On Monday, three German environmental think tanks said the country could bring forward its target for going “climate neutral” forward five years if it stopped the use of coal by 2030, significantly increased renewable energy generation, replaced natural gas with hydrogen by 2040 and banned the registration of combustion engine vehicles from 2032.Together, the measures could help Germany save almost 1 billion tons of carbon dioxide, they said.The plan received support from the environmentalist Greens, who are leading in the latest polls five months before Germany's federal election. Annalena Baerbock, the party's candidate to succeed Chancellor Angela Merkel, said the proposal showed that “reshaping German industry with an ambitious climate goal is more than feasible.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-china-to-increase-cooperation-on-climate-change-101619481066602.html
27-04-2021||World||India going through same Covid-19 crisis as UK, Europe did earlier: South Africa's health minister Zweli Mkhize||The current Covid-19 crisis of huge number of daily infections in India is something that has already happened elsewhere in the world, South African Health Minister Zweli Mkhize said here.The minister appeared on the national public broadcaster, SABC, on Monday morning, where he was asked why the extensive vaccination programme in India had not stopped the current surge."Different countries have had the same experience. While they are going through the vaccination, the next wave was coming through so you cannot necessarily say that the vaccination will stop it," Mkhize said."Many countries have gone through what India is going through – the UK and countries in Europe had exactly the same problem," he added."What we have learnt from our side is that we went through the second wave without any vaccines and we managed to get our numbers down because of our precautionary measures (of masks and social distancing)," the minister said.And these measures have to be intensified so that whenever the next wave hits, the situation does not get out of hands, he added."Vaccinations will be going on throughout the year, so we will still be getting the outbreaks and hotspots here and there – that will be part of the way we will live for the rest of this year," the minister said."Only when we have vaccinated the majority of the people will we start to see it receding," he added.Mkhize also announced that South Africa would be resuming on Wednesday the Johnson and Johnson vaccine trial programme.The programme was suspended a fortnight ago, as was the case in many other countries, after cases of blood clots in eight women were reported.Mkhize said the South African Health Products Regulatory Authority (SAHPRA) had now reviewed all the reports and recommendations on what was happening all over the world and decided that South Africa should resume the vaccination.SAHPRA has recommended that pregnant and lactating women be excluded from the vaccination programme at this stage."Those continuing with the programme will be have to sign a consent but they will also be given additional information about what precautions to take, what symptoms to look out for, and if there is anything suspicious, to get medical attention," the health minister said.Mkhize said the American studies had shown the risk to be one in a million, which made it very low compared to the rates of infection.Around 3,00,000 healthcare workers had already been vaccinated before the programme was suspended. A further 200,000 are expected to be vaccinated within the next week or two, he said."We have to clear the rest of the health workers and then get to the rest of the public. We must move up to about 5.5 million to be vaccinated (who are) over 50 years (of age) very quickly," the minister said.More than 600,000 people have already registered on the electronic date system that has been set up to prioritise vaccination sites across the country as speedily as possible.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/india-going-through-same-covid-19-crisis-as-uk-europe-did-earlier-south-africa-s-health-minister-zweli-mkhize-101619480623510.html
27-04-2021||World||Chinese airlines suspends cargo flights to India||The largest cargo flight operator from China to India, the Chinese state-owned Sichuan Airlines, has suspended all cargo flights to India for 15 days because of the surge in Covid-19 cases in the country.The suspension, which is likely to disrupt frantic efforts by Indian private companies to import medical supplies including oxygen concentrators to fight the pandemic from China, comes despite Beijing’s repeated offers of “support and assistance” to India to fight the pandemic.The airlines operated 10 flights on six routes to four Indian cities - New Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, and Bangalore.In a late night development, the airlines told the state-run tabloid Global Times that it was “discussing a new plan” to resume cargo services to India.“We are re-evaluating the original plan of suspending cargo services to India, and actively discussing a new plan to guarantee cargo services to the region,” the company told Global Times.The company said the reason why it suspended cargo flights to India was the recent sudden change in Covid-19 cases in the country.A discussion to resume cargo flights was taken after Indian media from Beijing reported the company’s decision to suspend the operations, the Global Times report said.In a letter to the sales agents on Monday, the Sichuan Chuanhang Logistics Co. Ltd, part of Sichuan Airlines, said the airline has suspended its cargo flights on all six routes -- Xi’an-Delhi, Xi’an-Mumbai, Chengdu-Chennai, Chongqing-Chennai, Chengdu-Bangalore, and Chongqing-Delhi – for 15 days,The airlines said “…in the face of sudden changes in the epidemic situation (in India), in order to reduce the number of imported cases, it is decided” to suspend the flights.The airlines added the India route has “always been the core strategic route for Sichuan Airlines” but added that the Indian Covid-19 outbreak had not only caused “…a record number of deaths but also caused a surge in imported cases”.The Chinese foreign ministry, however, did not offer any comment. “With regard to the operation of airlines, I will refer you to the relevant airlines for more information,” foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said when asked about the development.The ministry also did not confirm or deny a tweet by the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka, which said 800 oxygen concentrators have been airlifted from Hong Kong to Delhi with another 10,000 to be dispatched in the coming week.“800 Oxygen Concentrators have been airlifted today from #HongKong to #Delhi; 10000 more in a week. #China is keeping in touch with #India for urgent needs. Stay Strong,” the tweet published by the Chinese embassy in Colombo early on Monday said.When asked to comment on the tweet at the regular ministry briefing, Wang said: “As I said, China is willing to provide necessary support and help to India in its fight against the virus. If India raises specific demands, we will provide help and support to the best of our capability.”He added: “We have stated that we are ready to help India fight the virus in the first opportunity available. [The] two sides are in communication regarding this... China has been following closely the epidemic situation in India. We show our sincerest sympathies to the worsening situation in India.”To a question from Blommbergon three other Quad members (the US, Australia, and Japan) not helping the fourth member, India, during this crisis, Wang said countries should work together to fight the virus.“With regard to some mechanisms that you mentioned, we hope we can also follow this principle and work towards building a community with a shared future and to provide support and help to other countries in their fight (the) virus and show their true responsibilities and obligations.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-airlines-suspends-cargo-flights-to-india-101619474732252.html
27-04-2021||India||As foreign aid arrives, Centre lays down plan to ensure swift distribution||As relief materials for India’s Covid-19 response began pouring in from countries such as the UK and Ireland, the government on Tuesday established procedures to ensure supplies, especially oxygen and related equipment, promptly reach the worst-hit areas across the country. The UK and members of the European Union (EU), which activated its Civil Protection Mechanism for emergencies on Sunday, were among the first to respond to India’s pressing needs for oxygen and medical equipment as the country grapples with a devastating second wave of the pandemic that has seen six straight days of more than 300,000 infections. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that a high-level inter-ministerial group established procedures for immediate clearance of materials from abroad. “The material would be dispatched promptly to recipient institutions in various parts of the country in coordination with different government agencies,” said one of the persons cited above. A total of 100 ventilators and 95 oxygen concentrators arrived from the UK on Tuesday, part of a package of 495 oxygen concentrators and 140 ventilators pledged by London, while France is sending eight large oxygen generating plants that can each meet the needs of a 250-bed hospital and five containers of liquid oxygen that can cater to the needs of 10,000 patients a day. Germany is sending a mobile oxygen production plant that will be available for three months, 120 ventilators and more than 80 million KN95 masks. Other EU members have pledged more oxygen-related equipment, ranging from 700 oxygen concentrators being sent by Ireland on Wednesday to smaller batches of ventilators and oxygen concentrators from countries such as Romania, Luxembourg and Sweden. Belgium is sending 9,000 doses of Remdesivir while Portugal will provide more than 5,500 vials of the antiviral medicine and 20,000 litres of oxygen per week. Following discussions between India and American officials, the US is finalising a support package that is expected to include oxygen generation systems, both small and large-scale, and components for the oxygen supply chain such as concentrators, ventilators, cylinders and transport. The aid could include oxygen generation systems for field hospitals that cater for 50 to 100 beds. The US will also provide therapeutics, personal protective equipment and rapid diagnostic test kits, and approve the supply of vaccine raw materials such as filters needed to manufacture Covishield vaccine in line with pledges made by President Joe Biden during his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. The two sides are holding technical discussions to ensure the equipment supplied by the US can connect to devices in India, and the American side will provide training for using all the equipment and help with their transportation. “US commercial suppliers of Remdesivir that are immediately available have been identified. Rapid diagnostic test supplies and PPEs that can be transferred to India immediately have also been identified. Besides, the US will facilitate India’s access to supplies from US-based sources,” said a second person. India is also expected to benefit as and when the US begins donating up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from its stockpile after the shot clears federal safety approvals. Besides the donations, India has secured medical supplies through private and commercial channels. These include 500 BiPAPs, 250 oxygen concentrators and four cryogenic oxygen containers sourced from Singapore, 80 tonnes of liquid oxygen being shipped via sea from Saudi Arabia, 800 oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong, four cryogenic oxygen tanks from Thailand, six cryogenic containers from the United Arab Emirates, and 23 mobile oxygen generation plants being imported from Germany by the Armed Forces Medical Services. Officially, India has issued no appeal for international aid in keeping with the government’s stated policy. However, Janez Lenarčič, the EU commissioner for crisis management, noted on Sunday that the support is being provided in response to an Indian request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-foreign-aid-arrives-centre-lays-down-plan-to-ensure-swift-distribution-101619547030919.html

27-04-2021||India||‘Demand for medical oxygen rising rapidly in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, UP’: Experts||The shortage of medical oxygen in some of the northern and north-western states (and national capital Delhi) has been or is in the process of being resolved, the head of the empowered group on oxygen supply, Giridhar Aramane, said. He, however, said that demand from Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Uttar Pradesh and Gujarat are rising rapidly.“Bengaluru’s caseload is increasing apart from Kerala. Karnataka’s allocation has gone up from 300 MT to 800 MT as the caseload has more than doubled in a few days,’’ said Aramane, who also serves as Union secretary of road transport and highways. He heads the empowered group since Guruprasad Mahapatra, Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) is recovering from Covid-19. Karnataka has just announced a 14-day lockdown but the increasing oxygen demand by the new states may be the new challenge for the Centre.While there is still a lack of clarity over the situation in Delhi, the Centre said it is supplying enough, the state said it isn’t receiving enough while the Delhi High Court has criticised both governments for not doing their job. The demand from other parts of the country is rising.”What needs to be seen is that Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh and Telengana have all started asking for more oxygen,” said Sumita Dawra, additional secretary of DPIIT under which comes under the commerce minister, the body responsible for medical oxygen.The figures which were presented in Delhi High Court on Tuesday bear out this shift in oxygen demand. The empowered group’s mapping shows that on April 15, Karnataka consumed 250 MT of oxygen which reached 770MT by the weekend. The state expects demand for over 1000 MT by the end of the month.HT reached out to the CM’s office for a comment but is yet to get a response. However, state minister MTB Nagaraj told reporters in Bengaluru, “Covid is spreading at an unimaginable speed. We have given some suggestions to the CM at the cabinet meeting.’’Karnataka has 262,162 active cases of Covid-19 as of Monday. Similiarly, Tamil Nadu saw its oxygen allocation go up from 208MT on April 15 to 355MT over the weekend. The state expects demand to further increase to 400. “At present, Tamil Nadu is using around 350 MTs of oxygen for Covid- 19 treatment. It is likely to touch 400 MTs if active cases shoot up,” said P Umanath, director, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC). Senior officials said that the EG’s allotment for the state is incorrect. Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami wrote to PM Modi on this issue on Sunday and asked the Centre to immediately cancel oxygen being diverted from Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana which have fewer active cases compared to the state. Tamil Nadu has an oxygen production capacity of 400 MT and storage of 1167 MT.It’s not just the southern states; Uttar Pradesh has seen a rise in demand from 550MT on April 15 to 850MT on Sunday. Its projected demand for the end of the month is also likely to be over 1000 MT. Gujarat has gone from 550MT to more than 1000 MT and has now demanded 1500MT by the end of the month.“Maharashtra, with 700,000 active cases, is consuming 1600 MT, Kerala with 219,000 cases is consuming 241 MT but Gujarat with 115,000 cases is consuming 1000MT,’’ said Saket Tiku who heads the gas manufacturers association (AIGMA), adding that the usage needs to be “rationalised”.“That’s what I told the Prime Minister in our meeting with him last week. It’s a message that the health ministry needs to send out.’’The solicitor general also said this during the Delhi High Court hearing, “We have to redistribute in a way that they are taken care of. This is a need-based exercise,’’ said Tushar Mehta, putting the views of the central government in court.But things are getting better in the national capital, Dawra insisted.“Delhi has a good stock of oxygen now. 450-500 MT and another 100 with resellers and rest is on the way.” Tiku added that 24 tankers with 100 MT of oxygen are on their way to Delhi from Jamshedpur. And on Tuesday, the first train from Raigarh, Chattisgarh to Delhi, carrying 64MT tonne of oxygen arrived.On Tuesday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that things were getting better. ‘‘Last week, the oxygen crisis in Delhi worsened on Thursday, Friday and Saturday. Hospitals were jam-packed and I was personally scared of any major untoward incident leading to several deaths due to lack of oxygen. But, in the last two days, the situation has improved significantly. We do not have as many SOS calls from hospitals now as we got on those three days. I want to thank the Central government for helping us through this time by providing their top officials who worked in close coordination with the senior officers of the Delhi government. I thank our Delhi government officials too who’ve worked day and night to address the crisis,” Kejriwal said.Uttar Pradesh acknowledged that there was an increase in demand, “The demand for medical oxygen in Uttar Pradesh has increased by 25 to 30% from the normal times,” said additional chief secretary, health, UP Amit Mohan Prasad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/demand-for-medical-oxygen-rising-rapidly-in-karnataka-tamil-nadu-up-and-gujarat-experts-101619544571238.html

27-04-2021||India||Covishield, Covaxin effective against 'Indian strain' of coronavirus: Report||Covishield and Covaxin -- the two coronavirus vaccines currently in use in India -- have efficacy against the 'Indian strain' and show "milder" illness in case of infection post vaccination, a senior scientist said on Tuesday citing preliminary results of a study.Anurag Agrawal, the Director of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology (IGIB), said the study on effectiveness of the available vaccines on the B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2 suggests that post vaccination, the infections are milder.The B.1.617 variant is also being called a 'double mutant' or the 'Indian strain'."Initial positive neutralisation studies of B.1.617, with both post-Covaxin or Covishield sera, are correlatable with milder disease during post-vaccination breakthrough infections. This is a positive while we get quantitative data for better understanding of infection protection," Agrawal tweeted.IGIB is an institute under the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR).Another study by the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB) in Hyderabad under the CSIR suggests that early results using in-vitro neutralisation assay show that both convalescent (prior infection) sera and Covishield-vaccinated sera offer protection against the B.1.617 variant."Very preliminary but encouraging result: #Covishield protects against #B1617. Early results using in vitro neutralization assay show that both convalescent (prior infection) sera and Covishield vaccinated sera offer protection against the B.1.617 variant, aka #DoubleMutant,” CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra tweeted last week.The B.1.617 variant has three new spike protein mutations. Two mutations -- E484Q and L452R -- are in the area important for antibody-based neutralisation.The third mutation -- P681R -- allows the virus to enter cells a little better. These are defining characteristics of the variant.The B.1.617 variant of SARS-CoV2 has been found prevalent largely in Maharashtra and Delhi that have been severely hit by a devastating second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-covaxin-effective-against-indian-strain-of-coronavirus-report-101619537999479.html

It added during such times resources need to be “professionally augmented and utilised.”A bench of Justices DY Chandrachud, L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat took the affidavit on record and posted the matter for further hearing on Friday. “It is also pertinent to note that the medical oxygen in any country cannot be unlimited. While the government started all out efforts to augment oxygen resources and procure more and more oxygen from all available sources, these supplies available at any given time in the country are to be distributed to all the states, especially those which are critically burdened with high number of active COVID cases, in a balanced manner,” the government said, according to news agency PTI.The Union ministry of home affairs also said that it is in the process of commissioning 162 PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption technology to generate oxygen at local level) plants across the nation a war footing. “It is submitted that 38 plants have already been installed and another 21 plants will be installed by April 30, 2021. A further 105 plants will be installed by May 31, 2021 and thereafter increasing to 156 plants by June 30, 2021. Besides, 500 more PSA plants are planned to be installed in the hospitals in district headquarters to enhance oxygen generation in smaller cities and towns,” Centre said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-home-minister-directly-monitoring-oxygen-supplies-govt-tells-sc-101619534641894.html

The test positivity rate in the state stands at 23.24 per cent, said chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan. Talking to newsmen in the state capital, the chief minister said mutant variants are behind the rapid spread of the virus and urged people not to lower guard at this critical juncture.“In the last two weeks, there has been a 250 per cent hike in Covid-19 cases. Mutant variants of the virus are triggering such a spread. All hospitals have been asked to increase beds and ensure an uninterrupted supply of oxygen. The situation remains critical,” Vijayan said. He said some of the recent studies have shown an intense spread of mutant variants of the virus in the state.He said risk assessment studies of three variants (the UK strain, the double mutants and the South African type) were conducted and it was found that these strains have a multiplying effect and the death rate can also increase in proportion with the mounting infection rate. As the rate of infection goes in up in jails, the government has decided to release more prisoners.Medical experts said the B.1.1.7 variant, which was first detected in the United Kingdom, is 45 to 90 per cent more contagious than the original virus and the state will have to observe utmost caution as this highly infective variant was found in 40 per cent of the samples. “True, the situation is really serious, still people can maintain the surge by observing basic precautions like double masking, physical distancing and hand hygiene,” said public health expert Dr TS Aneesh. He said that going by the present surge rate, cases may go drastically by the next two weeks. Experts like him said next two weeks are critical for the state.This is the first time Kerala’s daily caseload has crossed the 30,000-mark. According to the data released by the state health ministry, when 1,41, 199 tests were conducted, 32,819 patients tested positive and a high TPR of 23.24 was reported. Kozhikode in north Kerala reported the maximum number of cases with 5,025 infections followed by Ernakulam district with 4270 cases. The active caseload is about to cross 2.5 lakh (2,47,181). Health experts said the growing infection in health workers is putting an extra burden on the overworked system. The only silver lining is that the state’s fatality rate is still the lowest in the country, below 0.4 per cent. As many as 32 patients have died, taking the state’s cumulative Covid-19 death toll to 5,170.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/250-hike-in-covid-19-cases-says-cm-as-kerala-logs-record-infections-101619534369770.html
27-04-2021||India||No surplus Covid-19 vaccine doses to send to India right now, says UK||The UK is currently moving through its domestic priority lists for Covid-19 vaccines and therefore has no surplus doses to share with countries in need such as India at this stage, Downing Street said on Tuesday.In reference to India’s devastating second wave of the pandemic, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s spokesperson said the process is kept under constant review, while the country sends an assistance package made up of 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators and 20 manual ventilators to India to meet the supply shortages over the course of the week.The first tranche of 100 ventilators and 95 oxygen concentrators arrived in New Delhi early on Tuesday.“We committed in February to sending excess doses from the UK’s supply to the COVAX procurement pool and to countries in need, once they are available,” the UK PM’s spokesperson said.“Right now we are moving through the UK prioritisation list for our domestic rollout and don’t have surplus doses, but we keep this under constant review. We recognise that no one is safe until we’re all safe in this pandemic which is why the UK has contributed GBP 548 million to COVAX and sent vital medical supplies to India,” the spokesperson said.The COVAX facility refers to the Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access global initiative aimed at equitable access to vaccines led by Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the World Health Organisation (WHO).The latest update from Downing Street comes as it emerged that the US is to export around 60 million doses of the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine, with India expected to be among the biggest recipients of the consignment after talks between US President Joe Biden and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.With 3,23,144 people testing positive for the coronavirus in a day, India's infection tally climbed to 1,76,36,307 on Tuesday. The death toll mounted to 1,97,894 with 2,771 new fatalities.Several efforts are on within the Indian diaspora in the UK to fundraise for essential supplies such as oxygen concentrators and coordinate distribution of across India’s struggling hospitals through a series of emergency appeals, including by charities such as the British Asian Trust and British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (BAPIO).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-surplus-covid-19-vaccine-doses-to-send-to-india-right-now-says-uk-101619532367341.html
27-04-2021||India||Army chief Gen MM Naravane reviews readiness in eastern Ladakh||Army General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday reviewed the Indian Army’s operational readiness in eastern Ladakh where India and China have been locked in a standoff for nearly a year and are currently negotiating a withdrawal of frontline troops and weapons from friction points on the contested border, a senior official familiar with the development said.“Gen Naravane interacted with the troops and complimented them for their steadfastness and high morale while being deployed in some of the harshest terrain, altitude and weather conditions,” the army said in a statement. This is Naravane’s first visit to eastern Ladakh after the Indian and Chinese armies wrapped up the disengagement process in the Pangong Tso sector in February, with both sides pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, infantry combat vehicles and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) after 45 years.The disengagement process between the two armies has hit a wall at other friction points as a result of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) unexpected reluctance to pull back its forward deployed troops from Hot Springs, Gogra and Depsang. The army chief will visit forward areas, including the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector, near the LAC on Wednesday, he said. The army chief also visited Siachen Glacier where two soldiers were killed in an avalanche on April 25. Naravane’s visit to India’s farthest frontiers comes at a time when the country is reeling under the Covid-19 crisis and the military is at the forefront of providing relief. Lieutenant General PGK Menon, commander of the Leh-based HQs 14 Corps and the man leading the military dialogue with China, briefed the army chief on the prevailing security situation in the sensitive sector.“As far as internal Covid situation is concerned, it should not affect the territorial integrity of the country for which the armed forces have to remain prepared all throughout. It warrants that the army chief reviews operational plans on ground and also boosts the morale of the troops,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd). The swift pace of disengagement in the Pangong Tso area in February - it began and ended in less than 10 days - raised hopes of positive outcomes at the remaining flashpoints on the LAC. But the initial optimism appears to have waned after the latest 11th round of military talks on April 9 during which the PLA demonstrated a lack of commitment to restore the status quo of April 2020, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. Disengagement of frontline troops on the LAC is the first crucial step to restore peace and tranquillity in eastern Ladakh. Until that happens, there is no question of de-escalation of the border conflict and the eventual de-induction of rival soldiers in the sensitive theatre.Days after the mutual withdrawal of front-line troops and weapons from the Pangong Tso heights in February, Naravane cautioned that the disengagement process with China would be a long-drawn one. He described disengagement as a “win-win situation” for both sides but added that de-escalation of conflict and the de-induction of rival forces was “still a long way to go.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-mm-naravane-reviews-readiness-in-eastern-ladakh-101619532869547.html
27-04-2021||India||WHO steps up aid to India to stem Covid-19 surge||The World Health Organization (WHO) said on Tuesday it was stepping up efforts to help India as hospitals there struggled to cope with a huge surge in coronavirus cases, including bringing in oxygen and other essential supplies.India's death toll is now nearing 200,000, and some hospitals are turning away coronavirus patients as they do not have enough oxygen supplies and beds.WHO spokesman Tarik Jasarevic said the crisis had worsened due to mass gatherings of people, more contagious variants and low vaccination rates."We are working with the government to bring in essential supplies like oxygen and alleviate the immediate situation," Jasarevic said.The WHO was providing 4,000 oxygen concentrators, which only require an energy source, he said. Mobile field hospitals are being set up and laboratory supplies provided for testing.He urged people not to stockpile essential supplies. Wider distribution of high-quality masks was also key to control transmission, he said.More than 2,600 WHO experts already working in the country on other health programmes have been deployed to respond to the pandemic, the U.N. agency has said.The problem has been exacerbated by some people going to hospital when home care would suffice, Jasarevic said.Less than 15% of people infected with Covid-19 actually need hospital care and even fewer will need oxygen, he said.Community-level centres should screen and triage patients and provide advice on safe home care, he said.Studies continue into virus variants circulating there, including the B.1.617 variant with two mutations, first detected from samples collected last December, he said, citing some evidence that they may be more contagious."The extent to which these virus changes are responsible for the rapid increase in cases in the country remains unclear, as there are other factors such as recent large gatherings that may have contributed to the rise," he said.India's 323,144 new cases over the past 24 hours stood below a worldwide peak of 352,991 hit on Monday, while 2,771 deaths took the toll to 197,894.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/who-steps-up-aid-to-india-to-stem-covid-19-surge-101619530703514.html
27-04-2021||India||Tripura hikes transport tariff by up to 25%, three years after last revision||The Tripura government has increased transport tariff by up to 25% citing the hike in petrol and diesel prices during 2020-2021 financial year. The transport tariff was last hiked in July 2018.“We have decided to increase transport fares with the rise of petrol and diesel prices by 30% and 32% (respectively). However, we are not going to hike fares for Air Conditioned buses,” said transport minister Pranajit Singha Roy.After the revision, per kilometre fair for ordinary state transport buses has increased to 73 paise from 58 paise, similarly the fair for minibuses has increased to 90 paise from earlier 72 paise per kilometre.Fares for metered auto and contract auto services have also been hiked to ₹20 for two kilometres and ₹8.66 per kilometre from ₹7.20 respectively, said the minister.The government also announced a new bus service in hilly areas. The fare for minibuses under this service will be ₹1.20 per kilometre and ₹1.45 per kilometre for other small buses.Night bus services operating from 9pm to 5am will charge an additional 25% fare and express bus services will levy an additional 15% charge.Petrol prices rose sharply across the country after recovery in prices of international crude oil in the last few months of 2020-2021 since the Central and state taxes were not reduced in the same proportion. The domestic prices for petrol and diesel vary across states due to various taxes and levies by various state governments. Central and state taxes constitute 60% of the retail selling price in petrol and over 54% in diesel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tripura-hikes-transport-tariff-by-up-to-25-three-years-after-last-revision-101619531789874.html

27-04-2021||India||Gujarat govt's handling of Covid-19 pandemic 'not satisfactory': High court||The Gujarat High Court on Tuesday expressed its displeasure over the state government's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, noting the entire exercise lacks "transparency" and pointed to the death of patients outside hospitals due to "non-attendance by doctors".The court also advised against imposing a lockdown and said it is not a solution to fight the pandemic.The HC asked the Gujarat government to direct hospitals to admit all Covid-19 patients approaching them instead of just those coming through '108' (helpline) ambulance service."We are not saying that the government is not doing anything or the (Ahmedabad Municipal) Corporation is not doing, but the manner in which it is being done is not satisfactory, not transparent, and therefore all these problems are arising," said a division bench of Chief Justice Vikram Nath and Justice B D Karia.The bench made the observations while hearing a suo motu (on its own) PIL over the Covid-19 situation in Gujarat which has seen a sharp rise in coronavirus cases in the last few weeks."If you had a more practical, thoughtful and a more meaningful system of working, it would be doing much better and there would be much less crisis."These untimely deaths or unfortunate deaths that are taking place outside hospitals because of non-attendance by doctors should not happen," the court said.The HC raised the question of government and designated Covid-19 hospitals in Ahmedabad attending to only patients coming in EMRI (Emergency Management and Research Institute-run) '108' ambulances and ignoring those brought in private vehicles.The court said a doctor cannot refuse to attend to a patient who has not come in a '108' ambulance and let him die."Everybody has to be attended irrespective of which vehicle he has come from," it said.The bench asked the government to ensure that patients who arrive at hospitals in private vehicles are also attended by doctors and not left "high and dry"."Why doesn't the government issue directions to corporations all over the state, to government hospitals, designated hospitals, that whenever a patient arrives, attend to him. A patient attended to would be mentally satisfied that immediate care has been taken," the bench said.When Advocate General (AG) Kamal Trivedi, representing the state, said it will be difficult to control a steady flow of patients approaching a hospital in private vehicles, the HC suggested that each medical facility should have a display board outside showing the status of available beds."We had directed the Principal Secretary Health to convene a meeting of all stakeholders and decide a common policy to be followed."All these are common issues... corporations cannot have their own policy contrary to what the government has," the court said.The bench questioned the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation (AMC)'s policy of not giving admission to patients in its hospitals coming from outside the city."Can you do that? Is this a kind of domicile thing that we are only catering to Ahmedabad and therefore we cannot care for patients from outside, even if he is critical?" it asked.The court also questioned the government over people lining up to fill up oxygen cylinders required to treat critical Covid-19 patients.The HC's observation came after Advocate General Trivedi said the existing mechanism is to divert the supply ofmedical oxygen to the Centre for it to allocate to states.When the AG told the court that there was a "sea of difference" in the Covid-19 situation today compared to a week ago, the bench asked him whether the government was ready to handle the projected heavy flow of patients in the coming days."What is going to happen on May 1 when the number of patients doubles? Everyday there is an increase. Are you ready for it?"What are the steps you are going to take? All the patients will not be attended and they will be allowed to die?" it asked.The court sought to know the preparations to tackle a further surge in cases."What is the way this system is working? There is a projection of half a million patients in the next 15 days. What is your preparation? Nothing," it said.The court asked the government to consider ways to "break the chain" to contain the spread of the virus."It is for the government and experts to decide how to break the (transmission) chain," it said.When a lawyer appearing in the case pressed for imposing a lockdown to break the chain, the court said unlike Germany or London, such a step is hard to take in India and appealed to people to remain in self-imposed lockdown as far as possible."Lockdown is not a solution. By imposing lockdown, do you know how many people would lose their daily meal? This is not Germany, New Zealand, London, this is India...Why can't we have our own self-restrictions and not depend on the government?" the bench said.The court asked the government to ensure Covid-19 patients get the full dose of Remdesivir injections.A civil application, filed by three persons, has been made a part of the PIL. The application seeks court direction for urgent supply of medical oxygen to the needy patients.The PIL will be further heard on May 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gujarat-govt-s-handling-of-covid-19-pandemic-not-satisfactory-high-court-101619530757666.html

Abandon all political work and help people, they were told amid the surge in Covid-19 cases that has overwhelmed hospitals and triggered a shortage of essential supplies such as medical oxygen.Congress, the principal opposition party, wants to raise an army of Covid Sevaks, or those eager to reach out and help distressed families, amid the pandemic.“During this Corona crisis, I request my Congress colleagues that all political work should be abandoned. Just help the people, by all means remove the misery of the countrymen. This is the religion of the Congress family,” said Gandhi in his message to party workers, accessed by HT, delivered through the Congress’s app.The aim, a Congress leader said, is to create a dedicated force in every block and every district. On the first day, 27,000 workers registered themselves for this voluntary work in these challenging times.Other political parties are also trying to extend their helping hand at the grassroots level, widening their role in India’s worst health crisis ever.

27-04-2021||India||6-year jail term for Saritha Nair in Kerala solar scam||The judicial first class magistrate court in Kozhikode (north Kerala) on Tuesday sentenced the second accused in solar cheating case Saritha S Nair to six years rigorous imprisonment and fined her ₹40,000.Congress leader and former home minister Thiruvanchoor Radhakrishnan welcomed the verdict. “The ruling front has used her to target Congress leaders. It is a slap on its face,” he said. The court found Nair guilty of breach of trust, cheating, forging documents and other offences. The first accused, Biju Radhakrishnan, her second husband, is in quarantine and his sentence will be announced later. The court held that she has to undergo the sentence separately. She had already been convicted in three other cases.This is one of the 30-odd complaints registered against the duo in the solar cheating case in 2013. This case relates to the cheating of a businessman Abdul Majeed in 2012. He had accused both of cheating him of ₹42.70 lakh after promising to install imported solar panels in his office and house and franchisee rights of their firm. Fearing bad publicity many withdrew their plaints later.Though the trial in the case was completed in 2018, the verdict was postponed. The case dragged after Nair failed to appear before the court citing many reasons. Later, the court issued an arrest warrant and she was held from her house in Thiruvananthapuram last week.The solar scandal, one of the reasons for the fall of the Oommen Chandy regime, surfaced in 2013. Nair and Radhakrishnan floated a fictitious solar energy company called ‘Team Solar’ and cheated many by seeking investments with the promise of making them business partners or offering to install solar power units. They flaunted their ‘high connections’ to attract gullible investors.She used to frequent the CM’s office using her connections. Oommen Chandy, the then CM of Kerala, had to sack two of his private secretaries and the state public relations director when their names cropped up in the case. Later, Nair also accused many Congress leaders, including Chandy, of sexually harassing her. This complaint was handed over to the CBI by the Pinarayi Vijayan government two months back but the central agency is yet to take up the case.Nair allegedly figured in another cheating case last year when some of the job aspirants filed a police complaint against her saying she accepted money from them in the guise of helping them to get government jobs. However, due to her alleged proximity with the left front government, which used her to target Congress leaders, she was spared.She also tried to contest against Congress leader Rahul Gandhi in Wayanad in the 2019 Lok Sabha election but her papers were rejected. Last November, the Supreme Court rejected her plea challenging the election of Congress MP Rahul Gandhi with a fine. Her nomination from Wayanad was rejected by the returning officer on account of her conviction in cheating cases related to the solar scam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/6year-jail-term-for-saritha-nair-in-kerala-solar-scam-101619525308431.html

With fresh supplies having arrived, a determined Tayab revisited the centre on Monday and got himself vaccinated, demonstrating a marked-shift in people’s attitude towards the Covid-19 vaccine amid a continuous rise in infections and a record number of deaths registered in Jammu and Kashmir on Monday.“I was very sad when the [hospital] staff told me [that] vaccine doses were finished, but on my next visit, I got the jab along with my wife,” said Tayeeb. “I just developed a fever and no other complications after the vaccination.”J&K on Monday reported 23 deaths due to Covid-19-- the highest-ever toll in a 24-hour period since the outbreak.

27-04-2021||India||Ireland to send 700 oxygen concentrators to back India’s Covid response||Ireland announced on Tuesday it is sending 700 oxygen concentrators from its stockpile to back India’s Covid-19 response, joining the growing list of countries that are rushing aid to help health facilities tackle a severe shortage of oxygen. The concentrators, devices that draw oxygen from the air and deliver it to patients, are expected to reach India early on Wednesday. Ireland has also pledged to send ventilators to India as a gesture of solidarity that is part of the European Union’s (EU) coordinated response to help the country cope with the massive surge in Covid-19 cases. Irish ambassador Brendan Ward said: “The situation in India is being followed closely in Ireland, where there is now a large Indian community. Indian medical professionals are very important to our health system. “We are pleased to be able to offer these oxygen concentrators now. We are in close contact with the Indian government and we are looking at what further assistance we could offer, such as ventilators and other equipment.” According to official data released on Tuesday, India recorded 323,144 new Coronavirus infections since Monday – the sixth consecutive day of record-breaking tallies above the 300,000 mark. Nearly 2,800 more people succumbed to the viral disease, taking the death toll to 197,894. Ireland’s donation of oxygen concentrators is being made from stocks originally purchased for use in a field hospital setting, as part of pandemic preparations, national broadcaster RTE reported. Oxygen cylinders need to be refilled, while oxygen concentrators can provide a continuous flow of oxygen that doesn’t run out and are lighter than cylinders and can be moved easily. A spokeswoman for Ireland’s Health Service Executive said they are ideal for patients who don’t require mechanical ventilation but would benefit from oxygen via a face mask. The donated items are brand new and were purchased specifically for Covid-19 patients. Ireland’s health minister Stephen Donnelly, who worked on the plan to send supplies to India along with foreign minister Simon Coveney over the weekend, said, “We have all seen the rapidly deteriorating situation in relation to Covid-19 in India. I am pleased that Ireland is in a position to make this emergency donation of 700 oxygen concentrators to India.” Tanaz Buhariwalla, India director for IDA Ireland, the agency responsible for inward foreign direct investment, said, “India and Ireland have a strong relationship spanning decades. We are happy that during these difficult times, the Irish government has extended an arm to support our war against Covid-19 and aid the healthcare workers.” The aid from Ireland is part of the response under EU’s Civil Protection Mechanism, which was activated on Sunday following a request from India. Germany and France have also announced support packages as part of the EU response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ireland-to-send-700-oxygen-concentrators-to-back-india-s-covid-response-101619515826928.html

On Monday, 991 beds were available in around 100 private hospitals and their satellite facilities. The 12 state-run hospitals in the city had just 458 remaining beds.“The rush in Kolkata is more than the districts. While state run-hospitals are 80% occupied, across the state the occupancy rate is around 55%. We are augmenting the infrastructure not only in the state-run hospitals but also in private hospitals,” said a health department official, requesting anonymity.The number of available beds in state-run hospitals was around 5,600 on March 26, a day before the assembly elections kicked off in the state. West Bengal reported 646 Covid-19 cases that day. On April 26, the state recorded 1,5992 cases. Some private hospitals, which ran out of beds, have come up with satellite facilities.Also Read | EC bans election victory rallies as Covid-19 cases continue to surgeOfficials said at least one out of every three private hospitals in the city and its fringes has no beds left. A few state run-hospitals are also left with no beds, they added. Around 35 top private hospitals in the city have no beds available.The highest number of cases are being reported from Kolkata, which recorded 3,868 infections on Monday. As many as 5,321 cases were reported from the three adjacent districts of North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas, and Howrah. The surge has led to a depletion of oxygen supply and shortage of antiviral Remdesivir and prompted the authorities to issue guidelines for their strict rationing.“Due to the high caseload, we need to decongest the hospitals and more importantly the CCU [cardiac care unit] and HDU [high-dependency unit] beds. For this, detailed guidelines have been brought out...which patients could be kept in HDU and CCU beds and who could be referred to isolation centres from hospitals depending on the severity. Also, guidelines have been brought out over the use of oxygen and Remdesivir,” said another official, who did not wish to be named.Hospitals have been asked to start oxygen therapy only if the saturation of a patient drops below 94%. The state government has also made it mandatory for pharmacists to sell Remdesivir to hospitals only.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kolkata-left-with-less-than-1-500-beds-in-hospitals-as-covid-19-cases-break-new-records-101619515166405.html

Annapurna, (8091 mtrs) 10th highest mountain in the world on 16th April 2021 at 1.30pm. And also I am the first Indian woman to scale Mt Annapurna.” Her journey that kick-started on March 21 was followed by a 5-day quarantine period. Before she started the climb, she also updated her followers as she captioned her post, “Going towards my dream. Mt Annapurna I, whose elevation stands at 8091m making it fall under 14× 8000m plus peaks of the world.”“I was confident, excited and a bit scared as it is one of the deadliest mountains because of its unpredictable climate which makes it even more difficult for a climber. I am also happy because there were no causalities this year,” says Mohite on this remarkable achievement. She also adds, “After every climb, I get at least 1,000 new followers on social media and I hope I am able to have good influence on them.” In the past, Mohite has also achieved success in climbing Mt Makalu, the fifth-highest peak in the world, in 2019, and became the first Indian woman. She has previously scaled Mt Lhotse, the fourth highest mountain in the world, in 2018 and Mount Everest in 2013.The mountaineer didn’t let the lockdown play a spoilsport in her practice and training last year as she believes that endurance and preparation play a key role for a climb. “From August onwards, gym and fitness centres reopened, so I also restarted my work out regime. However, the outdoor training and activities were reduced due to the Covid-19 situation and I need to be cautious as getting infected will have an impact in the long run as a mountaineer, so I resorted to strength training, cross fit, and high-intensity interval training,” she says. Mohite, who works at a pharmaceutical company in Bengaluru, wanted to climb Kangchenjunga this year but couldn’t due to unavailability of the team credits her parents for the continuous encouragement through the years. “My parents have always supported my decisions and pushed me to strive better,” she says.In her leisure time, Mohite likes to go for nature treks, do rock-climbing and watch films that are related to mountaineering. However, she also feels there’s a dearth of movies in Indian cinema that portray the lives of mountain climbers. “There should be more films depicting the lives of mountaineers...Climbing is really difficult but I understand shooting outdoors would be hard too, but there should be one like the film, Everest (2015),” she concludes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/priyanka-mohite-the-first-indian-woman-to-scale-mt-annapurna-there-should-be-more-films-depicting-the-lives-of-mountaineers-101619514566063.html

Following this different 'akhadas' (sects) had agreed to keep their participation symbolic.Crowds at the ghats of the Ganga started thinning down drastically since last week after the key 'akhadas' of seers began pulling out of the Maha Kumbh, one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, citing the spike in coronavirus case numbers.Many spots wore a deserted look on Tuesday at the Kumbh which will formally close only on April 30.With 3,23,144 people testing positive for coronavirus infection in a day, India's total tally of Covid-19 cases has climbed to 1,76,36,307, while the national recovery rate has further dropped to 82.54 per cent, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Tuesday.Uttarakhand reported 5,058 Covid-19 cases on Monday with Dehradun registering 2,034 cases and Haridwar 1,002 cases.By 10.45 am, 600 seers of the Joona, Agni, Avahan and Kinnar 'akhadas' had taken a dip in the river followed by 70 seers of the Niranjani and Anand 'akhadas' on Chaitra Purnima, Zonal Officer (Intelligence) of Haridwar Sunita Verma said.Seven more akhadas will converge at 'Har ki Pairi' during the day for a symbolic 'snan', the officer said.Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat, Inspector General (Kumbh Mela) Sanjay Gunjyal and Senior Superintendent of Police, Kumbh Mela, Janmejay Khanduri reviewed the arrangements at Har ki Pairi before commencement of the bath on Tuesday.Talking to reporters, Rawat thanked the seers for scaling down the shahi snan in response to the prime minister's appeal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kumbh-mela-seers-keep-last-shahi-snan-symbolic-affair-101619513645128.html
27-04-2021||India||EC bans election victory rallies as Covid-19 cases continue to surge||New Delhi: The Election Commission (EC), which has drawn flak for letting political parties flout Covid-19 protocols, on Tuesday banned victory rallies on or after the counting of votes in five states and a Union Territory on May 2 besides barring over two people from accompanying winning candidates for receiving their election certificates. The ban came a day after the Madras high court blamed the EC for the second pandemic wave, which has overwhelmed hospitals, and said officials of the poll watchdog should probably be tried on murder charges for allowing the violation of the norms.“No victory procession after the counting on 2.5.2021 [May 2, 2021] shall be permissible. Not more than two persons shall be allowed to accompany the winning candidate or his/her authorized representative receive the certificate of election from the Returning Officer concerned,” the EC said, as it detailed new protocols on the counting day in view of the Covid-19 situation.The poll watchdog cited the broad guidelines issued on August 21 last year to conduct elections during Covid-19 and added they were framed after receiving suggestions from political parties. It added the guidelines for political parties on election campaigns and meetings were reviewed based on suggestions received from chief electoral officers. The EC said the Covid-19 related provisions for counting of votes on May 2 are to be in accordance with the broad guidelines of August 2020, with the addition of the new protocols issued on Tuesday.The poll watchdog has faced criticism for allowing political parties to hold big rallies, where most participants, including political leaders, have been seen in attendance without masks. It issued guidelines reiterating the importance of adhering to Covid-19 protocol but did not act against any leader or party for flouting them.The EC has also faced criticism for holding the West Bengal assembly elections across eight phases, and for refusing to combine later phases even as the health crisis escalated and triggered a shortage of critical resources such as medical oxygen needed to save lives.The daily Covid-19 cases in the country have risen by over 400% since April 1 and deaths by over 600%. India on Tuesday reported 68,546 new infections and 2,771 fatalities (CHECK).The lowest turnout--roughly 75.06%—so far was recorded in the seventh and the penultimate phase of elections in West Bengal amid surging Covid-19 infections in the state on Monday when it reported around 16,000 infections and 68 deaths.Elections were also held in Assam, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, and Puducherry in March and April. The counting of votes there will take place along with that in West Bengal after the last phase of polling in the state on Thursday.The campaigning for the West Bengal elections has ended. The EC earlier banned it at night, increased the silence period from 48 hours to 72 hours, and limited election rallies to 500 people after the Calcutta high court last week expressed dissatisfaction over measures taken to enforce Covid-19 norms during the polls.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) chief Jagat Prakash Nadda welcomed the EC order banning victory processions. “I have directed all state units of BJP to strictly adhere to this decision. All karykartas [workers] of BJP are using their energies to help the ones in need in this hour of crisis,” Nadda said in a tweet.RESPONSES FROM OTHER MAJOR POLITICAL PARTIES Jagdeep Chhokar of the Association of Democratic Reforms said that EC’s move came far too late and would achieve very little. “The Commission should have ensured that the protocols were followed far more sternly,” he said. “The EC has lost its credibility, which will take a long time to recover.”The Madras high court on Monday warned it could even stall the counting of votes unless the EC produced a Covid-19 protocol blueprint for it on April 30. The court said at no cost can counting be allowed to become a catalyst for a further surge. It toned down its observations as the reference to murder charges was not part of the written order. The court said public health is of paramount importance. “It is only when a citizen survives that he’ll be able to enjoy the rights that a democratic republic guarantees.”The court noted that face masks, sanitisers were not used, and no social distancing was maintained during election campaigning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ec-bans-election-victory-rallies-as-covid-19-cases-continue-to-surge-101619513845904.html

All you need to know||The United States on Tuesday said that it will be delivering raw materials to the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine, with an aim to help India tide over the current wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). In a White House briefing, senior officials of the Biden-Harris administration detailed the comprehensive plan for support that involves transporting raw materials, oxygen supplies, ventilators, therapeutics, Remdesivir, testing and protective equipment, and providing public health assistance to India.Raw materials for vaccineFirstly, the United States will be "diverting" its own order of raw materials to the Serum Institute of India for the production of the AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine against Covid-19, senior administration officials said, adding that this was the "most effective and rapid step" that could be taken at this stage to provide support.Also Read: 'We remember India's generosity': US to 'divert' vaccine resources to Serum Institute"Given that there is not enough of the supply for the entire global manufacturing effort and in light of the current crisis, we, the United States, are diverting our order to India. So, I want to be clear here that we did not intervene with the manufacturer to make them fill the Serum Institute’s order; we don’t have that power. Instead, what we are doing is diverting our own order of our own supplies to the Serum Institute for their manufacturing," the official said.Medical oxygenRegarding oxygen supplies, US officials said that these are the resources that India has "specifically requested" and are situated very high on the priority list."There’s a number of different buckets — oxygen transport, oxygen generation, oxygen cylinders, the oxygen supply chain. And, in particular, our Department of Defense (DoD) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) are pursuing options to provide oxygen generation systems," the official said.Also Read: Covid Crisis: 7 steps India took to ramp up oxygen supply amid shortageThe administration is also working on oxygen generation systems, including larger-scale as well as smaller-scale units, which have been used in US field hospitals to provide oxygen for 50 to 100 beds, the White House said. "And I’ll stress that some of these elements are in the exploration phase; they’re shorter- and longer-term options that we’re providing in the immediate, and then we plan to continue to be engaged over the longer term," a press noted cited senior administration officials as saying.Technical assistanceMoreover, US experts are also engaged in technical discussions with their Indian counterparts to ensure that the supplied equipment, oxygen concentrations, and ventilators, are compatible with the devices in India. "And we’re also going to be providing training associated with all of these requests as needed."Also Read: How Biden admin changed stance on supply of vaccine raw materials to IndiaProviding further details, said that the USAID and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be providing additional technical assistance and materials to strengthen vaccine communications between India and the US and support "vaccine readiness at the national and sub-national levels."The US government is also preparing to help with the transportation of these and other supplies to India.Therapeutics, personal protective equipment, and testsThe United States has identified commercial suppliers of Remdesivir that are immediately available to help relieve the suffering of Covid-19 patients in India. Rapid diagnostic testing supplies and personal protective equipment (PPE) have been identified, and will be available to be transferred to India immediately, the White House said. "Finally, we mentioned the antiviral drug Remdesivir and rapid diagnostic tests, but we are also facilitating India’s own access to those supplies through US-based sources," officials said.Public health assistance, a 'strike team'The US acknowledged that the CDC and India's Epidemic Intelligence Services (EIS) have a "long, long history of working together closely and helping one another."The US CDC, working with the USAID, will urgently deploy a strike team to India, the White House said, which will include public health experts to work in close collaboration with the American embassy, with India’s health ministries and experts, and with India’s EIS staff."That strike team will work hand-in-hand with India’s experts in a number of areas, including laboratory services; surveillance and epidemiology; bioinformatics for sequencing and modeling of the disease; infection, prevention, and control; vaccines rollout; and risk communication," the press note detailed.Providing further details, senior administration officials said that the 'strike team' will also include CDC-EIS officers and laboratory leadership service officers who will work directly with India’s experts in peer engagements for the model for areas to allow support at the state and the local level. Support from the strike team could also support India being able to immediately add residents to epidemiology class sizes to add new training experts in the Field of Epidemiology Training Program frontline cohort, where the two countries are already working together.The USAID will also work in the public health arena with the CDC to support and fast-track the mobilization of emergency resources available through the Global Fund. India’s base allocation through the Global Funds Covid-19 resource mobilisation round is $75 million, the White House said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-exactly-is-the-us-planning-to-help-india-fight-covid-19-all-you-need-to-know-101619510233000.html

Senior doctors present in the meeting also advised the L-G on additional steps needed to contain the disease. The rising number of infections in the second wave led to imposition of restrictions such as night curfew in the UT last week.The L-G asked senior doctors and religious leaders to use social media among others to educate people on the pandemic and to clear misconceptions related to Covid vaccines. He also said that people not wearing face-masks should be denied entry at all religious places.“All necessary measures must be taken to ramp up the availability of beds and medicines for Covid patients,” he observed.Night curfew was clamped across all municipalities and urban areas of the UT on April 20 and places of mass gatherings such as public parks were closed; restrictions have been placed on public gatherings and transport services and markets have been asked to operate at 50% capacity.UT officials informed the L-G that hospitals in the region had enough oxygen and beds. The administration has approved setting up of 36 oxygen generation plants to meet with the possibility of a sudden rise in demand as seen in many Covid hotspots across the country. A total of 1,743 Covid beds were also vacant out of the total capacity of 3,062 beds as of Monday. Similarly, 203 Covid ICU beds, out of the 338, were vacant. The UT on Monday recorded 25 deaths including 11 from Jammu and 10 from Kashmir—the highest so far this year. 2,135 fresh Covid cases were reported on Monday, pushing the tally to 162,868. 791 fresh cases were reported from the Jammu division and 1,344 from the Kashmir division. Srinagar district recorded the highest number of 632 cases, followed by 472 in the Jammu district, said officials.Sinha promised all necessary support including equipment, additional manpower for hospitals and doctors, who suggested adoption of a multi-pronged approach such as tightening of Covid containment measures including restrictions on social and political events on one hand and meticulous inoculation of all people on the other. Some experts also stressed the need to strengthen the three-tier healthcare system to take off pressure from big cities.On his part, Sinha thanked doctors and frontline health workers for their continuous service in the times of crisis.“I am truly grateful for the amazing work you and your team members and health workers are doing. You are an inspiration for all of us...,” Sinha said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-l-g-takes-stock-of-covid-19-preparedness-in-ut-101619511565330.html

27-04-2021||India||'We remember India's generosity': US to 'divert' vaccine resources to Serum Institute||The United States on Tuesday said that it remembers "India's generosity" in the early days of the pandemic and will hence be delivering raw materials to the Serum Institute of India (SII) for the production of the Oxford-AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine, with an aim to help India tide over the current wave of the coronavirus disease.In a White House press briefing earlier this day, senior officials of the Biden-Harris administration said that the United States was "diverting" its own order of raw materials to the Serum Institute in light of the current crisis as this was the "most effective and rapid step" that could be taken at this stage to provide support.Also Read: How Biden admin changed stance on supply of vaccine raw materials to India"As requested by the Government of India, we will be providing raw materials for the production of the AstraZeneca Covishield vaccine at the Serum Institute of India," a senior administration official said, elaborating on the "complexities of the global supply chain" and the exact nature of the assistance that the US is providing to India."Given that there is not enough of the supply for the entire global manufacturing effort and in light of the current crisis, we, the United States, are diverting our order to India. So, I want to be clear here that we did not intervene with the manufacturer to make them fill the Serum Institute’s order; we don’t have that power. Instead, what we are doing is diverting our own order of our own supplies to the Serum Institute for their manufacturing," the official said.Providing further details, the senior administration official said that the Defense Production Act (DPA) in the US requires American companies to prioritise US government contracts over others. "But what it does not mean is an export ban or a de facto ban or an embargo or any restrictions on sales to any other outside clients or customers anywhere. Companies are able to export however they need," he said.Also Read: Joe Biden’s wartime law use blocks India’s vaccine ramp-upAdding that the DPA doesn't cause any shortages in global supplies, the official pointed out that the US government doesn't even have the power to intervene with the manufacturing companies' orders. Hence, it was diverting its own supplies to India in view of the recent surge in Covid-19.The official further said that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will be providing additional technical assistance and materials to strengthen vaccine communications between India and the US and support "vaccine readiness at the national and sub-national levels."US experts, however, believe that the Biden administration can do more. The US Chamber of Commerce had earlier last week called on the White House to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots will more than meet its needs. The US has also not authorised the AstraZeneca shot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/we-remember-india-s-generosity-us-to-divert-vaccine-resources-to-serum-institute-101619506818134.html

27-04-2021||India||Counting of votes: Madras HC suggests lockdown in TN, Puducherry on May 1-2||The Madras high court has suggested a May 1-2 lockdown to Tamil Nadu and Puducherry governments to prevent a surge in Covid-19 cases during vote-counting for the recently held assembly elections. The court said on Monday that only vehicles required for counting and emergency services could be allowed. “Public health is more important than counting votes. The process may be delayed or even deferred, but public health must not be compromised,” the court said.The first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy made the observations while hearing a suo motu petition by the court on the status of the availability of oxygen, ventilators, hospital beds, and Remdesivir drug for treating Covid-19, besides vaccine availability. “If an appropriate announcement in such regard is made well in advance, say by April 28, ordinary citizens may have sufficient notice and may complete the weekend purchases by Friday and abide by the restricted movement norms as was evident in course of the lockdown observed on Sunday, April 25, 2021,” the court said. “As of now, the situation does not appear to be completely out of control, though there are some horror stories in media and some other anecdotes on the social media.”Also Read | Madras high court blames Election Commission for surge in Covid casesThe state submitted to the court that it had enough supply and that chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami had written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi a day ago against oxygen diversion so that oxygen is available for Tamil Nadu even in a worst-case scenario. The court also suggested that vaccine-manufacturing units at Chengalpattu, Coonoor and Ooty could be re-started. The state informed the court that Remdesivir is being sold at ₹1,400 plus GST per vial and a counter has been opened specifically for this purpose at Kilpauk Medical College. The Centre has allotted 59,000 vials of Remdesivir till April 30 to Tamil Nadu against pending orders of the state totalling 250,000. State health secretary J Radhakrishnan informed the court that only 25% of the Covid-infected may need hospital admission and 15% of them may need oxygen beds. The court noted that people may panic and hinder functioning at hospitals and healthcare centres as many have expressed serious concerns over black marketing of drugs, on the number of beds being far too few and on the lack of information regarding the availability of beds, drugs and doses of vaccine. Based on the court’s suggestion, the state agreed to widely publicise the do’s and don’ts.Both Tamil Nadu and Puducherry have announced a series of curbs starting Monday, such as closure of places of worship, spas, beauty parlours and salons to check the spread of the virus.The court will hear the matter next on April 29 unless it has to be taken up earlier on an urgent basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/counting-of-votes-madras-hc-suggests-may-1-2-lockdown-to-tn-puducherry-101619507664742.html

Electricity will be provided by the state."Justice DY Chandrachud asks, "When can you start the plant?""We can start producing oxygen in maybe 10 days," Salve replies.Also Read | Tamil Nadu allows Vedanta to temporarily reopen, company opposes operation of oxygen plant by govt"There is a national calamity," the judge further said, referring to the shortage of medical oxygen reported from hospitals across the country which has led to concerns over treatment of Covid-19 patients, especially those in serious condition, amid a rapid and alarming surge in daily new cases of the viral disease.On Monday, hours after the Tamil Nadu government's decision, Vedanta opposed the top court's suggestion from last week to let the state government operate the oxygen production unit at the plant, saying, "it is just beyond the competency and financial ability of the government to run this oxygen plant." The government's order, on its part, only mentioned that a government committee, including members of the civil society, will be set up to oversee the functioning of the plant.Also Read | Vedanta seeks to reopen Tuticorin unit for oxygen output.

The Madras high court, last year, dismissed Vedanta's appeal to reopen the plant.

At a time like this, when the country passes one grim milestone after another, Janaki Omkumar and Naveen Razak, students at Thrissur Medical College attempted to break the monotony and spread cheer with their dance moves on Boney M’s 1978 hit Euro-disco track ‘Rasputin’, as part of the popular Rasputin challenge that is sweeping social media across the world. Although the video went viral on social media, it took a communal turn when the video began garnering hate as the two students belonged to different religious communities.To protest against the hate meted out to the video, more medical students have joined the Rasputin dance challenge and shared videos on social media platforms. These videos were then reshared using the hashtag #StepWithRasputin and have also been collated on Instagram by student political organisation SFI’s Cochin University of Science and Technology wing.Earlier as well, Tharoor had praised the original video by Janaki Omkumar and Naveen Razak, tweeting, “These kids deserve applause and encouragement, instead of the Hindutva venom being spewed at them because of their different religions. They ooze both talent & comradeship, the best of Young India.

27-04-2021||India||SC appointed panel suggests scrapping railway project in Western Ghats||Empowered Committee (CEC) constituted by the Supreme Court has recommended withdrawal of the environmental approval to doubling of the single line railway track between Tinaighat in North Karnataka and the port town of Vasco da Gama in Goa. The line cuts across the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats and the CEC said that the project will only marginally enhance railway capacity but cause big damage to the fragile ecosystem of the Western Ghats, an internationally recognised Biodiversity hotspot. The recommendation is being seen as a big win for environmental activists. The CEC also recommended that the Goa-Tamnar 440KV power line should be set up along the alignment of the existing power line to save fresh forest areas from intrusion. In the third major recommendation, the panel cleared the four-laning of NH-4A between Anmod and Panajim if done as an elevated corridor to prevent any harm to the wildlife. All three projects were cleared in April last year by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife (SCNBWL), chaired by Union minister of forests Prakash Javadekar, sparking uproar and protests in Goa. The Goa Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) invested in preserving the ecology, challenged the projects in the SC. A copy of the CEC report was submitted to the top court and another was given to the Goa Foundation.“[The] CEC does not find any justification for undertaking a project of this nature which will destroy the fragile ecosystem of the Western Ghats... an internationally recognised Biodiversity hotspot and one of the most important wildlife corridors of the Country. Moreover this doubling project will only be marginally enhancing the capacity of the most inefficient section of the Railway Network passing through ecologically sensitive and biodiversity rich tiger Reserve, two Wildlife Sanctuaries and a National Park,” the CEC headed by P V Jayakrishnan, said. “In these circumstances it is recommended… to revoke the permission granted by the (SCNBWL) for doubling of the railway track,” the CEC said. The railway line passes through the Western Ghats from Tinaighat-Castlerock in Karnataka to Kulem in Goa, involving 120.875 hectare of forest land from the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary (BMWLS) in Goa, 10.45 and 0.88 hectare in Dandeli Wildlife Sanctuary and Haliyal Forest Division respectively in Karnataka. In 2010, the Ministry of Railways sanctioned the doubling of the existing Hospet-Tinaighat-Vasco railway line of a total length of 342 kilometres. The first phase between Hospet and Tinai ghat involved easier terrain atop the largely flat Deccan plateau and had already been completed. It was the second phase between Tinaighat and Vasco da Gama, involving crossing the steep slopes, raging rivers and the thick forests of the Western Ghats as well as the densely populated areas of coastal Goa, that was contested. The railways maintained there was no alternative to the current alignment passing through the protected area and claimed the existing single railway line was saturated. The authorities had also announced four underpasses to allow for wildlife crossings, which activists dismissed as insufficient.The CEC in its findings, recorded that the doubling of the existing rail line will not have any positive impact on the gradient and curvature of the new line and it will operate at the same inefficient level as the existing line, made in 1890s. The CEC also observed that the proposed doubling of the line will pose a serious impediment for the movement of long-ranging animals like tigers and elephants. “At present the Konkan railway line gives excellent connectivity to Northern and Southern parts of India. The connectivity between Goa and Karnataka is being strengthened/improved by way of 4 laning of NH-4A [between Belgaum and Panaji] along the same route and by the development of a new airport,” the CEC said. The SC will now decide whether to accept or reject the recommendations in the CEC report. The Goa Foundation has welcomed the findings of the CEC but said they will consult other environmental activist groups before finalising the stance before the top court in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-appointed-panel-suggests-scrapping-railway-project-in-western-ghats-101619501843506.html
27-04-2021||India||India likely to receive Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccines from Russia on May 1||India is expecting to receive the first batch of Russia's Covid-19 vaccine 'Sputnik V' on May 1, according to an official of the Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF), cited by news agency Reuters. Kirill Dmitriev, the head of the RDIF, told the news agency that the first doses of Sputnik V will be delivered on May 1, adding that he hoped the Russian supplies would help India navigate its way out of the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic in time.India, the world's second-most populous country, is struggling with the new, more infectious wave of the pandemic, as hospitals throughout the nation report running out of bed and critical oxygen supplies. India's new coronavirus cases stayed above 300,000 for the sixth consecutive day on Tuesday, recording 323,144 daily Covid-19 cases in the preceding 24 hours. As many as 2,771 new deaths were reported, but health experts believe the tally runs significantly higher.Several countries, including Britain, Germany, and the United States have pledged to send urgent medical aid to help tackle the coronavirus crisis that is overwhelming India's hospitals. At this time, the arrival of the Sputnik V shot from Russia would mean an addition to India's vaccine arsenal, which is currently running dry with Serum Institute of India's 'Covishield' (the Oxford-AstraZeneca shot) and Bharat Biotech's indigenous 'Covaxin' vaccines.Although the RDIF chief did not specify how many Sputnik V vaccines would there be in the first batch or where they would be made, Reuters reported that Russia's sovereign wealth fund, which is marketing Sputnik V globally, has already signed agreements with five leading Indian manufacturers for over 850 million doses of the vaccine a year. The RDIF has said it expects production of the vaccine in India to reach 50 million doses a month by the summer and to rise further.Meanwhile, Russian pharmaceutical firm Pharmasyntez said earlier on Monday that it was ready to ship up to 1 million packs of the Remdesivir antiviral drug to India by the end of May, once it has received the approval of Russia's government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-likely-to-receive-sputnik-v-covid-19-vaccines-from-russia-on-may-1-101619498099409.html

Issuing an order to the chief electoral officers of all states and union territories, the EC said that it has decided to put out more stringent provisions, to be followed during the process of vote-counting. No victory processions after the counting on May 2 shall be permissible. Additionally, no more than two persons shall be allowed to accompany the winning candidate while receiving the election certificate, the poll body said.Also Read: Election Commission is BJP’s parrot: West Bengal CM Mamata BanerjeeIn a letter signed by Sumit Mukherjee, the senior public relations secretary to the Election Commission of India, the poll body said that it had issued broad guidelines on August 21 last year to conduct elections during Covid-19, after receiving suggestions from national and state-based political parties. The guidelines for political parties conducting election campaigns and public meetings had also been reviewed based on suggestions received from various chief electoral officers of states and union territories, the letter read. The Covid-19 related provisions for counting of votes on May 2 are to be in accordance with the broad guidelines dated August 21, 2020, with the addition of the new protocols issued today."No victory procession after the counting on 2.5.2021 shall be permissible.

Coming down heavily on the poll body, the high court bench said that a proper "blueprint" of a plan to ensure Covid-19 protocols are followed on May 2 must be submitted before it by April 30, failing which the court might even resort to stopping the counting of votes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/election-commission-bans-victory-processions-on-or-after-counting-on-may-2-101619499681690.html
27-04-2021||India||Use masks indoors until you’re sure your family isn't infected: Gagandeep Kang||The government on Monday urged people to do more to break the chain of Covid-19 transmission with VK Paul, member (Health), Niti Aayog, saying people may need to wear masks even while they are at home. Gagandeep Kang, a virologist at Vellore’s Christian Medical College, spoke to Sunetra Choudhary about the need for wearing masks even indoors. Edited excerpts:Is there a need to wear masks at home even if there is not a Covid-19 patient around?The thing to think about is how are infections acquired. Infections are acquired when you have someone who is infected in your vicinity and that person is a source. When that person, speaks, eats, sings, breathes in and out, she will be putting out viral particles even with the new infectious variant for about a week to nine days. With the older version of the virus, we thought it was about a week--two days before symptoms and five days after. Now, what seems to be happening with the UK variant is that the amount of virus that is in the respiratory tract is quite a lot, much more than the ancestral variant. This means that a lot more virus is getting shed. In that situation, whenever you are around infected persons, it makes sense for them and you to mask so that you are each protecting the other. Should you be masking at home? If you are in contact with people that you do not know whether they are infected or not, it makes sense to stay masked. Should you stay masked inside with people you know who have not been exposed to anybody infected? I am not sure what level of risk that has and whether in that situation also you should be masked up.Watch: Everything you want to know about masks, explained by Dr Gagandeep KangSo, if people want to err on the side of caution, they can choose to wear the mask...A lot of infection happens when you are asymptomatic. So, if anyone in your family has been in contact with other people who might be potentially infectious and you want to be sure that they have not really brought the infection home, then it makes sense to stay with a mask until you are sure that your family members have not been infected during the time they were in contact with others. This applies at a time when there is very high transmission outside and you are really worried about the risk. Once the risk settles down and you have less transmission in Delhi, then it might be time to rethink the intensive wearing of masks at home.Also Read | IAF to airlift 6 oxygen containers from Dubai todayIs masking a good idea in homes where someone is going out to work? At this time, there is a very high risk in places like Delhi that a person going outside is going to come in contact with people whose infection status is unknown. Anytime that happens, you should be treating that person as a potentially infectious contact. If you want to be really careful, that is good advice to follow at this time.The other thing is should you be following the same when everyone is vaccinated? In other parts of the world, the [The United States] CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] for example, says if everybody in the family is vaccinated, then it is safe for you to be around each other without masks. If there is an incentive to get vaccinated, that is it.Can you say definitively now that cloth masks are not enough and N95 are required?I think N95 masks are expensive and a luxury. N95 masks without valves are the safest protection that you can have. It is very important that with the N95 or the surgical mask, you wear them well. If for example, your glasses are steaming up on top of the mask, you are not wearing it well as air is coming out from the mask. The order is N95 masks for any situation that is a high risk, three-layered good surgical masks for most other interactions. I would advise that you use...[cloth masks in Delhi] only to make sure the surgical mask is fitting as well as possible.The doubts about masks began following a study about the coronavirus being airborne. What does that mean? The virus has always been airborne as it is a respiratory virus. So, it is a virus that comes out of your track in a range of particle sizes. You can have very small particles and you can have very large ones. Originally when we first heard about the virus, we were not sure there was human to human transmission. When we knew there was, we knew it was due to droplet infections. ...when you breathe out, ...large particle size...settles in an area around you approximately 3-6 feet. ...We now know that it is not only droplets. It is also aerosol that is generated, smaller than the 5-micron cut off. If those particles are that small, they have the ability to float around in the air for a lot longer. So, if you are in an enclosed space with an infected person, those particles will build up over time. So, ventilation is good because it creates an airflow that dilutes the particles out. So how can a person be infected if they have never been near an infectious person? There are two ways. One, you did not know that someone was infected, and they came home. If you live with young people, they may have an asymptomatic infection that was never picked up but was infectious enough to infect an older, susceptible person. The other one that has been hypothesized but not yet proven is that when you have a droplet infection and droplets fall all around you, when you clean after that, those droplets can become an aerosol which can float around for a while and infect someone else. The latter theory sounds a little less clear to me. It has been shown in experimental systems... but for humans, there is no data that backs that.Also Read | Covid-19: Flight from UK carrying vital medical supplies lands in IndiaCould the current situation of oxygen shortage have been avoided?It is difficult to assess. Obviously, we do not have as much oxygen as needed in the worst-hit places at this time. In terms of logistics for establishing new infrastructure, could we have been faster? We could always have been. Did we not do the right thing? I do not think anybody was anticipating a surge of this size. Should we have looked at other countries and predicted this? We did not even though there have been second waves in other places. The behaviour of viruses is difficult to predict. What is happening now, I hope this will be a lesson to us for the future. That building up infrastructure which allows for surge capacity is always going to be a good investment.Do you think our policymakers should have been working very hard from January to March when numbers were down? Did they get complacent?I am working with a group that is seeking to develop a road map for health care in India. We really think that not just for these few months, both short term and long term, we need investments in health and primary health care. This happens time and again. Every time there is an emergency, certain issues get highlighted. As soon as the emergency is over, it is no longer an urgent need. It happened after the first wave. I hope it would not happen after the second.What is the most important step the government can take right now?I think urgent care outside of hospital facilities. So, if they do not have beds, then what is it that you can do to ready beds as soon as possible. Nobody should be left lying outside of a hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-masks-until-you-re-sure-your-family-hasn-t-been-infected-gagandeep-kang-101619499743440.html
27-04-2021||India||Navy to get aircraft carrier Vikrant, missile destroyer Visakhapatnam in 2021||Indian Navy is expected to get delivery of 45,000-tonne indigenous INS Vikrant aircraft carrier and 7,500-tonne Visakhapatnam class stealth guided missile destroyer by end-2021 to add to its capability to defend and dominate the Indo-Pacific region.The indigenous aircraft carrier and INS Visakhapatnam will be formally commissioned into the Navy next year. “Contractual clauses come alive once the warship is handed over to Indian Navy but commissioning takes times as the vessel is to be tested by the Naval personnel for its capability,” said a former Western Navy commander.While the Chinese Navy has commissioned three main battleships last Saturday at Sanya in Hainan naval facility in disputed South China Sea, the Cochin shipyard will start final trials of INS Vikrant as precursor of handing over the carrier to the Indian Navy. The Mazagon Dockyards will complete trials of INS Visakhapatnam and deliver the stealth destroyer close to the Indian Navy Day.Powered by General Electric turbines, INS Vikrant will carry two squadrons of MiG-29K fighters and 10 Kamov Ka -31 helicopters. The aircraft carrier strike force will have a range of over 15000 kilometre with Barak surface to air missile to give aerial protection to the vessel. INS Visakhapatnam’s main attack weapon is anti-ship and land attack BrahMos cruise missiles apart from torpedos for anti-submarine warfare.With the Indian Navy deciding to give preference to nuclear powered conventional submarines in future sea-warfare, the third aircraft carrier also called INS Vishal will now be seen as a replacement for the presently serving INS Vikramaditya. India’s sole aircraft carrier is currently under maintenance and will be available for operations in the coming months. The decision to project INS Vishal as a replacement for INS Vikramaditya means that the third aircraft carrier plan has not been shelved. Instead, it will go on concurrently so that there is no gap when INS Vikramaditya is decommissioned and mothballed.In fact, Indian Navy will add more teeth to its capability next year when INS Arighat, India’s second ballistic missile nuclear submarine, will be delivered to the Strategic Forces Command. The vessel is under trials and will be equipped with 3500 km K-4 intermediate range ballistic missiles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/navy-to-get-aircraft-carrier-vikrant-missile-destroyer-visakhapatnam-in-2021-101619498533809.html
27-04-2021||India||IIT scientists predict India's Covid-19 active caseload likely to peak at 38-48 lakhs in mid-May||Active cases in the ongoing second Covid-19 wave in India may peak at 38-48 lakh between May 14-18 and daily new infections could hit a high of 4.4 lakh from May 4-8, according to a mathematical model by IIT scientists who have revised their projections upwards.India on Monday saw a single-day rise of 3,52,991 (3.52 lakh) Covid-19 infections and 2,812 fatalities with 28,13,658 (28.13 lakh) active cases.The scientists from the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur and Hyderabad applied the Susceptible, Undetected, Tested (positive), and Removed Approach' (SUTRA) model to predict that active cases would go up further by over 10 lakh by mid-May.The latest projection tweaks the time frame as well as the numbers.Last week, the researchers predicted the pandemic may peak between May 11-15 with 33-35 lakh total active cases and decline steeply by the end of May.Earlier this month, their modelling approach projected that active infections in the country would peak by April 15, which didn't come true.“This time, I have also computed minimum and maximum for predicted values and posted it. I am reasonably confident that the actual values will be within the min and max values mentioned,” Maninder Agrawal, professor at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT-Kanpur, told PTI.On Sunday, Agrawal shared the new peak values for active and new Covid cases in a Twitter thread.“Peak timing: May 14-18 for active infections and May 4-8 for new infections. Peak value: 38-48 lakhs for active infections and 3.4 to 4.4 lakhs for new infections,” he said.He also noted that it was not clear what the final values would be.“I have now computed a range of values for peak value and timing and the final numbers should be within this range,” Agrawal said in another tweet.Explaining the changing projections of the model over time, Agrawal said, “The primary reason is that there is a continuous slow drift in parameter values of current phase for India. This makes the guess of the right values difficult. That is causing a slow change in predictions.”The scientists in the as yet unpublished study said there are several novel features in the SUTRA model.Whereas previous papers divided the patient population into asymptomatic and Infected, the new model also accounts for the fact that some fraction of asymptomatic patients could also be detected due to contact tracing and other such protocols.The IIT Kanpur professor noted that the SUTRA model uses three main parameters to predict the course of the pandemic.The first is called beta, or contact rate, which measures how many people an infected person infects per day. It is related to the R-nought value, which is the number of people an infected person spreads the virus to over the course of their infection, Agrawal explained.The other two parameters are ‘reach', which is a measure of the exposure level of the population to the pandemic, and ‘epsilon' which is the ratio of detected and undetected cases.Independent calculations by Gautam Menon and his team at Ashoka University in Haryana had predicted that the peak of the ongoing wave of infections could be between mid-April and mid-May.Menon also cautioned that such projections of Covid-19 cases should really be trusted only in the short term.Any excessively precise prediction, of a peak within just a five-day window would ignore the many uncertainties associated with the inputs to any such calculation, Menon, who was not involved in the modelling, had told PTI earlier.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-scientists-predict-india-s-covid-19-active-caseload-likely-to-peak-at-38-48-lakhs-in-midmay-101619498786123.html

Health ministry’s graphic explains||Following Covid-appropriate behaviour, using non-medical interventions such as wearing a face mask, face cover and maintaining a minimum of six-feet distance, can significantly reduce the risk of transmission of the coronavirus from an infected person, a graphic shared by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Tuesday showed.Taking to Twitter, the ministry tweeted the graphic with the text “Follow Covid appropriate behaviour to lower the risk of transmission.” The image showed the varying levels of risk of an uninfected person contracting the virus from those already infected, with the highest chance of transmission being 90% risk when no distance is maintained and no face masks or covers are used.#Unite2FightCorona pic.twitter.com/00nlbyuajiHowever, the chance of transmission remains the lowest with negligible risk when a facemask and cover is worn and a minimum of six-feet distance is maintained from the patient, the image showed.The graphic also highlighted that discarding the distancing rule, despite both the infected and the uninfected wearing a face mask and cover, posed a 1.5% risk with a low chance of transmission of the virus. Also, when the uninfected person is without a mask and within six feet of an infected person, the risk increases to 5% with a medium chance of transmission, even if the infected person is masked, the graphic showed.Also read | Flight from UK carrying vital medical supplies lands in IndiaIn the advisory, the health ministry red-flagged two conditions which posed a bigger risk with higher chances of transmission. When an infected person is not wearing a mask, the risk increases to 30% with a high chance of transmission within six-feet distance, in spite of the other person wearing a mask.The highest chance of transmission is possible when all such safety measures are discarded and both the infected and uninfected do not wear a mask or a face cover and are within six feet distance of each other. The risk increases to 90% in this case, the image showed.The advisory from the ministry comes at a time when the country is reeling under the second wave of the pandemic.

27-04-2021||India||France joins global call to help India, to send medical equipment||France is the latest country to join the global call for support to India India ride out the crisis of coronavirus pandemic that has destabilised the country’s healthcare mechanism.The French government late on Sunday said that President Emmanuel Jean-Michel Frédéric Macron has requested the country’s ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs to mobilise a solidarity operation to support India ride out the crisis of coronavirus pandemic with the help of the French embassy in India.ALSO READ: Covid-19: What you need to know todayThe statement released by the French ministry said the operation will air and sea support to deliver 8 oxygen concentrators, containers of liquid oxygen, specialized medical equipment including 28 respirators and 200 electric syringe pumps among others.The call for support comes at a time when India is facing an acute crisis of medical oxygen as state governments and hospitals scramble for oxygen for thousands of critical patients across the country.ALSO READ: Why India is facing an oxygen crisis as Covid-19 cases mountFrance said the oxygen concentrators that it will provide can provide a hospital with oxygen autonomy for a dozen years. “These units are permanent fixtures that can produce medical oxygen from the oxygen present in the air. Each one can continuously supply a 250-bed hospital. The system’s flow rate is sufficient for 15 intubated Covid patients in a resuscitation care unit (or 30 patients in conventional intensive care) or 150 patients requiring oxygen in a conventional hospital setting. Also included are devices to refill oxygen cylinders,” a statement released by French ministry for Europe and Foreign Affairs read.It further said that in response to needs expressed by Indian officials the equipment is designed to respond to the emergency but also to boost the capacity of Indian hospitals over the long term to treat patients and fight the pandemic.“France and India have always stood together in solidarity at difficult times. This solidarity lies at the heart of our strategic partnership and the friendship between the French and Indian people,” the release read.Close allies United States, United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia have come forward to support India’s fight against Covid-19 pandemic with Washington asking its nearest bases to air-lift oxygen generators, concentrators, Remdesivir anti-viral drug and raw materials for vaccine in the next 48 hours. On Monday, US President Joe Biden took to Twitter to say that his administration is determined for India to tide over the crisis of coronavirusUAE is sending a huge shipment of oxygen concentrators and Saudi Arabia large number of oxygen generators to India.Medical support to India has started to come from countries like Denmark, Singapore Israel and some other EU nations in reciprocation to New Delhi’s solidarity for the world when it stood firm with the democratic world in supply of much-needed drugs and vaccine.Under its ‘vaccine maitri’ initiative, India supplied much-needed drugs in the form of grants as well as on commercial basis. Since the Covid-19 pandemic started last year, India supplied hydroxychloroquine to the US and Europe with the total number of countries touching 150. India supplied 6.5 crore vaccine doses to 93 countries in Asia, Latin America and African countries apart from UK.India's Covid-19 crisis continued unabated as the country reported over 300,000 new infections of the disease for the fifth straight day on Monday.

27-04-2021||India||Madras high court blames Election Commission for surge in Covid cases||The Madras high court on Monday observed that the Election Commission of India (ECI) was responsible for the second wave in the country and that its officials should probably be tried on murder charges for allowing political parties to hold massive rallies without following Covid-19 norms.The first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy warned ECI that the court could even stall the counting of votes on May 2 unless it produced a blueprint on April 30 on Covid-19 protocol at counting centres. “At no cost can counting result as a catalyst for a further surge, politics or no politics, whether the counting takes place in a staggered manner or is deferred,” the court said.An official familiar with the functioning of ECI said that the poll watchdog has told the high court that according to the Covid-19 rules notified under the Disaster Management Act, 2005, the State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA) has the responsibility to ensure the rules are followed. “Commission has always emphasised in its 21.8.2020 and all subsequent instructions that the State authorities shall ensure COVID compliance in the matter of public gatherings etc. for campaign purposes. At no occasion, the Commission takes over the task of SDMA for enforcement of COVID-19 instructions,” it told the high court, according to official who did not want to be named.“The campaign [for Tamil Nadu] ended on 4.4.2021. Fortunately, the second wave of COVID-19 was yet to be visible fully by that time. Polling was conducted following all prescribed COVID appropriate measures on 6.4.2021, which witnessed good electoral participation with full compliance of norms by all concerned,” the commission told the high court, the officials said.The election commission has come under criticism for its decision to allow political parties to wilfully flout Covid-19 protocol through huge rallies, with most participants, including the political leaders unmasked. The body has, from time to time, issued guidelines reiterating the importance of adhering to Covid-19 protocol but has steered well clear of acting against any leader or party for flouting these. ECI has also come under fire for staggering the West Bengal assembly elections across eight phases, and for making no effort to combine later phases even after it became clear that India was facing a serious health crisis.“When campaigning was on going in Tamil Nadu, we did not have so many cases and polling also ended before cases began to rise,” said Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) spokesperson A Saravanan. “Perhaps ECI could have imposed certain curbs. Except for the BJP [Bharatiya Janata Party], all parties in Bengal asked for the last phases to be clubbed. Until Modi cancelled his rallies, ECI didn’t bring in restrictions and by then cases had exponentially risen.”West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee welcomed the Madras high court observations “which clearly said ECI cannot escape its responsibility”. “Both Prime Minister Modi and EC are responsible for the (current) situation (of Covid spreading in the state),” Banerjee alleged at a workers meeting in North Kolkata on Monday.The HC order was passed during a hearing on a writ petition filed by Tamil Nadu transport minister MR Vijayabhaskar seeking a direction for safety measures and fairness during counting in Karur constituency from where he is contesting.“You are the only institution that is singularly responsible for the situation today,” the chief justice said during the hearing. “No action against political parties taking rallies despite court orders. Your election commission officials should be put up on murder charges probably.”In its order copy released later in the day, the court had toned down its observations against the election body as the statement on murder charges wasn’t part of the written order.The bench noted that face masks, sanitizers weren’t used and no social distancing was maintained during election campaigning. “Were you on another planet when the election rallies were held?” the chief justice asked the ECI counsel, Niranjan Rajagoapalan.Stating that public health is of paramount importance, the court said, “It is only when a citizen survives that he’ll be able to enjoy the rights that a democratic republic guarantees.” The court directed ECI to file a blueprint after a detailed consultation with the state health secretary.Assembly elections were held in four states- Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam, West Bengal and the union territory of Puducherry . Except for Bengal, elections have concluded in other states. All these states are seeing a surge in cases, but so is almost every part of India.India ended Monday with 319,509 news cases of Covid-19 and 2,764 new deaths, taking its totally tally to 17,625,626 cases and 197,901 deaths. Daily cases have risen over 400% since April 1, and daily deaths, over 600%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/madras-high-court-blames-election-commission-for-surge-in-covid-cases-101619488095052.html
27-04-2021||India||Biden pledges US help for India’s Covid fight||US President Joe Biden on Monday pledged his support for India’s Covid-19 response through emergency assistance such as ventilators and vaccine raw materials, even as Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasised the importance of ensuring “smooth and open supply chains”.These matters figured in a phone conversation between the two leaders, a day after the US announced it would supply raw materials urgently needed for making the Covishield vaccine and oxygen generation equipment to bolster India’s efforts to counter a second wave of record-breaking Covid-19 cases.Shortly after the conversation, US surgeon general Vivek Murthy announced a plan to share America’s stock of AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines with the world. Murthy said in a tweet that 60 million doses will be shared “as they become available” but didn’t give details.US lawmakers and experts had called on the Biden administration to do more to support India, which set a global record for the rise in infections for the fifth consecutive day on Monday, with 352,991 new cases reported since Sunday. The US has also faced criticism from some quarters for what was perceived as a lethargic response to the crisis in India.According to a readout from the White House, Biden “pledged America’s steadfast support for the people of India who have been impacted by the recent surge in Covid-19 cases”. The US is providing a “range of emergency assistance, including oxygen-related supplies, vaccine materials, and therapeutics”, it said.Modi emphasised the “need to ensure smooth and open supply chains of raw materials and inputs required for manufacture of vaccines, medicines, and therapeutics”, said a statement from the Indian side.Experts believe India will be among the countries to immediately benefit from the US plan to share its stocks of AstraZeneca vaccine, which is made under licence by the Serum Institute of India and is one of the two shots rolled out for India’s immunisation programme. The AstraZeneca shot isn’t approved for use in the US and the Biden administration had faced immense global pressure for not taking a call on sharing its stockpile.The US will begin sharing the AstraZeneca vaccine once it clears federal safety reviews, and doses are expected to be available for export in the coming months, the White House told The Associated Press.“Given the strong portfolio of vaccines that the US already has and that have been authorised by the FDA, and given that the AstraZeneca vaccine is not authorised for use in the US, we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next several months,” said White House Covid-19 coordinator Jeff Zients.Zients said the process of safety reviews could be completed in the next several weeks. About 10 million doses of AstraZeneca vaccine have already been produced and another 50 million doses could be available to ship in May and June.Modi described his conversation with Biden as fruitful and tweeted: “We discussed the evolving COVID situation in both countries in detail. I thanked President Biden for the support being provided by the United States to India.”He also tweeted that he had “underscored the importance of smooth and efficient supply chains of vaccine raw materials” at a time when the India-US health care partnership “can address the global challenge of Covid-19”.Modi briefed Biden on India’s efforts to contain the second wave of Covid-19 infections through expedited vaccination efforts and ensuring the supply of critical medicines, therapeutics and health care equipment.Biden said the US is “determined to support India’s efforts by quickly deploying resources such as therapeutics, ventilators and identifying sources of raw materials to be made available for the manufacture of Covishield vaccines”, the Indian statement said.Since February, the Indian side has urged the US to ease curbs imposed on exports of vaccine raw materials after the Biden administration invoked the Defense Production Act, which requires American suppliers to prioritise orders from American buyers. This was done in line with Biden’s plans to vaccinate all Americans by the end of May.However, as Covid-19 cases spiked in India, there were growing calls in both countries for the export curbs to be eased so that Indian manufacturers could ramp up the production of vaccines.The White House readout further said the two leaders resolved that the US and India will “stand shoulder-to-shoulder in the effort to protect our citizens”. The Indian statement said Modi mentioned India’s commitment to contain the pandemic globally through the Vaccine Maitri initiative and participation in the COVAX and the Quad vaccine initiatives.Modi also raised with Biden India’s initiative at the WTO for relaxing norms under the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) to ensure quick and affordable access to vaccines and medicines for developing countries.Meanwhile, a key American official said on Monday the US is diverting its own “pending orders” of vaccine raw materials to help India and that earlier supply bottlenecks were not the result of an export ban.Tim Manning, the White House Covid-19 supply coordinator, explained an issue that made the Biden administration look egregiously insensitive to the crisis in India and said the Defense Production Act “doesn’t even mean a ‘de facto’ ban”.“Now here’s what we did yesterday: we diverted our pending orders of vaccine filters to India’s vaccine manufacturing effort. This will help India make more vaccine,” Manning said.Manning set up his argument in the context of an unprecedented demand in vaccines globally, going up from four billion a year, mainly for flu and measles, to 14 billion because of the Covid-19 epidemic, and this strained the global supply chains.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/biden-pledges-us-help-for-india-s-covid-fight-101619474795324.html

She added that the bodies were being brought to Joshimath in Chamoli area for post-mortem and completion of other formalities so that death certificates could be issued as soon as possible.Bhadoria also said that at least three to four persons are still believed to be missing. As many as 384 people who were working with BRO were shifted to a safer location, she added.The snow avalanche, which occurred at around 4 pm on Friday, hit Sumna area near the border at an altitude of over 11,000 ft when several labourers of Border Road Organisation were working at the site. A search and rescue operation was immediately initiated by the personnel of the Indian Army’s Central Command to rescue the trapped persons.Seven persons were injured in the incident. While one of them was brought to Dehradun, the remaining were taken to AIIMS Rishikesh for treatment.The avalanche occurred less than 100km from Raini village which was affected by a glacier breach on February 7. The glacier breach which triggered an avalanche and deadly floods in Chamoli district, killed at least 72 people and destroyed two hydroelectric projects.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/chamoli-avalanche-death-toll-reaches-15-101619474835407.html

Four hailed from Hisar and one from Punjab.Hisar deputy superintendent of police Rajbir Singh confirmed that five Covid-19 patients died at the hospital but added that the exact cause of death was yet to be ascertained.“The relatives of the deceased alleged that all of them were on ventilator support and died due to shortage of oxygen supply. The hospital authorities have not spoken on the issue yet,” he added.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said a magisterial probe was ordered into the incident. ”There is no oxygen shortage either in Hisar or at any other place,” he said.But relatives of the deceased said the lack of medical oxygen was responsible for the incident.“The doctors failed to provide proper treatment to my uncle and he died due to shortage of oxygen supply,” the nephew of a 42-year-old deceased said.The brother of a 43-year-old victim said he visited another hospital to bring a cylinder for his brother but in vain as the patient passed away before his arrival.The oxygen reportedly ran out of supply at 12 am on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. After several efforts to ensure supply, the hospital staff later allegedly brought two gas cylinders from another private hospital but till then, all five had died.Three manufacturing units in Hisar provides nine metric tonnes of oxygen to various hospitals in Hisar, Agroha and Sirsa, which is more than sufficient, an official said. “The oxygen is being supplied to various hospitals as per patients numbers. There is no shortage of oxygen in the district,” the official added.This is the third incident of Covid-19 patients dying, allegedly of oxygen shortage in the state, in the past 24 hours.A day ago, four patients each died at private hospitals in Gurugram and Rewari respectively, allegedly due to shortage of oxygen supply. An inquiry was ordered in both the cases.Four people died at Rewari’s Virat hospital on Sunday afternoon and four other critically Covid-19 patients, who were on ventilator support at Kathuria hospital in Gurugram, died due to shortage of oxygen supply, according to hospital management.Kathuria Hospital owner Dr AK Kathuria said they had informed the health department regarding the oxygen supply. However, around 3pm, the cylinders went empty and four patients lost their lives, he said.Virat Hospital operational head Dharmender Kumar said that 114 Covid-infected patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital. “Three patients died in ICU, while one died in the ward. We need over 300 oxygen cylinders on a daily basis, but our supply has been reduced. We have been repeatedly reporting this to the administration,” he added.Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni said a probe will be conducted into the deaths. “ A medical negligence board has been setup to analysis the reasons behind the deaths,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-covid-patients-die-in-hisar-hospital-kin-allege-oxygen-shortage-101619486034954.html

At his age, and in these times of pandemic’s great surge, he ought to be snuggled inside his home. Instead, on this early morning, he is out in the streets, on his bicycle, at work.“I have to earn whatever little I can,” says Muhammed Fazil. Even in these times of curfew, he pedals about this south Delhi neighbourhood, collecting empty bottles and boxes from the pavements, and selling them to a recycler.“I’m also a spice seller.”Before the city shut down in the most recent Covid-ridden crisis, Mr Fazil would pedal all the way to the famous spice market in Old Delhi’s Khari Baoli to get the masalas, which he would hawk in little sachets in south Delhi localities. “My spice trade has stopped for the time,” he says, shrugging his shoulders, as if implying he has surrendered to events beyond his control.But that’s not the thing worrying him for the moment. “My family in Rampur—my wife and daughters—I haven’t been able to send them money for weeks.”Until a month back, Mr Fazil would be able to earn ₹500 daily, “but now I’m lucky if I can make even ₹100.”He notes that things were never this bad—“Good people would sometimes help me with cash... but now nobody wants to help.” Everybody is concerned for their own emergencies, he explains.“I have six daughters... four are still to be married,” he says, giving a nervous chuckle.Working in Delhi since 1979, Mr Fazil lives alone. “These days I wake up early in the morning because I’m keeping roza (Ramzan fast).” He cycles around the area, returning to his single-room home in the evening in time for prayers and for iftar, when the fast ends. “Then I cook dal roti.” Not knowing when his life might return to old certainties, he hesitantly confesses that “my family is surviving by God’s generosity... but for how long?”Although he is wearing a mask, isn’t he scared of venturing outside, and catching the virus?Mr Fazil looks on blankly, and says after a long pause—“who knows what will happen tomorrow?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-surge-era-portrait-101619485849891.html
27-04-2021||NA||Covid-19 LIVE: Andhra Pradesh reports over 11,000 new cases in last 24 hours||India's Covid-19 crisis continued unabated as the country reported over 300,000 new infections of the disease for the sixth straight day on Tuesday. With 323,144 new cases of the coronavirus disease and 2,771 fatalities, the country's cases tally reached 17,636,307 while the death toll climbed to 197,894.

27-04-2021||India||A tenure that withered on the vine||Justice SA Bobde is perhaps the only Chief Justice of India in the country’s judicial history who gave a clean chit to his predecessor as well as his successor. Leading an in-house inquiry as the second senior-most judge in the court, cleared former CJI Ranjan Gogoi in a case of sexual harassment; then, as CJI, he cleared the decks for justice NV Ramana by shutting a complaint of alleged impropriety against the latter from Andhra Pradesh CM YS Jagan Mohan Reddy. Both the inquiries were conducted with utmost secrecy by an institution that otherwise preaches transparency and decries conflict of interest.However, there are more than one reason why justice Bobde’s tenure reflects peculiarity. His 17-month tenure, most part of which was spent conducting proceedings through video-conferencing, was marked by justice Bobde’s idiosyncrasies instead of an institutional response. This was a man who made the headlines, repeatedly, for his utterances; the following day was usually spent clarifying what had been said or contradicting the older statements. In March, he asked a government employee seeking protection from arrest in a rape case if he was willing to marry the survivor? A week later, justice Bobde blamed the incident on “misreporting” and said he had highest respect for women. Similarly, in a hearing earlier this month, justice Bobde commented on how some women lawyers had turned down offers to become judges because of familial responsibilities and education of their children. Two days later, the CJI was yet again clarifying that he did not mean all women lawyers had declined to become judges because of family issues.Two days before his retirement, justice Bobde’s bench took suo motu cognisance of the crisis triggered by the second Covid-19 wave, and decided to monitor the equitable distribution of medical supplies. The move was contentious because at least seven high courts were already supervising these issues in their jurisdiction, keeping the Centre and state governments on their toes. Justice Bobde, in his distinctive style, once again remarked that the Supreme Court would consider transferring all the cases from the high courts to itself – something that the Union government said was the proper course of action. Justice Bobde appointed senior advocate Harish Salve as the amicus curiae to assist the court even though Salve represented Vedanta, which wanted its controversial shuttered plant in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi reopened for producing oxygen. A massive controversy erupted with several senior lawyers raising questions if this was an attempt to hold the hands of the proactive high courts. On his last working day, justice Bobde was seen not only issuing a clarification about there being no restraint against the high courts but also retiring without hearing this case any further. Salve withdrew as amicus in the wake of the disputations over his possible conflict of interest.The issues that arose out of justice Bobde’s personal traits were sometimes compounded by a lack of judicial determinateness and decisiveness by the benches he headed, leaving very little as his legacy as a Supreme Court judge. He headed the benches which were seized of some of the most important cases of the times, including validity of statutes, such as the three farm laws, the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, and the constitutional amendment providing for quota for economically weaker section; the Sabarimala case which was expanded to include various other religions and their practices; the definition of a “money bill”; the validity of electoral bonds; the deportation of Rohingya refugees; and the handling of the migrants’ crisis during the lockdown last year. Not one of these cases attained finality. Interim orders passed in some of these matters simply meant more delays in long-pending cases, often without good reason.Meanwhile, cases of constitutional importance were put on the back burner. An argument can be made that constitutional matters involve at least five judges, a battery of lawyers, and a lot of paperwork, making them infeasible once the top court shifted to virtual hearings. However, it is pertinent to underscore that CJI Bobde did set up a five-judge bench when he decided in April to issue guidelines for cheque-bounce cases in a suo motu matter. Another five-judge bench also heard on a day-to-day basis and reserved its verdict in the Maratha reservation case in March this year. Moreover, most of the benches in the apex court did not sit for full hours, till 4pm on several days during the pandemic. Experts have pointed out that matters of constitutional import, if not decided immediately when they are topical and impact citizenry of the country, run the risk of becoming an academic exercise in adjudication, and may well benefit the executive.Justice Bobde’s inclination towards constitution of committees and commissions in various matters also appeared to be symptomatic of a reluctance to close matters. He formed panels in cases on farm laws, the Hyderabad and Vikas Dubey encounters, environment and wildlife-related matters such as monetary valuation of a tree, protection of rare species of birds and the undergrounding of high-tension wires, and the water dispute between Delhi and Haryana. Some panels have submitted their reports, and others are yet to express their views.Interestingly, justice Bobde launched parallel proceedings in several cases that the jurisdictional high courts were already looking into, causing some amount of consternation in legal circles. At the moment, both the Supreme Court and the Allahabad high court are seized of challenges to Uttar Pradesh government’s anti-conversion law. Despite being informed that the high court was examining the validity of the law, justice Bobde neither left it to the high court to decide nor transferred all the cases to the apex court. Similarly, justice Bobde agreed to examine the new user privacy policy of WhatsApp while the Delhi high court was already hearing the same. In the Hathras case, even after the Allahabad high court took suo motu notice, justice Bobde admitted the matter, asked the UP government to clarify certain aspects, observing: “We want to widen the high court proceedings and make it more relevant.” However, in less than a month, he had a change of heart and his bench acknowledged that the matter was already being examined by the high court. It finally referred everything back to the high court.The tenure of justice Bobde will also be remembered for another unlikely distinction. He is the first CJI in judicial history who has retired without making recommendation for a single appointment in the top court after the advent of the collegium system in 1990s. Even during an unprecedented standoff between the judiciary and the central government over the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) that aimed to redefine the appointment process, the then CJI, HL Dattu, made one appointment. But justice Bobde was unable to do this. When he retired last week, the top court had only one woman judge. The failure was indicative of a lack of cohesion and understanding between justice Bobde and other judges in the collegium.The shortage of judges across the high courts also rose to a new high with around 40% positions being vacant during his tenure. But as the first judge of the country and guardian of judiciary, justice Bobde’s endeavours fell way short of nudging the high court chief justices into sending proposals for appointments, resulting in a situation where there are no names for consideration for at least 200 positions of high court judges.Having not been able to do much on the administrative side, justice Bobde, however, did try to deal with the issue of pendency of cases and shortage of judges on the judicial side. His bench paved way for the high courts to appoint ad hoc judges to deal with old cases but with an array of stipulations and limitations. The order made the entire process cumbersome and conditional on several factors instead of letting each high court devise its own formula, based on its own needs. Similarly, his bench sought to fix a timeline for the government to clear the appointment of judges to the high courts, but did not prescribe any schedule for the high courts to send names , which is the first and the most important step in the entire process. He also delivered a judgment in the Tata Vs Cyrus Mistry case, ruling in favour of the former while rendering a contentious jurisprudence on the rights of minority shareholders.Justice Bobde’s tenure came across opportunities to affirm the supremacy of judiciary by making the executive accountable and by deciding issues of seminal importance that mattered the most to the citizens at a particular point in time. Most remain unresolved, though, and CJI Ramana may have to start from scratch.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cji-sa-bobde-a-tenure-that-withered-on-the-vine-101619480203818.html
27-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India will likely cross a total of 200,000 reported deaths on account of the coronavirus disease on Tuesday. In the absence of standardised death data — the number of people who can be expected to die in a region in a certain length of time; and ideally, this should be a long period average that takes into account various population metrics — there is no way to accurately arrive at a so-called excess death number for the entire country.The only way to do this is to assume other parameters; for instance, some models doing the rounds assume the degree of under-reporting and estimate the number of deaths. A better approach may be to make two assumptions: one, the infection fatality rate for Covid-19, the proportion of people dying to those infected; and two, the proportion of cases unreported or undiagnosed for every recorded Covid-19 case. The second could be one in 10, 15, maybe even 20 or 25; and the first, based on what we know of other viral diseases in general, 0.1% (conservatively). I’ll leave the math to readers interested enough to work it out because this is a hypothetical exercise, although it is evident from HT’s own ground reporting, and that of other media, that there is a discrepancy between the claimed death numbers appearing against each state in the HT dashboard (this is sourced from the state health departments), and the number of Covid-19 cremations and burials taking place every day.Most models expect the situation to stabilise by the third week of May, but there’s no telling. The positivity rates of many states are at a level where a sharp fall is next to impossible (and will possibly suggest manipulation); and some states (notably Maharashtra) saw their positivity rates plateau at a relatively high level during the first wave of the pandemic in India. Given that, it is likely that cases and deaths will continue to rise. Anecdotal evidence suggests that some of the deaths are being caused by factors such as lack of oxygen or ventilators, which is only to be expected as the health system across many parts of the country gets overwhelmed by cases; this also means that once supply and distribution of oxygen is enhanced (an effort that is already underway, and is expected to be completed by the end of the week), the number of deaths should start declining. Oxygen has emerged as a key constraint in India’s ability to deal with the second wave — and this is important to remember as the country prepares for the third wave, which will break at some point.Vaccines hold the key to helping crush the second wave and lower the intensity of the third — but there are a lot of gaps in what we know about their supply and availability.There is a complete lack of clarity on the number of vaccine doses that will be available in the domestic market (for the Centre, states, and private buyers) over the rest of the year from the two large domestic manufacturers, Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech, after these companies meet their contractual export commitments. There is an equal lack of clarity on the number of Sputnik V doses that will be available (as import at first and from local manufacturing subsequently). What is clear, based on the incomplete numbers that are in the public domain, is that India will fall well short of its requirement. Indeed, with the third phase of vaccination set to start from May 1, there is still no visibility on when the states that have placed orders will start receiving vaccine doses.We need data on availability, and timing. And we desperately need a comprehensive vaccine strategy that prioritises first doses (in the case of Covishield, which accounts for almost 90% of the vaccine doses administered so far) over complete vaccination so as to protect as many people as possible from the pandemic. If that is done over the next six weeks, India can crush the second wave. And be ready for the third.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101619478174078.html
27-04-2021||India||Ahead of phase 3, states divided over vaccine stocks, availability||Multiple states have said that they may not be able to begin coronavirus vaccinations for all adults from May 1, while some others said they will use the stocks at hand and hope for replenishments from the companies or through the central government as they go along, shrouding the third phase of the drive in confusion since large numbers of people also become due for their second doses soon.India’s Covid-19 vaccination programme has significantly slowed down in recent days as outbreaks expand across the country, triggering restrictions and reluctance among people. In the last week, 2.6 million doses were administered in a day on average, which is a 38% drop from the peak daily vaccination rate of 4.1 million doses on average during the week ending April 21.Officials in at least two states – Rajasthan and Punjab – said they will not be able to open up vaccinations for all aged 18 and above from May 1, while Delhi, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka said they will roll-out the expansion with the stocks they have at present but were hoping more doses come in later in the month.Officials in Bengal, where assembly election results are to be declared on May 2, said they will likely begin 18+ vaccinations from May 5 but need more stocks. “Existing stock is dwindling. Only 5-7 lakh doses are left in Bengal so to carry out universal vaccination, we need fresh stock,” said a Bengal health department official, asking not to be named.In Rajasthan, an official said the target launch date is now May 10. “The state is facing shortage of vaccines and is asking the Union government for bulk stock. The shortage has forced the drive to be halted at several places,” said an official, who asked not to be named. This person added that the state has placed direct orders for 37.5 million doses, though delivery timelines were not immediately clear.Last week, on April 19, the Union government announced it will allow direct sales of coronavirus vaccine to states and private hospitals, who were free to give it to anyone above the age of 17, accepting a long-standing demand to open the drive up.Experts say rapid, universal immunisation may be the only way for India to emerge out of the current crisis, since sustained lockdowns are economically damaging.But the plan has been mired in confusion about procurement as well as pricing. States will need to negotiate deliveries and purchase the doses on their own and their share is likely to be from within a kitty of half of what India-based vaccine makers produced, which will also be shared by private hospitals.The rest will go the Union government, which will continue the free vaccination programme for people above the age of 45 at centres to which it delivers. Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech (the makers of Covishield and Covaxin) drawing criticism for different pricing for centre, states and private outlets.Several states have announced they will make vaccines free for people between the age of 18 and 44. Officials in Maharashtra, which was the first to make such an announcement, said on Monday the state is unlikely to roll the drive out for those in the 18-44 age category in a big way owing to challenges related to supply and lack of clarity on whether it would provide free vaccines to all.A day after Maharashtra ministers announced the government will provide free vaccines to beneficiaries over age 18, state health minister Rajesh Tope on Monday said that it may not be possible, adding that the department will move a proposal to provide free vaccine jabs to the poor only.In Delhi, which too will offer free doses for all adults at state government-run centres and announced it had placed an order for 13.4 million doses, an official said the expansion will begin with the existing stocks and orders are being place for more, which will likely arrive at least two weeks later.Tamil Nadu, which too said it will sponsor doses for all adults, said it will begin with existing stocks, possibly from May 1. “We are preparing to vaccinate everyone above 18 from May 1,” said Tamil Nadu health minister C Vijayabaskar. “Chief minister will make an important announcement tomorrow on how we will go about this so it won’t be right if I speak on [procurement] now,” he said, while adding that the priority is to give the second doses to eligible people.The state is yet to place orders directly with the manufacturers.In Punjab, where chief minister Amarinder Singh said on Sunday that the expansion is unlikely to be possible till May 15, officials said on Monday that direct orders are yet to be finalised.Principal secretary, health and family welfare, Husan Lal, said the state government has ordered three million doses of Covishield, but “SII is yet to respond on the schedule of delivery. We are prepared for the roll-out provided we have the enough doses of vaccinations”.KV Trilok Chandra, Karnataka’s commissioner for health, family welfare, said the state will begin offering doses to all adults from May 1, and had placed an order for 10 million doses of Covishield. “Delivery schedule is awaited. Hopefully we will get replenished,” he added.Union government officials said on Monday that state governments will have to directly procure vaccines from manufacturers, whether domestic or foreign. From May 1, the Centre will not get into procurements, including imports, beyond their 50% quota, a senior official familiar with the matter said, asking not to be named.Experts said this could create complications due to the different pricing announced by SII and Bharat Biotech, which offer the cheapest rate to the Union government, citing bulk orders. “There should be same charges for central and state governments,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ahead-of-phase-3-states-divided-over-vaccine-stocks-availability-101619474782481.html
27-04-2021||India||States may have to directly purchase doses for phase 3 drive||State governments will have to directly procure coronavirus vaccines from domestic or foreign manufacturers to give doses to people in the 18-44 age group when they become eligible from May 1, senior officials aware of the matter said, while adding that the centre will not get into procurements, including imports, beyond their 50% quota.Even though both the Indian vaccine manufacturers that have been granted emergency use authorisation – Bharat Biotech and Serum Institute of India -- have declared the price at which they will sell their vaccines to states, state governments are free to further negotiate and explore procurement options for foreign made vaccines, these people said.The foreign manufacturers in the fray are Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson, with Johnson & Johnson having already applied to DCGI for bridging studies in India for its Covid-19 vaccine.“The cost of vaccination depends entirely on the rate at which the state government procures the vaccines. We have been given to understand that some state governments have already begun negotiations with vaccine manufacturers. The same logic applies for cost of vaccination at central government run hospitals; once state governments procure, they can provide such doses for vaccination to their hospitals or, and, to central government hospitals,” said a senior health ministry official aware of the matter, who did not want to be identified.Another official said, on condition of anonymity, “The states are free to go for foreign made vaccines also provided the vaccine is imported as per the government of India guidelines. Usually, a foreign made vaccine is imported through their local distributers. Foreign manufacturers get in to local tie-ups.”Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, for example, has a tie-up with the Russian Direct Investment Fund for importing and distributing the Russia-made Sputnik V vaccine. Sputnik V is the first foreign made vaccine that has been granted emergency use authorisation by the Drugs Controller General of India, Dr VG Somani.If states are able to better negotiate the price, in effect, it would mean the cost of vaccination for people in the 18-44 age group could come down further. Some states have already announced that they will be providing the vaccine for free. The cost for vaccinating those 45 and above will continue to be free under the Union government’s vaccination programme.So far, 17 states including Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Tamil Nadu have decided to vaccinate their population for free.The Indian manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines – at present this includes SII and Bharat Biotech – will need to keep at least 50% of their doses for the Union government while the rest can be sold to states or private hospitalsSII announced a prices of ₹400 for state governments and ₹600 for private hospitals/institutions, while Bharat Biotech’s quoted a price of ₹600 for state governments and ₹1200 for private hospitals and institutions.As some states showed apprehensions regarding the high cost, the central government asked the manufacturers if they could reduce the selling price, one of the officials said. “It was always demanded that the prices be kept reasonable, and if some states are feeling it is expensive then they should consider bringing it down further,” said the second official cited above.Experts, however, say that given the Covid-19 surge in the country, India needs to vaccinate its people faster.“It is very important that the vaccination pace is increased. However, the impact on second wave is minimal and it will mostly be beneficial in reducing mortality in subsequent waves,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-may-have-to-directly-purchase-doses-for-phase-3-drive-101619474776203.html
27-04-2021||India||Tamil Nadu allows Vedanta to temporarily reopen, company opposes operation of oxygen plant by govt||Tamil Nadu on Monday granted temporary permission to a shuttered copper plant in Thoothukudi to reopen for medical oxygen production for four months, almost three years after the facility was closed over pollution concerns after the deaths of 13 protesters in police firing.Hours later, Vedanta Industries, the plant’s owner, opposed the Supreme Court’s suggestion to let the Tamil Nadu government operate the oxygen producing unit at the plant, saying “it is just beyond the competency and financial ability of the government to run this oxygen plant.” The next hearing in the case is on Tuesday.Last week, Vedanta moved the Supreme Court for permission to operate its oxygen producing unit at the Thoothukudi’s Sterlite copper plant, which was shut down in May 2018, citing dire oxygen shortages across the country dealing with surging Covid-19 infections. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant. The Supreme Court also rejected requests to reopen the plant for a trial run on January 22 this year..To be sure, the Tamil Nadu government order didn’t mention that the administration will run the plant but mentioned that a government committee, including civil society members, will be set up to oversee the plant’s functioning.Submitting its affidavit in the apex court, Vedanta said the oxygen plant must be operated by its own team, under possible supervision of a central government’s expert body such as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF).“The running of the oxygen plant by the state government is likely to pose grave danger not only to the assets but to the personnel deployed for operation, as the operation critically involves the operation of high-pressure vessels, heavy duty compressors, high voltage equipment and proprietary control systems. There is a high probability that if untrained personnel were to operate the oxygen plant, the quality of oxygen produced can be substandard and may not be safe for use,” stated its affidavit in the top court.The Tamil Nadu government decision came after an all-party meeting passed a unanimous resolution that set five rules: only the oxygen unit will function, not the copper smelter; preference for oxygen will be Tamil Nadu; a supervising committee under the district collector, superintendent of police, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, two state officials knowledgeable in oxygen production along with civil society, non-governmental organisations and anti-Sterlite protestors, will be formed ; admission passes will be given to workers operating the oxygen unit; and the state will provide security and supply electricity for four weeks, or howsoever long the plant functions, depending on oxygen needs.“This is only a temporary permission and attempts shouldn’t be made to turn this into a permanent permission to produce oxygen or to reopen the facility,” Thoothukudi MP K Kanimozhi who was present at the meeting told the media.The meeting led by chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami was attended by representatives from eight political parties including the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress, Left and other regional parties.The copper unit was sealed by the state government in May 2018, days after 13 agitators were killed in police firing during a violent protest against pollution caused by the facility in the southern district.Reopening of the plant continues to be a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu as local residents and activists fear that the company is attempting to gain back-door entry. “This polluting company made it hard for us to breathe and now they want to help in oxygen production? It seems suspicious to us and we will never accept for it to be reopened,” said S Gunaseelan, an anti-Sterlite activist in Thoothukudi.In the top court last week, Vedanta’s plea was opposed by the Tamil Nadu government, citing law and order and local residents’ anger towards the company.The state’s resistance had prompted the court to asks the Tamil Nadu government if it was willing to operate the plant on its own. “When people are dying, can a state say we will still not run it because there could be law and order problems or that Vedanta did this and that? We are not on who will produce. Let Tamil Nadu government produce it if they have a problem with Vedanta,” it had asked the state.In its response, Vedanta maintained that its oxygen plant had a capacity of 1050 MT per day and that this plant is a non-polluting unit which can be operated without touching the copper smelter.“The only intent of the petitioner in running the oxygen plant is to initiate the production within 7-14 days, in order to cater to states, which are in need of oxygen supply for treating the Covid patients... Further, the petitioner undertakes that it will not carry out any kind of production activities apart from the production of oxygen under the directions of this Hon’ble Court,” said Vedanta.It stated that the state government did not have the requisite expertise or personnel for the maintenance and operation of the oxygen plant and that in view of the national emergency triggered by the surge in infection, the Tamil Nadu government must fulfil its sacrosanct responsibility of maintaining law and order.Separately, during a suo motu hearing on the health infrastructure of Tamil Nadu to manage Covid-19, the state informed Madras high court that only limited supply of liquefied oxygen may be initially available through the Sterlite plant in Thoothukudi. “But the owners have assured the state that immediate measures would be taken to put in place a system by which gaseous oxygen will be converted into liquefied oxygen for medical use with the appropriate content in excess of 99% oxygen,” the order copy of the case read. The high court didn’t delve into the matter further as it is being dealt with by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-allows-vedanta-to-temporarily-reopen-company-opposes-operation-of-oxygen-plant-by-govt-101619474701186.html
27-04-2021||India||UK and South African virus variants present in Kerala, says Vijayan||Chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday said that the presence of deadly Covid-19 mutant strains of the United Kingdom and South Africa are confirmed in the state.Talking to media persons in the state capital, Vijayan said preliminary studies have found that mutant strains fanned the second wave in the state. “Among the new patients, at least 40% are infected with the mutated variants. Of these 30% are UK variant and 7% with double mutants and 2% with South African variant,” he said. He said experts would divulge more on this issue in the coming days.“Detection of UK and African variants calls for stricter restrictions. The situation is really critical. We don’t want to create panic but people will have to be extra vigilant. We are going through a bad phase. Now experts have advised people to wear double masks in public places to avoid fast infection,” he said.The CM said vigil has been stepped up in areas where mutant strains were reported.Last week the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in Thiruvananthapuram had done an extensive study on the spike protein of the virus with the help of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi. Going by the rapid spread and nature of the second wave, experts have earlier warned about presence of strong mutants.Earlier in the day, the CM chaired an all-party meeting which decided not to enforce a complete lockdown but partial closure in weekends to be continued and restrictions in containment areas to be tightened.The meeting has also decided not to hold victory processions or rallies on vote counting day on May 2_when assembly election results will be out. Almost all political parties have agreed that a complete lockdown will affect people who are already reeling under the impact of the pandemic.“Mini lockdown will continue in the weekend for the time being. Shops and business establishments will be allowed to open till 7.30pm. Bars and malls will be shut. We will tighten measures in containment zones and effective policing will be there,” said the CM adding it is the duty of respective political parties to ensure that big victory rallies or processions don’t take place on the counting day.As cases rise alarmingly the core committee on pandemic had earlier recommended two-week lockdown but the all-party meet felt that complete closure and curfew will impact people badly and it will affect their livelihood.Kerala on Monday reported 21,890 new cases with a high positivity rate of 22.71%.In terms of daily caseload, Kerala is on the third spot with 21, 890 cases and active cases have also risen to 2,31,812. Out of 96,378 people tested, 21,980 were tested positive, according to the data released by the state health ministry. The state has also reported 28 fatalities taking the toll to 5,138. Among the infected are 70 health workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-and-south-african-virus-variants-present-in-kerala-says-vijayan-101619474691205.html
27-04-2021||India||Modi holds talks with Japan PM on cooperation in Covid-19 fight||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga on Monday discussed cooperation in key areas, including creating resilient supply chains and ensuring reliable supply of critical materials, to overcome challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic.During a 25-minute phone conversation, the two leaders discussed the Covid-19 situation in each other’s country and close India-Japan cooperation to overcome regional and global challenges due to the pandemic.Such bilateral cooperation includes “working together to create resilient, diversified and trustworthy supply chains, ensuring reliable supply of critical materials and technologies, and developing new partnerships in manufacturing and skill development”, the external affairs ministry said in a readout.The two leaders emphasised the need for early operationalisation of the Specified Skilled Workers (SSW) agreement signed recently to synergise their strengths and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes.They also highlighted the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed rail (MAHSR) project as a “shining example of their cooperation and welcomed the steady progress in its execution”, the readout said.The two leaders confirmed the importance of bilateral and multilateral cooperation, including Japan-Australia-India-US quadrilateral collaboration, to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific and decided to continue their efforts to build a rules-based international order, Japan’s foreign ministry said in a statement.Suga said he hopes to further develop cooperation in areas such as cyber, digital, decarbonisation, healthcare and connectivity, and mentioned possible collaboration in 5G, submarine cables, strengthening industrial competitiveness, diversification of supply chains and development of India’s northeastern region.Suga also expressed “serious concerns about China’s continued and strengthened unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas, including the Coast Guard Law”, the statement said.Modi and Suga appreciated the support and facilitation provided to resident citizens in each other’s country during the pandemic and agreed to continue such coordination. Modi thanked Suga for providing aid to India to combat the pandemic, and expressed the hope he would be able to receive the Japanese prime minister in India in the near future after the Covid-19 situation stabilises.Suga recently called off a planned visit to India and the Philippines because of the Covid-19 situation.In January, Japan provided a loan of up to 30 billion yen (about ₹2,129 crore) to support the Indian government’s efforts to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. This was the latest addition to Japan’s support to India in its fight against Covid-19.Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Japan has provided a 50-billion yen (about ₹3,549 crore) loan to implement health and medical policies and develop hospitals equipped with ICUs and infection prevention and management facilities, a grant of a billion yen (about ₹71 crore) to provide oxygen generators to treat Covid-19 patients in critical condition.Japan has also partnered with international organisations such as UNDP, UNICEF and UNHCR to provide assistance worth more than $7.26 million to the Indian government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-holds-talks-with-japan-pm-on-cooperation-in-covid-19-fight-101619474323300.html
27-04-2021||India||Armed forces to recall retired medics to work in Covid facilities: CDS to PM||Military medical personnel who retired or took premature retirement during the last two years are being recalled to work in Covid facilities near them, chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat told Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a briefing on Monday.This comes at a time when the country is reeling under a public health emergency and its health care resources are stretched to breaking point.Medical officers who retired more than two years ago have also been requested to make their services available for consultation through medical emergency helplines, the PMO said in a statement after the CDS briefed the PM, who reviewed the military’s preparations to assist in Covid management.At a meeting on April 20, defence minister Rajnath Singh asked the military to explore the possibility of utilising the services of vaccinated retired military personnel to help the civil administration and state governments to deal with the Covid crisis.India reported 354,709 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of infections in the country to 17.3 million till Sunday night. A total of 2,808 new deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Sunday, pushing the total number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 195,137, according to the HT Covid-19 dashboard.The CDS told the PM that all medical officers on staff appointments at Command HQ, Corps HQ, Division HQ and similar HQs of the navy and the Indian Air Force will be employed at hospitals.“The CDS informed the PM that nursing personnel are being employed in large numbers to complement the doctors at the hospitals. The PM was also briefed that oxygen cylinders available with armed forces in various establishments will be released for hospitals,” the PMO statement said.The PM reviewed the operations being undertaken by IAF to transport oxygen and other essentials in India and abroad. IAF is making a significant contribution in the fight against Covid by transporting much-needed empty oxygen containers to filling stations across the country to tackle the oxygen crisis.IAF on Monday ferried six empty cryogenic oxygen containers from Dubai to Panagarh in West Bengal in a C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, with the airlift of six more containers from Dubai planned on Tuesday. On Monday, the air force also airlifted two containers from Jaipur to Jamnagar for refilling. The containers will be filled up and transported to different centres for Covid relief by rail or road.Last week, IAF airlifted four such containers from Singapore to Panagarh, apart from carrying out several domestic shuttles. IAF is using a variety of aircraft for Covid relief including C-17, C-130J, IL-76, An-32, Avro, Chinook and Mi-17 helicopters, as previously reported by HT.General Rawat informed the PM that the armed forces are setting up a large number of medical facilities and, wherever possible, military medical infrastructure will be made available to civilians.“The PM also discussed with the CDS that Kendriya and Rajya Sainik Welfare Boards and officers posted in various headquarters in veterans’ cells may be instructed to coordinate the services of veterans to extend the reach to maximum extent possible including in remote areas,” the PMO statement added.The armed forces and other wings of the defence ministry can play an important role in the fight against Covid, Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS), said last week.“They have the manpower, resources and discipline to provide relief in these hard times. The military especially has a culture of quick response, be it enemy action or natural catastrophes. It can do a lot to alleviate the sufferings of our countrymen during the pandemic too,” Chopra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/armed-forces-to-recall-retired-medics-to-work-in-covid-facilities-cds-to-pm-101619470383668.html
27-04-2021||India||France aids India's Covid-19 fight, to send massive oxygen generators, container||France on Tuesday announced a support package for India’s Covid-19 response, including major equipment such as oxygen generators and liquid oxygen containers that will be shipped by air and sea by the end of this week.The solidarity mission, initiated by President Emmanuel Macron, is supported by French companies present in India and the European Union, and aims to respond to both emergency needs and boost long-term resilience of India's healthcare system, French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain said.France has become the second European country after Germany to announce a support package for India, which registered record-breaking Coronavirus infections for the fifth consecutive day on Monday, with 352,991 cases reported in 24 hours. Official data showed the death toll rose to an all-time high of 2,812.The support packages of most countries, including France, are aimed at helping address a severe shortage of oxygen in numerous cities. Experts have blamed many deaths on the lack of oxygen and plants across the country have been hard pressed to meet the growing needs of health facilities.France’s support package will include eight medical oxygen generators, each capable of uninterrupted supply for a 250-bed hospital. The generators can meet the needs of 15 critically ill Covid-19 patients in an ICU, or 30 patients in the ICU of a non-Covid hospital or 150 patients on oxygen therapy in a conventional hospital.The units can make a hospital “autonomous in oxygen supply for approximately 10 years” and are durable installations that produce medical oxygen from ambient air yearlong, the French embassy said in a statement.France will also ship five containers of liquid medical oxygen as a first instalment, each capable of supplying medical oxygen to up to 10,000 patients a day, and specialised medical equipment, including 28 ventilators and 200 electric syringe pumps.The statement said the package is part of the support announced on Sunday by the European Union (EU) under its Civil Protection Mechanism, which helps coordinate the EU’s response to emergencies in Europe and beyond.“France and India have always stood by each other’s side in difficult times. This solidarity is at the core of our strategic partnership and the friendship between the Indian and the French peoples,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-aids-india-s-covid-19-fight-to-send-massive-oxygen-generators-container-101619468597811.html
27-04-2021||India||More offers of oxygen support come in amid Covid-19 challenge in Uttar Pradesh||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Monday called for doubling the health resources to fight Covid-19 while reiterating that oxygen supply to the state was being augmented from various sources even while the number of active cases under treatment crossed the three-lakh mark with the state recording 33,574 new cases and 249 more deaths, which was the highest single-day fatality count in Uttar Pradesh.At the same time, the total recoveries showed an upward trend, going past the eight-lakh mark with 26,719 more patients being discharged in the last 24 hours statewide, according to official data.The state’s total Covid-19 caseload stands at 11,20,176 now.Dwelling on more help on the oxygen front, the chief minister said the Tata and Reliance groups had offered to supply oxygen to UP.The officers concerned should negotiate with them to speed up the process of supply, he said at the Covid review meeting he held virtually with officials.He also asked for increasing the number of oxygen tankers and seeking help from the central government.He also told the officials to keep a close watch on all Covid-19 hospitals in the state and immediately provide them with oxygen as and when they required it.The chief minister once again noted that oxygen supply was being augmented daily with supplies from Roorkee and Kashipur (Uttarakhand), Modinagar (UP), Bokaro (Jharkhand) and the state’s MSME units.He warned the officers concerned that once the Integrated Covid Command and Control Centre (ICCCC) allotted a hospital to Covid positive patients, it must be ensured that they find admissions in those hospitals, or else the officers will be held responsible and face action.“Considering the intense transmission rate of the virus this time, there is a need to increase the health resources for Covid-19 at least by double. The health department and the medical education department should prepare a work plan for increasing beds. Now, two more CHCs (community health centres) each should be added to the Covid management list in each district,” he said.Since OPDs (outpatient departments) were closed in hospitals, it was necessary to promote online consultation, publicise the lists of doctors for Covid and non-Covid consultation for the convenience of the people, he added.The chief minister asked the state health minister to monitor the supply of Covid medicine kits to home isolation patients across the state. All Covid patients in home isolation must get the kit containing medicines for at least one week, he said.“Through the CM helpline, the administration must keep in touch with the home isolation patients to track their condition,” he said.He also said many Covid recovered patients wanted to extend a helping hand.“So, encourage such people to come forward, make a list of them. There could be doctors, paramedics etc. Rope them in, they could be deployed at hospitals,” he said.He reiterated that there was no shortage of Remdesivir and other such Covid-19 drugs. Since the state was getting their supply every day, they should be provided free of cost to patients in government hospitals and at concessional rates in private hospitals, he said.Talking about vaccination, he said so far 97,83,416 people had got the first dose of the Covid vaccine and more than 20 lakh had been given both doses. Thus, a total of 1,17,83,880 doses had been administered in the state.“Prepare well for the vaccination drive that is scheduled to begin from May 1,” he said to the officers concerned.Apart from publicising the Covid safety protocols, health specialists should be engaged in spreading awareness about foods that boost immunity and techniques to increase the oxygen level in blood, the chief minister said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/more-offers-of-oxygen-support-come-in-amid-covid-19-challenge-in-uttar-pradesh-101619465571346.html
27-04-2021||India||Wear masks at home, Covid-19 now a runaway outbreak: Govt||Covid-19 is now a “runaway outbreak” in several parts of the country, and people may need to wear masks while they are at home, especially if they or someone in the household is infected, a top official said on Monday, as the government urged people to do more to break the chain of transmission.The officials said it is now crucial to reduce the scale of the outbreak since India’s large population means the “health infrastructure will never be enough”.“If there is one positive person at home, it is very important that the infected person wears a mask because he transmits the virus to others. In fact, now it is time, I’d say, that we should anyway wear a mask at home. We used to talk about (wearing a mask) outside but now because the spread is high, and if someone is accidentally infected at home, we should keep a mask on. It will be beneficial,” said VK Paul, member (Health), Niti Aayog, during the government’s weekly briefing on Covid-19.A health ministry official described the scale of outbreak.“We have reiterated it many times, but today it becomes all the more important -- in the light of runaway spread of infection that we find -- in certain regions that Covid-appropriate behavior such as physical distancing, hand hygiene, and wearing a mask is strictly observed,” said Lav agarwal, joint secretary, Union ministry of health and family welfare.India recorded 319, 509 new cases and 2,764 more people died, according to HT dashboard on Monday.“Almost all the states have currently crossed their highest daily reported cases during previous wave’s peak in September last year, which is a major cause for concern as it overloads our health care delivery system and poses a challenge in clinical management of patients,” said Agarwal.“Given the scale of India’s population, the health infrastructure will never be enough. Therefore, it is crucial to prevent infection to avoid putting undue stress on our health infrastructure. Some states have more than 1 lakh active cases; therefore, our focus will be containment and effective clinical management of these cases. But most important is to observe Covid-19 appropriate behaviour,” he added.The official quoted from certain studies to illustrate the gains from social distancing, pointing out that if no distancing measures are followed, one person can infect 406 people in 30 days. But if people reduce exposure by 50%, this number falls to around 15 in the same period.OXYGEN CRISISThe government officials at the briefing also addressed the oxygen crisis in several parts of the country, which in some cases has led to people in critical condition succumbing after the facilities they were in ran out of supply.“India is going through a critical phase as far as second wave is concerned, and for optimal hospital utilisation, there is a need for community participation. The panic is causing more harm than good. As even mild cases rush to a hospital, start medicines that are not required or even have started hoarding oxygen and essential medicines,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India Institute of Medical Sciences, Delhi.“Oxygen is an important strategy for treating Covid, but misuse is not recommended. 94% oxygen saturation is good, which means enough oxygen is reaching all organs and tissues. You don’t have to bring it up to 98-99%. We say 94% that’s to keep a buffer,” he said, also adding hospitals to cut down on wastage.For drugs like antiviral injection remdesivir, Guleria said that not everyone needs the drug, and it should be given only to hospitalized patients with moderate to severe disease.“Only about 10-15% of the cases require oxygen therapy, and medicines like remdesivir. As high as 85-90% Covid-19 positives get mild or no symptoms such as fever, cough, sore throat and need symptomatic treatment.Guleria said if for some reason there is a delay in getting Covid-19 RT-PC tests, those with all typical symptoms of the disease should immediately get isolated and consult a doctor.“Now we will have to do clinic-radiological diagnosis and treat these patients like Covid-19 cases. Fever, cold, cough, sore throat is most likely Covid-19 in these times. So, if there are symptoms just isolate and consult a doctor,” said Guleria.Experts said the recommendation to use masks indoors depends on the risks involved, including whether the transmission rate at the time is high.“Should you be masking at home? If you are staying someone who is infected or infectious, it makes a lot of sense for you to do so. If you are in contact with people you do not know or how much exposure they had outside, you should stay masked.

27-04-2021||India||Germany, Australia to rush equipment to India||Germany and Australia are working to rush equipment such as an oxygen production plant and ventilators to India to bolster the country’s Covid-19 response in the wake of record-breaking infections over the past few days.The German Army will provide a large oxygen production plant and efforts are on to transport the broad-spectrum antiviral medication Remdesivir among other medicines from emergency stocks, German ambassador Walter Lindner said on Monday.The Australian government is considering donating non-invasive ventilators to India from stocks created at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, health minister Greg Hunt was quoted as saying by ABC News. The National Security Committee of Australia’s Cabinet will meet on Tuesday to finalise the assistance for India.In a separate development, Anthony Fauci, Biden administration’s chief medical advisor, said the US could “actively consider” providing vaccines from its stock of 30 million AstraZeneca Covid-19 shots to India.On Monday, India set a global record for the rise in coronavirus infections for the fifth consecutive day, with 352,991 cases reported since Sunday. The number of deaths too rose to an all-time high of 2,812, according to official data.Lindner said Germany understands the urgency of the situation and authorities are “working day and night” to airlift critical equipment and medical supplies to India. People across Europe have been moved by the scenes of loss emerging from India, he added.The Germany Army will ship a large oxygen production plant and other authorities are working to provide respirators, ventilators and huge quantities of Remdesivir and other medicines from German emergency stocks.In the private sector, Tata and Linde Group have partnered to provide more than 20 oxygen tanks to increase transport capacity between oxygen producers and Covid-19 hot spots, while more than 20 oxygen plants being purchased by the Indian side from a company in southern Germany will be airlifted by the Indian Air Force, Lindner said.Cooperation between UNICEF and Germany, which started last year, will be intensified to provide cooling chains for vaccines, he added.Australian health minister Hunt said a specific request had been received from India for the physical supply of oxygen and authorities would check if any oxygen supplies could be donated. The government could donate non-invasive ventilators from Australia’s national stockpile that was created last year.“We are in a strong position on that front because we don’t need them [ventilators] at this point in time,” Hunt said.A cleared picture on the aid from Australia is expected after the meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday.Fauci told ABC News’ This Week programme that the US needs to do more to help India’s current Covid-19 response. “I don’t think you can walk away from that,” he said.He said discussions were underway “about really ramping up what we can do on the ground – oxygen supplies, drugs, tests, PPE, as well as taking the look into the intermediate and long run about how we can get vaccines to these individuals, both immediately now, as well as in the situation where you help them to be able to essentially make vaccines themselves”.Asked specifically if the Biden administration could help India with its stock of about 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which hasn’t been approved for use in the US, Fauci replied: “You know, I think that’s going to be something that is up for active consideration...I don’t want to be speaking for policy right now with you, but I mean, that’s something that certainly is going to be actively considered.”People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that critical equipment and supplies was coming into India as a mix of donations – such as the assistance being provided by Germany, Australia and the US – and commercial purchases, such as the oxygen tanks airlifted from Singapore and United Arab Emirates.The people said China’s offer to provide support hadn’t been taken up so far, and pointed out that tweets and statements by Chinese officials about equipment being sent to India – such as a tweet from the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka about 800 oxygen concentrators airlifted from Hong Kong to New Delhi on Sunday – involved commercial purchases made by Indian firms.Chinese embassy spokesperson Wang Xiaojian said in a statement that China “will encourage and guide Chinese companies to actively cooperate with India to facilitate acquiring medical supplies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/germany-australia-to-rush-equipment-to-india-101619463384429.html
27-04-2021||India||Modi holds talks with Japan PM on cooperation in Covid fight||Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Japanese counterpart Yoshihide Suga on Monday discussed cooperation in key areas, including creating resilient supply chains and ensuring reliable supply of critical materials, to overcome challenges posed by the Covid-19 pandemic. During a 25-minute phone conversation, the two leaders discussed the Covid-19 situation in each other’s country and close India-Japan cooperation to overcome regional and global challenges due to the pandemic. Such bilateral cooperation includes “working together to create resilient, diversified and trustworthy supply chains, ensuring reliable supply of critical materials and technologies, and developing new partnerships in manufacturing and skill development”, the external affairs ministry said in a readout. The two leaders emphasised the need for early operationalisation of the Specified Skilled Workers (SSW) agreement signed recently to synergise their strengths and achieve mutually beneficial outcomes. They also highlighted the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high speed rail (MAHSR) project as a “shining example of their cooperation and welcomed the steady progress in its execution”, the readout said. The two leaders confirmed the importance of bilateral and multilateral cooperation, including Japan-Australia-India-US quadrilateral collaboration, to ensure a free and open Indo-Pacific and decided to continue their efforts to build a rules-based international order, Japan’s foreign ministry said in a statement. Suga said he hopes to further develop cooperation in areas such as cyber, digital, decarbonisation, healthcare and connectivity, and mentioned possible collaboration in 5G, submarine cables, strengthening industrial competitiveness, diversification of supply chains and development of India’s northeastern region. Suga also expressed “serious concerns about China’s continued and strengthened unilateral attempts to change the status quo in the East and South China Seas, including the Coast Guard Law”, the statement said. Modi and Suga appreciated the support and facilitation provided to resident citizens in each other’s country during the pandemic and agreed to continue such coordination. Modi thanked Suga for providing aid to India to combat the pandemic, and expressed the hope he would be able to receive the Japanese prime minister in India in the near future after the Covid-19 situation stabilises. Suga recently called off a planned visit to India and the Philippines because of the Covid-19 situation. In January, Japan provided a loan of up to 30 billion yen (about ₹2,129 crore) to support the Indian government’s efforts to mitigate the socio-economic impacts of the pandemic. This was the latest addition to Japan’s support to India in its fight against Covid-19. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, Japan has provided a 50-billion yen (about ₹3,549 crore) loan to implement health and medical policies and develop hospitals equipped with ICUs and infection prevention and management facilities, a grant of a billion yen (about ₹71 crore) to provide oxygen generators to treat Covid-19 patients in critical condition. Japan has also partnered with international organisations such as UNDP, UNICEF and UNHCR to provide assistance worth more than $7.26 million to the Indian government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/modi-holds-talks-with-japan-pm-on-cooperation-in-covid-fight-101619464218976.html
27-04-2021||India||IIT professor’s remarks on SC, ST students trigger row||An associate professor at the Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur (IIT KGP) who verbally abused students purportedly belonging to Scheduled Caste (SC) and Scheduled Tribe (ST) communities and those with physical disabilities during a preparatory class is likely to face institutional action after videos of her online classes went viral on social media, following which student bodies sought her termination for alleged casteist slurs.The recordings, which are under review of the institute, were posted on Sunday afternoon anonymously on the confessions page of IIT KGP, an informal group of students on social media. The clips are of online preparatory classes taught by Seema Singh, a professor of English from the department of Humanities and Social Sciences, which were attended by several students and parents. In it she can be heard repeatedly hurling abuses at them.The Mumbai chapter of the Ambedkar Periyar Phule Study Circle (APPSC)—a student organisation with chapters in various IITs -- demanded that the professor be terminated and booked under the SC/ST Prevention of Atrocities Act. “She is in complete cognisance of her actions and proclaims immunity from any disciplinary actions and consequences,” said APPSC in a statement.IIT Kharagpur registrar Tamal Nath said that the institute was reviewing the veracity of the videos and the claim that she made casteist slurs, brought forward by student bodies.“The incident has come to our notice. We are reviewing the veracity of the claims. The institute does not tolerate such behaviour. Action will be taken,” he said.Singh remained unreachable for comments.The institute’s director Virendra Kumar Tewari also did not respond to calls, messages and emails.“[Tewari] has expressed his support to the students and their parents during an online meeting on Monday evening. Meanwhile the professor concerned has been referred to a review committee,” an official from the institute said on the condition of anonymity.The official confirmed that the video was of the preparatory classes taken for students belonging to SC/ST communities and persons with disability (PWDs). However, the students that HT reached out to refused to comment on the video as they were afraid of possible repercussions. HT has not been able to independently verify the video.IITs offer preparatory courses for two semesters to aspirants of SC and ST communities as well as PWDs. The preparatory courses are offered against vacant seats reserved for the students who missed out on admissions through the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE). At the end of the two semesters, the students can either take the JEE again or seek admission based on their performance during the preparatory course.In the video clips, Singh can be heard verbally abusing both students and their parents for not attending classes, and keeping their cameras switched off during the class. Singh also castigated a student for sending an email stating that they would not be able to attend the class for a few days due to the death of their grandparent.“The professor at IIT KGP is all-powerful… What I have to do, I will do. You can go to ministry of women and child. Go to ministry of SC, ST and minorities (sic). Nothing can prevent me from doing what I have to do to you,” Singh can be heard telling the students in one of the clips.It was not immediately clear whether the recordings were of the same class, or of different classes.“The words used by her such as “dumb” and “bastard” have casteist connotations, especially since she uses them in plural. There is an inherent assumption that students belonging to the reserved categories are somehow lacking merit,” said a member of the APPSC, IIT Bombay chapter.The APPSC has also demanded that a permanent SC, ST, Other Backward Classes cell be set up at IIT KGP and other IITs, which will act as anti-discrimination cell to take action against “structural forms of caste discrimination”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-professor-s-remarks-on-sc-st-students-trigger-row-101619463389317.html
27-04-2021||India||TN allows Vedanta to temporarily reopen, comapny opposes operation of oxygen plant by govt||Chennai/New Delhi: Tamil Nadu on Monday granted temporary permission to a shuttered copper plant in Thoothukudi to reopen for medical oxygen production for four months, almost three years after the facility was closed over pollution concerns after the deaths of 13 protesters in police firing. Hours later, Vedanta Industries, the plant’s owner, opposed the Supreme Court’s suggestion to let Tamil Nadu government operate the oxygen producing unit at the plant, saying “it is just beyond the competency and financial ability of the government to run this oxygen plant.” The next hearing in the case is on Tuesday.Last week, Vedanta moved the Supreme Court for permission to operate its oxygen producing unit at the Thoothukudi’s Sterlite copper plant, which was shut down in May 2018, citing dire oxygen shortages across the country dealing with surging Covid-19 infections. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant. The Supreme Court also rejected requests to reopen the plant for a trial run on January 22 this year.. To be sure, the Tamil Nadu government order didn’t mention that the administration will run the plant but mentioned that a government committee, including civil society members, will be set up to oversee the plant’s functioning. Submitting its affidavit in the apex court, Vedanta said the oxygen plant must be operated by its own team, under possible supervision of a central government’s expert body such as the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) or the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEF). “The running of the oxygen plant by the state government is likely to pose grave danger not only to the assets but to the personnel deployed for operation, as the operation critically involves the operation of high-pressure vessels, heavy duty compressors, high voltage equipment and proprietary control systems. There is a high probability that if untrained personnel were to operate the oxygen plant, the quality of oxygen produced can be substandard and may not be safe for use,” stated its affidavit in the top court. The Tamil Nadu government decision came after an all-party meeting passed a unanimous resolution that set five rules: only the oxygen unit will function, not the copper smelter; preference for oxygen will be Tamil Nadu; a supervising committee under the district collector, superintendent of police, Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board, two state officials knowledgeable in oxygen production along with civil society, non-governmental organisations and anti-Sterlite protestors, will be formed ; admission passes will be given to workers operating the oxygen unit; and the state will provide security and supply electricity for four weeks, or howsoever long the plant functions, depending on oxygen needs. “This is only a temporary permission and attempts shouldn’t be made to turn this into a permanent permission to produce oxygen or to reopen the facility,” Thoothukudi MP K Kanimozhi who was present at the meeting told the media. The meeting led by chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami was attended by representatives from eight political parties including the ruling All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, opposition Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, Bharatiya Janata Party, Congress, Left and other regional parties. The copper unit was sealed by the state government in May 2018, days after 13 agitators were killed in police firing during a violent protest against pollution caused by the facility in the southern district.Reopening of the plant continues to be a sensitive issue in Tamil Nadu as local residents and activists fear that the company is attempting to gain back-door entry. “This polluting company made it hard for us to breathe and now they want to help in oxygen production? It seems suspicious to us and we will never accept for it to be reopened,” said S Gunaseelan, an anti-Sterlite activist in Thoothukudi. In the top court last week, Vedanta’s plea was opposed by the Tamil Nadu government, citing law and order and local residents’ anger towards the company. The state’s resistance had prompted the court to asks the Tamil Nadu government if it was willing to operate the plant on its own. “When people are dying, can a state say we will still not run it because there could be law and order problems or that Vedanta did this and that? We are not on who will produce. Let Tamil Nadu government produce it if they have a problem with Vedanta,” it had asked the state. In its response, Vedanta maintained that its oxygen plant had a capacity of 1050 MT per day and that this plant is a non-polluting unit which can be operated without touching the copper smelter. “The only intent of the petitioner in running the oxygen plant is to initiate the production within 7-14 days, in order to cater to states, which are in need of oxygen supply for treating the Covid patients... Further, the petitioner undertakes that it will not carry out any kind of production activities apart from the production of oxygen under the directions of this Hon’ble Court,” said Vedanta. It stated that the state government did not have the requisite expertise or personnel for the maintenance and operation of the oxygen plant and that in view of the national emergency triggered by the surge in infection, the Tamil Nadu government must fulfil its sacrosanct responsibility of maintaining law and order. Separately, during a suo motu hearing on the health infrastructure of Tamil Nadu to manage Covid-19, the state informed Madras high court that only limited supply of liquefied oxygen may be initially available through the Sterlite plant in Thoothukudi. “But the owners have assured the state that immediate measures would be taken to put in place a system by which gaseous oxygen will be converted into liquefied oxygen for medical use with the appropriate content in excess of 99% oxygen,” the order copy of the case read. The high court didn’t delve into the matter further as it is being dealt with by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tn-allows-vedanta-to-temporarily-reopen-comapny-opposes-operation-of-oxygen-plant-by-govt-101619464038844.html
27-04-2021||India||Shopkeepers say need more clarity on curbs||BengaluruAs soon as the state government announced new restrictions for 14 days in the state on Monday, residents in Bengaluru thronged various markets, shopping for groceries and other essential items in a state of panic. Long queues were reported from outside supermarkets and local markets across the state, even though the government announced that shops dealing with essential commodities will be allowed to open from 6am to 10 am on all days.Chief minister BS Yediyurappa on Monday announced that the state will go in a “closed down” for two weeks from Tuesday night in a bid to contain the raging Covid-19 crisis in the second wave of the pandemic. The decision came following a cabinet meeting that went on for over two hours on Monday morning. The government said that public transportation, including BMTC and Bangalore Metro services, will not function during the closed down period. Goods can be transported from one state to another and takeaway from restaurants and home delivery of alcohol have been allowed. A shopkeeper in Bengaluru’s RT Nagar said there was no shortage of supplies to the shop. “There is still some confusion over if we can keep the shops open after 10 am. The government has said essential supplies can open between 6 am and 10 am. But it also said that home delivery is allowed. This is very confusing and there should be clarification on this,” said shopkeeper Ravi Kumar.Rajesh Bhatt, who runs a restaurant, said only those affiliated with the delivery apps will gain. “We are allowed to have home deliveries but if people don’t come out, we lose out on business. We are now offering home deliveries. We will know how it will work in the next few days,” said Bhatt, who runs a restaurant in Babusapalaya.While shopkeepers remain upset about the loss in business, they agreed that strict measures were required. “We are still recovering from the losses from last year. Many shopkeepers had to shut down because they couldn’t handle the debt. We face similar problems, but we can understand the situation. We hope the government will do something to help us after this,” said Peter Antony, another shopkeeper.Meanwhile, Bengaluru police have made elaborate plans to enforce the restrictions. A senior police officer told HT that since a lockdown was in effect, more manpower is being diverted for enforcement. “We will increase patrolling and check posts across the city. We hope people will cooperate with us but if they don’t, we will take strict action. We have seized more than 2,000 vehicles during the weekend lockdown. This drive will continue,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shopkeepers-say-need-more-clarity-on-curbs-101619463920113.html
27-04-2021||India||IT professionals aim to develop support system for dissemination of Covid information||Bengaluru A qualified group of persons from Bengaluru among other places like Hyderabad and Coimbatore are working on creating a WhatsApp bot and other technological interventions to complement the existing voice call-based support system for dissemination of Covid-19 information and to reduce the stress on the already overstretched resources.The team, which comprises Artificial Intelligence (AI) and other software solutions startups, are using their technical expertise to streamline a volume of requests in Bengaluru, one of the worst Covid-hit cities in the country, by collating information and providing a platform to integrate both government and volunteer-driven efforts in order to gain a grip on the pandemic, people aware with the developments said.“Last time around, there were multiple people trying to solve a problem. Chatbots hadn’t percolated as much but most of the chats happened via WhatsApp as people forwarded everything through the platform. We learnt from that and decided to use WhatsApp as a chatbot-based system. There is no soiling of information, everything is put into a google sheet which every non-profit or CSO (central statistics office) sector person knows how to use,” Gautam Prakash, co-founder and chief problem solver at Reap Benefit, a startup that devises community-based solutions, said.Bengaluru recorded 16545 new infections in the 24 hours on Sunday and accounted for 105 fatalities out of the total 201 in the state. Karnataka reported 29744 new cases and the positivity rate was 17.87%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. Caught napping for over four months since the submission of a report on Covid-19 and its imminent surge from a government-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC) in November, the B S Yediyurappa-led administration has now resorted to lockdown-like restrictions across the state to buy time and increase preparedness for rising cases.The WhatsApp bot, which is expected to be rolled out anytime now, aims to reduce the burden on call centres that have otherwise witnessed a three-fold increase in traffic since the beginning of March with each of the 100 or so executives (working in three shifts round the clock) answering and following up on a range of requests, as reported by Hindustan Times earlier.The techies aim to disseminate accurate inputs with the help of the rural development and panchayat raj (RDPR) department of Karnataka which is providing real time information, and the same can be accessed by pinging the bot.Gayatri Meka from Hyper Verge, an AI startup that also channels its efforts into social capital, said that last year, the bot on WhatsApp was used to share information on the nearest ration shop to help relief work. But this time around, the requests have centered around securing hospital beds, oxygen and medicines among other information critical for treatment of Covid-19.Last year, several leading startup founders like Mekin Maheshwari of Udhyam Learning Foundation, Aprameya Radhakrishna, co-founder of Vokal, Abhiraj Singh Bhal, co-founder of services startup, Urban Company, Vivekananda Hallekere, CEO of Bounce among scores of others were part of the efforts, building key software and developing solutions to help the government issue lockdown passes, provide information on the pandemic and streamline relief work.“Basically, when a person pings for help, the bot asks for location or pincode.... then it asks what help is required, if it is hospital bed or oxygen or medicines. Then it looks up the database with hospital data close to their location, with bed count in realtime and this is shared with the user,” Meka explained.In the wake of shortage of beds, the bot raises a request following which a volunteer group looks into it and gets back to the user.Uma Mahadevan, principal secretary at Karnataka’s panchayat raj department, said that the professionals were also mapping resources and monitoring Twitter regularly for any request-related post and figuring out solutions for better integration.“Lots of people are helping us develop the platform. This year, we want to continue with this effort and make it as hyper local as possible,” she said.Meka said the platform is built in such a way that it can also be expanded to integrate work of volunteers from other cities for better reach.“For the next few days, we are trying to get more volunteer groups on board. We know that there are so many efforts round the country, people in different cities putting together their own databases, responses, etc. This helps them reach more people and we can integrate their work with ours,” Meka said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/it-professionals-aim-to-develop-support-system-for-dissemination-of-covid-information-101619463858790.html
27-04-2021||India||K’taka imposes stricter curbs for 14 days amid Covid surge||BengaluruThe Karnataka government on Monday announced stricter restrictions across the state from Tuesday night for 14 days, in a last-ditch attempt to contain the rapidly deteriorating health crisis amid unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases in the second wave of the pandemic.“Strict measures to control Covid pandemic will be taken. From tomorrow (Tuesday) night till next 14 days, there will be closed down for the whole state,” chief minister BS Yediyurappa said in Bengaluru after an over two-hour cabinet meeting on Monday. He added that essential commodity shops will be open between 6 am and 10 am, after which all shops will be closed.The state cabinet also decided to provide Covid-19 vaccinations free of cost at government hospitals for those between 18 and 44 years of age in the new vaccination drive starting May 1.The government said that the restrictions, termed as “closed down”, were enforced to “break the chain of Covid-19 transmission in the state” and will be in place from 9 pm on April 27 to 6 am on May 12.Yediyurappa added that if the situation did not come under control within this period, there would be chances of extending the same.“Regarding control of Covid pandemic, the cabinet has taken decisions after consulting with an expert committee,” Yediyurappa said. Earlier, the Karnataka government has been accused of neglecting warnings given by the state-appointed technical advisory committee (TAC) in its report in November last year about the imminent second wave of infections and level or preparedness required to deal with the surge.The decision came on a day when Karnataka reported 29,744 new Covid-19 cases and 201 fatalities, taking the caseload and deaths in the state to 1,368,945 and 14,627, respectively. The case positivity rate in the state was 17.87%, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department. The state had recorded its highest-ever tally of 34,804 cases in a day on Sunday.Bengaluru accounted for 16,545 fresh infections and 105 deaths on Monday, taking the total number of Covid-19 cases and related deaths in the city to 670,201 and 5,905, respectively.While the state government refrained from using the term ‘lockdown’, restrictions announced on Monday were nothing short of it, business owners and government officials said.Several other states like Delhi, Punjab and Maharashtra have relapsed into lockdown mode as a measure to contain the surge.The government said all shops and establishments serving food, groceries and other essentials can remain open from 6 am to 10 am till the period of the curfew. Yediyurappa said that stand-alone liquor shops will be allowed to remain open for take away services only. However, officials at the Excise department said they would have to now make fresh orders as existing provisions under the stringent act allows opening of liquor stores only from 10 am.“We are not sure how to remain open at 6 am and then close down at 10am. Unless we have orders from the excise department, it will be hard for us to operate since any violation can end up with us losing our licence,” said a liquor shop owner in upscale Indiranagar locality, requesting not to be named.The government has also allowed industries, except garments, to continue operations. Construction workers will be issued passes, the government said in its guidelines.Meanwhile, the Karnataka Employers Association on Monday appealed to the government that it should be allowed to operate its units with 50% strength.“The garment industry has already received lot of orders with strict timelines to deliver. European markets have just opened and they have sent huge orders. If there is a delay in supply of finished goods to the buyers, it will result in huge penalty, losses and also it will result in employment loss,” BC Prabhakar, the president of the association, wrote in the letter.Earlier in the day, Yediyurappa said garment factories will not be allowed to function since the sector employs lakhs of people who have to sit side-by-side and work.Meanwhile, the announcement triggered confusion and anxiety among residents of the city and other parts of the state, who resorted to panic buying, not knowing what turns the current restrictions would take.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-imposes-stricter-curbs-for-14-days-amid-covid-surge-101619463738732.html
27-04-2021||India||48 hours on, forest fires rage across Mizoram||Massive forest fires that broke out on Saturday and continued to rage till Monday have affected several parts of Mizoram and damaged vast tracts of land, satellite images have revealed. No human casualty has been reported so far.According to a satellite data assessment by the Forest Survey of India (FSI), there were as many as 2,671 forest fire points in the state between April 20 and 26, with over 400 points on Monday alone. NASA’s Earthdata website also showed a very large concentration of fires in and around the state both on Sunday and Monday.Speaking to chief minister Zoramthanga, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday assured all possible assistance to deal with the situation. “Spoke to Mizoram CM, Mr Zoramthanga and took stock of the situation arising due to forest fires in parts of the state. Assured all possible support from the Centre in overcoming the crisis,” Modi tweeted.The chief minister later thanked Modi and even tweeted a video of an Indian Air Force (IAF) chopper with bambi buckets (used for aerial firefighting), trying to douse the flames. “Thank you so much Prime Minister Shri @narendramodi ji. I thank the Central Government for its prompt assurance and swift action. The people of #Mizoram says ‘Kan lawm e,” Zoramthanga posted on Twitter.The forest fire reportedly broke out at Saisih forest area in the outskirts of Lunglei town between 6 am and 7 am on Saturday and spread to Lunglei town on Sunday, Lunglei district deputy commissioner M Misael told news agency PTI.While Lunglei is the worst affected, Serchhip, Lawngtlai and Hnahthial were also hit by the blaze as firemen deployed in several sites struggled to douse the flames.According to the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD), the states of Mizoram and Tripura recorded “large deficiency” in rainfall during the pre-monsoon period from March 1 to April 26 at 74% and 67% below normal.“There were over 400 forest fires today. Several factors may have led to this. They (forests) have large bamboo plantations and bamboo leaves are highly inflammable. When there is less moisture and high fuel load in the form of dry leaves and twigs on the forest floor, fire catches easily and spreads rapidly. Jhum cultivation is also another factor. Mizoram has very good forests. During this dry season, certain manmade factors may have led to extensive fires. But this needs to be ascertained on ground,” Sunil Chandra, deputy director (Forest Geoinformatics Division) of FSI, said.Meanwhile, the weather body has predicted heat wave conditions over isolated pockets of Gujarat and coastal Odisha on Monday. A fresh feeble western disturbance is also likely to affect the Western Himalayan region from April 27, causing isolated rainfall/snowfall with thunderstorm and gusty winds over Jammu, Kashmir, Ladakh, Gilgit, Baltistan, Muzaffarabad, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand between April 27 and 30.A north-south trough (low pressure area) runs from Marathwada to south coastal Tamil Nadu across north interior Karnataka, Telangana and Rayalaseema in lower tropospheric levels, the IMD said. Under its influence, scattered to fairly widespread rainfall or thunderstorm is very likely over Kerala and Mahe, and isolated to scattered rainfall/thunderstorm over Maharashtra and remaining parts of south Peninsular India in the next three to four days. Heavy rainfall is also likely over north Kerala on April 28 and 29 and over south interior Karnataka on April 28 and 29.Strong surface winds (speed reaching 20-30 kmph) are very likely over Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh, Delhi and north Rajasthan on Monday and Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/48-hours-on-forest-fires-rage-across-mizoram-101619463394309.html
27-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Joe Biden speaks to PM Modi, says 'India was there for us, we'll be there for them'||United States President Joe Biden extended America's full support to India which is battling a severe Covid-19 second wave on his call with Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Joe Biden recounted India's contribution in US' fight against the deadly disease in a tweet from his official President account. The call between the two leaders comes on the day India recorded more than 3 lakh cases for fifth day in a row."Today, I spoke with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and pledged America’s full support to provide emergency assistance and resources in the fight against Covid-19.

The new infections brought India’s total to more than 17.3 million, behind only the United States.The US on Monday said it is working to relieve the suffering in India by supplying oxygen, diagnostic tests, treatments, ventilators and protective gear.The White House has also said it would make available sources of raw materials urgently needed for India to manufacture the AstraZeneca vaccine.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” President Joe Biden tweeted on Sunday.Help and support were also offered from archrival Pakistan, which said it could provide relief including ventilators, oxygen supply kits, digital X-ray machines, protective equipment and related items.Germany’s Health Ministry said it is urgently working to put together an aid package for India consisting of ventilators, monoclonal antibodies, the drug remdesivir, as well as surgical and N95 protective masks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/joe-biden-speaks-to-pm-modi-says-india-was-there-for-us-we-ll-be-there-for-them-101619461791850.html

Inspector BR Ghadge, posted at Akola, wrote on April 20 , a 14-page complaint (HT has a copy) against Singh to Chief Minister Uddhav Thackerey, home minister Dilip Walse Patil, the Director General of Police Maharashtra, Sanjay Pandey and DG Anti-Corruption Bureau, alleging that while serving as Commissioner of Police, Thane, Singh indulged in several illegal acts and made crores of rupees.Pandey confirmed receipt of the letter: “A complaint has been received by my office and as per legal procedure it is being looked into.”Singh did not answer phone calls and messages seeking comment. Ghadge’s letter claimed that as Thane CP, Singh gave orders to police officers to extricate some influential people from criminal cases registered against them, allegedly in return for huge sums of money.The letter further alleged that Singh accepted ₹50 lakh to ₹1 crore for posting of senior inspectors, and that he insisted on being gifted gold biscuits on Diwali from all zonal DCPs, ACPs and senior inspectors of Thane police . The letter specifically mentions a cheating and forgery case from 2013 where Kalyan Dombivli Municipal Corporation officials gave extra FSI to builders in dead people’s names and claimed that Ghadge was asked to drop the name of 22 government officials from the case. It also mentions the case involving a fake call centre on Mira road and several others. Ghadge alleged that because he refused to drop the case against the 22 in the KDMC case, four false cases were registered against him.  Ghadge has furnished details of the FSI case along with his complaint. According to the complaint, Singh bought 21 acres in Sindhudurg district in someone else’s name. He also alleged that Singh was using two government residences at one time, which amounts to criminal misconduct. Inspector Ghadge said that all these complaints were also previously made by him on September 21, 2015, March 17, 2016, May 30, 2016 and June 8, 2016, but that no action was taken. He added in the letter that he has also filed five write in the Bombay High Court in this regard over the years. Singh was removed as commissioner for what the state government claimed was his mishandling of the Antilla explosives case, and the murder of Mansukh Hiran, the man in possession of the vehicle in which the explosives were found, outside the residence of billionaire Mukesh Ambani. Hiran reported the vehicle stolen around a week before it was found with the explosives in late February. He himself was subsequently found dead. Mumbai policeman Sachin Vaze has been named as the main accused in both cases by the National Investigation Agency. After his removal as commissioner, Singh wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that the state’s home minister Anil Deshmukh instructed Vaze to extort money from restaurants and bars in the city. He also approached the courts with his complaint, following which the Bombay High Court ordered the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, a move that forced Deshmukh’s resignation. Singh is already facing two enquiries being carried out by DGP Sanjay Pandey.In the first, Pandey is checking whether there was any dereliction of duty on part of Singh in not apprising the government about the Antilia bomb scare . The second inquiry pertains to corruption allegations made against him by police inspector Anup Dange.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/inspector-accuses-ex-mumbai-top-cop-of-cheating-corruption-101619462778580.html

27-04-2021||Today's||Evidence: The bedrock of Covid management||Twitter in India is a desperate place. Pleas for beds, sources of oxygen, remdesivir and plasma overwhelm, even as volunteers amplify messages and scramble to help. Tongue twisters — tocilizumab, itolizumab — appear in discussion as people call, message and sink into despair and guilt at being unable to procure what they are told is needed to care for their family or friend.We are struggling with a health care system that is inequitable in access and quality at the best of times. There is limited surge capacity for seasonal illnesses in hospitals, few trained and competent staff, especially in infectious diseases and critical care, and a fragmented health care system. At any time, and especially now, evidence-based medicine, or “the right care at the right time to the right patient” is essential.As the Indian medical community and health policymakers, we have not done well in this pandemic. We have promoted, as “cures”, poorly evaluated treatments from our traditional systems of medicine. This is a disservice to the accrued knowledge over millennia of the science of life in Indian systems of medicine.We have held on to “expert opinion” for drugs such as hydroxychloroquine, even as data continued to emerge from randomised controlled trials that it did not work. Guidance from the National Covid-19 Task Force from last week treats as equivalent “may do” recommendations, hydroxychloroquine, for which data from the Together trial in outpatients and the World Health Organization (WHO) Solidarity trial in inpatients show lack of benefit, and inhaled budesonide, which is supported at least by the open label Stoic trial and showed less progression to need for hospitalisation and less time to recover.Evidence-based medicine requires lifelong learning, and the continued education of medical communities and patients. For a new infectious disease where we have little knowledge of how damage is caused and how to manage or reverse it, it is important to focus on the generation of evidence by testing old and new drugs and medical management measures.Early in the course of the Sars-CoV2 pandemic, we relied heavily on information emerging from China where it appeared that we would need early and intensive ventilatory support, and many clinical trials were supported for antivirals and other drugs. Through the experience of pulmonologists and critical care specialists, we now know that keeping patients off ventilators for as long as possible makes it feasible to manage many with oxygen masks, high-flow nasal cannulas or non-invasive ventilation, moving to invasive ventilation as a last resort. Whether it is proning or ventilation, these were not situations where the treatment could be hidden from the patient or the doctor, so blinded or controlled and randomised clinical trials were not feasible.However, when it comes to specific drugs, the right drug at the right time for the right patient does and should depend on evidence and that evidence needs to be generated through clinical trials, and not depend on opinion. Many of the early Chinese clinical trials failed to meet their recruitment targets and initially we had little evidence to base our recommendations on.To know what drugs are needed when, it is important to understand how the disease is caused and develops. In the early phase, the disease is primarily driven by replication of Sars-CoV-2. Later, and especially when the infection is not controlled and symptoms start to become severe, the disease appears to be driven by an uncontrolled immune and inflammatory response to Sars-CoV-2 that leads to tissue damage. Based on this understanding, in general, any antiviral treatment would have the greatest effect early in the course of the disease, while immunosuppressive/anti-inflammatory therapies would be needed in the later stages of Covid-19.With positive data on budesonide (an inhaled steroid used for asthma) in early illness and dexamethasone in hospitalised patients with severe disease from the Stoic and Recovery trials, it appears that steroids are important to stop the disease from progressing. Many drugs for which there was some hope, such as the antiviral lopinavir/ritonavir, interferon and hydroxychloroquine have been shown not to work.For remdesivir, the Solidarity trial showed no effect on severe disease or death, but the ACTT-1 trial showed that for patients who were at the stage of requiring supplemental oxygen, but not yet needing high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, remdesivir provided some benefit in shortening duration and preventing death. This highlights that the drug is not for every patient, but for a small subset at a specific stage of treatment.Similarly, for tocilizumab, evidence-based recommendations are narrow, for a subset of patients with rapid progression who need either high-flow oxygen or non-invasive ventilation, and in combination with other therapy including steroids. For plasma therapy, there is no evidence that any plasma from any group of donors is helpful as shown in the Indian Council of Medical Research-supported Placid trial, and is not currently recommended. Clear answers come from large clinical trials. We have over 400 registered studies in the Clinical Trials Registry of India, mostly small studies that will not inform future practice.As people desperately seek drugs that may not be needed, we have an ethical and moral responsibility to ensure that all health care providers use evidence to inform treatment. Professional organisations, clinical research communities, the regulator and policymakers must play a role in ensuring that treatments are used according to need and not to create false hope.Gagandeep Kang is professor, Christian Medical College, VelloreThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/evidence-the-bedrock-of-covid-management-101619532812017.html
27-04-2021||Today's||Decentralise and empower states and civil society||“Wait for Godot or wait for God?” — is a philosophical question that seekers direct at the masters. Godot was an enigmatic character created by the Irish playwright Samuel Beckett in his popular play, Waiting for Godot. In Beckett’s play, two characters, Vladimir and Estragon, engage in animated discussions about various issues while waiting for the arrival of Godot, who never turns up. Waiting for Godot eventually became an allegory in the Christian tradition for man’s urge for salvation which would never come.Allegorically speaking, that appears to be the situation the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic has pushed many in India towards. The health care establishment has been so overwhelmed that many patients find it difficult to access. Although called a wave, the second outburst of the pandemic turned out to be a tsunami.We were able to handle the first wave efficiently. It was possible due to the timely steps taken by the government on one hand, and the disciplined response of the people on the other. But, over the last few months, complacency seems to have crept in. Going by the statements of the leaders in the government, they did not anticipate the virulence of the second wave. Citizens too seemed to be taking things lightly by not following pandemic protocols.Social media is full of criticism these days. The larger share of the blame is laid at the doorstep of the government. It may partly be because people had high expectations from this government. They were convinced from last year’s experience that the government knew how to handle the pandemic and would act swiftly. When things seem otherwise, they naturally blame the government.Criticism is easy. But it must also be remembered that the challenge before the government is unprecedented. Nobody in the country has witnessed such a massive health care crisis in their lifetime. The last time that humanity experienced such a crisis was during the Spanish flu in 1918-19. An estimated 20 million Indians had perished during that pandemic. Globally, over 100 million were said to have died of that virus. The severity of the Spanish flu virus was such that Mahatma Gandhi, himself afflicted, had confided in a confidante that “all interest in living has ceased”.Covid is not too dissimilar to the Spanish flu. Both spread through human contact, and nose and mouth were the infecting organs. There are lessons to be learnt from both the experiences.One big lesson that the Covid-19 pandemic has taught is that a country of India’s size and diversity needed greater decentralisation. Decentralisation does not simply mean the Centre forwarding vaccines, medicines and oxygen supplies to the states for free distribution. It is about sufficiently empowering various stakeholders, including state governments, district and village administrations and non-governmental organisations (NGOs).Right from the time of the making of the Indian Constitution, there was a tendency for building a strong Centre. Many members of the Constituent Assembly had argued that we should make, not a federal, but a unitary constitution. Many expressed fears about Indian provinces developing secessionist tendencies if a federal system was put in place. The provincial representatives, on the other hand, were against centralisation. BR Ambedkar, in his own wisdom, rightly impressed upon the members the need for having balanced decentralisation of powers. He insisted that the dominance of the Centre will be “expressly confined to emergencies only”.There is a health care emergency today, no doubt. But it must be appreciated that greater empowered involvement of different stakeholders is imperative for the country to tide over this emergency. The differential and higher pricing of vaccines for states is unconvincing. Health being a state subject, the states are responsible for health care and need a greater independent role. Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s principle of cooperative federalism should be at work.Civil society and NGOs, which have been facing some difficulties in the recent past, need to be encouraged to supplement the government’s efforts. In 1918, when British administrators had run away from the crisis and hidden in palatial rest-houses in forests and remote areas, it was the media and civil society which had provided succour to the suffering millions. “Never before, perhaps, in the history of India, have the educated and more fortunately placed members of the community, come forward in large numbers to help their poorer brethren in time of distress,” a British government report said.Lastly, when a crisis befalls a nation, intellectual humility needs to be the way for all who matter. Just as success brings plaudits, crisis brings panning. There will be advice, both solicited and unsolicited and criticism, both warranted and unwarranted. But in such a situation, the wise betray humility, not haughtiness. Haughtiness may win the day, but humility wins the race. It can be called the Socratic way.When unreasonably condemned by the Athenian court for treason, Socrates, referring to an oracle’s statement that he was the wisest among all citizens, humbly says: “What’s likely, gentlemen, is that in reality it’s the god who is wise, and the oracle is saying, ‘he among you humans is wisest who, like Socrates, knows that he’s really worth nothing when it comes to wisdom’.”Ram Madhav is a member of the national executive of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh and member of the board of governors, India FoundationThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/decentralise-and-empower-states-and-civil-society-101619532810917.html

To put this number in perspective, even during the brutal third wave in the United States, daily deaths never grew at a rate that exceeded 50%. India’s daily deaths have been increasing above that 50% threshold for nearly four straight weeks now. Does this mean that India is squandering its advantage of having the best case fatality rate, or CFR, among the world’s worst-hit nations? A close look at numbers presents a disturbing answer. For an accurate understanding of the relationship between Covid-19 cases and deaths, one must keep in account a 14-day lag. This is because studies have showed that the median time between someone testing positive for Covid-19 and dying from it (if things go South) is around 13.8 days. So, people who are dying because of Covid-19 today will most likely have tested positive around two weeks ago. In the past week, 17,330 people died across the country. If we look at the corresponding period 14 days ago, there were 1,001,558 new infections in the country. This would imply that around 1.7% of all Covid-19 patients are currently dying – the highest proportion since at least early August. A week before that, CFR was 1.6%; two weeks before, it was 1.3%. When we look at the same figures in the number of deaths reported in early February, the CFR drops to as low as 0.7%. So, it is clear that the CFR, which was dropping steadily for the past several months, has again started rising. This rising mortality rate is not because the disease has become more fatal all of a sudden, but because the massive caseload (there were nearly 2.9 million active cases in the country on Monday) has completely overwhelmed India’s health care system. People are dying not just because of the fatality of the disease, but also due to the lack of treatment, hospital beds, medicines, oxygen, even ambulances. With active cases continuing to rise at a record level, the burden on the country’s health care system is only increasing, which means the crisis will only worsen in the near future. On Sunday, with 354,709 new cases, India broke the record for most daily cases reported in a country for the fifth day in a row. If 1.7% of these cases end up dying, India will likely be reporting daily deaths in excess of 6,000 a day in as little as two weeks. This is a frightening figure, even without taking into account reports of massive undercounting of deaths or the impact of a further rising active caseload on CFR. Most models expect India’s second wave to peak by the third week of May. By then, if fatality numbers don’t turn around, confirmed daily deaths may be in excess of 7,000 a day. This highlights the urgency of arresting the second wave — the lives of hundreds of thousands of people are at stake.jamie.mullick@htlive.comThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/in-the-second-wave-is-india-s-cfrrising-101619532751242.html
27-04-2021||Today's||The Taste with Vir Sanghvi: The slow death of hope||It shouldn’t feel so different. After all, we have been here before. Last year, we were locked in at home for months while the government tried to cope with what was then, the worst Pandemic since the Spanish Flu of the early Twentieth Century.And yet, this time feels totally different.The last time around too there were stories about the rapid spread of cases. There were appeals on social media for ventilator beds at hospitals. There were queues at crematoria.There was widespread paranoia about surfaces. Don’t touch newspapers, we were told. Don’t touch boxes or packages. Don’t touch takeaway foods. Don’t even touch currency notes.This time around, the lockdown is not so stringent. The stuff about getting Covid from surfaces has been debunked and put into context. (Yes, it is theoretically possible but very unlikely.) We have faced Covid before and it is no longer a mysterious new threat.And yet, we are more depressed, more panicked, more paranoid and more gloomy about the future than we have been at any time since the Covid pandemic started.What’s made the difference?Two words.Confidence. And Hope.During the first wave, we were confident that the lockdown was a holding operation. That, as terrible as it was, the crisis would peter out. Doctors were looking for solutions. There would soon be a vaccine. We would augment hospital capacity. Should the virus return for a second massive bite out of us, we would be prepared. We had confidence in the government and in its medical establishment.This time around, we realise that we were betrayed. That the confidence was misplaced.And last time we had hope. We believed then, that for all its problems, India was on its way to becoming a major power. That the virus was a global phenomenon and given how low our death rates were (compared to some Western countries) we would actually emerge stronger than the rest of the world when the crisis ended.It is getting harder and harder to be hopeful now.Let’s take the betrayal of confidence, first.Our primary hope lay in the vaccine. And in fact the vaccine developed by Oxford University did come along pretty much on schedule. India took a while to approve it perhaps because we were waiting for a domestic vaccine, created by Bharat Biotech to also be ready so that we could launch both together and claim that this was an achievement of Atmanirbhar Bharat.No matter. At least we had the vaccines.Then, the screw-ups began. Not recognising the need for emergency action, we rolled out the programme too slowly. When other vaccine manufacturers asked for permission to sell in India, we were sniffy. We don’t need Pfizer, we said. Will Sputnik even work in summer temperatures in Rajasthan? Go and do more tests before we approve, we told them.Instead of taking the line that, if a vaccine was approved for use by the world’s major countries, you needed to do very little further research before buying it, we insisted that we had to run the approvals process from scratch. (As a matter of interest, the so-called Indian vaccines are still not approved in the US. Neither AstraZeneca --- which we call ‘Indian’ because we manufacture it in India under licence in Poona — nor the Bharat Biotech vaccine have been approved in the US.)The priority then was to score political points. We were going to use Indian vaccines, we were told. We would not import any vaccines from abroad, even if they were available (which, given the demand, was already a big ask). The vaccine programme would be the Prime Minister’s personal triumph. They even put his photo on the vaccine certificates.You can argue about the merits of this strategy but what you can’t dispute is that we did not order enough doses to vaccinate most of our people. Even today, many centres run out of vaccines. It is generally accepted that we face a vaccine shortage.Despite the urgency of the situation, only around two per cent of our population has been fully vaccinated (both doses) to date.Two percent.Confidence in these guys?You must be kidding.And then there is the oxygen problem. Covid itself may or may not necessarily be fatal but if a patient in serious condition doesn’t get oxygen, he or she dies.Each day, scores of people who should have lived, die because hospitals do not have enough oxygen.Who is to blame for those killings?In Delhi the state government blames the Centre for the oxygen shortage. The Centre blames the state government.Either way, it is a governmental failure.Can you really have confidence in those people? In the health ‘experts’ who screwed up the vaccination policy? In the politicians who played with lives to advance their own petty interests.And as for hope, well, here’s why that is so hard to rely on.Last year, Dr. VK Paul, the government’s Covid Czar told us that the pandemic would wind down by May 2020.Earlier this year, Harsh Vardhan, the Health Minister bowed low before Baba Ramdev before endorsing Coronil, a ‘medicine’ that was first advertised as a cure for Covid, and then, when that claim could not be sustained, described as an immunity-booster. Dr. Paul did his bit. He urged us to have haldi milk, kadha and Chyawanprash if we had Covid. This was while he was still denying most of us the vaccine.As for the pandemic, Harsh Vardhan told us, we were in the endgame.Who can have any hope when the people who are supposed to look after our health are such negligent nitwits?As deaths have risen, the Prime Minister has stepped in. Every vaccine that has been approved abroad can be used in India, you can import vaccines, and the eligibility criteria have been expanded.Everything the government’s critics had asked for has finally been done.But no, though the PM has overturned every one of their decisions (when it is too late to save many lives) not one of the guys who landed us in this mess has been sacked or held accountable.So if you can’t have hope in the health ‘experts’ can you have hope in their political masters?Not a chance.Politicians knew what they were doing when they held super-spreader rallies in Bengal. They knew what they were doing when they allowed the Kumbh to go ahead. They can’t be surprised that Covid cases have surged in Bengal and Uttaranchal.So that’s why, this time around, there is zero confidence and so little hope.Last year, we settled down to a holding operation, steeled ourselves for sacrifices, baked bread at home and looked for distracting lockdown activities.This time, we are panicked and desperate. We have been betrayed.And we don’t know who to turn to.For more stories by Vir Sanghvi read here||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-with-vir-sanghvi-the-slow-death-of-hope-101619519054846.html
27-04-2021||Editorials||Tackling the issue of biomedical waste | HT Editorial||The Noida Authority in the Delhi-National Capital Region has put up 500 red-coloured bins at city markets, cremation grounds, and other sites to dispose of Covid-19 waste such as masks, gloves and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. According to the authority’s estimate, Noida is producing at least 70 kg of biomedical waste a day. This is one example of a wider challenge posed by the pandemic — of tackling Covid-19 waste.According to a Central Pollution Control Board report, released in November 2020, India generated around 33,000 tonnes of Covid-19 biomedical waste between April and November. Before the pandemic, regular biomedical waste generation in India was at 610 MT per day, but now, the waste has gone up to 765.5 MT per day. While Maharashtra has been the biggest contributor to biomedical waste, not a surprise given it has had the highest number of cases nationally, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi also figure among the top 10 waste generators.The pandemic has exposed India’s broken system of biomedical waste management. If this waste is not managed scientifically, it can cause great harm to the environment and to human health. It is imperative to define Covid-19 waste; identify different types of waste generators; launch a large-scale campaign for awareness related to PPE usage. Urban local bodies must provide separate waste bins, and push citizens to segregate waste at source. The government must also augment the capacities of biomedical treatment units with appropriate monitoring strategies and work with all stakeholders — doctors, innovators and medical items and equipment manufacturers — to come up with a plan to reduce the waste burden.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/tackling-the-issue-of-biomedical-waste-hteditorial-101619532752431.html
27-04-2021||Editorials||Preserving a friendship | HT Editorial||At a time of distress, friends matter. And it is disappointing when a friend does not instinctively reach out and help, and, instead, may even add to the distress. As India got hit by the second wave, this is what happened with the United States (US) — when it was seen as blocking the export of raw materials essential to ramp up vaccine production or sitting on unused vaccines or not offering medical resources India needed to fight the pandemic. This may have been due to a range of reasons — America’s isolationist foreign policy impulse (which has got reinforced because of the politics of ultra-nationalism), or a ruthless and insensitive decision-making matrix blind to suffering elsewhere, or its slow internal decision-making process, or its own trauma of pandemic leading to hoarding all resources available to fight Covid-19, or India’s mixed messaging, or all of the above. The US came across as unreliable, even when antagonistic countries offered support. This led to a ground-up backlash, and rightly-so, against Washington. The good news is that the Joe Biden administration listened to feedback — communicated by its own diplomats, Indian interlocutors, the diaspora, prominent Indian and American think-tanks, sections in the Hill (where even some critics of the current government in Delhi worked to voice India’s case), media reports, and social media. This was not just a support package at stake — the entire relationship and perceptions of the US in India were at stake. And in the last two days, there has been a high-level attention to the issue, culminating in President Biden’s phone conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday night. The US has committed to providing emergency assistance, “including oxygen-related supplies, vaccine materials, and therapeutics”. It has also announced a plan to share its stock of 60 million AstraZeneca vaccines, of which India will be a beneficiary. The good thing is it did not make it sound like a favour but acknowledged the Indian assistance to the US in its time of need.It is important not to let the blip affect the relationship, and stay focused on what is the core battle — fighting Covid-19 through established protocols, better-resourced health infrastructure, and universal vaccination. Delhi should leverage all the help it can get from the US, hold it to its commitments, preserve the friendship, and use it to alleviate the distress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/preserving-a-friendship-ht-editorial-101619532749459.html
