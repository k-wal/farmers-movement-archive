A team had visited the Bhondsi Nature Park last week as it has a lot of space available. A temporary structure would be set up there. The district administration and the health department are likely to set up a Covid-19 care centre there, after estimating the total cost.”The Haryana Forest Development Corporation officials, meanwhile, said that it will be a temporary structure with around 50 oxygen beds. “We and the forest department are trying to find places that could be used for treating Covid-positive patients. The existing infrastructure at the eco-tourism destination, Bhondsi Nature Park, suits the requirements to an extent, so a temporary structure with around 50 oxygen beds could be built there,” said a senior official from the forest development corporation, requesting anonymity.The official added that the forest rest houses in other blocks of Gurugram, if required, could also be converted into Covid-19 care centres on further instructions by the district administration. Gurugram has been witnessing a continuous spike in the number of Covid-19 cases since the past few days, with the district reporting over 3,000 cases on a daily basis for the past five days.On Monday, Gurugram reported 3,555 fresh Covid-19 cases, and seven deaths. At present, Gurugram has over 27,000 active cases, with a doubling rate of 28.82 days, said the officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/bhondsi-nature-park-to-be-turned-into-covid-care-centre-101619461039726.html
26-04-2021||Gurugram||17 RWAs write to DC for more empowerment, enforcement of measures||Around 17 Resident Welfare Association (RWAs) from Gurugram sent a joint letter to Dr Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, on Sunday evening, asking for more empowerment and enforcement of measures to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 at their respective condominiums, societies, and plotted housing colonies.In the letter — a copy of which was accessed by HT — the RWAs have appealed to Garg to give them the power to take action against those violating home isolation norms repeatedly. They also highlighted that, despite a rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in their residential areas and informing the local primary health centres (PHCs) about the same, the areas are either not named in the administration’s list of containment zones or added after a prolonged delay.Garg had issued an order to the RWAs on April 7, directing them to take action to encourage residents to stay indoors, discourage private functions, and ensure that everybody wears masks. His order, however, had not mentioned or given any executive powers to the RWAs for taking action against the violators. “Any suggestion or advice that can help reduce or contain the spread of the virus is always welcomed, especially during this Covid-19 crisis. All the demands of the respective RWAs will be examined, and the administration will take the next step on the matter accordingly,” Garg said on Monday.Barring Carlton Estate in DLF 5, the remaining RWAs are either located near Sohna Road or Golf Course Extension Road. The remaining 16 RWAs that submitted the joint letter to the Garg via email are: Wembley Estate, Tatvam Villas, Unitech Escape, Unitech Harmony, Uniworld Gardens, Vatika City, IREO Uptown, Grand Arch, Malibu Towne, Orchid Petals, The Nile, Vipul World, Tatvam Villas, Central Park 2, Nirvana Country, and TATA Raisina.Pawan Tharwani, president, Carlton Estate Condominium Association (CECA), said that there were several towers in the condominium that have been reporting a lot of Covid-19 infections. Despite informing the local PHC about the situation repeatedly, two of these towers have not been mentioned in the list of containment zones yet. “There is no prior information given or taken from the RWA on several measures. The lack of communication and clear directives on behalf of the administration are an obstacle in the efforts of the RWA to contain the spread of the coronavirus. Hence, in our letter, we have stated that the criteria for containment zones should be made clear, and the list should be updated on a daily basis. We are thus seeking the DC’s intervention in the matter,” said Tharwani, adding that two towers in the condominium were added in the list of containment zones two weeks ago, much after the RWA had highlighted the rise in the cases there.Tharwani also said that the administration had informed the RWA after three days that the two towers were included in the latest list of containment zones.Several RWAs also highlighted that they are not “empowered enough to deal with the repeated offenders and nuisance makers, who have been violating isolation norms or safety protocols”.Rear Admiral (retired) Kapil Gupta, president, Unitech Escape RWA in Sector 50, said that action can be taken against the RWAs for not implementing Covid-19 norms as per the Haryana State Disaster Management Authority (HSDMA) guidelines. “While the government has the right to take action against the RWAs for failing to take restrictive measures, they also need to realise that we have no power or authority to take action against the violators now. Even if a person under home isolation steps out, there is a little we can do, besides requesting him/her to comply, or make a complaint to the administration. Hence, we have requested the DC to give us executive powers and contain the spread of the virus,” said Gupta.In the letter, the RWAs have also highlighted non-availability of basic Covid-19 related medicines, medicines being sold at inflated prices, shortage of oxygen cylinders, concentrators and ambulances, private ambulance owners charging hefty amounts, shortage of RT-PCR tests, non-availability of oxygen beds in hospitals, non-availability of yellow garbage bags for Covid-19 waste segregation and collection, late removal of bio-medical waste from residential areas, and shortage of vaccines, due to which the residential vaccination camps are being cancelled, among other such observations. In addition, they have also appealed to Garg to hold a video conference call with the RWA representatives, to understand their difficulties and address the issues mentioned in the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/17-rwas-write-to-dc-for-more-empowerment-enforcement-of-measures-101619461038401.html
26-04-2021||Gurugram||Patients in home isolation struggle to get antiviral drugs||Covid-19 patients in home isolation are struggling to get antiviral drugs over the last 10 days, with many taking to social media and some even paying procuring stocks from those black marketing them.Officials said that the shortage of drugs to treat Covid-19 patients, including remdesivir, is mainly due to panic buying. “People have stored the medicines thinking there is a lack of supply, whereas the manufacturers have been asked to double their production and the consignments are expected midweek. While people are stocking up these medicines expecting a shortage, those who are in dire need are not getting them, due to which several Covid patients in home isolation are suffering, with many developing serious complications,” Amandeep Chauhan, district drugs controller, said.According to the data available with the health department, 26,137 Covid-19 patients are in home isolation in the district, most of who consult doctors on video calls.Chemists familiar with the situation said that only favipiravir, an antiviral, and tocilizumab, an immunosuppressant, besides multivitamins, are available at a few stores.Prince Philkana, a resident of Palm Drive, who has been in isolation for the last two days said he has been trying to arrange medicines for his ailing mother and himself, but to no avail. “People are messaging me to pay more than the market price, but it is only available in Delhi and other states. Chemists in Gurugram said they have not received the stock for the last 10 days,” he said.Another resident, Vatsala Arora, said she was trying to buy antiviral medicines for her husband who tested positive, but has not been able to do so. “People are black marketing these medicines and there is no support from the local administration. The government should cap the charges and these should be available for the residents. We are struggling every day, while the mafias are getting data of home isolation patients and contacting them for the supply,” he said.In a few instances, hospital staffers were also stealing the drugs to make a quick buck, as reported by HT over the past few days.Doctors said that many private hospitals recommended remdesivir to patients in home isolation, but due to the non-availability of the same, they are in a panic. “Lots of patients are also consulting doctors of their home town who have been prescribing these medicines even at a stage where it is not required,” said a senior doctor at a government hospital.Meanwhile, chemists said they have run out of antiviral medicines, with many stopping home deliveries due to rising demand and increasing pressure.Jatin Chachra, a chemist in Jacobpura, said that there is high demand for remdesivir, tocilizumab, Medrol tablets, zinc tablets, Mucinac and Tazact over the last 10 days. “People are ready to pay ten times the cost, but there is no supply in the market. There are a few available medicines, but people pick them as soon as the supply hits the market,” he said, adding that a few people were found stocking up to sell at higher prices.A chemist in Basai Road, Vineet Madan, said that the situation is getting difficult to manage with every passing day. “People threaten us to give medicines thinking we are stocking them. Families beg us and cry, pleading with us to give them a few doses, but it is unfortunate that despite regular follow-ups with the stockists, we are unable to fulfil the needs of customers who are in dire need,” he said.Chauhan, on the other hand, said that strict action will be taken against those found black-marketing the medicines. “We will take action against persons hoarding these medicines without need, if we receive complaints against them,” said Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/patients-in-home-isolation-struggle-to-get-antiviral-drugs-101619460978331.html
26-04-2021||Gurugram||Hospital, realty firm tie up to treat moderately ill patients in empty flats||Amid an acute shortage of Covid-19 beds, a multi-speciality hospital and a real estate company have tied up to shift 300-400 mild to moderately ill Covid-19 patients to empty flats where oxygen beds will be placed, Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Monday, even as the city continues to face a shortage of beds.“A tie-up between Medanta hospital and M3M (a real estate developer) has been done in Gurugram where beds with oxygen facility will be arranged in empty flats, where less serious patients will be shifted from Medanta Hospital. Through this, 300 to 400 more beds for Covid-19 patients can be made available,” a release by the district administration stated.As per the Gurugram Covid Combat Companion (GC3), a real-time portal managed by the district administration, there were only four oxygen, three Intensive Care Unit (ICU), and a solitary Covid-19 ventilator bed available in Gurugram across its 43 Covid-19 hospitals on Monday night.Khattar was in the city on Monday to review the Covid-19 situation and visit oxygen plants, the release stated. Issues of oxygen supply, availability of beds and remdesivir stock were the main points discussed with senior officials from across the state through video conference at the PWD rest house in Civil Lines.A key development in the conference was the formation of a centralised control room at Chandigarh, to monitor the status and arrangements of Covid-19 across Haryana, under principal secretary Vijendra Kumar.Khattar said that Haryana has been allocated 162 metric tonnes of oxygen from the Central government and the same will be distributed based on their assessments. He said that district drug control officers have been made responsible for arranging as well as ensuring the correct distribution of oxygen.In the meeting, it was also decided that medical students who have undertaken the fourth and fifth year examinations of PGIMS, Rohtak, and those doing MD and MS will also be taken to fill any shortfall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospital-realty-firm-tie-up-to-treat-moderately-ill-patients-in-empty-flats-101619460979000.html
26-04-2021||Gurugram||Smaller hospitals struggle to transport oxygen supplies||More than 20 hospitals with low bed capacities in the city are struggling to replenish their oxygen supply on a daily basis, with hospital staffers having to restock and transport the cylinders from facilities across the district, according to hospital administrations.Dr Prithvi Raj Aryan, the director of Aryan Hospital on Old Railway Road, which has a capacity of 70 beds, all of which are occupied by Covid-19 patients, said that the hospital staff is involved in refilling and transporting oxygen cylinders. “It is sad to see more than six staff members are only involved in arranging oxygen supply. The administration only shares the location but is not delivering the supply. It is taking more than eight hours to arrange four oxygen cylinders,” he said.Dr Aryan also said that he contacted the deputy commissioner and the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), asking them to hire private vehicles for the deliveries. “The cost of oxygen and vehicle can be taken from the hospitals. This way we will get the oxygen supply at our doorstep and the staff can focus on patients health instead of arranging oxygen. There is no support from any department and it seems it is an individual battle, we are fighting for our patients’ lives and officers have turned a blind eye,” he said.Dr Ashok Khanna, of Kalyani Hospital in Sector 14, said that they are managing oxygen on their own with great difficulty. “There is shortage everywhere and we are managing to get oxygen every day from different places so that 28 patients can get proper oxygen,” he said.Private hospitals that do not have oxygen plants in their hospitals are dependent on cylinders, which are already short in the market.Doctors of private hospitals said they were assured that oxygen supply will be streamlined last week, with supplies arranged from plants in Panipat and Bhiwadi of Rajasthan, but to no avail. Hospitals have cited genuine concerns about medical oxygen availability even after the supply was resumed from the Bhiwadi plant.Dipankar Sethi, general manager, operations, Sethi Hospital in Model Town, said that the oxygen supply was not reaching the hospital on time. “It is the responsibility of the hospital to arrange and manage oxygen. We are running to Manesar and Sector 37 to get the oxygen cylinders refilled. Despite repeated reminders to the administration, we are not getting oxygen,” he said.On the other hand, the district administration said that all demands were met and regular oxygen supplies were sent to private hospitals.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said the mobile numbers of all the officials have been shared with the private hospitals. “We are responding to all calls and messages throughout the day and the teams are on their toes. If any hospital is alleging that they have not received oxygen supply, then I have all the records (to show that) they have regularly being supplied. We are trying to increase the oxygen supply and demands are being met,” he said.Garg said they are regularly coordinating with oxygen plants and with the two companies in Bhiwadi and Panipat to increase the supply. “Hospitals have been assured that oxygen supply will be streamlined this week as logistics are being arranged. There has been an improvement, as compared to last week and we are hopeful to overcome this issue at the earliest,” he said.Hospitals in the city have been grappling with a shortage of oxygen supply amid the spiral in Covid-19 cases.On Sunday, six critically ill Covid-19 patients who were on ventilator support died at two private hospitals due to a shortage of oxygen. Staff at the hospital alleged that they had raised the alarm with the authorities concerned well on time, but did not get the supply despite assurances.Dr AK Kathuria, the owner of Kathuria Hospital, where four patients died on Sunday, said that if the situation remains the same, the hospital will have to shut operations as families of other patients are also panicking. “Raising voice against the administration will leave an impact but we cannot play with the lives who are admitted in our hospital and have faith in us,” he said.Officials said that it is a difficult situation for all parties concerned and they are regularly coordinating with the hospital staff on daily basis. “Even a green corridor has been created by police for the regular and quick supply from Bhiwadi and Panipat. We are also trying to tie up with the local suppliers for delivery,” Garg said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/smaller-hospitals-struggle-to-transport-oxygen-supplies-101619460918366.html
26-04-2021||Gurugram||Two more deaths in Gurugram as hospitals grapple with low oxygen supply||Two critically ill Covid-19 patients who were on ventilator support at the Center of Diabetes and Allied Sciences (CDAS) died late Sunday evening due to oxygen shortage, according to the hospital management, which took the number of deaths due to oxygen shortage in the district to six, all reported over the last two days.Dr S Raghunandan, vice-president, CDAS, said that they alerted the local administration about the shortage two hours before the supplies ran low, but did not get any help. “A 60-year-old woman died at 8.25pm and a 61-year-old man died at 8.35pm on Sunday due to lack of oxygen. There was another death but that was not related to Covid,” said Dr Raghunandan.“We are facing a huge problem due to shortage of oxygen supply. The local supplier has refused to supply. We are managing our operations with the minimum oxygen supply we can manage,” said Dr Raghunandan.CDAS in Sector 47 has a capacity of 50 beds, of which 38 are occupied by Covid-19 patients.Dr AK Kathuria, the owner of Kathuria Hospital, where four Covid-19 deaths were reported due to low oxygen on Sunday, said on Monday that the situation has not improved. “We are still struggling for oxygen cylinders and there is no help from the administration. My son who is also a doctor is struggling in queues to get the cylinders filled from Manesar. We are not even getting eight cylinders a day, whereas we require 25 in a day. Where is the oxygen going? This is a question we want to be answered,” he said.Officials of the district administration refuted the allegations made by the hospital managements but admitted that there is a shortfall in oxygen supply.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said they have been delivering oxygen supply to all the hospitals and they have records of all the deliveries, but failed to share the same. “We were informed regarding the deaths later but we were not aware that the situation was grim and patients could die. The hospitals are creating pressure tactics. We are here to meet their need, not their greed. There is a WhatsApp group where all the private hospitals, nodal officer, chief medical officer (CMO) and Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) commissioner has been added and prompt action is taken on each request,” he said.Garg said that at present, the district is receiving 35 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen, against a requirement of 50 MT. “We are adding more beds and will need more oxygen, for which we are trying to increase the supply through both plants in Panipat and Rajasthan,” he said.Also, the district administration directed hospitals to report shortfall in supply at least six hours in advance, as it is not possible to respond to requests made an hour or less before the supply runs out.Garg said, “We have asked private hospitals to inform us six hours in advance if they are facing a shortage of oxygen so that timely oxygen can be managed. We need this much time to arrange and send oxygen supply as it’s not readily available with us.”The city has been grappling with a shortage in oxygen supply for the past 10 days amid a huge surge in coronavirus cases. Many hospitals on Monday also reported a shortage in oxygen and took to social media platforms, seeking immediate help from the district administration. At 6.51pm on Monday, a Twitter user posted that Genesis Hospital in Sector 84 was running out of oxygen, with 12 to 13 patients requiring oxygen support.Officials of Genesis Hospital could not be contact for comment on the matter.Many family members of Covid-19 patients said they paid exorbitant amounts, up to ₹1.5 lakh, to get oxygen cylinders.Dr Raghunandan of CDAS said, “We were standing in long queues on Monday to get oxygen cylinders but our demands are not met. The doctors at the hospital are running pillar to post to refill cylinders, leaving patients. We have never felt this helpless in our entire career.”Many hospitals said that they have stopped new admissions due to lack of oxygen supply. “We have limited oxygen now and the situation is getting worse day by day. We are getting very less supply of oxygen and cannot run a hospital like this,” said a senior official of W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56.“Issue continues with the oxygen supply. We are making our own arrangements on a daily basis,” said Dr Devlina Chakravarty, the managing director of Artemis Hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/two-more-deaths-in-gurugram-as-hospitals-grapple-with-low-oxygen-supply-101619460918976.html
26-04-2021||Lucknow||SP, Congress engaging in politics of lies: UP minister||UP minister Siddharth Nath Singh on Monday lashed out at the Congress and Samajwadi Party (SP) for engaging in “politics of lies” to defame the BJP government.“During these pandemic times, Congress leader Priyanka Gandhiji and SP chief Akhilesh Yadavji should focus on helping the people instead of trading in politics of lies,” he said.His statement made to the media came a day after the Congress government in Chhattisgarh announced it was sending 16 tons of oxygen for a private hospital in Lucknow. “On being informed by Priyanka Gandhiji on phone about acute crisis of oxygen in Lucknow, a tanker of oxygen has been sent for Medanta Hospital in Lucknow,” Chhattisgarh chief minister Bhupesh Baghel had tweeted on Sunday.However, Siddharth Nath claimed the opposition leaders, desperate to regain lost political ground, were engaged in political stunt instead of helping the people.“Everyone knows what the Congress government had done last time in the name of sending students from UP, back to their villages, during the lockdown announced by the government in the first Covid wave,” he said.“Instead of questioning us, the Congress would do well to question their own chief ministers on what they have done to help the common man hit by the pandemic,” Siddharth Nath said.The UP minister also hit out at the SP chief. “Instead of raising fingers at the BJP government, the SP should tell what all it did to better health infrastructure in the state during its four stints in power,” he said.The UP government’s counterattack came after Congress leaders, including its state chief Ajay Kumar ‘Lallu’ and other party leaders in the state took to twitter to thank the Chhattisgarh chief minister even as his party leaders, including former Congress chief Rahul Gandhi and party’s UP in-charge Priyanka Gandhi Vadra targeted the BJP, accusing it of hiding the reality.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/sp-congress-engaging-in-politics-of-lies-up-minister-101619460138195.html
26-04-2021||Lucknow||IIM-L professors brainstorm on ‘oxygen audit’ project||A team of professors at the Indian Institute of Management, Lucknow (IIM-L) is currently working on the procedure to be adopted for oxygen audit under which they will track and monitor usage of oxygen in hospitals to ensure optimal utilization. The team is led by professor Suresh Jakhar with professor Arunabha Mukhopadhyay, Prof Ajay Garg and Prof Kshitij Awasthi as other team members. The IIM-L professors are busy developing a procedural and monitoring framework for oxygen supply and optimal utilization by hospitals. “Initially we will develop parametres for collecting information from each hospital on daily basis and centralised oxygen unit will monitor it,” said one of the team members. The team members held quite a few virtual interactions with each other to finalise on how to go about it. The teachers at IIM-L held meetings with larger group of experts drawn from other institutes. IIM-L is working with UP government, IIT-Kanpur and IIT BHU for oxygen audit in the hospitals of UP. Prof Archana Shukla, director, IIM-L is part of high-powered group comprising of additional chief secretary home, Awanish Awasthi, director IIT-K, Abhay Karandikar and director IIT BHU Prof PN Jain and medical experts among others. Chief minister Yogi Adityanath announced the oxygen audit a day after launching a digital platform for monitoring oxygen supply system. He asked officials to strike a balance between demand and supply of oxygen. He also asked them to “distribute oxygen in a transparent manner.” Additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi said efforts were on to ensure rational utilisation of oxygen in hospitals. The health department and the medical education department have issued guidelines for the use of oxygen in Covid-19 pandemic. The state government had also received guidelines for the judicious use of oxygen as a therapy to treat Covid-19 patients, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/iiml-professors-brainstorm-on-oxygen-audit-project-101619460018234.html

Traffic leading to the chowk from ESI Hospital road was also diverted for around an hour due to the protest. Amid sloganeering, Grewal and Sharanjit Singh Dhillon said there was severe shortage of gunny bags at the grain markets, forcing farmers to store the wheat in trolleys or at their houses. “The Congress leadership is making tall claims regarding the procurement process, while due to shortage of gunny bags, even the procured wheat has been lying in the open and payment is being delayed to farmers,” they said.Holding Ashu responsible for the delay, Ranjit Dhillon and Gosha demanded Ashu’s removal from the post of cabinet minister. On flouting of Covid safety norms, Ranjit claimed social distancing was ensured and everyone was wearing masks. “The protest was necessary to wake up the government from its deep slumber. While the Congress government has failed to serve the public, the Aam Aadmi Party has also failed to perform its duty as the opposition. In fact, it has been working as the B-team of Congress,” he alleged. Refuting their claims, Ashu’s wife and councillor Mamta Ashu said all arrangements were in place for wheat procurement. “Over 85 lakh metric tonnes of wheat has been procured in the state and payment is being transferred directly to the farmers’ bank accounts. While the farmers are satisfied with the process, SAD is staging protests just to gain political mileage.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/giving-social-distancing-the-go-by-sad-protests-slow-wheat-procurement-in-ludhiana-101619459778959.html

Visitors are seen ignoring social distancing norms and without masks. This, even though 1,389 fresh infections were reported from the district on Sunday, the highest single-day spike so far.Apart from individual buyers, the market is thronged by around 450 arhtiyas, their staff, farmers, thousands of street vendors, retailers and other visitors. Farmers/transporters from other districts and nearby states also visit to sell their produce.The market is open on six days (Monday to Saturday) in a week. Last year, the administration had restricted the operations of the market to three days a week and working hours were fixed from 9am to 11am, after videos and pictures of huge gatherings at the market went viral on social media. Further, the concept of establishing ward-wise “mandis” was introduced in the city, wherein only registered vendors were allowed to purchase vegetables and fruits from the main market. They used to supply it to street vendors assigned to specific wards, who further sold it to residents.The system remained in force till mid-June. The administration also faced trouble restricting the entry of vendors in the main market and controlling the rush of residents at earmarked ward-wise mandi sites.Gurminder Singh, a resident of Nehru Nagar, said, “Strict and immediate action should be taken to restrict gatherings at the main market. Supply of vegetables and fruits is necessary, but the lives of residents should not be put at risk and an alternative needs to be found. The street vendors roam the entire city and can spread the virus rapidly.”Meanwhile, the arhtiyas said that the administration should focus on enforcing Covid norms, rather than bringing business to a halt.Amarvir Singh, an arhtiya, said, “Shutting down the market is not a solution, as arhtiyas, farmers and vendors will suffer huge losses and daily turnover of over ₹3 crore will be affected. The administration should rather impose strict restrictions and those flouting norms should be fined ₹5,000. Further, we also urge the administration to allow shops selling veggies and fruits to open on Sundays, as they are essential items and perishable goods.”Officials of the market committee stated that steps are being taken to make sure residents and arhtiyas follow the Covid norms, but no restrictions have been imposed till now on working or entry in the main market.Tek Bahadur, secretary of the market committee, said, “We have issued notices to arhtiyas to ensure wearing of masks and social distancing. No directions have yet been received from the administration to impose any restrictions on entry or working of the main market. Stalls have been installed to spread awareness and staff has been deputed to keep check.”In April last year, district mandi officer (DMO) Jasbir Kaur had tested positive for the virus and deceased assistant commissioner of police Anil Kumar Kohli was also suspected to have contracted the infection while he was deputed at the vegetable market.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhianas-main-vegetable-market-a-ticking-bomb-amid-surge-in-covid-cases-101619459599269.html

The number makes for 27% of the total 29,000 students enrolled at the district’s 993 government primary schools this year.According to teachers, a considerable number of these children had never been to school and were found playing in parks or in slums. Through the door-to-door campaign, teachers have been educating parents regarding the facilities and achievements of government schools, and providing them contact numbers of teachers. Children of parents convinced on the spot are registered through the ePunjab Schools portal.Apart from this, parents can register their wards through the online admission forms of the respective schools. Government Primary School, Chanan Devi, has enrolled 300 children through personal visits, including 95 who moved over from private schools and 60, who never went to school. Head teacher Jaswinder Kaur said, “We visited slum areas near Jagraon Bridge, parks near Chand Cinema and enrolled children aged between two and six. A large number of out-of-school children were found playing in the parks. We encouraged them to join school through stationery and candies.” Similarly, Government Primary School, Jawaddi, added 50 students through the door-to-door drive. “We also utilised the public address system of gurdwaras to inform parents about the ongoing admission process. The door-to-door campaign is effective in motivating parents to get their children to attend online classes.” “To enhance enrolments in the current session, we have been holding meetings with school heads, block primary education officers and tracking the new registrations. A large number of children have also shifted from private schools,” said Kuldeep Singh, deputy district education officer, elementary, Ludhiana.In all, 1.17 lakh students are currently enrolled in the district’s government primary schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/govt-teachers-door-to-door-campaign-inspires-8-000-ludhiana-kids-to-join-school-101619459119566.html

These will also run out by mid-Tuesday.Due to the low stocks, the vaccines were administered to just 8,822 residents on Monday, while the number was 13,276 on Sunday despite the lockdown and 17,003 on Saturday. The health department had already stopped supply to around 75 private hospitals in mid-April.

There is an emergency of breaths because of lack of oxygen, beds and medicines. The way people are dying, it’s genocide like situation,” said the former UP chief minister.In a statement, Akshilesh said short-sightedness and mismanagement of the BJP government, despite warnings from experts, has turned UP into ‘Corona Pradesh (Corona state). “The BJP must quit its arrogance of power and should start thinking like family members of Covid patients. It must immediately start making arrangement of oxygen cylinders at Covid patients in home quarantine. Patient is a patient, be at hospital or home,” he said.Akhilesh also demanded that prices of vaccines should be uniform and people be inoculated free-of-cost.“The government has failed to the extent that even BJP MPs and MLAs are not satisfied with the current state of affairs and warning of sitting on dharna. The phone numbers of hospitals and doctors that the BJP government is publicising are all wrong. Such an insensitive government was never seen in the state,” he said.The former chief minister further said that the government also failed on checking black-marketing of drugs and oxygen in the state. He said “Medical experts and scientists had been indicating that the second wave of Covid pandemic would be far more severe, but the BJP government was busy trying to win praise.

26-04-2021||Pune||State asks districts to restart plants, modify nitrogen plants to generate O2||Pune: To augment the needs of the rising demand for oxygen to treat Covid-19 positives, the state government has asked district collectors to identify the Oxygen Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) plants which are shut and could be restarted. The state has also asked the districts to identify Nitrogen PSAs which could be modified and used for generating oxygen. Earlier, deputy CM Ajit Pawar has said that the state is identifying the defunct O2 plants which could be restarted. Following the central government’s orders, the state has requested district collectors to check PSA plants for oxygen which could be reactivated with slight modification. The state has also asked to find if any of the PSA plant for nitrogen could be modified to generate oxygen in less than a week. Packaging and food processing industry needs nitrogen and there are many PSA plants for nitrogen generation in the districts. The state in its letter by principal secretary Dr Pradeep Vyas, health department stated, “We are struggling to augment the supplies of oxygen, while we are trying to increase the availability of oxygen by moving quantities from outside the state. We should also explore setting up new PSA oxygen generation plants and re-purposing PSA plants for nitrogen.” The letter mentions the state is also setting up new O2 PSA plants in various locations through SDRF funds. It says, “It seems that there are several PSA plants for oxygen installed in various parts of our state over the years and are lying unutilised. Recently, one such plant at Satara is now being activated which would generate sufficient oxygen to fill 2400 Jumbo cylinders every day.” Pawar said, “We are trying to restart oxygen plants which were shut as power supply was cut or because the companies had gone bankrupt. Minister Nitin Gadkari has said he would ensure smooth supply in the Vidarbha region.” “Some of the PSA plants for nitrogen probably can be re-purposed to generate oxygen with slight modification in very short time. It seems that while a new oxygen generation plant will take 3 to 4 weeks to install, retro fitting existing PSA plants for nitrogen probably can be achieved in less than a week,” stated the letter. Pune is planning to set up 30 new oxygen generation plants in the district and has also received 75 oxygen concentrator plants through CSR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/state-asks-districts-to-restart-plants-modify-nitrogen-plants-to-generate-o2-101619455097747.html

In this hour of crisis, it will be good if we all could work together, ensuring timely service,” Soren said. In the letter, Soren said Jharkhand was an oxygen surplus state. “Unfortunately, we are struggling with flow constraints in the supply-chain due to paucity of oxygen cylinders despite having refillers available in Jharkhand. I have been informed that many of our orders of LMO (liquid medical oxygen) tanks, vapourizers and cylinders are pending with manufacturers in Guajarat,” he said in the letter. Through the letter, Soren sought the Gujarat CM’s assistance in getting the orders delivered. “This will allow us to make oxygen available to hospitals and subsequently the people who desperately need it,” he further said in the letter. Earlier on Sunday, the CM inspected two oxygen refilling plants in Ranchi to take stock of the situation capacity of the plants to produce oxygen. The plant operators raised the issue of pending orders with Gujarat manufacturers and Soren assured them to deal with the issue, officials said. Many oxygen plant operators told the CM that they will double oxygen refilling and supply if they get delivery of orders from Gujarat. Last week, the CM claimed there was no shortage of oxygen production in the state, as it produces more than 550 tonnes of oxygen daily against the requirement of 100 tonnes. However, shortage of oxygen cylinders posed a challenge. The state has a mere 8,739 medical oxygen cylinders. However, the state was trying to increase the number of medical oxygen cylinders from various sources. Officials said they were also trying if they could use industrial oxygen cylinders for medical purposes. Jharkhand has around 17,000 industrial cylinders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/soren-writes-to-guj-cm-to-ensure-delivery-of-oxygen-equipment-101619452518737.html

He said that use of steroids and anticoagulants also needed to be used judiciously, especially in the early part of infection, as indiscriminate use could have adverse effect. “The key is to know when to use which drug and in what measure. There is no role of fancy drugs in the majority of patients,” he said. There has been a scamble for Remesivir and a few other drugs, which has led to shortages, panic-buying and black-marketing in the state. The Bihar government also sent a special plane for procurement of Remedesivir from Ahmedabad. Nischal, who was part of the central team that visited Patna last year, also spoke on important aspects of clinical management and infection control during the virtual session to underline the fact that doctors and healthcare workers needed to be safe to face the challenge. “The spurt in Covid cases is a clear warning that people must mend their ways to stay safe. All we need to do is to mind our social behaviour, as further complacency can be fatal,” he said. The virtual training has been organized at the request of the Bihar health department.

26-04-2021||Pune||19 engineers to oversee maintenance of furnaces in Pune city||Pune: The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has appointed 19 engineers at various crematoriums in the city to oversee repair and maintenance of electric/gas furnaces, in order to keep them functioning uninterrupted for cremation of Covid fatalities. The civic body has also ordered them to maintain a record of the daily number of Covid fatalities brought to the crematoriums, the number of ambulances with bodies waiting for cremation and the time when furnaces are not occupied. The order has been issued to facilitate the cremation of Covid bodies and reduce the waiting period. “These engineers have been appointed at 19 out of 21 crematoriums in the city. Because of the second wave of Covid, the burden on crematoriums has increased. There should be a contact person for the administration to oversee the operations at crematoriums. We should know what are the problems occurring, how many bodies have been cremated, and which crematoriums are overburdened,” said Kunal Khemnar, additional municipal commissioner. The appointed engineers have also been instructed to make sure furnaces are functional. In order to keep furnaces functional without interruptions, a gap of 30-50 minutes between two cremations has been advised. Periodically, after 15 days, furnaces are closed and chimneys cleaned. Heating coils in electric furnaces and gas burners in gas furnaces will be checked. As HT has reported earlier, the number of Covid-19 fatalities cremated in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad for the past two weeks, has far outnumbered the official death toll being reported by the state health department. Officials from PMC involved in monitoring the crematoria claimed that 170 bodies have been cremated each day in the past one week. Of these 170 bodies, 120, on average, are Covid victims. PMC has taken various steps to reduce the waiting period for cremation of Covid victims. It has allowed cremations of Covid bodies at all crematoriums in the city. Also, the system of online cremations has been started. Many volunteers have been helping the civic officials at the crematoria to reduce the load. “The recent measures have reduced the load and decreased the waiting period,” Khemnar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/19-engineers-to-oversee-maintenance-of-furnaces-in-pune-city-101619448197065.html

NMRC caters to the National Capital Region’s Noida and Greater Noida areas.“To discourage passengers movement on curfew days, Noida Metro Rail Corporation (NMRC) has decided not to run any service on the curfew days i.e. Saturday & Sunday. Therefore, NMRC metro services will not be available on these days,” ANI quoted NMRC managing director Ritu Maheshwari as saying.NMRC is in charge of managing the ‘Aqua Line’ which connects the twin cities of Noida and Greater Noida, encompassing 21 stations, over a distance of 29.7 kilometres. NMRC had suspended services for 5 months during the nationwide lockdown imposed in March of last year and resumed normal operations in September. Commuters on the Aqua Line also had to abide by Covid-19 preventive measures once services were resumed.The Yogi Adityanath-led government announced a weekend lockdown in all districts of the state from April 26 till May 15. The lockdown hours have been fixed from 8pm on Saturdays till 7am on Mondays. Adityanath also ordered a penalty of up to ₹10,000 against those found outdoors without a mask. This lockdown was imposed in addition to a night curfew that was already in place in districts with more than 500 active cases of Covid-19.

26-04-2021||Pune||PCMC to reimburse caretakers for Covid victim cremation||Pune: The Pimpri Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) will provide for free wood and cow dung cakes for cremation of residents who died of Covid. The spike in virus-related deaths has left caretaker at crematoriums unable to manage funeral requirements. The PCMC administration has decided to reimburse the cost incurred in performing final rites at crematoriums. The order states that funeral expenses like wood and cow dung cakes will be reimbursed every month. PCMC had given permission on April 15 to cremate Covid victims as per the traditional rites. The cost of cremation is ₹6,000 which includes wood and cow dung cakes, to be borne by the bereaved families. “The decision was taken unanimously with the five firms that manage the crematoriums without any discussion. The civic administration has told us to manage everything. Around 10-12 bodies are cremated every day and each funeral costs ₹6,000. Hence, PCMC should release some advance amount instead of reimbursement,” said one of the caretakers on request of anonymity. Nigdi and Bhosari crematoriums are managed by Shubham Udyog, while Chinchwad and Nehrunagar is run by Jai Bhavani Enterprises and Sangvi crematorium comes under Mahalaxmi Swayam Rojgar Seva Sanstha. With rise in Covid deaths, PCMC on Sunday decided to add four new crematoriums for Covid victims at Morwadi, Kalewadi, Pimple Gurav and Pimprinagar respectively. “PCMC could have looked at the option of arranging one truckload of wood for each crematorium every day to lessen our burden,” said a caretaker.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcmc-to-reimburse-caretakers-for-covid-victim-cremation-101619443456573.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Police step in to perform funerals of those living alone or those with relatives living far away||When an army lieutenant colonel, posted in Leh, called up the Delhi Police seeking help with the cremation of his father-in-law, who had lived in Dwarka and had succumbed to Covid-19 on Saturday, a team of policemen came forward to perform the last rites of the elderly man. A police team, in PPE kits, collected the body and took it to the cremation ground where it was cremated as per the Hindu rituals.With entire families contracting Covid-19, they are unable to make the funeral arrangements for the deceased in their families; leaving the police with no option but to shoulder the responsibility of arranging these funerals. Police have also made the funeral arrangements of those who had lived alone or when families back out of the responsibility for fear of the virus. In two similar cases reported on Saturday, police cremated a woman on her brother’s request in Dwarka while in Karol Bagh, they made arrangements for the cremation of an elderly couple who had died of Covid-19.Talking about the army officer’s relative, deputy commissioner of police (Dwarka) Santosh Kumar Meena said they had received a call on Saturday, around 3pm, from lieutenant colonel Soumen Mondal that his father-in-law, who lived in Dwarka, had died of Covid-19.“Mondal said since his father-in-law had Covid, no one was willing to help them with the cremation. Mondal expressed his inability to come to Delhi at such short notice. On his request, the personnel from the Dwarka North police station made arrangements for the cremation of Mondal’s father-in-law Biswanath Pramanik. We arranged everything and the last rites were performed as per the rituals,” Meena said.The DCP said the same evening, a team of policemen from Dwarka South police station cremated a woman on her brother’s request. “We received another call later that day reporting that a woman, Jai Matnani, who had tested positive for Covid had succumbed to the virus during treatment. The caller was her brother. He said there was nobody to take the responsibility of her cremation. Therefore on humanitarian grounds, we took over that responsibility and her body was immediately shifted to a cremation ground in Dwarka’s Sector 24 and she was cremated as per the Hindu rituals,” the DCP said. In another such case reported from Karol Bagh, a Delhi police team cremated a man and his wife who had died of Covid within just three days of each other. According to the police, on April 21, information was received that an 84-year-old resident of Karol Bagh, Bal Krishan Sharma, who had tested positive for Covid, had died. “It was reported that the man lived with his wife Kanak Sharma, 76, who too was positive for the virus. The couple’s only daughter lives in the USA and his granddaughter who had come to Delhi is hesitant in performing their last rites. Finding no other alternative, a police team from Desh Bandhu Gupta Road police station arranged for Sharma’s last rites at the Panchkuiyan Road cremation ground,” deputy commissioner of police (central) Jasmeet Singh said.He said police also arranged milk, groceries etc. for his wife Kanak Sharma. “However, on Saturday, Kanak has also succumbed to the pandemic. Her neighbours informed police and once again we took over the responsibility of her funeral and arranged an ambulance. Her last rites were also performed at the same crematorium,” Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-step-in-to-perform-funerals-of-those-living-alone-or-those-with-relatives-living-far-away-101619441956422.html

So, housing societies with clubhouses should turn it as isolation centres for virus-affected residents,” said Rajesh Patil, PCMC commissioner. PCMC medical officers will visit these clubhouses twice a day, according to civic officials. According to PCMC, high-risk persons with comorbidities, below 10-year age group, senior citizens and pregnant women should not be allowed in clubhouse isolation centres. “The isolation centre clubhouses are more successful in societies having 1BHK flats as those with more rooms will prefer to be confined in their home. Many societies had converted clubhouse into isolation centres last year. Residents feel that PCMC should make more arrangements for Covid positive patients,” said Tejaswini Sawai, chairperson, Pimpri-Chinchwad Cooperative Housing Societies Federation (PCCHSF).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pcmc-issues-order-to-convert-society-clubhouse-into-covid-isolation-centres-101619441656495.html

They should think like family members of Covid patients and ensure availability of oxygen at their homes," Akhilesh said, accusing the party of not paying any heed to experts’ warning about the second wave of the infection.The SP chief also demanded uniformity in rates of Covid vaccine in the entire country and appealed to his party workers to help people battle coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-govt-fudged-coronavirus-fatality-number-alleges-akhilesh-yadav-101619440682098.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||In home isolation? Restaurants provide quarantine meals at doorstep||Restaurateurs, chefs and food aggregators are doing what they do best — cooking and feeding the hungry. And in the second wave of the pandemic, they’re continuing to do so by providing healthy home-style meals to those recovering from Covid-19.While some eateries have suspended services and takeaways but are delivering free Covid-19 meals, others have launched special daily tiffins and 14-day quarantine meal plans at nominal charges.“The only way I know to help the community and contribute to these tough times right now is by cooking. And it’s one thing I’m good at it,” says chef-owner Radhika Khandelwal at Fig & Maple, who made a conscious decision to suspend all delivery and takeaway services and provide free meals to all households battling Covid-19 in Greater Kailash 2. She says, “We are offering a set menu of nutritious, safely packed meals. The service is free, however, one can opt to pay as they like or contribute to our free meal programme,” who is fully booked for the week, catering to meals for 57 families along with her partner Ravish Bhavnani. She’s also willing to do grocery runs and lend books.As a gesture to give back to the society, another restaurateur Neha Gupta, founder, Beyond Designs Bistro is also helping those in distress. “The idea is that government has allowed us to have delivery and takeaways, and as our bistro kitchen is open and chefs are working, and we got several messages on our social media from families who had been affected, so we are just using the opportunity to lend a hand in these times, ” says Gupta who has prepared healthy, safe and home-style daily tiffins at nominal charges for 70-80 families so far. Whereas some have a fixed menu for the week to choose from, chef Sareen Madhiyan, executive chef, Punjab Grill is preparing and customising meals as per the need and taste of customers. He says, “We’ll be speaking to the customers and prepare a healthy menu accordingly. The idea behind is to provide meal for people who are suffering from Covid-19 and are staying alone by themselves.” The lunch and dinner options are offered at an affordable price and delivery is available all over Delhi-NCR.Moreover, there are a few who are catering to only those in NCR. Richa Kharbanda, owner, Quirky Perky, says, “We saw so many posts on social media from Delhi, Mumbai and Bangalore where restaurateurs and chefs came forward to help those affected by Covid-19, so we decided to take the initiative in our area [Ghaziabad] at marginal costs. Kharbanda who sends out 38-40 thalis in a day is also taking requests from those abroad and want fresh produce delivered to kin here. Apart from restaurants and cafe, recently, food aggregator Zomato announced quick delivery for Covid-hit. Deepinder Goyal, founder tweeted, “Today, along with thousands of our restaurant partners, we just rolled out a “priority delivery for covid emergencies’’ feature on the Zomato app...Thousands of restaurants have pledged to prioritise these orders in their kitchen above all others.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/in-home-isolation-restaurants-provide-quarantine-meals-at-doorstep-101619440099958.html
26-04-2021||Jaipur||Rajasthan: Congressman joins call for CBI probe in Prajapati encounter case||Two senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and at least one Congress leader in Rajasthan have demanded a CBI probe into Kamlesh Prajapati encounter case after a couple of videos that went viral on social media cast serious doubts over the police version of the events leading to the notorious criminal’s elimination in Barmer last Thursday.Barmer police claimed to have killed Prajapati, a notorious smuggler booked in seven cases in the district and also for a hit and run case in Pali, in retaliatory fire during a raid on Thursday night when he tried to escape after attempting to kill one police man.However, two videos of the alleged encounter of 6.25 and 10.08 seconds in lengths respectively, circulating on social media on Sunday, show the cops broke the windshield of the gangster’s car in the outskirts of Barmer city under Sadar police station area, pulled him out and bundled him into another vehicle. Prajapati is not seen firing in the video but one policeman is seen firing three rounds at him. The video clips were allegedly sourced from the CCTV footage which captured the encounter. However, no authority has confirmed its authenticity at this stage.After the videos emerged, both the Congress and the BJP leaders accused the Barmer police of killing Prajapati in cold-blood and demanded a fair inquiry into the alleged encounter.Union minister and BJP parliamentarian from Jodhpur, Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said it was “police killing” done in the name of an encounter.“...It is seen in the video that Kamlesh was first cornered and beaten and then shot. There were no signs of any fight at the scene. This is a very sensitive and suspicious episode... ”.Shekhawat alleged that the state’s Ashok Gehlot government and the police could not be trusted therefore a CBI inquiry should be ordered.“Police are acting at the behest of the chief minister, therefore the investigation of any state-level investigative agency cannot be trusted,” he tweeted.Leader of opposition (LoP) in Rajasthan assembly Rajendra Rathore said Barmer police had planned Kamlesh Prajapati’s killing.“Gehlot saheb has always been ready to conduct a CBI inquiry. I am requesting the chief minister to show sensitivity... ...case should be investigated by the CBI,” he said, while pointing out that Prajapati’s community was very angry with the police over the incident.Former Barmer MP and Congress leader Manvendra Singh said it a “fair investigation” followed by “punishment to the guilty” alone will restore faith in the conduct of state police.“It is clear from the CCTV footage that whatever the police leadership told me is far from the truth,” he said. He also referred to two instances of doubtful police encounters of criminals Chatur Singh and Anandpal Singh, in 2016 and 2017 respectively.“I am requesting the chief minister to conduct a fair investigation of this case according to the public sentiments,” Singh added.Congress MLA from Barmer’s Pachpadra constituency too had termed the encounter as fake and demanded a CBI probe two days ago on April 24.However, an official from the state home department, who didn't wish to be named, said that the demand for a CBI probe was not being considering as of now.Barmer superintendent of police (SP) Anand Sharma told HT that the National Human Rights Commission’s directives for dealing with police encounter cases was being followed and a judicial inquiry in the case had already begun.The NHRC directives say that a death in police encounters would not be considered an offence if it is caused in the exercise of either the right to private defence or of power of arrest, under Section 46 of the CrPC. The four point guidelines by the commission mandate that all encounter cases are entered in police register, investigated by an independent agency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-congressman-joins-call-for-cbi-probe-in-prajapati-encounter-case-101619439918394.html
26-04-2021||Other||Vaccinating entire country seems tough but is certainly achievable||Given the alarming rate at which the coronavirus is spreading and mutating, there is an urgent need to considerably scale up the vaccination programme in the country. From May 1, the government has opened up vaccination to all those above the age of 18 years. That is a welcome step. However, if the vaccination is to serve the purpose of halting the spread of the disease and also bringing down the intensity of the infection, we have to treble the rate at which we are giving the jabs now or else the entire exercise would be futile. Let’s look at the staggering numbers that we need to inoculate- roughly about 840 million adults. Since each person needs two doses, the number of doses doubles to 1680 million and if we take into consideration the 140 million doses already administered, we need to push roughly about 1540 million jabs.As per government statistics, in 95 days the government gave over 130 million doses. So it works out to about 1.36 million doses per day. At this rate, we would be completing our vaccination only by May 2024. Worse, by then, the total number of jabs required to be given would have multiplied , as those who took the shots in the first and the second year would be eligible for re-vaccination or booster doses. In other words, the entire vaccination programme would become unmanageable.On the other hand, if we treble the rate at which we are vaccinating the people and administer 4 million vaccines per day, we can vaccinate the entire 18 plus age group by the end of May 2022, including those who become eligible that year. And that should be our target. It is not an easy target, given the fact that we need to have a continuous supply of four million doses of vaccine every day. But keeping in mind the dreadful consequence of delayed vaccination- uncontrollable infections caused by a variety of mutated viruses, we need to do everything possible to get that supply --- step up existing productions, get more companies to produce the vaccines, import as much as possible --–well, we cannot borrow or steal, but we can certainly beg for vaccines when we need it to save lives, there is no shame in it.Pricing of the vaccine is equally important. The centre as well as the states have to ensure adequate availability of the vaccines for free at government facilities and at very reasonable rates at private facilities, to make sure that the price of the vaccine does not become a deterrent in the mass vaccination programme. We may need the vaccines desperately, but given our numbers, we are also the biggest consumers of the vaccine and we need to use that power to bargain hard for lower prices. The government also needs to ensure that the private sector, I refer here to the hospitals as well as the pharmaceutical companies, does not exhibit the usual avariciousness in this hour of crisis.Today, every country in the world is racing against time to vaccinate its population and those countries that are producing adequate vaccines have a clear advantage. In the United States, for example, roughly about 41 per cent of the population has got at least one dose of vaccination and 27 per cent, two doses. Of course their population is only around 328 million. We are fortunate that we not only produce the most widely used of the eleven different vaccines against Covid-19 in the world today, Oxford Astrazenica or Covishield by Serum Institute of India, but also have our own indigenously produced vaccine, Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin. And we will soon have Russia’s Sputnik V too in our stable.However, being the second most populous country , our demands are huge. SII has said it plans to jack up its production from the present 60-65 million doses to 100 million per month from July and BB said it had scaled up its capacity to produce 700 million doses annually. However, both have export commitments and SII is also having problems with vaccination component imports from the US . But we are likely to have vaccines from more manufacturers –and if we put enough efforts into increasing indigenous production and also imports, we can easily achieve what may seem impossible at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vaccinating-entire-country-seems-tough-but-is-certainly-achievable-101619434270160.html

The oxygen audit was completed by additional deputy commissioner (development) Vishesh Sarangal on Monday. Deputy commissioner Ghanshyam Thori had ordered the audit and it has yielded promising results. Also read: India, Japan PMs discuss cooperation to overcome Covid-19 challenges“By reducing pilferage and plugging leakages, optimum utilisation of oxygen has been made possible. We checked all supply lines and promptly plugged leakages. CCTV cameras were installed for surveillance and logbooks monitored to account for every cylinder used at the hospital,” Sarangal said. The captive oxygen plant at the hospital was also found to be under-utilised, hence patients having high oxygen demands were shifted to plant-produced oxygen. He mentioned that these steps proved to be helpful in reducing the oxygen demand at the hospital from the earlier 410 to 214 cylinders a day. He said it was observed that some oxygen cylinders were not completely filled so officials have been deputed to check on this aspect. Patients in need of oxygen were shifted to rooms nearer the plant, which has a capacity of 130 cylinders, to reduce pilferage and wastage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/oxygen-audit-helps-jalandhar-civil-hospital-cut-consumption-by-half-101619434150871.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||State govt responsible for tankers: Gambhir slams Kejriwal over oxygen crisis||Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) lawmaker Gautam Gambhir on Monday sharpened his attack on Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal over the ongoing shortage of oxygen supply in the national capital. Gautam Gambhir said that the state government is responsible for the oxygen tankers while the Centre’s job is to make the gas available. The Delhi government earlier claimed the major reason for the oxygen crisis was the obstruction of tankers from the neighbouring states of Haryana and Uttar Pradesh.Gambhir also alleged on Sunday that eight oxygen plants were supposed to be set up in Delhi but only one has been installed by the Aam Aadmi Party-led (AAP) government till now. “Whose responsibility is this? Is this the responsibility of the BJP? Despite getting funds from the PM Cares Fund for setting up oxygen plants, you (the Delhi government) should have installed eight of them. But you have managed to install only one. And now you’re saying there is a shortage of oxygen,” Gambhir was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Also Read| Oxygen Express with 4 tankers heads to DelhiThe BJP leader and former cricketer announced on Sunday that his foundation—the Gautam Gambhir Foundation—will distribute oxygen cylinders and the antiviral drug Fabiflu to the Covid-19 disease patients across Delhi. They were only being distributed in his East Delhi constituency before that. According to PTI, those in need of cylinders and the anti-viral drug from Gambhir’s foundation will have to submit a doctor’s prescription and their Aadhaar number.As several hospitals in Delhi have been facing issues in getting oxygen supplies on time for the past one week due to which patients have died, Kejriwal said on Sunday that out of the total requirement of 700 tonnes, the Centre has only given 490 tonnes to the Capital. He also said he has also written to chief ministers of other states to help Delhi. After Kejriwal’s appeal, the railways ministry said on Sunday an Oxygen Express from Chhattisgarh carrying four cryogenics tankers carrying Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) will soon reach Delhi Cantonment railway station on Monday night.Also Read| Covid Crisis: 7 steps India took to ramp up oxygen supply amid shortageDelhi on Sunday saw a slight fall in its daily Covid-19 tally after 22,933 cases were reported in the last 24 hours and 350 more people died.

26-04-2021||Other||Monday musings: Pune’s Covid case count begins to flatten... will fatalities follow||With cautious optimism, we can say Pune’s Covid positive cases are on the downward march. The graph plateaued more than a week ago and the trend consolidated further this week. The daily positivity rate in Pune district has been under 25%, with numbers being reported close to the 10,000-mark, every day, for the past two weeks. The daily positivity rate throughout the past week has been: 24.21% on April 24; 24.53% on April 23; 22.78% on April 22; 25.28% on April 21; 27.94% on April 20; 25.28% on April 19 and 28.82% on April 18. Since the Covid-wave hit Pune and Mumbai a month before rest of the country, its subsidence is being noticed early in these cities as compared to other parts of India, where the peak may come later. Fatalities, too, appear fewer as compared to the first wave, thanks to early intervention, ramped up health infrastructure and a better evolved treatment protocol. However there’s big mismatch between number of bodies coming in for cremation and numbers reported by both, the state health office and the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC). As reported by Hindustan Times in its Monday (April 26) edition, an official coordinating cremation at all 21 crematoria in the city claimed over 170 bodies are coming in for final rites each day since the past one week. However, there’s hope – and cautious optimism. With the graph for fresh cases flattening, fatalities may see a similar trend within a week; the previous wave in Pune has shown fatalities peaked around 10 days after Covid cases. During the first wave, it took 202 days – starting from March 9, 2020, to September 16, 2020, - for cases to peak. The graph of fatalities begun its downward move by September-end, as some positive patients later became critical, and a few of them couldn’t survive. During the second wave, the graph for Covid positive cases began moving upward from early February, crossing the previous peak of 5,048 on September 16 last year, with 5,098 cases on March 21. It hit its peak on April 4, when the day’s positivity rate was 41.2%. Positivity rate reflects the spread of the infection and the number of positives reported for every 100 tests. So what worked to bring down these numbers? The answer can be both – curbs and vaccination. The inoculation drive on weekend was almost crawling due to a shortage of vaccine doses. However, overall, Pune has so far inoculated close to 2 million people, of which 1.724 million have received only the first dose, while 2.69 million have been administered both the doses. This means almost one-fifth of Pune district’s overall population has received a partial shield from Covid, at least from its severity. With the centre’s permission for inoculation of everyone above the age of 18 and aggressive local stakeholders, Pune will continue to vaccinate its population faster than rest of the country. The administration estimates by June 15, entire Pune will be vaccinated if supply of doses is constant and uninterrupted. If vaccination has offered a partial shield, then curbs or lockdown - as the government preferred to call it last week – turned out to be an efficient way of containing the spread of Covid. The restrictions mandated people to stay inside their homes. Roads became deserted and markets empty. This prevented even small congregations, something that the virus loves, as it feasts on gatherings. Earlier in March, the government had imposed a strict lockdown in places like Amravati and Yavatmal, where the tally had substantially risen. Through restrictions, the administration managed to contain the march of Covid after a strict lockdown for two weeks. This brought the positivity rate of Amravati and Yavatmal to 12% and 9%, respectively, on March 17, from 50% and 41%, respectively, a month before that. The harsh restrictions, currently in force till May 1, may be extended further. They have been effective even it has been a heavy price to pay. Had there been no restrictions, the already overstretched health system would have come under further burden and fatalities would have grown far more. When the matter is between life and death, curbs over opening-up is certainly an option worth considering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/monday-musings-pune-s-covid-case-count-begins-to-flatten-will-fatalities-follow-101619433491191.html

26-04-2021||Delhi||The Robin Hood Army : The army of plasma enablers||Even in the darkest moments, there’s always a glimmer of light. This glimmer shines brightly in the hearts of good samaritans who, amid the second wave of the pandemic, have been helping Delhiites survive and battle the deadly coronavirus infection. One such person is 30 years old Yugank Kapila, Head of Strategy and Operation, The Robin Hood Army, who spends his day dedicated to helping infected patients get better by receiving plasma donations. He does this with the help of his team of driven volunteers, who he terms as his Robins. “Basically since a couple of weeks the situation has become extremely bad and the demand for plasma has surged. To tackle this, the Robin Hood Army has started initiatives in various cities instructing it’s volunteers to go to people that they would know have been Covid positive in the recent past and convince them to donate plasma. From friends, families, house help to guards, the volunteers scan their entire inner circle to identify potential plasma donors and then convince them to donate plasma,” says Kapila.Project Plasma is a Fever Network initiative to celebrate the super power of Covid recovered plasma donors, who are stepping forward amid the second wave of Covid, to donate their plasma to save lives of other infected patients.Kapila, a SAP Consultant in an IT company by profession, understood early on that in order to tackle the chaotic plasma requests on the net, there has to be a process to it. “We have been getting surplus and overwhelming number of plasma requests and we have recruited teams to streamline the process. There’s one team that’s verifying the requests, then the other team collates the request in a particular format and shares it across groups. We then screen eligible plasma donors and connect them to the recipients. We started this initiative thinking even if we could help one person, that would be great,” he says.Motivating potential plasma donors by dispelling their fears, Kapila informs, “A lot of donors are afraid of getting reinfected. But we try to explain to the donors that we will help you take all the precautions when you donate plasma. Don’t be afraid. Think that through this you will be able to save someone’s life. The fear of donating is nothing compared to the value of someone’s life. We try to motivate plasma donors. If the plasma donors have a problem with transportation, we help them with that too.”With plans to utilise the rising curve of infection to save future lives, Kapila says, “The donors on ground aren’t able to match the number of requests from infected patients because the number of infected cases are too many. However, we have been maintaining the database of infected patients who can become potential plasma donors too.”No fear is as big as the joy one gets from saving someone’s life. Kapila concludes, “Please come forward and donate and save people’s life. The joy that you get once you donate is unimaginable. The situation is really bad on ground, and if you are eligible to donate plasma, please do come forward and do it, because you have the power of making a difference and saving a life.”You are a superhero if you have recovered from Covid 19 because you have the power to save a life!

26-04-2021||Delhi||Free Covid vaccine for all adults in Delhi from May 1: Kejriwal||Delhi will provide free Covid-19 vaccines for all adults in the National Capital from May 1, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said on Monday. He also urged vaccine manufacturers in the country to reduce their prices, even as he, once again, pushed the Centre to consider a “one nation, one rate” policy for Covid-19 vaccines. The chief minister’s office stated that the free vaccines will be available in all government-run Covid-19 vaccination centres in Delhi while those who opt for private centres will have to pay for the jabs. Addressing a press conference, Kejriwal said his government had, on the same day, approved procurement of 1.34 crore [13.4 million] vaccine doses with various manufacturers to boost a massive vaccination drive. The announcement came ahead of the third phase of India’s Covid-19 vaccination drive from May 1. In this phase, the Central government has allowed vaccination for all citizens above the age of 18 years. Registrations for vaccination are going to open on the CoWin app from Wednesday. Also Watch | Oxygen Express with 4 tankers to reach Delhi amid shortage in hospitals“As we are seeing, Covid-19 has wreaked havoc in the country. There is only one solution to this pandemic and that is vaccination. Delhi government has decided to give free Covid-19 vaccines to those who are 18 and above,” Kejriwal said. While he did not specifically say that the third phase of the vaccination drive will be rolled out on a massive scale from May 1 itself, the chief minister, however, did say that the government is drafting its vaccination plan on how registered adults can be inoculated on a rapid scale and in large numbers. “Today morning, we have given approval to buy 1.34 crore [13.4 million] vaccines for Delhi. We are trying to procure these doses as soon as possible so people are vaccinated quickly. It has been found that those who have taken the jabs either do not get Covid-19 or have very mild symptoms upon contracting the infection. Mostly those who get Covid-19 even after vaccination do not require hospitalisation, and even if some of them do get admitted, their condition does not become serious. If everyone gets vaccinated, Corona will be like an ordinary disease,” Kejriwal said. He gave the example of how the United Kingdom controlled its surge in Covid-19 cases by conducting mass vaccination. The Delhi chief minister, once again, flagged his demand for uniform rates for the Central and state governments in vaccine procurement. “One of the vaccine manufacturers is offering a rate of ₹400 a dose to state governments, while the other is quoting ₹600. But both the companies are offering their vaccine at ₹150 to the Central government. My demand is that the rates should be the same for state and central governments,” he said. Also Read | Covid-19: 8 states account for almost 70% of India’s active caseload, says govtKejriwal said the manufacturers are earning a lot of profit by selling their vaccines at ₹400 and ₹600 to states. “This is the time to show humanity. This is not the time to earn profits. Across the country, the Centre and states have capped the prices of various medicines and treatments. I appeal to the vaccine manufacturers to reduce their prices to ₹150. You (manufacturers) have a lifetime to earn profits. This is not the time to earn profits from people when the pandemic has hit the country so hard. I also appeal to the Central government to cap the prices of vaccines in the coming days,” he said. He also urged the Central government to consider a vaccination plan for children. “We have seen that a lot of children and adolescents are also getting infected by Covid-19, and some of them have died. So, the time has come to think of them as well. If the available vaccines are safe for them, the Centre should allow it for them. If they are not safe, then other vaccines should also be developed,” Kejriwal said. The chief minister said beds are being increased further in Delhi to treat Covid-19 patients. “I inspected the Covid care centre at Radha Soami Satsang Beas campus in Chhattarpur which has been opened for patients today from 10am. It has started with 500 beds, which will be increased by another 500 in about two days, then 2,000 and finally, it will be ramped up to 5,000 beds. In addition, we are also arranging 200 ICU beds there. We are increasing Covid-19 beds across Delhi this way. I hope this will help people in this crisis,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/free-covid-vaccine-for-all-adults-in-delhi-from-may-1kejriwal-101619424010441.html

The traffic on the section under Chakradharpur division of South Eastern Railway (SER) in West Singhbhum district was suspended for hours following the blast, said railway officials.A senior railway official indicated that a goods train passing through the damaged section between Lotapahar and Sonua stations alerted the authorities and reported a “heavy jerk”, which led to at least 8 mail/express/passenger trains being stopped at different stations to prevent any untoward incident.“On receiving information, all movement in the Rourkela-Chakradharpur section was immediately stopped and 8 mail express/passengers trains and several goods trains were controlled at different stations as security measures,” Manish Kumar Pathak, senior divisional commercial manager (Sr DCM), Chakradharpur division of SER, said Monday morning.He said patrolling teams accompanied by security personnel were sent to the blast site first and it started investigating the ‘heavy jerk’ reported by the goods train loco driver after arriving at the site.“During the investigation of the site it was found that the Up main line track was sabotaged. The blasted pieces of the rail were found up to 35 metres from the site. Restoration work started immediately after getting security clearance. Down line was given a fit at 7.15 am, the 3rd line at 8.35 am. Movement over the lines has resumed,” Pathak said.

The order will be effective till May 31. In a late evening tweet on Saturday, chief minister Hemant Soren said, “In view of Covid-19 infection in the state, distribution of ration will take place at PDS shops through OTP (one time password) system instead of biometric authentication till May 31.” Further decision on the same will be taken after reviewing the Covid-19 situation, officials said.The department also issued a notification in this regard. Earlier, PDS dealers in the state demanded the government for temporary suspension of biometric system for ration withdrawal in wake of surge in cases.President of Fair Price Shop Dealers’ Association (FPSDA), Jharkhand, Onkar Nath Jha said, “As many as 10 PDS dealers lost their lives due to the infection this April and over two dozen dealers are infected and undergoing treatment at various hospitals.”He said the biometric system was being used in PDS for distribution of ration. Hundreds of consumers withdraw ration through their thumb impressions on a single biometric device, known as e-PoS machine, at PDS shops. “Hundreds of thumb impressions on a single machine raise threat of spread of infection,” Jha said.More than 57 lakh beneficiaries were enrolled under National Food Security Act in the state. One PDS dealer deals with around 200-400 consumers, Jha said.“We wrote to the Jharkhand chief minister on April 19 to withdraw the online system temporarily. Now, we will distribute ration through OTP authentication. When we will enter a person’s ration card number, the beneficiary will receive a fixed standard OTP,” Jha said.The association, however, demanded government compensation to ration dealers on line of Rajasthan government. “In Rajasthan, ration dealers have also been considered as front line workers. The Rajasthan government announced ₹50 lakh compensation if any dealer dies of Covid-19 infection. We demand similar initiative for PDS dealers in Jharkhand,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-suspends-mandatory-biometric-authentication-for-ration-withdrawal-till-may-31-101619421009633.html

26-04-2021||Other||Testing hub RMRI battles machine snag, infected staff||PATNAThe sudden upsurge in the Covid-19 cases has taken its toll not only on people, but also on the state’s biggest RT-PCR testing facility at the Rajendra Memorial Research Institute (RMRI), a unit of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). A large number of its scientists and staff have themselves tested positive, perhaps due to continuous testing of swabs, mainly from Patna. To make things more difficult, one of the machines, COBAS-6800, has also developed snag, bringing down the number of tests daily for the last three days. It has come down from 4,000-4,500 tests carried every day till 4-5 days ago to around 1,500-2,000. While RMRI was the sole testing lab last year in the state, it has now quite a few, including at AIIMS, PMCH, IGIMS etc. However, RMRI still accounts for around 30%-40% of tests in the state. “In the midst of pandemic, my entire team is working round-the-clock. The COBAS-6800, given by ICMR, is a fully automated high-end machine for performing real-time Real Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) and it could handle 1,100 samples in 24 hours. We have got the repairs done Sunday and it should be operational by evening. The capacity will again go up,” said RMRI director Dr Krishna Pandey, who is himself from clinical medicine discipline. Apart from COBAS, RMRI also has Magnapure automatic RNA extraction machine given by the Bihar government and manual RT-PCR, though it is also facing challenge on another front – growing positivity among its scientists and staff. According to a senior official, nearly 10 of the 18 scientists have tested positive, while several staff members and technicians have also gone into isolation after developing symptoms and undergoing tests. Pandey said infection was a reality in the prevailing situation. “But both ICMR and Bihar government are extending help by way to manpower. ICMR has accepted our proposal for increase in manpower till June, which would most likely be extended up to September. The Bihar government has also provided 17-18 employees for data entry and have also asked for further requirement,” he said. A senior official said that due to major increase in positivity rate, the number of samples has increased, while several staff members have also tested positive. “This may be the reason behind some delay in test reports, but things will be alright. On Saturday, there were around 2,860 pending samples. The government is consciously trying to augment resources.

Dr Pramod Tiwari, superintendent of GMCH, said the plant has a capacity of producing 280 litres of oxygen per minute. “Work is underway to connect 60 beds in the Covid ward with oxygen supply through pipelines, which is likely to be completed by tomorrow (Monday),” said Dr Tiwari, adding that laying of pipeline has already been done. The GMCH, earlier known as MJK hospital, has 120 beds in its dedicated Covid ward with 12 ventilator beds operational in its intensive care unit (ICU). The hospital has 63 ventilators. The GMCH, however, would continue to refill (medical) oxygen cylinders from Harshidih-based (East Champaran) plant. “We will continue to fetch cylinders from there as per our requirements,” said the hospital superintendent. According to official records, 64 Covid patients were admitted to GMCH till Sunday, of which five were on ventilators, while the remaining were on oxygen support. Since April 1, 34 Covid patients have died here.“There are 2,698 active cases of Covid in West Champaran, while 138 patients have recovered in past 10 days,” said Arun Kumar Sinha, civil surgeon, West Champaran. Meanwhile, anticipating a sharp surge in the Covid patients, the hospital authorities have decided to increase number of beds and other medical facilities required for the treatment of Covid patients. “As we are handling the critical cases of two districts of East and West Champaran, the possibilities of exponential rise in cases cannot be ruled out. Hence, we are prepared to make the arrangements for 90 more beds in the hospital,” said Dr Tiwari. In yet another development, the hospital authorities are contemplating 30-bed ward for suspect Covid cases. “Two patients in our hospital continue to be Covid suspect with symptoms of the virus but their medical reports are negative. We are making the arrangements of 30 beds for such suspect cases,” said the GMCH superintendent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-plant-goes-live-at-gmch-101619420889534.html

However, the state government has managed to raise the supply to around 6,900 cylinders per day.Patna district magistrate Chandra Shekhar Singh said they were working overtime to bridge the shortfall so that no patients dies due to shortage of oxygen. “Today, a defunct plant of oxygen, located at Marcha Marchi area of the state capital, was operationalised to supplement the supply. We have sorted all issues and activated the plants on an urgent basis. Now, we are looking to arrange trained manpower so that the plant could work in 24x7 mode,” he said, adding that three other plants have been activated to supply bottled oxygen.District authorities said PMCH, NMCH and IGIMS, which are main Covid treatment centres of the state government, together required supply of around 2,600 cylinders per day. “The existing plants of oxygen generation at PMCH and NMCH are not capable to deal with the current rush of patients,” said a senior officer.Meanwhile, the state reported 12,795 fresh cases of Covid-19 and 68 related deaths on Sunday. Of the total, 1,848 cases were detected in Patna and 1,340 in Gaya. Currently, the state has over 87,000 active cases. On Saturday, 12,359 Covid cases were reported in Bihar, of which 2,479 were found in Patna alone. The rush at crematoriums to cremate the bodies is such that the kin are being made to wait for up to 20 hours to light the funeral pyre of the deceased.“Around 100-150 bodies are being cremated per day on different ghats of Ganga. Most of bodies are being disposed of as per Covid protocol, even though a majority of them were not confirmed to have died due to Covid,” said an official at Gulbi Ghat.The state health department has issued an advisory to the common people, particularly those in home isolation, to take emergency anti-viral, antibiotic and vitamin supplements along with fever suppressants to take care of those suffering from moderate symptoms of the pandemic. They have been advised to take steam vapour twice daily along with gargling with hot water and salt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/68-dead-in-24-hours-hospitals-still-can-t-breathe-easy-101619420830560.html

On an average, PDS shops gets around 500 footfalls daily from beneficiaries. There are not adequate safety measures like sanitisers, soaps and PPEs kits for the dealers. The POS machines are also risky now in these times of Covid,” Singh said.He said the association had already written to chief minister, chief secretary and food department secretary on the issue several times. The fresh surge in Covid cases has once again put focus on the PDS system for providing subsidised foodgrains to poor families facing the economic brunt of partial lockdown and return of migrants back home. “If the PDS dealers go on strike, it would badly hit the distribution of subsidised foodgrains,” said the association president.There are total 1.79 crore ration card holders with 8.72 crore beneficiaries availing subsidised foodgrains in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/citing-virus-pds-owners-want-biometric-system-suspended-threaten-strike-govt-unmoved-101619420829677.html

26-04-2021||Patna||Bihar Covid-19: Patna hospitals grapple with oxygen short-supply||Oxygen shortage continued to cripple treatment of Covid patients at both private and government hospitals in Patna as their attendants ran from one hospital to another in search of the life-sustaining gas on Sunday.Officials estimate city hospitals need around 7,125 oxygen cylinders per day to treat critical patients, however, the administration has so far managed to raise the supply only to around 6,900 cylinders per day, leaving a shortfall of over 200 cylinders.Kin of Prabhakar Sinha, a Covid patient admitted to a Patna private hospital, which had run out of oxygen, struggled without luck trying to find one oxygen cylinder on Sunday, when Sinha’s oxygen level dropped drastically. He luckily survived after the oxygen supply was restored to the hospital in the afternoon, however, there is still no back up, said a family member. "It has been a nightmare for us. The entire health system has collapsed,” the relative said, wishing not to be named.Patna district magistrate (DM) Chandra Shekhar Singh said they were working overtime to bridge the shortfall so that no patient died for want of oxygen. “Today, a defunct plant of oxygen located at Marcha Marchi area of the capital city was operationalised to supplement the supply. We have shorted all issues and activated the plant on an urgent basis. Now, we are looking to arrange for trained manpower so that the plant could work in 24x7 mode,” said the DM, adding, three other plants have been activated to supply bottled cylinders.Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH), Nalanda Medical College and Hospital (NMCH) and Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences (IGIMS), the main public Covid treatment centres, together required around 2600 oxygen cylinders per day—one third of the city’s total oxygen requirement. “The existing oxygen generation plants at the PMCH and the NMCH are not capable of dealing with the rush of patients in a pandemic,” said a senior government officer.Rajesh Kumar Rathore, who has been supervising the state Congress task force, set up to help Covid-infected people with oxygen and other essential medicinal supplies, said the state machinery didn’t prepare itself for the current wave of the disease. “The state’s health machinery became complacent and hence woke up rather late... to streamline oxygen supply. We are managing the oxygen cylinders for critical patients, who are quarantined at home after a lot of difficulties,” said Rathore.Bihar continues to log a high number of Covid-19 infections with 12,795 cases, including 1,848 in Patna and 1,340 in Gaya, reported on Sunday, taking the number of active cases to more than 87,000. Apart from this, 68 patients died in the 24 hours preceding the release of the data by the state health department on the same day. On Saturday, Patna alone reported 2,479 fresh Covid-19 cases.More than 1.01 lakh tests were conducted for Covid across the state on Saturday. The rising number of Covid-19 casualties too has thrown up a new challenge in the long-waiting time at crematoriums. In many instances, it has taken up to 20 hours to get a chance to perform the last rites, said an official at one of the ghats along the river Ganga.“Around 100-150 bodies are being cremated per day on different ghats of Ganga. Most of the bodies are being disposed of as per Covid protocol, even though a majority of them were not confirmed Covid deaths,” said an official at Gulbi ghat.The state health department has issued an advisory, asking moderate Covid-19 patients in home isolation to take emergency anti-viral, antibiotic and vitamin supplements along with fever suppressants.

They are threatening to go on an indefinite strike from May 5 and return the biometric machines in protest if the system is not discontinued by April 30. The government has however rejected their demand.ABBA was introduced to check leakages in the PDS, which is also the channel for delivery of additional subsidised foodgrains to the poor under the national food security act.“There are a total of 87.1mn PDS beneficiaries and around 55,000 PDS dealers. On an average, a PDS shop is visited by around 500 beneficiaries daily. There are no safety measures like sanitisers, soaps, PPEs kits for the dealers. The point of sales (POS) machines are also risky in these times of Covid,” association’s president Barun Kumar Singh said. The dealers refer to the ABBA system as POS machines. Singh claimed that at least 11 dealers across the state died due to Covid-19 infection in the last two weeks and a large number with their families were infected. The association has also demanded an insurance cover of ₹50 lakh for PDS dealers.“In PDS shops, there is hardly any social distancing as people come close... to lift the foodgrains. Many times, the servers are down and the staff has to help the beneficiaries to use the POS machines, exposing them to the risk of contracting the virus,” Singh said.He said the association wrote several letters to the chief minister, chief secretary and food department secretary in this regard.“The government can easily stop the use of POS for beneficiaries and make it manual, ensuring less contact and touching. The biometric machines could be used only by the dealers for authentication through thumb impression for the time being. It will protect us all,” he added.There are total 17.9mn ration card holder families totalling 87.2mn beneficiaries under the national food security (NFS) scheme in Bihar.The state government said there was no plan to discontinue the use of the biometric machines for beneficiaries under the NFS scheme. “There is no plan to exempt biometric authentication,” Vinay Kumar, the secretary food and consumer protection department, said in a text message responding to queries on the demands raised by the association.He added that all POS machines have the facility for contactless Iris scan. “This can be used for authentication,” he said, adding, normally 3.5 lakh card holders use the option regularly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-pds-dealers-claim-biometric-system-spreading-covid-threaten-strike-101619411350357.html

26-04-2021||Delhi||Centre trying to hide 'failure' in setting up PSA O2 plants in Delhi: AAP||Calling the Centre's claim of Delhi government delaying the site readiness for installing eight Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) oxygen generation plants in the national capital with the support of the PM CARES Fund as "outrightly false", Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal-led government on Sunday said only one plant has been made operational till date."It is extremely unfortunate that at a time when Delhi government is working closely with Centre to bridge the gap in Centre's allocated quota of oxygen for Delhi, Central government is giving outrightly false statements to hide its abject failure in setting up of PSA oxygen plants in Delhi," the Kejriwal government said in a statement.The Delhi government said it is well known that the Central government decided to set up 162 PSA plants all over India and issued tenders for the same in October 2020."The plants were to be set up by Union Health Ministry through PM Cares fund, and not a single rupee was given to state governments. All these plants were supposed to have been installed by December 2020 and handed over to state governments. However, the Central government gave the contract for 140 of these plants to a single vendor, who ran away. As a result, across India not even 10 of these 162 plants have been made operational till date," it added.Talking about Delhi, the Kejriwal government said that seven of the eight plants in the national capital were to be set up at Delhi government hospitals, and one at Central government hospital - Safdarjung."After multiple follow-ups with the Central government, plants for five hospitals were delivered in early March 2021. Typically these plants take three to four days for installation. However, once again, the vendor was non-responsive and after multiple follow-ups with the Centre, only one of the five plants has been made operational to date," it said.The Delhi government alleged that for the remaining two hospital locations, the plants have not even been received on site."We are shocked to learn that Central government is now making the excuse of site certificate not being available from the Delhi government as a reason for delay in plants. This has never been brought to Delhi government's notice and is an outright lie," it added.The Kejriwal government also said, "The fact that the PSA plant has not been made operational at even Centre's own Safdarjung hospital shows that Centre is caught in the web of its own lies."In order to augment the medical oxygen capacity of Delhi amid the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, eight PSA oxygen generation plants are being installed in the national capital with the support of the PM CARES Fund, official sources had told ANI.These plants will enhance the capacity of medical oxygen by 14.4 metric tonnes. Of the eight PSA plants to be installed in Delhi, one was already installed at Burari Hospital, Kaushik Enclave on March 17.Four plants, one each at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Lok Nayak Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital, Rohini and Deepa Chand Bandhu Hospital, Ashok Vihar are expected to be completed by April 30.The sources said it is the Delhi government that delayed the site readiness despite weekly reviews since November last year.

26-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi lockdown extended by a week on public opinion: CM||Delhi on Sunday extended by a week its lockdown, a “last resort” measure put in place to arrest the alarming spread of Covid-19 in the Capital, as the health care infrastructure remained overwhelmed by a massive surge in infections, with complaints of shortages of medical oxygen and hospital beds pouring in from across the city.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown last Monday, citing a relentless surge in Covid-19 infections that inundated hospitals. While he hoped that the lockdown would not have to be extended, the Delhi chief minister on Sunday indicated the battle to control the fourth and the worst wave of infections was far from over.“The situation is concerning. Last week, we imposed a six-day lockdown in the light of the Covid-19 situation which should have ended tomorrow (Monday). The lockdown was necessary. This is our last weapon against the rapidly spreading pandemic. The unfortunate thing is that Covid-19 is still spreading. Delhi recorded a positivity rate of around 36% this week. Even though the positivity rate has today dropped to slightly below 29%, we need more time to observe the trends,” Kejriwal said in a digital news briefing.“In the light of the current situation, we have decided to increase the lockdown by another week. The lockdown now applies till 5am next Monday (May 3),” he said.The chief minister added that the decision was in accordance with public sentiment. “The public opinion is for extension of lockdown,” Kejriwal said.On Sunday, Delhi added 22,933 new Covid-19 cases and recorded 350 deaths, taking the city’s total tally to 1,027,715 and toll to 14,248. The Capital’s positivity rate -- the proportion of samples testing positive for Covid-19 -- was 30.21%, exponentially higher than the 5% threshold that experts say is the sign of an outbreak under control.Essential activities, including the sale and supply of food items, groceries, medicines, etc., are allowed in the lockdown. There are no restrictions on the movement of health care workers, frontline workers, government staff, judicial officials, journalists and those seeking medical attention.With the extension of the lockdown, the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) order – HT has seen a copy – included some new categories of exemption. They include: services provided by self-employed persons such as plumbers, electricians and those engaged in repairing of water purifiers; courier services; shops that sell educational books for students; and those selling electric fans. However, they will be allowed with a valid e-pass for movement.Kejriwal said: “Delhi is facing a severe shortage of oxygen. We need 700 MT of oxygen every day but the city’s current quota – after recent increase – is 490 MT. Secondly, even the amount allocated to us by the central government is not reaching us. Yesterday (Saturday) we received only 335 MT. The central government has been helping a lot in this regard. I have also written to chief ministers in other states to help us. The chaos, we hope, will be sorted in a few days.”The city has reported nearly 2,500 deaths due to Covid-19 in a 12-day period. Several hospitals in the national capital are grappling with severe shortage of medical oxygen. On Saturday, 20 people died at a Delhi hospital as the facility said its stock of oxygen was running dangerously low.Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia recently alleged that states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were obstructing the movement of oxygen tankers, and sought the help of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in getting the issue resolved.The Delhi high court on Saturday asked the Centre about the preparedness to deal with the expected Covid-19 second wave peak in mid-May, terming the mounting cases as a “tsunami”, and also warned it will “hang” any person who tries to obstruct oxygen supplies to hospitals in the Capital.With the worsening of conditions at the hospitals, the Centre has announced exemption of basic customs duty on import of Covid-19 vaccines, medical-grade oxygen and related equipment to boost domestic availability and directed the customs department to clear all import consignments, including life-saving drugs and equipment used in Covid-19 treatment on priority.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his monthly radio address on Sunday that India had been shaken by a “storm”, and called on people to get vaccinated and not “get swayed by any rumour about the vaccines”.In his briefing, Kejriwal said: “At this point, management of oxygen is the key. We have issued an order directing all hospitals and oxygen vendors to provide the government real-time updates on oxygen stock, consumption, and details on departures from plants, arrival in Delhi, etc., every two hours. The situation is tough but I am sure we will overcome this health emergency.”The lockdown order issued on Sunday also specified that there will be no restrictions on the interstate and intrastate movement of all types or goods, cargoes and empty trucks. They don’t need any separate movement passes.Under the previous lockdown order issued on April 19, such an exemption was applicable on interstate and intrastate movement of only essential goods.Earlier in the day, the Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) too urged the Delhi government to extend the lockdown. “We @CAITIndia urge Delhi LG Shri Anil Baijal and Delhi CM Shri ArvindKejriwal to extend lockdown till 2 May though we know that traders will be the worst sufferers but nation first, Delhi first,” Praveen Khandelwal, secretary-general of CAIT, tweeted.Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the division of epidemiology and communicable diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR), said: “Delhi should have imposed a series of restrictions by mid-March. Now the situation has gone out of hand. The government is not left with too many options now than extending the lockdown. They have to scale up bed capacity, increase ICUs and do something about the oxygen crisis. For all that to happen, the spread has to be controlled.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-lockdown-extended-by-a-week-on-public-opinion-cm-101619389572852.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt portal to track supply and stock of oxygen in real time||Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday said the government has developed a portal in which all stakeholders involved in the supply chain of medical oxygen will have to feed real-time updates on consumption, stock, departure and arrival of tankers, etc every two hours, even as, his office said, he wrote to several industrialists in the country seeking their help in addressing the oxygen shortage amid a massive surge of Covid-19 in the city.“Availability of oxygen is a major problem now. So, it has become very important to manage what we have with us. We have opened a portal in which all stakeholders in the supply chain – from manufacturers, re-fillers, vendors to hospitals – will have to update their oxygen stock position in every two hours. The information that needs to be provided include real-time update on oxygen stock, consumption, and details on departures from plants, arrival in Delhi, etc,” Kejriwal said in a video press briefing on Sunday.The chief minister’s comments came a day after the Delhi High Court expressed concerns over four hospitals in the city – including Jaipur Golden hospital, where an incident of oxygen shortage on Friday night led to death of 20 critical Covid-19 patients earlier in the day – complaining that there was nobody to coordinate with them on supplies of oxygen and essential medicines.The Delhi government informed the court on Saturday that they had constituted a team of officers to coordinate with hospitals, but they were not getting information about the quantity of oxygen supplied from suppliers and re-fillers, following which the court directed the suppliers and re-fillers to give all such information to the city government.As he extended the ongoing lockdown in Delhi by a week, Kejriwal also said on Sunday, “Delhi is facing a severe shortage of oxygen. We need 700 MT of oxygen every day but the city’s current quota – after recent increase – is 490 MT. Secondly, even the amount allocated to us by the central government is not reaching us. Yesterday, (Saturday) we received only 335 MT. The central government has been helping a lot in this regard. I have also written to CMs in other states to help us.”Government records showed that Delhi recorded receiving 380 MT oxygen on April 22, 309 MT on April 23, 335 MT on April 24. The data for Sunday was yet to be summarised, said a senior official in the CM’s office.On several occasions last week, Kejriwal and his deputy Manish Sisodia alleged that states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh were obstructing oxygen tankers headed for Delhi and sought the help of Prime Minister Narendra Modi in this regard.Later, on Sunday, Kejriwal’s office released a press statement that said, “Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Sunday wrote to the most prominent industrialists of India, seeking their help in combating the ferocious second Covid-19 wave in the country. CM Kejriwal said that he would be grateful if the leading industrialists, involved in using or producing oxygen and can help with transporting oxygen in cryogenic tankers, come to Delhi’s assistance in its time of need. He wrote that due to an unprecedented rise in the number of Covid-19 cases in Delhi, it was falling woefully short of our oxygen requirements and asked for this request to be treated as an SOS. He wrote that Delhi did not produce any oxygen, and currently faces an acute shortage of oxygen.“I understand that your organisation either uses, produces or can come in possession of oxygen. I would be grateful if you could provide us any stocks of oxygen, along with cryogenic tankers for its movement. We would also welcome any help in import of cryogenic oxygen tankers from any other country. Kindly treat this as an SOS. I would be personally grateful for your support,” read the statement citing Kejriwal’s appeal, even though the government did not specify who are the industrialists the chief minister has reached out to.HT has learnt that the CM has written to Ratan Tata, Kumar Mangalam Birla, Rahul Bajaj, Mukesh Ambani, and Anand Mahindra.The Delhi government on Sunday also issued an order appointing senior officers and allotting them hospitals in which they will personally keep track of oxygen consumption, arrivals, re-fills, and stocks on a real-time basis. These officers will now act as point of contact between the hospitals and the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s control room for distress call regarding oxygen shortage. The officers are also directed to “acquaint themselves with the oxygen suppliers of their allotted hospitals and create a channel with them to follow up and facilitate oxygen deliveries and allotted quantities by directly interacting with their representatives,” said the order, a copy of which HT has seen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-portal-to-track-supply-and-stock-of-oxygen-in-real-time-101619387179382.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Hospitals keep checking their supply meters||Hospitals in the national capital on Sunday continued to remain on edge, operating with precariously low oxygen supplies, waiting endlessly for refills and resetting the clock again to count the hours for which the replenishment will last.The Delhi government-run Lok Nayak hospital — the biggest Covid-19 facility in the city — was running on backup stock after running out of its main supply. The hospital received supply around 10am when it had just two hours of stock. The medical director of Jaipur Golden Hospital where at least 20 patients in critical care died of alleged low oxygen pressure on Sunday, had to refuse new admissions over erratic supplies.The Pentamed hospital in Model Town sent out an SOS on Twitter around 11.30am, saying it had oxygen stock that will last only for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, after an all-night scramble for an oxygen refill, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital received five metric tonnes of medical oxygen in the early hours of Sunday, hospital officials said.The Delhi high court on Saturday asked the Centre and the Delhi government to coordinate on the issue of making medical oxygen available to hospitals treating Covid-19 patients, observing that citizens cannot be left to die. The court also made it clear that the efforts which Delhi government has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised and they should not leave it entirely to the central government.While some hospitals have managed to make short-term arrangements, there is no immediate end to the crisis in sight. Metro Hospital, in Gurgaon’s Palam Vihar, claiming to be in its “last leg of medical oxygen”, made an urgent appeal for help to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah and other ministers on Sunday.The Delhi government on Sunday announced setting up a portal on which real time information relating to oxygen supply and stocks will be made available.“Availability of oxygen is a major problem now. So, it has become very important to manage what we have with us,” Kejriwal said in a video press briefing on Sunday.Referring to the oxygen supply issues at Lok Nayak hospital, medical director Dr Suresh Kumar said, “We had exhausted our oxygen stock and were using the backup which would have lasted for two hours only.” AAP MLA Raghav Chaddha, who is also the chairman of LNJP Hospital’s Rogi Kalyan Samiti, tweeted about the cryogenic tanker on its way to refill oxygen stock in the hospital.“Within the next 30 minutes, LNJP will receive liquid oxygen supply via cryogenic tanker. The tanker is on its way,” he tweeted around 9.55am on Sunday.Officials at the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini said they continued to face oxygen supply problems and denied admission requests from more patients on Sunday, a day after it reported 20 deaths amid shortage of the life-saving gas.“We are having to deny SOS admission requests for COVID patients requiring hospital care,” the hospital tweeted. Around 6pm, hospital’s medical director DK Baluja said he had been assured by officials that an oxygen tanker would reach within half an hour.Gautam Singh, the head of Shri Ram Singh Hospital and Heart Institute, also posted a video message on social media, requesting an oxygen refill for his 100-bed healthcare facility in east Delhi.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospitals-keep-checking-their-supply-meters-101619386991932.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Food, medicines, hospital beds: Residents step up in face of crisis||In the midst of an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases across the city, as social media platforms emerge as national helplines, several citizens and small-scale collectives have taken up the mantle of helping fellow residents in distress and responding to SOS messages sent by them seeking hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, plasma, and medicines.The second wave of the pandemic across the country — and the fourth in Delhi — has turned out to be the deadliest one yet.For the past 10 days, Jamia Nagar resident Shariq Hussain’s phone hasn’t stopped ringing. Desperate calls for help from affected families have kept the 29-year-old social activist on his toes. Hussain has been providing free oxygen cylinders to Covid-19 patients ever since cases in the city spiralled out of control.“On a daily basis, 500-700 people are getting oxygen refilled from my house. People from Noida, Ghaziabad, Meerut, and Bulandshahr have been visiting us for oxygen. I am trying to help as many people as we can,” said Hussain.The service is provided without any cost and the expenses for procuring oxygen are being borne by Hussain alone. “Even as we speak, hundreds of people are standing outside my house. Besides calls from individuals, I also get calls from Delhi Police who divert requests to us,” said Hussain, who lives in Jamia Nagar’s Batla House.The one-man army has hardly slept in the past week and continues to help people while observing fasts during the month of Ramzan. “We are trying to help as many as we can. At times, people die before they can reach us. Dealing with such instances is painful,” he said.Shubham Chawla, a 26-year-old, along with his mother Veenu Chawla and brother Anuj started Mom’s Kitchen — an initiative that provides free meals to Covid patients. The marketing professional’s extended family members are undergoing treatment for Covid and had a tough time securing beds in the city. Dismayed by the perilous situation in hospitals, he decided to divert his energy towards helping those who were in need.“My brother-in-law and grandmother are ill due to Covid. Their condition is quite serious and we were unable to find beds for a long time. We were helpless. After many efforts, we were able to find beds and got them admitted. During the hospital visit, I saw the situation on the ground and the true extent of the crisis hit me. I realised that I was not contributing in any way and felt the need to do something constructive. My mother loves cooking, so I thought we could start by delivering 15-20 free meals in nearby areas to help people,” said Chawla, a resident of Pitampura.Starting with five orders on the first day, the numbers increased to 50, then 100 and currently touch anywhere around 200-250. From people in dire stress to influential families, Chawla has been receiving calls from all across the city.“People often cry on the phone. Some of them even offer money but we refuse any monetary help,” said Chawla. The mother-son duo is also getting help from friends and relatives who assist in handling the growing reach of the food service. They leave food outside houses as a precautionary measure.Yogita Bhayana, a child rights activist, works round the clock with her team of seven to respond to SOS messages they receive on Twitter.“Our volunteers personally go to hospitals to check the availability of beds and wherever they get a lead they inform the patients. There are so many requests and we are not being able to help everyone. I have also started collecting empty oxygen cylinders from families who lost their loved ones and distributing them among those who want them. We are also helping them refill cylinders,” she said.Several citizen groups are also helping with ambulances.Himanshu Kalia and his cancer-survivor wife who runs Shaheed Bhagat Singh Help And Care in north Delhi’s Pratap Nagar have been providing free ambulance services in the National Capital Region.“For the past three or four days, we have been receiving nearly 200 phone calls a day. The frequency of calls we are receiving even at night has increased,” said Himanshu.Despite having 16 ambulances in their fleet, the Kalia couple is able to help move only 20-30 patients to hospitals every day.India Care, a collective that was initiated last year to help people in need amid the pandemic and helped migrant workers extensively, is now working on connecting plasma donors with those in need.Sabita Chandna, a Delhi-based life coach and volunteer at the collective, said they have been inundated with calls and SOS messages in the last week.“Our IT people pick requests we are tagged in on Twitter and put them on our groups of Telegram and WhatsApp. From there, our volunteers pick these requests and work on them. We have also started online registration for plasma donors requesting people to come forward and donate plasma. My inbox is full at present,” she said.One among the multiple networks that have taken shape to aggregate information from social media in the past two weeks is the Covid Citizen Action group — a volunteer initiative that was started by concerned citizens to crowdsource information on the availability of beds, medicines, ventilators, oxygen cylinders, plasma donors, among others. The network is using social media to verify crucial information and provide verified leads and credible information – pertaining to bed availability, oxygen, and medicines – to those in distress and follow up on critical cases.(With inputs from Shiv Sunny)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/food-medicines-hospital-beds-residents-step-up-in-face-of-crisis-101619386632357.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Illicit sale of vital Covid drugs hurts desperate buyers||On Saturday, 47-year-old Ganesh Upadhyay, a Janakpuri resident, drove around the city while simultaneously making enquiry calls, to get hold of six doses of remdesivir for his 42-year old wife who was admitted to a private hospital with Covid-19. While the antiviral drug was unavailable at most pharmacies, a neighbour connected him with a dealer in north Delhi, who offered to supply him with the medicine for ₹25,000 a vial. Chemist bodies in the city said the drug retails for between ₹1,000 and ₹2,700.“I tried contacting authorised remdesivir dealers using the list released by the Delhi government, but many numbers were unavailable, while others did not have any stock,” Upadhyay said.Even common pills like paracetamol were hard to come by, he said.With increasing instances of hoarding and black marketing of drugs being reported in the Capital at least five chemist associations in Delhi-NCR on Saturday issued notices to members asking them to stay vigilant against such practices.These notices reiterated that medication used to treat Covid-19 patients such as remdesivir, favipiravir, ivermectin, and others, are to be sold only after a buyer produces a prescription and the patient’s Aadhaar card, to avoid their black-marketing.“This is a very crucial time and there is a shortage of supply of medicines. In fact, many of our members have said they are also running out of regular flu medicines because people are panic-buying. However, in case of any Covid-19 specific medication, we have issued directions that the drugs are to be sold at the maximum retail prescription and only with valid prescription and ID cards,” said Kuldeep Singh Channa, secretary of the Southwest Delhi Chemist Association.Chana said that for instance, a 17-tablet strip of 400mg Fabiflu, which is the most prescribed brand of favipiravir, is to be sold at an MRP of ₹1,224. However, in the black market, this is now being sold for as much as ₹4,000 a strip.Residents across the city said there is a shortage of non-Covid medicines and equipment too.“My mother is a chronic diabetic, and I have been buying insulin syringes from a local shop for years. But supplies of these syringes have dried up for the past week. Since the owner of the shop knows us, he delivers it to our house as soon as he manages some, but the situation is really bad,” said Himanshu Agarwal, a resident of south Delhi’s Munirka.Suresh Yadav, the owner of a pharmacy in Dwarka Sector 6, said supplies have been hit because a large share of the stock of medicines is being diverted to hospitals and pharmacies near Covid care centres.“In the last three hours at least 50 people have come in asking for paracetamol tablets. I am already out of it. People are taking these medicines without a prescription, as a prevention against Covid-19, which is another reason they’re out of stock,” Yadav said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/illicit-sale-of-vital-covid-drugs-hurts-desperate-buyers-101619386236236.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Police told to shore up security outside distributors’ offices||The Delhi government has asked the police to ensure adequate security arrangements outside the offices of Remdesivir distributors, as demand for the antiviral drug soars, with several doctors prescribing the medicine to treat Covid-19 patients.In a letter to Delhi police commissioner SN Shrivastava on April 22, the state government’s special health secretary and drug controller Udit Prakash Rai wrote, “…steep increase in demand of the said formulations (remdesivir) has resulted in long queues… which are now becoming unmanageable and resulting in law-and-order problems… you are requested to provide adequate security arrangement and police staff at these sites.”The Delhi government on April 19 allowed a few distributors to sell Remdesivir injections to those with valid prescriptions.Distributors said they have been bombarded with calls from relatives of Covid-19 patients and are unable to meet the demand.Sandeep Nangia, organising secretary of the All India Organisation of Chemists and Druggists (AIOCD), said, “There are queues of nearly 200-300 people outside the offices of these few remdesivir distributors. But we don’t have enough medicine to meet the demand. This has resulted in a major problem at the distributors’ offices. We asked the drug control department for more security. It has become extremely difficult for these distributors because their contact information has now been made public, even though only a few are allowed retail sales of the medicine.”There are 30 Remdesivir distributors in Delhi.A senior official with the government’s drug control department said there have been complaints from distributors of people queuing outside their offices and misbehaving with them.“We allowed a few distributors to sell the medicines directly to people. But this has resulted in a law-and-order situation outside some offices. This is why we have requested the police to provide adequate security,” said a senior government official aware of the matter.“We are constantly monitoring the situation at all drug centres and hospitals. The local police are sensitised in these areas and appropriate arrangements will be made as required,” said the Delhi Police’s spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/police-told-to-shore-up-security-outside-distributors-offices-101619386018392.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Airlines fly in O2 concentrators amid shortages||As hospitals across the country struggle with oxygen shortages, a Boeing 737 operated by SpiceJet airlifted 800 oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong to Delhi on Saturday, said airline officials aware of the matter.This week, Air India is also scheduled to bring oxygen concentrators from San Francisco and Chicago to Delhi. Police have also made arrangements at the Delhi airport to ensure smooth and uninterrupted delivery of the Covid-related consignments to their destination.Avani Singh, CEO of SpiceHealth, said the aircraft landed at the Indira Gandhi International airport with the consignment of oxygen concentrators via Kolkata around 7pm on Saturday.A SpiceJet spokesperson said the airline is gearing up to bring as many as 10,000 oxygen concentrators this month from across the globe.An Air India official said that their aircraft is expected to bring in oxygen concentrators from the USA to Delhi this week.An official from the Delhi airport said the customs department has also been told to expedite customs clearance for these incoming consignments. “All Covid related parcels will be subject to speedy clearance on high priority by the custom, be it drugs, oxygen concentrators or any other medical equipment,” said the officer said requesting not to be named.Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson of Delhi Police, said whenever required, they are prepared to escort any vehicle carrying emergency drugs or equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/airlines-fly-in-o2-concentrators-amid-shortages-101619385571918.html

26-04-2021||Delhi||Cops work to keep oxygen flowing||The Delhi Police spent much of their last 24 hours — from Saturday evening to Sunday evening — escorting oxygen tanks to hospitals, helping individuals with transportations and medicines and even arresting three men allegedly involved in blackmarketing of essential drugs and oxygen.“The police prepared green corridors and made other arrangements for the safe and quick movement of oxygen tankers to several hospitals such as Dharamshila Hospital in Vasundhara Enclave, Safdarjung Hospital, Batra Hospital and St Stephen’s Hospital,” said Chinmoy Biswal, spokesperson of Delhi Police.Oxygen cylinders were also arranged for ESI Hospital in Vivek Vihar, Jeevan Hospital in South-East Delhi and Batra Hospital until a tanker arrived there.On Sunday, the police were busy helping individuals in different capacities.In East Delhi’s Mayur Vihar, for instance, the police helped two elderly people move to a hospital after receiving a request from a Singapore-based man on Twitter. In Lajpat Nagar, they cremated a body found under a tree.The police also cracked down on a group of people allegedly involved in black marketing of Remdesivir vials, oximeters and small oxygen cylinders.According to deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj, Alok Tyagi, Somel Gupta and Abhishek were arrested with three vials of Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, which were allegedly being sold for ₹40,000 each, 100 oxymeters and 48 small cylinders. Bhardwaj said that the trio,arrested from east Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar on Sunday, got fake press ID cards to roam around the city.The national capital has been reeling under the devastating impact of a fourth wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, with the city on Sunday adding 22,933 fresh cases of the infection, while 350 more people succumbed to the virus, even as the test positivity rate fell marginally to 30.2%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/cops-work-to-keep-oxygen-flowing-101619384765460.html

26-04-2021||Delhi||Woman killed by landlord’s son in outer delhi for refusing his sexual advances||25-year-old woman was allegedly killed by her landlord’s son at her rented accommodation in outer Delhi early on Saturday for refusing to give in to his sexual demands, police said.The woman, her husband and their seven-month-old adopted daughter had moved into the rented room on the third floor of the building in outer Delhi only four months ago. Her husband works at a printing unit.According to a senior police officer, the woman’s husband was staying at his workplace due to restrictions on movement. “The 29-year-old son of the building owner noticed the absence of the woman’s husband,” said deputy commissioner of police (outer) Parminder Singh. The suspect is a graduate and works in a private firm.The DCP said the suspect called his friends over on Friday night and had dinner on the terrace. “His friends left after dinner around midnight. He was the last to leave the terrace,” said Siingh adding the suspect was drunk at the time of the crime.While walking down to his house on the first floor, the suspect noticed the door of the woman’s room open and entered. The woman was sleeping beside her daughter. “He sought to establish physical relations with the woman who threatened to report him to police.

They walked in to find the woman dead and the baby crying,” the officer said.While investigating the murder, police realised the room had only one entrance and the access to the floor was controlled by the house owner, the DCP said.“When we questioned the landlord’s son, he initially tried to pass the blame on his friends who came for dinner.

26-04-2021||Delhi||Oxygen Express with 4 tankers heads to Delhi||The first ‘Oxygen Express’ train for Delhi, with four cryogenic tankers carrying liquid medical oxygen (LMO), is scheduled to depart from Jindal Steel and Power Ltd (JSPL) steel plant in Chhattisgarh’s Raigarh on Sunday night, said officials from the railway ministry aware of the development.“One Oxygen Express train carrying four tankers (around 70 metric tonnes of LMO) will depart tonight for Delhi Cantonment from JSPL, Raigarh,” said a spokesperson from the railway ministry.Suneet Sharma, chairman of the railway board, said at a press conference on Sunday that so far, the Indian Railways has transported 10 tankers carrying around 150 metric tonne of oxygen.“Indian Railways is going to deliver more than 140 MT liquid oxygen in next 24 hrs. Currently, nine tankers are already on the run, out of which five will reach Lucknow by tonight (Sunday) and remaining four containers of LMO, which have already started from Bokaro, are expected to reach Lucknow tomorrow (Monday),” read a statement from the railway ministry.The ministry has also asked the Delhi government to obtain more cryogenic tankers. The Railways is also ready to transport oxygen containers on container wagons from Durgapur to Delhi, said officials from the ministry.The move comes at a time when hospitals in Delhi are struggling with an acute shortage of oxygen for the sixth consecutive day, with some even turning away Covid-19 patients. On Saturday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal wrote an urgent SOS to heads of other states, requesting them to send whatever surplus oxygen and tankers they can spare for the national capital.While Delhi’s daily oxygen allocation is 480MT, Kejriwal has said the city currently requires about 700MT of oxygen. The national capital has been reporting nearly 25,000 or more Covid-19 cases every day for the past one week.According to a statement by his office, Kejriwal on Sunday wrote to some prominent industrialists, who were not named in the statement, seeking their help in combating the ferocious second Covid-19 wave in the country. CM Kejriwal said that he would be grateful if the leading industrialists, involved in using or producing oxygen and can help with transporting oxygen in cryogenic tankers, come to Delhi’s assistance in its time of need.According to the statement, CM Kejriwal wrote that while the central government is helping Delhi in this regard, the intensity of the spread is so severe that the quantity is proving inadequate.As many as 350 people died of Covid-19 on Sunday, according to the Delhi government’s bulletin. The city also reported 22,933 fresh cases of the infection.Plagued by the acute shortage of oxygen due to a significant rise in Covid-19 cases, more states are seeking the railways’ assistance for delivering LMO via the ‘Oxygen Express’ trains. The national carrier has planned more Oxygen Express trains to Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, Telangana, Delhi and MP in the coming weeks.The first Oxygen Express train departed from Mumbai to Vizag on April 19. Four such trains have also made round trips from Lucknow to Bokaro from April 22 to 24, said railway officials, adding that so far, around 10 oxygen tankers (each having a capacity of 15-16MT) filled with LMO have been transported in these trains.Last week, the Indian railways decided to deploy first-of-a-kind ‘Oxygen Express’ trains to transport LMO and oxygen cylinders in bulk along key corridors, amid high demand from states grappling with the second wave of Covid-19.With several states reporting a shortage of oxygen, the government last week directed them to ensure uninterrupted movement of vehicles carrying medical oxygen along their borders and said they must not impose any curbs on production and supply of essential commodities of public health.A meeting was held between Railway Board officials and state transport commissioners and representatives of the industry on April 17 on issues related to the transportation of liquid medical oxygen.Last week, the railway ministry also approved the transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers under its ‘roll on-roll off’ model as a special case following a request from the Maharashtra government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-express-with-4-tankers-heads-to-delhi-101619382787280.html

Only medical stores remained open. The state and administration took this step to curb further spread of Covid after witnessing a surge in cases for the last 25 days.The lockdown was largely successful as residents remained inside their houses and avoided stepping out without valid reasons. A meagre movement of traffic was witnessed in the city. All shops, stores, offices, malls, restaurants, and hotels remained shut. Around 2,000 police personnel deployed at various locations in the city kept a strict vigil on the movement of people. In the internal parts of the city, some small shopkeepers had opened their shops that had to be shut down by the police. In areas with majority population of labourers including Sherpur, Giaspura, Focal Point, Dhandhari, Daba, and Jamalpur, people were seen gathered in small groups. They were sent back to their respective houses by the police. J Elanchezhian, joint commissioner of police, headquarters, said that the lockdown remained a success. Very few violations were witnessed in the city and the residents’ cooperation was appreciated, he added.A hiccup at ISBTSome people were seen waiting for buses at the Amar Shaheed Sukhdev Thapar inter-state bus terminal. When a bus for Chandigarh arrived, passengers flouted the social distancing norms and gathered around the conductor to get tickets. They were in a hurry as only 26 passengers were allowed to board a bus at a time. Except for the buses running on the Chandigarh route, all others witnessed low occupancy.Shopkeepers rue lossesThe shopkeepers rued that they were already reeling under losses due to low footfall and now the Sunday lockdown had made things worse as people are usually free on the weekends and go to the markets then. Markets such as Chaura Bazar, Ghumar Mandi, and Model Town usually witness more footfall on Sunday than on any other day of the week. They added that the limit set by the government on the number of people permitted to attend weddings had also affected businesses and very few people were turning up at their shops to purchase clothes and jewellery as a result. Sanjeev Chaudhary, president of Arora Market Chaura Bazaar Association, said, “The lockdown will affect businesses as people from different parts of the state visit our market on Sundays. I deal in ready made garments and due to the government allowing only 20 persons to attend weddings, people have stopped shopping in bulk. This has resulted in a loss for the shopkeepers.”Akalgarh Market, one of the wholesale garment markets of the city, has around 800 shops. Manpreet Singh Bunty, president of Akalgarh Market Readymade Garment Association, said, “Over 90% of our business is done on Sunday. The lockdown had affected us badly. The authorities must come up with an alternative and strictly impose restrictions such as wearing masks and maintaining social distance.”There are over 300 shops in the Model Town market that are registered with the Market Association, Model Town. Amarjit Singh, President of Model Town Shopkeepers’ Association, said, “We are already witnessing a low footfall and businesses will collapse if the authorities impose a lockdown every Sunday. A majority of our customers turn up on weekends. The livelihood of the shopkeepers depends on the sales made on Sunday.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-halts-for-sunday-lockdown-bizmen-rue-losses-101619382668057.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Traders want curbs on market timings||Representatives of the Capital’s wholesale markets after a meeting on Sunday said they will write to the Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal and CM chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, demanding a series of steps to control the spread of Covid-19 in markets, including limiting market timings, weekend shutdowns of these wholesale outlets, and vaccinations for workers.Representatives from at least eight wholesale markets across the city, including Azadpur mandi, Ghazipur mandi, Flower Mandi, Chaudhart Chetram mandi, Murga Machhi mandi, Okhla mandi, Narela mandi and Najafgarh mandi discussed these measures, they said, which will ensure these markets do not turn into Covid-19 hot spots.Stakeholders said the letter is likely to be sent to the L-G and CM on Monday.“The number of cases is growing fast, so the government needs to ensure that preventive measures are taken for crowd control at wholesale markets. During the meeting, representatives from all the mandis put forth their opinions, and we are going to send these to L-G Anil Baijal and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal,” said Anil Malhotra, member of the Azadpur Agricultural Produce Marketing Committee (APMC).Malhotra said that since the bulk of vegetables are sold between 11pm and 11am, and fruits between 5am and 11am, the wholesale should be open only during these hours, and can stay shut for the rest of the day.During the lockdown last year, authorities put in place a slew of measures like drone surveillance, passes for entry into markets, designated spots for loading and unloading of stocks, to keep crowds under control.Meanwhile, retail vegetable and fruit sellers in the city said they were facing problems transporting their stock from the wholesale markets to their shops amid the lockdown.While they said the demand for fruits and vegetables has increased, barricades and checks were delaying deliveries.“People remember the problems during the lockdown last year and started panic-buying early on. Another problem is that because so many people are falling ill, we do not have enough workers to meet the demand for home deliveries. Most of the sale is happening through home deliveries these days and being a small-scale supermarket, we do not have the resources for it,” said Madhukar Tripathi, owner of a supermarket in southwest Delhi’s Palam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/traders-want-curbs-on-market-timings-101619382535038.html

Several beggars and destitute people were seen on deserted streets and outside temples, shrines and empty rotaries waiting for alms and food in vain.50-year-old Prem Kumar, a beggar in Gandhi Nagar, who is crippled since birth and moves around with the help of crutches, said, “Last year, when the Covid pandemic hit the country, a complete lockdown was imposed. The situation was extremely grim for beggars. Now, the lockdown is back again. We pray that it does not last long because we survive on the food and alms given to us by philanthropists.” “Temples, gurdwaras, mosques, churches, markets, restaurants and eateries are closed. Now, we are truly at God’s mercy,” he added. “Some philanthropists came today and gave us food in Gandhi Nagar area. I pray that this pandemic comes to an end because if lockdown is frequently imposed then people like us may starve,” he said. Last year in the middle of the Covid lockdown, the J&K government provided dry ration to beggars, the destitute and daily-wage earners but it didn’t reach everyone because of their enormous population spread across 20 districts of the UT. The lockdown has also put several migrant labourers from Bihar, Chattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, West Bengal and Odisha in a quandary. “Last year, was tough for us. We somehow managed to reach home when trains started running. Transporters were already on strike for the past four days and now this lockdown has added to our woes. We have to leave our shanties early morning and walk 7km to reach the construction site,” said Mohan Lal of Bihar’s Kishanganj area. “Daily wage earners will bear the brunt of the lockdown. Unlike government employees, we have to work everyday to earn two square meals for our families. If the government has to impose lockdown, it should allow construction workers to work with Covid SoPs,” he added. His colleague Waheed said, “We appeal the government to allow construction activity and other allied sectors so that we can continue to eke out our living. Otherwise, we may have to head home again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/34hour-lockdown-last-year-s-nightmare-haunts-migrant-workers-destitute-in-jammu-101619382548054.html

The number stood much higher at 17,000 on Saturday. A health department employee, on the condition of anonymity, said that people may not have turned up due to fear of police action. Sanjeev Sharma, a resident of Sarabha Nagar, said he had planned to get a Covid test on Sunday, however, he changed his mind at the last minute. “I did not wish to land in any sort of trouble with the police. So I decided to postpone it till Monday,” he said.Deepak Kumar, a resident of Civil Lines, said, “I thought the cops may question my on why I was venturing out during the lockdown. So I felt it was best to wait another day to get the vaccine.”District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Dhagat was not available for comments despite repeated attempts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/testing-vaccination-centres-see-lean-footfall-amid-sunday-shutdown-101619382428194.html

Such acts hamper efforts to provide assistance to hospitals that really need help. The media should cross-check before reporting such cases,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/hospitals-should-not-raise-alarm-on-o2-shortage-unnecessarily-sisodia-101619382255994.html

Complainant Mohit Narang, 30, of Gobind Nagar, Shimlapuri, alleged that the cops kept dilly-dallying the matter, forcing him to move the Punjab and Haryana high court with a writ petition.The accused in the case are Rashtrawadi Shiv Sena national president Sunil Tangri, his accomplices Surinder Kali, Sunny Tangri, Shalu Bawa and their five unidentified accomplices.Narang said he runs a mobile repair shop in a rented space in Gurmandi. The owner of the rental space wanted him to vacate the shop following which he moved the court for a stay order. The accused then started pressuring him to withdraw the case, which he agreed to. But on July 19, 2019, two days after he withdrew the case, the accused forcefully got him to vacate the shop. “They stole the material kept in my shop. On September 15, 2019, I filed a complaint against the accused at Division number 1. Soon after I came out of the police station, the accused started thrashing me and also stole ₹32,000 from my pockets,” said Narang.“Even though the incident took place outside the police station, no action was taken against the accused. After approaching the police multiple times, I moved a writ petition in the Punjab and Haryana high court against the police inaction. Now, the cops have registered an FIR to save themselves,” he said.Assistant sub-inspector (ASI) Gurmeet Singh, the investigating officer, said a case under Sections 356 (assault or criminal force in attempt to commit theft of property carried by a person), 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means), 323 (voluntarily causing hurt), 506 (criminal intimidation), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object) of the Indian Penal Code has been registered against the accused.

26-04-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: Pandemic postcard||The evening breeze is cool. The blue sky is darkening. A pale moon has already surfaced. The air is filled with the incessant sound of ambulance sirens. The roads on which those ambulances are running cannot be seen amid the thick tree cover, but these desperate vehicles must be heading to nearby Safdarjung Hospital, or to All India Institute of Medical Sciences.If you count out the sound of sirens, then this corner of south Delhi’s Hauz Khas Village is picture postcard perfect. Stony remains of the 14th century are speckled across an expanse of green. The Hauz Khas lake is glimmering in the distance. The village’s lanes are completely empty due to the pandemic-era curfew. The cafes are closed. The aggressive nightclub bouncers and touts who would crowd the Main Street in less deadly times have disappeared. A few stray dogs are snoozing here and there, immersed in peace. The monument’s rusting metal gate is also locked, with nobody inside but for a lone gardener watering the grass with a long green hose, and a handful of uniformed security guards.The only antidote to the continuous wail of ambulance sirens is the continuous chirping of birds — mostly pigeons. They are settled on one of the monument’s domes, as if it were a community club, standing as close to each other as we humans would in cinema halls before the pandemic. Suddenly, for no apparent reason, the birds all at once scatter away. Some go towards the balconies of the monument-facing village houses, many of which have been turned into AirBnB rooms. Some go towards an amaltas tree that will only bloom next month, with its golden yellow flowers. And some head to a rooftop cafe that was blaring pop music late into the night as recently as last month—which is like another lifetime.Few moments pass. And suddenly a great flock of pigeons fly back from those many directions and settle upon the same dome. Perhaps they are the same birds. This intermittent communal merry-go-round continues for a long time. Finally, the night sets in. The moon is the only visible thing in the black sky. The birds have disappeared. The village is deathly quiet. But the air is still pierced by an ambulance siren now and then, not letting the village residents forget about the city’s unfolding tragedy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-pandemic-postcard-101619381794381.html

The snow had scarred apple trees and stone fruit, including peaches, nectarines, cherries, plums, and apricots, in the high and mid-hills.A high-level meeting was held on Sunday to review the loss and relief will be subsequently sought from the Centre. The CM said untimely snow, hailstorm and rainfall had caused heavy losses to apple, wheat and peas in almost all districts of the state, which was a matter of concern. He also directed DCs to ask insurance agencies to send their agents to assess losses to crops covered under the Crop Insurance Scheme so that farmers and horticulturists could be provided compensation immediately. Former horticulture minister Narendra Bragta, who is a legislator from the affluent apple growing region Kotkhai, demanded that the government setup a high-level committee under a Cabinet-rank minister to assess the losses, the decision to shift posts of horticulture extension officers be reconsidered and pending payments of apple crop be released under market intervention schemes. “Farmers in Himachal have incurred a loss of around ₹1,500 crore, and the government must provide relief to them,” said former Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/assess-loss-to-fruit-trees-due-to-snow-jai-ram-to-dcs-101619382067913.html

The move comes amid reports of beds running out in the two government-run hospitals in the state — the state’s premier hospital, Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital, which has 147 Covid beds, all of which are occupied and Deen Dayal Upadhyay (DDU)Hospital, which has 90 earmarked Covid beds against 102 patients admitted at present. “We have ordered the take over of the Ayurveda Hospital and talks are on to take over private hospitals,” said Shimla deputy commissioner Aditya Negi. IGMC has sought the government’s assistance to enhance facilities for Covid patients. “Our hospital has the infrastructure and if required we can increase our capacity to 300 beds. We have done it earlier as well,” said senior medical superintendent of police Janakraj Pakhretia. DDU Hospital medical superintendent Ravinder Mokta said, “We are adding 30 more Covid beds as we have reached full capacity.” The two hospitals also cater to patients from the outer Seraj regions of Kullu, Rampur Bushar, Rohru, Jubbal, Kotkhai. Besides, patients requiring emergency treatment from Kinnaur and Bilaspur are also referred to Shimla . DDU hospital was redesignated as a Covid care centre a week ago. The government has also taken over the civil hospital in Junga. The district administration has also notified the Panchayati Raj Training Institute, Mashobra, as a dedicated Covid-care centre. The centre has capacity to accommodate 34 persons and 30 additional beds are being added to the regional Ayurveda Centre. “The government needs to put in some serious efforts to enhance the bed capacity. Numerous people are in home isolation, some of whom are critically-ill but are hesitant to go to hospitals as they are at full capacity. People in the state capital are struggling to arrange oxygen concentrators,” said former mayor Sanjay Chauhan. While officially 1,033 people are in home isolation, the number of infected patients could be higher as may patients with flu-like symptoms are reluctant to get tested. Shimla has the highest case fatality ratio (CFR) of 2.4. The second biggest hospital in the state, Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College and Hospital, Tanda is also nearly at full capacity .

Amid the crisis, Ludhiana has offered help to neighbouring districts where the situation is grimmer. While 250 life-saving oxygen cylinders have been sent to Amritsar and Jalandhar, 25 have been sent to Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar (Nawanshahr).The district has two air separation plants (ASP), which are currently catering to the need of oxygen here.Deputy director of local government Amit Bambi, who has been given the charge of monitoring the oxygen supply, said, “Roughly speaking, the demand of oxygen cylinders, which was around 300 cylinders a day in the beginning of the year, has gone up to 2,000 cylinders a day now. While our two ASP units are generating roughly 1, 600 cylinders of oxygen a day, the gap of around 400 cylinders is being met from the one functional bottling unit, which has 500 MT of liquid oxygen in its stock.”“We have requested the government for liquid oxygen so that the rest of the bottling plants can also be made operational to meet the demand,” said Bambi.He added that in a huge respite, the five big hospitals in the city -- Dayanand Medical College and Hospital, Christian Medical College and Hospital, SPS Hospital, Fortis and Mohandai Oswal Hospital – have a direct supply of oxygen. It is the smaller ones that require oxygen cylinders.Supply regulated, prices revisedThe doctors of private hospitals said the supply of oxygen has been regulated.Former president of Punjab Medical Council and member of the core committee of the Alliance of Doctors on Ethical Healthcare (ADEH), Dr Gurinder Grewal, said the price of oxygen has been revised. “Not only has the supply been regulated, the cost of filling oxygen has also been revised. In March, we could get oxygen cylinders refilled for ₹250, but now, it is available at a revised rate of ₹400 per refill.”Gagandeep Singh, owner of Weltech Equipment and Infrastructure Limited, said while the rate of refilling of cylinders from air separation units have not been revised, the bottling units have revised the prices from the back-end.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/four-out-of-5-bottling-plants-in-ludhiana-await-liquid-o2-101619381587864.html

While people stayed inside their homes, police and Central Reserve Police Force jawans were deployed at all significant places. No vehicles were plying on the road, except essential services. At many places, police had blocked the roads with barbed wire and the barricades.

Essential and emergency services to be allowed. All market, commercial institutions will remain closed, (sic)” Sinha’s office had tweeted. Amid surging cases, the government has already imposed night curfew across 20 districts. However, the weekend curfew was announced after the daily case count started crossing 2,000. The city’s business nerve centre Lal Chowk was empty as the police had barricaded the road last night. Nobody was allowed to move on the road. Likewise all the prominent roads and streets of Kashmir and business centres looked desolate. All the gardens of the city, including the Tulip Garden remained shut. Ordinarily, these gardens attract a significant crowd during weekends, especially tourists. After the surge in cases, tourist influx in the Valley has declined. The decision to impose curfew on the weekend was taken on the suggestion of experts, who have already requested the administration to impose lockdown in Kashmir to keep the situation under control. Some of the experts and doctors had even suggested a prolonged curfew as they fear the health infrastructure in J&K, especially Kashmir, will not be unable to tackle the daily influx of critical Covid patients.“The weekend curfew is good. But the government should go for prolonged curfew for a week or two. This will keep the disease well under control,” said a Government Medical College, Srinagar, doctor.Across Kashmir, police officials were seen encouraging people to sit inside their homes and abide to the curfew.“Great cooperation by the people. Heartening to see. We can limit the spread! Let only those in dire need come out on normal days as well!” tweeted Baramulla senior superintendent of police (SSP) Rayees Mohammad Bhat while posting pictures of curfew in Baramulla on social media. Police also requested people to wear masks.“Whilst we enforce lockdown outdoors, it is more important to take extreme precautions in indoor settings where the virus spreads more. Wear K95/N95 masks in cars,buses,offices. Avoid get togethers & open windows to allow air ventilation,” tweeted the Anantnag police on its social media handle.Meanwhile, Kashmir University has postponed all its offline postgraduate and undergraduate examinations till May 2. The campus will remain closed till April 28.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-wears-a-deserted-look-amid-covid-curfew-101619381470165.html

Railways would need 24-96 hours to upgrade and provide at the required place,” he added.President of Association of Physicians of India (Malwa branch), Dr Vitull K Gupta said such coaches should be parked away from the railway stations.“Since the movement of trains is still on in the region, passengers should be kept away from the isolation wards to avoid virus contraction. We have written to the central authorities to ensure such couches are kept away from platforms,” said Gupta, a public health activist and physician from Bathinda.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/railways-plans-to-deploy-40-coaches-for-covid-care-in-punjab-101619380447989.html

With this, the state health department is hopeful of becoming malaria-free by the end of this year.Last year, the state had logged 109 cases, a major drop from the 1,040 cases witnessed in 2019.The data suggests that the state health authorities are close to achieving the target of eliminating indigenous malaria cases in Punjab, despite most of its staff being deployed on Covid-19 duties.In accordance with the national framework for malaria elimination in India, which was launched on February 11, 2016, Punjab was shortlisted in category 1 among 15 states with a vision of having zero indigenous malaria cases by 2021. Also, Punjab health and family welfare department had launched a malaria elimination campaign 2017-2021.Dr Gagandeep Singh Grover, state nodal officer for National Vector Borne Diseases Control Program (NVBDCP) Punjab, said that the state reported only four cases of malaria in Fatehgarh Sahib district this year, out of which one was imported and three were induced cases.Dr Grover said the main reasons behind the decline in malaria cases include regular focal spray in affected areas, distribution of long-lasting insecticides, bed nets, release of Gambushia fishes in ponds. “We continued the statewide surveillance even during the Covid-19 pandemic,” he added.However, experts said that the favourable season for mosquito breeding starts from June to October, and only after can we determine the exact number of districts to have achieved malaria elimination by the end of 2021.Malaria is a potentially life-threatening parasitic disease caused by female anopheles mosquitoes. Mainly two parasites are common in Punjab — P vivax and P falciparam. Malaria infection has typical symptoms of fever, sweating and chills. World Malaria Day is observed on April 25 every year.Barnala civil surgeon Dr Harinderjeet Singh said that every fever case has to be screened for malaria. He added that people should be aware about source reduction activities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-only-4-cases-so-far-punjab-aims-to-be-malaria-free-by-yearend-101619380388854.html

The agency has filed an enforcement case information report (ECIR), seen by HT, under sections of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act at its zonal office in Jalandhar on the basis of probe details shared by Punjab vigilance bureau (VB).The ED has registered the case nearly four years after the VB shared the documents with the central agency in August 2017. Sources said the documents shared by VB were sufficient to lodge a money laundering case in 2017. Thereafter, the ED wrote letters seeking more details of the case in 2017 and 2018. The vigilance shared one chargesheet and some other case documents with the central agency in July 2020 in reply to the latter communication to the state agency in January 2019, almost after a period of one and a half years.The ED officials said they were yet to receive the remaining three challans from VB.In November 2019, the Punjab and Haryana high court had directed an additional district and sessions court, Mohali, to finish its trial against Pehalwan, in an alleged multi-crore graft case within a year while denying bail. However, in 2020, Supreme Court granted him bail.The state vigilance bureau had arrested Pehalwan, an alleged favourite of the Badal family of Shiromani Akali Dal, on June 9, 2017. According to the vigilance probe, Pehalwan allotted works of around ₹1,200 crore at exorbitant rates. He is also accused of parking his black money in accounts of bogus firms and family members. Pehalwan joined as a junior engineer in Punjab mandi board in 1993. He became a superintending engineer in GMADA in 2014 and officiated as a chief engineer there from 2016.In September 2019, VB had also attached 59 properties of the former GMADA chief engineer amounting to ₹26 crore (approx) as per the orders of a Mohali court. The VB has already filed four challans against Pehalwan and others so far in the case.As per the vigilance probe, Pehalwan had registered three fake companies in the name of family members and made transactions of hundreds of crores through banks. During his GMADA stint, he had formed a fake construction company “Ek Onkar Builders and Construction Pvt Ltd” and illegally allotted it tenders thereby amassing ill-gotten money to the tune of ₹400 crore. He also purchased various properties in Ludhiana, Ropar, Mohali, and Chandigarh amounting to ₹26 crore with the money.The vigilance case against him and others had been registered under sections 420 (cheating), 506 (criminal intimidation) and 120-B (criminal conspiracy) of the IPC and 13 (1) (d) read with 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. He also faces two more vigilance cases of disproportionate assets and forging birth certificate to get a government job, registered in 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/multicrore-graft-case-ed-books-ex-gmada-chief-engineer-for-money-laundering-101619380387924.html

Thirteen of the shifted doctors are specialists in medicine, 12 in anaesthesia and 10 in paediatrics.One of the doctors, who didn’t wish to be named, said: “Instead of recruiting doctors against the vacant posts in the state, the government has started shifting them mostly from rural areas. This will impact health services in rural institutions, which are already suffering due to shortage of doctors.”Tarn Taran civil surgeon Dr Rohit Mehta said: “Tackling the Covid situation is the department’s top priority at this point. We can manage with other doctors in the districts.”According to the health department record, nearly 40% posts of doctors are lying vacant in Tarn Taran.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-surge-35-specialists-from-8-dists-shifted-to-medical-colleges-in-punjab-101619378707900.html

It was manufactured in 2014 to treat Ebola, and has since been used to treat SARS and MERS. In 2020, the drug was repurposed for Covid treatment and clinical experience has shown that it works best in mildly ill to severe Covid-19 patients.“To control the misuse of Remdesivir and to ensure its easy availability in government and private hospitals, a “State Remdesivir Injection Monitoring Centre” has been formed. Nodal officers have been designated in each district as a part of monitoring committees, who will keep strict vigil on the supply, sale and purchase of Remdesivir,” said commissionerate of food and drugs administration, Punjab, in a letter.The letter reads that Remdesivir will not be sold to any person, firm or hospital without prior written consent or permission from the district nodal officer. In government and private hospitals, the daily usage of the anti-viral drug is over 50 doses, across the state.The move came a day after a Jalandhar-based doctor and his aide were arrested by police for black marketing Remdesivir. During a raid, several empty vials of Remdesivir were found at a medical centre, for which no bill of purchase or receipt of patients was produced.“The state has received the first batch of 3,000 Remdesivir doses from a private firm and we have started distributing it to the district health departments, according to their consumption and Covid patient load. Other stock of 5,000 doses from the same firm is in the pipeline. The Centre has also decided to send another 13,400 doses to Punjab. District-level monitoring teams have been formed to check black marketing and misuse of the drug,”, said Dr Rajesh Bhaskar, state nodal officer for Covid-19.“No private hospital in Punjab will be allowed to purchase Remdesivir injection directly from the supplier as they will have to take the stock from the district nodal officer, with proper permission and consent form. Also, any Covid-19 patient or their attendant can take the injection from the district health department, after showing Covid-19 test reports or identity proofs.”As per health experts, Remdesivir is an experimental drug for use, the efficacy of which has not been proven yet. But still, being the only anti-viral drug available in the country, people are purchasing it from chemist shops at high price. The injection is given to moderate and severely ill patients but it is not a life-saving drug.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/districtlevel-committees-formed-to-monitor-remdesivir-supply-in-punjab-101619378588740.html

According to the information provided by the central government, the delivery of vaccines for the 18-45 age group is not expected before May 15. To ensure free vaccination of the poor in government hospitals, Amarinder said in addition to the CM Covid Relief Fund, corporate social responsibility (CSR) funds should also be tapped into. Employees State Insurance Corporation (ESIC) should be asked to support the vaccination of industrial workers covered in the scheme, and the Board for Welfare of Construction Workers for construction labourers, he added. Reviewing the vaccination strategy, Amarinder requested the expert group led by Dr Gagandeep Kang to submit the plan for prioritisation of 18-45 years group (vulnerable groups in high risk areas – high transmission, high mortality etc including Construction workers and Industrial workers) in its first report by April 29.

It is impossible to bring more skill and delicacy, more taste and intelligence to the choice and preparation of dishes than women have brought.” Shattering stereotypes with their game-changing performance in a male-dominated world, women entrepreneurs of Chandigarh are increasing taking up leadership roles in the food and beverage industry. These women are not only changing the tricity’s dining culture with their entrepreneurial, pioneering and culinary skills, but are also coming up with dynamic solutions to the challenges the industry faces amid the Covid-19 pandemic. We spoke to some such women in the tricity about their journey so far and the challenges ahead. THE STARTERS “My mom started a little bakery when I was a year old. That inspired me to be a pastry chef,” says Gayatri Sood, 28, of Monica’s Pudding & Pies. Brooklyn Central’s Annu Bains, 56, says she didn’t really have any plans to join the industry as she’s an interior architect, but it was destiny that took her on the path of hospitality. For Puja Aggarwal, 39, of Back to Source, it was her love to cook and feed a large number of people that made her take up this career. So Delhi Khari Baoli’s Binny Mahajan, 43, says that hospitality is in her blood. STAYING AFLOAT AMID CHALLENGES “After the lockdown and now with the second wave of Covid, the challenge our industry faces is eliminating fear from the minds of customers so that they can resume coming out to dine,” says Aggarwal. “There will be changes in terms of sanitation and infrastructure with the Covid SOP in place. It’s an added responsibility to ensure safety of our staff and customers and regain their trust,” she says. “We have seen changes in almost every field since the pandemic hit. As a bakery, we were involved in happy moments of people’s life: Birthdays, anniversaries, weddings and baby showers. But now, people are going for small gatherings,” says Sood. “Luckily, they want an equally special cake to celebrate the occasion. So, we make smaller cakes and hampers for families,” she adds. Bains says, “Covid has taken away some sheen off the restaurant industry. Lots of places have downsized or shut down world over. Staying afloat is the biggest challenge.” “We are laying stress on following Covid prevention protocol for the staff and the customers. We have stopped giving out hard copies and have switched to digital menus with QR codes,” she says, adding, “With the vaccine drive in place, we are hoping for normalcy to return soon.” UPGRADE, UPDATE, ADAPT Mahajan believes that Covid has made lasting changes in the way we live, work and eat. “Post-Covid, ours is the worst-hit industry. People’s eating habits have changed. Eating out is out of the question for many, especially due to the fear of contracting the virus. The joy of bonding over food and drinks is barely there since last year,” she says. “So, to survive this crisis, we have been upgrading our packaging and infrastructure because now, customers will only want to dine at places where they trust that the food served is hygienic and there’s no threat to their health and safety,” Mahajan adds. GLORIOUS LAST CHAPTER “The key to success is consistency in taste, Instagramable plating, good service, sustainable practices, innovation in the menu, and customer feedback. Also, as Danny Myers says in the book, Setting The Table: Always write a great last chapter. That’s what we endeavour to do,” says Bains. Mahajan says, “Every building needs a strong foundation; similarly, every successful working woman has a strong family support. My pillars are my husband, in-laws, sister and my kids. My children are my problem-solvers. Today’s kids come up with such unique and easy solutions to challenges that it amazes me. Above all, constantly pushing yourself to do better is a must.” “It’s important to maintain quality. We keep reviewing our products to suit the requirement,” says Sood. For Aggarwal, “Giving your 100% to the job at hand, and using best quality and natural ingredients while cooking lead to long-term success. Whenever you serve others or cook for them, it should be a manifestation of what you expect others to serve you. That way, you’re bound to be satisfied with your work, get noticed, and flourish.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarhs-women-entrepreneurs-serving-hope-bouncing-back-amid-pandemic-101619378408430.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Bombay HC rejects bail of man who fleeced couple of ₹2.53 crore||The Bombay high court (HC), while observing that though a couple had not been diligent in verifying the person to whom they were paying money on the pretext of helping a widow living in Iran and transferred her husband’s wealth of 1.8 million dollars to India, refused to grant bail to the accused who had extracted ₹2.53 crore from the couple in the name of the Iranian woman. The accused, a foreign national, who was arrested in February 2019, sought bail on the grounds that there were other accused who pocketed the money. The single bench of justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the bail application of David Markas, was informed by advocate Ashish Baraskar that his client was a foreign national but had a valid visa and all his documents were in order in the year when the alleged offence took place.Baraskar further submitted that in their complaint the couple had not mentioned the name of the applicant and he had not played any part in the offence as he did not receive anything from the spoils of the crime. In light of these submissions, Baraskar sought regular bail for his client.According to the couple, they had been to Bangkok in 2017 and on their return, the husband befriended a woman claiming to be from Iran on Facebook. The woman claimed to be an American citizen but was living in Iran after her husband had died in a war. She further convinced the man that her husband had left $1.8 million for herself and her 12-year-old son but her deceased husband’s brother was forcing her to marry him. Hence, she sought help to transfer the amount to India which the couple agreed.The couple was contacted by different people asking them to deposit various amounts to different processes and parcels sent by the Iranian woman. It was only after the couple transferred around ₹2.53 crore to various accounts mentioned by the callers and visitors to their homes, did they realise that they were being cheated.The police laid a trap when the applicant called the couple to the domestic airport to hand over ₹16 lakh for a machine they had been told about earlier.Additional public prosecutor PN Dabholkar opposed the bail application and said that the mobile phone used by the accused was the same from which the couple was contacted regularly, hence his complicity in the offence with three others could not be ruled out; therefore his bail application should be rejected.After hearing the submissions the court observed, “Undoubtedly, the informant and her husband should have been diligent and careful but the fact remains that both of them were misled and with clear deceit they were made to part with their huge amount.” The court further said, “There is no doubt that the applicant himself had called the informant to the domestic airport to collect the amount. Therefore, he is a party to the larger conspiracy of extracting money from the informant by cheating her. In light of this, the court said that as the offence was serious and as such cases were on the rise it was not granting bail to the accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-rejects-bail-of-man-who-fleeced-couple-of-2-53-crore-101619378407269.html

However, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has maintained that the situation will have to be monitored until April 30, before claiming that the decline of the second wave in the city has started. The worrying part is the number of deaths going up on weekly basis.As the testing in the week between April 18 to 24 has gone down, the positivity rate too has gone down simultaneously. The positivity rate in the first week between April 4 and 10 was around 20% that went down to around 18% between April 11 to 17, followed by around 17% between April 18 to 24.According to the state health department data, between April 4 and April 10, 69,037 cases were reported followed by 190 deaths. During the same period, 341,614 tests were conducted. Further, in the next week between April 11 and April 17, 60,506 cases were reported followed by 357 deaths. During the same period, 335,187 tests were conducted. In the last week, between April 18 and April 24, 51,128 cases were reported followed by 425 deaths. In this period 297,738 tests were conducted.During this period, the active cases went up from 73,281 on April 4 to 91,110 on April 11 and then recorded a decline to 86,443 on April 17, to 78,226, as of April 24.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Thursday said, “Although the daily number of patients in Mumbai has stabilised between 8,000 and 10,000 in the last 15 days, the next 15 days are even more important.” According to Chahal, it is only after April 30 one will be in a position to say whether the number of cases being reported in the city is witnessing a downfall or not.On Sunday, 5,498 cases were reported in the city followed by 64 deaths. This took the total case tally to 627,644 and toll to 12,790. The recovery rate in the city is 85% with 537,944 recoveries, and mortality is 2.03%. There are 75,498 active cases in the city. Dharavi reported 37 cases taking the total to 6,325.Meanwhile, Dr Shashank Joshi, said, “Whenever there is a peak, the number of deaths tends to increase. However, this all will come into control within the next two weeks. For now, we can say that the flattening of the curve has started in the city and pockets of the state. However, we do not need to be relaxed but only be prepared and cautious anticipating the third wave.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-cases-dip-is-mumbai-s-second-wave-curve-flattening-101619378347781.html

The man was booked on the complaint of a 41-year-old woman after “sexually coloured” remarks against her were posted in a WhatsApp group, of which the Gondia resident was an admin. A division bench of justice ZA Haq and justice Amit Borkar, while hearing the criminal application by Kishor Tarone, then the president of the youth wing of a political party in Gondia district, was informed by advocate Rajendra Daga that the application challenged the FIR and chargesheet registered against his client at the Arjuni-Morgaon police station and sought to set it aside. Daga submitted that as per the FIR lodged by the woman, despite being a group admin, Tarone neither removed the co-accused who posted the objectionable remarks in the group nor sought an apology from him and was thus named an abettor in the case. Tarone was booked for punishable offences for making sexually coloured remarks, sexual harassment and (abetment) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and section 67 (publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of the Information Technology Act. However, Daga submitted that there was no incriminating evidence against his and hence, the FIR should be quashed. After getting conversant with the functioning of the messaging service, the bench observed, “Once the group is created, functioning of the administrator and that of the members is at par with each other, except the power of adding or deleting members to the group. The administrator does not have power to regulate, moderate or censor the content before it is posted on the group. But, if a member of the group posts any content, which is actionable under law, such person can be held liable under relevant provisions of law.” Noting that there was no criminal liability on a group admin for members’ posts, the bench said, “In the absence of specific penal provision creating vicarious liability, an administrator of a WhatsApp group cannot be held liable for objectionable content posted by a member of a group, unless it is shown that there was common intention or pre-arranged plan acting in concert pursuant to such plan by the member and the administrator.” The bench further said, “When a person creates a WhatsApp group, they cannot be expected to presume or to have advance knowledge of the criminal acts of the member of the group.” The bench, while quashing the FIR against Tarone, noted, “In our opinion, in the facts of present case, non-removal of a member by administrator of a WhatsApp group or failure to seek apology from a member, who had posted the objectionable remark, would not amount to making sexually coloured remarks by administrator.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cant-book-whatsapp-group-admin-if-common-intent-not-proved-bombay-hc-101619378347271.html

Our daily cases are currently ranging around 5,500-6,000 with over 10 per cent positivity in the past one week,” he said. “There are already signs of stress on the health system with increased demand for oxygen. The state is also receiving persons from neighbouring states for treatment, some of whom may be relatives of our people. In such a scenario, it is important that we collectively fight the pandemic,” said the CM in a statement. Meanwhile, all malls, shops, restaurants, and markets remained shut on Sunday in the state.

Over 250 patients are admitted in hospital’s Covid care centre, and eight patients are on ventilator support.The influx of patients has increased at Rajindra hospital as people from Haryana and Delhi have started approaching the facility for Covid treatment due to shortage of beds and oxygen supply in their states. Dr RPS Sibia, Covid care in-charge, said the mortality rate is high this year as patients are approaching the hospital in an advanced and critical stage.“Most of the patients are in very critical state with 30-40%of oxygen saturation level. On Sunday, one of the patients came to the hospital 18% of oxygen level.

26-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amritsar hospitals continue to face shortage of oxygen||Even after six patients died at a private Amritsar hospital for want of oxygen on Saturday, government and private hospitals in the holy city are struggling to meet the requirement of the life-saving gas.The district administration and the health department are on toes as private hospitals in the district, which are running short of the oxygen supply, are refusing to admit the critical Covid-19 patients.Six critical patients, four of them suffering from Covid-19, died on Saturday morning after the medical oxygen supply dried up at Neelkanth Multispecialty Hospital in Amritsar. The incident has increased the hardship for the Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Amritsar, the only government-run hospital in the Punjab’s Majha region with Level-3 treatment facility, as the patient load is increasing every hour. Also, the private hospitals are referring critical patients to GMCH because of oxygen crisis. “Against the requirement of around 32 MT of oxygen per day, we are receiving only 25 to 28 MT. The private hospitals are struggling to arrange oxygen cylinders as a result of which we are asking them to refer critical patients to government hospitals,” said Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira. Khaira added, “The situation is grim as the GMCH is also struggling to meet the requirement of the medical oxygen. We are making regular requests to state health department for ensuring proper supply.”Till filing of the story, GMCH was only left with 4-5 hours of the oxygen supply while they are expecting to receive another batch of oxygen cylinders, later in the night. GMCH medical superintendent Dr KD Singh said: “The patient load is increasing in the hospital after the Saturday incident. At present, over 200 Covid-19 patients are admitted to the hospital of which over 140 are on oxygen support. Sooner or later, the others will also require oxygen supply, but we are receiving very less supply. At least 15 MT are required in the hospital daily which will gradually increase due to more admission of the Covid-19 patients.”The district administration has set up a Covid-19 civil control room at the Red Cross building where people can consult health experts in case of emergency. Also, people can visit the control room if they require oxygen cylinders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amritsar-hospitals-continue-to-face-shortage-of-oxygen-101619378107887.html

Most of these places are civic schools and other plots. “As a part of preparing for the next vaccination drive which will cater to citizens above 18 years of age, we have had a meeting, in which we have identified places for the vaccination drive. However, we have to finalise them once the guidelines from the state government are released. The guidelines shall be provided this week,” said Sandip Nimbalkar, medical officer, KDMC. The civic body also claimed that it will have to outsource people to carry out the vaccination drive to avoid a staff crunch. “We will have to outsource people to fill in the manpower required for carrying out the vaccination drive,” said Nimbalkar. Presently the KDMC is conducting the vaccination drive only at its civic centres, while the vaccination at private centres is closed due to lack of doses. The civic body received a fresh stock of 12,000 Covishield and 1,000 Covaxin doses on Sunday. On Sunday all the private centres were shut, while the civic centres were functioning. Beneficiaries, however, complained that the second dose is not available in any of the centres even after following up for one week. “I checked almost four to five centres for the second dose. It is not available anywhere. How will the civic body run the vaccination drive for those above 18 years of age?,” said Madhavi Joshi, a resident of Adharwadi in Kalyan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vax-for-18-kdmc-identifies-75-spots-for-new-centres-101619377867263.html

Why has Karnataka govt still not announced FREE VACCINATION for all? I demand that free vaccines be given to all citizens & a roll-out plan be shared asap,” Shivakumar tweeted.The statements come days before the inoculation is scheduled to open up for 18-45 age group from May 1 to help contain the surge of Covid-19 cases.The Congress has targeted Prime Minister Narendra Modi and chief minister BS Yediyurappa for their lack of preparedness to deal with the second wave.“Instead of encouraging people to get vaccinated, @BJP4India govt has created a barrier by increasing the prices of vaccines. Mr. @narendramodi, Instead of PR events like ‘Tika Utsav’, ensure free #Covid19 vaccination to everyone,” said Siddaramaiah, leader of the opposition and former chief minister said.Though Karnataka is yet to announce the vaccine strategy, the government is expected to take a call on this at a cabinet meeting scheduled on Monday. Karnataka has ordered 10 million doses of vaccine costing ₹400 crore for the first phase.“Where are the 25 MPs from @BJP4Karnataka hiding during this time of crisis? These MPs should sit in front of @PMOIndia @narendramodi’s house & demand the necessary facilities required to tackle the pandemic,” Siddaramaiah posted in a six-part post on Twitter.Vaccine makers have announced the price at which they would sell the vaccine in the open market. Serum Institute of India has said that it will charge ₹400 per Covishield dose for the state governments and ₹600 for private hospitals. Hyderabad-based vaccine major Bharat Biotech would charge ₹600 for state governments and ₹1200 for private hospitals.Siddaramaiah also hit out at the BJP for celebrating the 5-kg rice scheme announced by the Prime Minister. He said the same leaders were trying to end the Anna Bhagya, a scheme to provide 7kg free rice during his term from 2013 to 2018.“@BJP4Karnataka leaders are celebrating the 5kg free rice scheme announced by @narendramodi but the same leaders made all attempts to end #AnnaBhagya scheme which provided 7kgs of free rice. This is an example for @BJP4Karnataka’s sickness,” Siddaramaiah said.“I have always been suggesting the govt to provide 10 kgs of free rice to all distressed people till the pandemic is over @PMOIndia should immediately consider this suggestion & ensure everyone gets 10 kgs of free rice,” he said in another post.He said that the BJP government is trying to reduce the amount of rice for the poor, asking Yediyurappa to “end this injustice immediately so that poor people don’t curse you.”BJP REACTION TO BE ADDED||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/centre-created-barrier-by-hiking-covid-vaccine-prices-dk-shivakumar-101619377810407.html

There are discussions to impose a complete lockdown or not,” Shettar told reporters.Yediyurappa will chair a cabinet meeting on Monday to discuss if the state will go into a lockdown and other Covid-related issues, at least two people aware of the developments said.“We also do not want to go in for a lockdown but the situation is such that if we don’t put restrictions, the people will not come under control,” Shettar said.“Earlier we had a lockdown for three months, this is about 8-10 days and we have to break the chain,” he added.The statements come on a day when Karnataka and its capital registered 34804 and 20733 new infections, highest single-day spike,. The positivity rate in Karnataka reached almost 20% in the 24 hours on Saturday, raising concerns on the rapidly deteriorating health crisis in India’s IT capital and the rest of the state.Bengaluru accounted for 77 out of the 143 fatalities reported on Sunday.The active cases in Karnataka stood at 262,162, of which Bengaluru accounts for 180,542, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Almost all 30 districts of Karnataka reported at least a 100 new infections with just Gadag and Haveri registering 76 and 99 cases. Kodagu, the coffee growing district of Karnataka, registered 1077 new infections while Tumakuru reported 1153 cases, indicating the extent of the spread in the second wave, which is expected to peak in the first week of May. An analysis by Hindustan Times has estimated Bengaluru will report around 25,000 cases per day by the beginning of May.The Yediyurappa-led government faces criticism for making little or no preparations to deal with the surge in the second wave despite clear warnings provided by the technical advisory committee (TAC) in November last year.Though Yediyurappa had categorically denied that there would be no lockdown in Karnataka, his government has imposed lockdown-like restrictions in Bengaluru and across the state, which allow only shops and industries dealing with essential services to operate and prevent movement of people. The restrictions have added to the air of uncertainty in Karnataka and its capital as small traders, businessmen and others are unsure of when things would return to normal nor have any clarity on if the administration will provide some financial relief for the losses due to the closure.The government, in an addendum to the existing guidelines, said that the number of people allowed for a funerals and cremation will be less than five.K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health, family welfare and medical education minister, said on Sunday that the chief minister will have to take a call on announcing compensation packages, if any.The surge has also resulted in an acute shortage of hospital beds in Karnataka and Bengaluru with less than 40 intensive care unit (ICU) and those with ventilator beds available in India’s IT capital.“(The) government is mulling to set up modular ICU and ventilator beds at Victoria and other teaching hospital campuses,” Sudhakar said. He added that around 85 beds in one building on Victoria campus and 180 beds in PMSSY will be reserved for Covid. “Along with this 100-150 bed makeshift hospitals will be set up. Makeshift hospitals will also be set up on other suitable medical college hospital campuses,” he added.The minister said 5000 portable oxygen generators for Bengaluru and 1000 each for all districts will be provided. “75% of the beds in all private medical colleges will be reserved for Covid-19. 2000-3000 additional beds will be set up in makeshift units at all government hospitals within 15 days,” he said.He also added that the Centre has allocated 1,22,000 Remdesivir to the state and increased daily allocation of medical oxygen from 300 MT to 800 MT.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/karnataka-cabinet-to-take-call-on-lockdown-today-101619377748495.html

Citing the example of late American President Franklin D Roosevelt – who had steered the US to economic recovery after the Great Depression – Raut said that Modi now needs to come out of poet Rabindranath Tagore’s role and get into Roosevelt’s role. He also slammed finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman over the economy and said India needs a “new Manmohan Singh” to revive the economy. The Sena leader, in his weekly column Rokhthok, in party mouthpiece Saamana, equated the current recession to the slowdowns experienced after wars or the two World Wars. He added that the pandemic brought a dreadful recession across the globe and the economy of the country has collapsed. In an attack on PM Modi, Raut wrote: “When leaders are self-contented and self-esteemed, this is bound to happen. For the economy to speed up, we need a Manmohan Singh. PM Modi first needs to come out of the role of Rabindranath Tagore and enter the role of F Roosevelt.” Raut added that the production rate in the country has gone down. He said that people had lost jobs during the demonetisation in November 2016 and the remaining ones lost their jobs in the pandemic. The spending power has gone and the savings are kept to put food on the table in the future, he said. “In such dire situation, we have to create a new Manmohan Singh to give the reins of the country’s economy. Today, 60% of the labourers are without jobs. The national income has gone down by two-thirds, but our leaders are listless and self-contented. PM Modi is a political person and in the past few years, many economists have left him. Modi has repeatedly said that “I am a businessman” but the businessman himself is sitting with his shop shut,” Raut wrote, adding that in October 1929, when the market collapsed in the US, it led to Great Depression but the then President Herbert Hoover told the Congress that everything was “prosperous”. “A similar atmosphere is there in our country. Barring hospitals and politics, nothing is running in our country. There is shortage of logs in the crematoriums and space in burial grounds. These are not any signs of prosperity,” he said. The Sena parliamentarian said that PM Modi and Sitharaman are not talking about reviving the economy or the steps taken for it. “PM and finance minister are not uttering a work on what are they doing to bring the country out of recession. PM says that [Bengal chief minister] Mamata Banerjee will lose the Bengal election. But is this the Remdesivir required to restart the collapsed economy? Home minister Amit Shah says that Maharashtra government will collapse due to its own weight. But this too is no answer for the slowdown and unemployment. The finance minister of the country is not seen anywhere,” he said. Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) spokesperson Atul Bhatkhalkar said, “Even Uddhav Thackeray does not pay heed to Raut’s advice. Raut’s only job is to criticise Centre and Modiji day in and day out. He must have forgotten that during Manmohan Singh’s tenure India had double digit inflation. His tenure was marred with corruption charges, which now continues in the Maha vasooli sarkar. Indian economy was bouncing back, but due to the second wave that started in Maharashtra, the economy has been hit again. So instead of criticising Modi ji, Raut should advice his chief minister on how to tackle the pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/need-a-new-manmohan-singh-to-revive-economy-sanjay-raut-101619377747267.html

In Karnataka and particularly in its capital, Bengaluru, the lack of preparedness has added to the pressure on the already overstressed healthcare infrastructure, shortage in medicines and oxygen, leading to a higher number of fatalities. The BS Yediyurappa-led state government has imposed lockdown-like restrictions across the state to contain the virus. However, Dr K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s minister for health, family welfare and medical education, in an interview with Hindustan Times, said the government has got the pandemic under control. Edited excerpts What is the Covid-19 situation in the state and what measures are being taken by the government to control it? We need to make sure that positivity rate decreases by curbing a lot of activities, following Covid appropriate behaviour (CAB), especially in Bengaluru and other places where there is a higher population. The pandemic chain can be broken in 14 days of isolation and minimising activities. Pandemic has brought in a new way of life, and we should adapt to it. As a government, we should briskly vaccinate our people, which is the only way to save people from successive waves. We also augment our health infrastructure, human and medical capital like intensivist, anesthetist, nursing, para-medical and create a huge pool of human resources with students of medical and nursing colleges. We should ensure oxygen concentrators and portable machines are also bought in large numbers, which can be kept at homes or Covid care centres (CCC). All these three strategies should work parallelly to control the pandemic. The expenditure on health from governments should be not less than 8% of the GDP to build a robust health infrastructure, public awareness, better hygiene, nutritional value. It should be a holistic approach. Have the learnings from the first wave been translated into the second wave? Definitely there is preparedness this time, but not enough. The second wave spread was so fast, almost three to four times the first one. We had prepared for twice the number, but the spread is four times. No country can build the kind of infrastructure that is required for today’s pandemic. Controlling the pandemic by action is more important than treatment after getting infected. Very quickly preparedness is happening around the country. The Centre and state government will fight this out and we will handle the situation before it goes out of control. The pandemic is definitely under control in Bengaluru and Karnataka, otherwise you would have seen the queue (outside hospitals) like in other cities. That situation has never arisen even though we have the highest number of active cases. A report by the Technical Advisory Committee in November predicted the second wave in February or March. How did the government prepare from submission of reports till the onset of the second wave? We have been continuously ramping up the health infrastructure ever since the pandemic broke out last year. For example, we had two testing labs in February 2021, which has now been increased to 192. There were about 5,000 oxygenated beds in government hospitals and medical colleges, which have now been ramped up to more than 30,000, an increase of about 6 times. But the scale of this pandemic is so unprecedented that no amount of preparation is sufficient. We have witnessed this even in advanced economies like the US and the UK. The UK has had three national lockdowns so far. Did by-lections and campaigns also contribute to the spread in other districts? Last year was a tough year for the economy due to the slowdown induced by the lockdown. Just when things were returning to normalcy, we are grappling with the second wave. We can’t single out any one factor for the spread when all other activities were opened up. The mutated nature of the virus has also contributed to the increased spread of infection. The virus seems to be more contagious if not more virulent in the second wave. However, personally I am of the opinion that an autonomous institution like the Central Election Commission should take a serious call on whether it is safe and necessary to conduct elections amidst the pandemic. There are under 20 ICU/ICU-V beds remaining in Bengaluru, how do we get more as denial of treatment of critical persons is leading to higher fatalities? We have enough general beds. The problem is with the oxygenated and ICU beds, especially in Bengaluru. According to ICMR (Indian Council of Medical Research), the requirement of oxygen is higher in the second wave at 54.5% compared to 41.1% in the first. Government is preparing to set up 2,000-3,000 modular ICUs and ventilator beds at Victoria hospital campus. We have made it mandatory for all private medical college hospitals in the state to reserve 75% of the beds for Covid-19 treatment. There are about 14 medical colleges in Bengaluru alone. In total, we have about 8,382 oxygenated beds, 1,321 ICUs and 721 ventilators in Bengaluru. Thanks to quick response from the Centre, Karnataka’s daily allocation of medical oxygen has been increased from 300 MT to 800 MT. Karnataka has also been allocated 122,000 vials of remdesivir. Private hospitals have been instructed to establish step down units in collaboration with nearby hotels to ensure that hospital beds are available to those who need it. We will also be strengthening tele-consultation through Aptamitra, so that asymptomatic and mildly symptomatic people under home isolation feel confident and they do not get paranoid about finding bed. Why did the government not go in for a lockdown earlier when Karnataka and Bengaluru started posting record numbers? Government has a tough task to keep the economy running even while we keep the pandemic under check. That’s why a calibrated approach has been taken instead of complete lockdown. By your predictions, till when is this wave going to last and what is the estimated number of infections till then? Experts have opined that the infections in the state will peak by the first week of May and the second wave will slow down by the end of May. Does the state have the monetary muscle to deal with the rising cost of the pandemic? As we know all governments across the world are facing a revenue crunch due to the pandemic. But both Centre and state governments under the leadership of PM Narendra Modi and CM Yediyurappa are committed to ensure that the pandemic is defeated at all costs. The fact that the CM has already earmarked ₹400 crore to procure 10 million doses of vaccine shows the intent and commitment of our government. Could the state government have done better in handling the second wave? As I said, the scale of the second wave is unprecedented. Even countries like the US, which has a robust healthcare system and spend several times more than what we spend on healthcare, couldn’t sustain this pandemic. More than 5.7 lakh people have died in the US so far, which is 3 three times more than the casualties in India. We need to get our act together and fight this pandemic. We need to be optimistic and instill confidence among people. Spreading panic and negativity will not help. How are we preparing for subsequent waves of infections in the imminent future? Vaccination is our biggest weapon to prevent the third wave. India is the fastest country to have administered more than 140 million doses of vaccine in just 99 days. In Karnataka, we have administered about 8.5 million doses of vaccine. Since vaccine is made open to all above 18 years of age from May 1, our government will accelerate the vaccination drive to inoculate as many people as possible at the earliest. I have already spoken to industry bodies like FKCCI and CII and requested them to ensure 100% vaccination of all employees and their families.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/preparedness-not-enough-for-second-wave-of-covid-sudhakar-101619377687286.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Aurangabad bench initiates suo motu PIL on Covid-19 issues||After the principal seat of the Bombay high court (HC) at Mumbai and Nagpur took cognisance of various issues like the supply of oxygen, Remdesivir and mismanagement of the second Covid wave, the Aurangabad bench took note of several news reports related to issues of cremation of Covid-19 patients, shortage of medical oxygen and black marketeering of Remdesivir drug. The court has initiated a suo motu (on its own) public interest litigation (PIL) and will hear responses from the state on April 26.A division bench of justice Ravindra Ghuge and justice Bhalchandra Debadwar on April 22, while referring to 14 newspaper reports, observed that relatives and kin of deceased Covid-19 patients had to run from pillar to post to collect various certificates for performing the final rites of their loved ones. Hence, a single-window system for such victims should be deliberated upon.While announcing that it was initiating a suo motu PIL, the court appointed advocate Satyajeet Bora as amicus curiae and directed the central and state government, municipal commissioner and district collectors from Marathwada and north Maharashtra to be made respondents in the PIL.The court then went on to enumerate the reasons for the PIL and referred to a news report which stated that the oxygen plant in the government medical college and hospital premises in Aurangabad was likely to face an accident similar to the one at Nashik on April 21. The bench also pointed to the news report which stated that apprehensions were cast on the proposal of the divisional commissioner of the Marathwada region to allow private hospitals to erect oxygen generation plants. Another report showed that some districts in the Marathwada region were receiving only a 50% supply of medical oxygen compared to their requirements.In light of the above, the court said that it would also deal with the black marketeering of Remdesivir injections that are being sold at ₹22,000, whereas the costs range between ₹850 to ₹2,500. The HC will hear the suo motu PIL on April 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/aurangabad-bench-initiates-suo-motu-pil-on-covid-19-issues-101619377627185.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Second Oxygen Express likely to reach Kalamboli on Monday||The second Oxygen Express, a train carrying liquid oxygen, is likely to reach Maharashtra on Monday. The train coming from Gujarat is expected to reach Kalamboli railway yard of Central Railway on Monday morning. The Roll-On Roll-Off (RORO) service carrying three tankers with nearly 44 tonnes of liquid oxygen and departed from Hapa railway goods shed of Western Railway’s Rajkot division on Sunday evening. The liquid oxygen tankers for Maharashtra are coming from Reliance Industries in Jamnagar plant, Gujarat as part of Centre’s allocation. “The RORO service departed from the goods shed on Sunday evening and will reach Kalamboli railway yard on Monday morning, covering a distance of 860 kms. The tankers will then be moved to respective districts via road,” said a senior railway official. “Liquid oxygen, being a cryogenic cargo, has many limitations like maximum speed at which it can be carried, maximum acceleration and deceleration and loading restrictions like availability of liquid oxygen tankers and loading ramps. Route mapping also takes care of the maximum clearances available along the route,” read a statement from Western Railway.The first Oxygen Express departed from Kalamboli railway yard on April 19 and reached back to Nashik in Maharashtra on Saturday morning, carrying liquid oxygen from a steel plant in Visakhapatnam. Four oxygen tankers were offloaded in Nashik and then transported to oxygen plants via road. The express had first reached Nagpur in Maharashtra where it unloaded three liquid medical oxygen tankers on Friday evening. Of them, two headed for Nagpur city and one headed to Amravati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrasecond-oxygen-express-likely-to-reach-kalamboli-on-monday-101619377568831.html
26-04-2021||Chandigarh||Capt sends SOS to Centre for oxygen quota increase||With oxygen supplies in the state depleting fast, chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh on Sunday sent another SOS, the second time in two days, to Union health and family welfare minister Dr Harsh Vardhan for urgent increase in allocation of the quota. Amarinder also directed chief secretary Vini Mahajan to pursue with the central government for urgent supplies, given the serious situation, with patient load increasing due to influx from Delhi and other states, and pushing up demand for medical oxygen. The chief secretary was asked to rush urgent supplies to Amritsar, where precious lives were lost on Saturday due to shortage of oxygen. The CM sought four-hourly reports from principal secretary, industries, on the state’s hospital-wise demand-supply situation of oxygen. The CM’s second letter to the Union health minister followed the Centre’s failure to increase the allocation to Punjab as per the new allocation of liquid medical oxygen (LMO) issued on Saturday, despite his plea for enhancement to at least 250 MT of LMO per day, according to an official spokesperson. Amarinder had on Saturday requested for an increase Punjab’s liquid oxygen quota to 250 MT daily. “The situation has become very grim over last few days as our supply of LMO has not been able to meet the increased demand,” he wrote on Sunday. He said that despite his request for allocation of 250 MT of LMO per day to Punjab from outside the state, the new allocation of LMO issued on April 24 did not increase the allocation to Punjab, though allocation to other states increased substantially. He said that Punjab does not have any major LMO production capacity and is largely dependent on the supply from outside the state, thus necessitating the minister’s urgent intervention. Currently, the daily allocation of medical oxygen for Punjab from the central pool is 105 MT, excluding the production of the local ASUs which generate around 60 MT of liquid oxygen and meet requirements of various re-fillers, bottling plants and distributors. There are a few PSA plants in government hospitals (Faridkot, Jalandhar and Ludhiana) and private hospitals which cater to part of their demands and add to the pool of oxygen available for the state. The spokesperson said the daily requirement as per the present Covid caseload is around 200 MT and around 50 MT for non-Covid patients. “This is expected to rise to around 250-300 MT in the next two weeks as per the projections of case load,” the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-sends-sos-to-centre-for-oxygen-quota-increase-101619377568322.html

26-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: BMC receives 150,000 doses of Covidshield; all centres to be operational from Monday||After a shortage of vaccine doses for a week, all vaccination centres in the city are expected to remain operational starting Monday as the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has received a fresh stock of 150,000 vaccine doses on Sunday. In the coming days, the city is also expected to get vaccine vans that will be parked in several areas for carrying out vaccination drive aggressively in the city.There are 132 vaccination centres in the city, however, only around 30 vaccination centres, majorly private centres, were shut owing to running out of stock. On Sunday, a mere 38 of the total 132 vaccination centres were operational in the city, owing to a shortage of vaccine doses.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal said, “We have received 1.5 lakh stock of Covishield today. All vaccination centres in Mumbai shall be functional tomorrow. However, Covaxin will be available only at select centres for the second dose due to extremely limited existing stock.”According to BMC officials, there is a possibility that few private hospitals may not begin vaccination or start it late on Monday. This, as few private hospitals are yet to purchase the doses from BMC. The purchase process will start at 8am on tomorrow (Monday).Further, Mumbai mayor Kishori Pednekar on Sunday said that as phase three of the drive, for vaccinating those between the age of 18 to 45, starts from May 1, the BMC plans to have vaccine vans visit in several areas of the city.Pednekar said, “We are not able to conduct door-to-door vaccination for now, but we are exploring to have vaccine vans in the city. These vans will go to different areas and cover the population by vaccinating them. The ground-level workers of political parties can help the administration in getting citizens to come out and get vaccinated.”Pednekar said, “In the coming days, crowd management will be a challenge, considering vaccination for the age group between 18 to 45 will begin. Hence, in the next two days, the state government will declare its strategy, based on which, the citizens may get vaccinated after registration or appointment.”Meanwhile, on Sunday 23,419 citizens were vaccinated, of which 1,175 were healthcare workers, 1,523 were frontline workers, 9,802 were above the age of 60 years and 10,919 were between the age of 45 to 59. Overall, 2,237,283 citizens have been vaccinated so far, since January 16, 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-bmc-receives-150-000-doses-of-covidshield-all-centres-to-be-operational-from-monday-101619377507780.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Oxygen supplied on time, shifting of patients from Bhagwati Hosp deferred||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC)-run Bhagwati Hospital in Borivli went into panic mode on Sunday after its oxygen supplier did not reach on time due to a technical glitch at a facility. Owing to this, as a backup plan, the hospital authorities planned to shift few patients, out of the total 98 patients, to the Dahisar jumbo centre.According to BMC officials, the technical fault at the supplier’s end was resolved by the afternoon and oxygen was supplied in a nick of time.If the supply would have been hit, it would have affected private and civic-run hospitals in the city.According to an official from the hospital, it got four dura cylinders and had three in back up, but when the supply van did not arrive as per schedule, we had to plan a backup. However, the supply van was in before we could shift patients.Dr Shantaram Kawade, superintendent of the hospital, said, “We received four dura cylinders on Sunday evening, and more are expected to be in by tonight. Hence, we have good stock for tomorrow also. We would like to reiterate that no patients were shifted out of Bhagwati Hospital on Sunday.”Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Sunday said, “All issues relating to oxygen supply under BMC stands resolved, and the supply situation is normal.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-oxygen-supplied-on-time-shifting-of-patients-from-bhagwati-hosp-deferred-101619377388800.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Personal Finance: How to choose between SIPs and lump sum for better returns from mutual funds?||The stock market is on an upswing right now. This has prompted many investors to look at the market with a lot of anticipation. However, experts maintain that markets will soon enter a correction phase wherein prices of stocks will decline from their current peak to a level that would trend over a long period.Many investors are unsure of when or how to park money in mutual fund investments as these are market-linked and hence do not promise guaranteed returns. Mutual funds contain investments in both debt and equity. The proportion of these asset allocations decides the risk profile of the fund, thus, allowing people to decide between more risky and less risky investment options.While the choice of a mutual fund depends mostly on its past performance and the risk appetite of the investor, many are still unsure of whether they should opt for a systematic investment plan (SIP) or make a one-time investment of a lump sum. Both the investment methods have their benefits.How SIPs workThis method involves a great deal of financial commitment as the predetermined investment amount gets deducted from your savings account every month. Investing through the SIP method is simple. You just have to decide how much you wish to invest every month; it could be as low as ₹1,000 or ₹2,000. The second step is choosing the fund that you wish to invest in. Regular and forced investments will keep you invested in the fund, irrespective of the highs and lows of the market. Depending on the net asset value (NAV) of the fund on the predetermined date, a specified number of units are allotted to your name. During market downturns, when NAV is low, you benefit from more units.Sahil Arora, director of Paisabazaar.com, a virtual debt syndication services, said, “Market timing of mutual fund investments needs a sound understanding of macro-economic situations, geopolitical trends, policy impact, fundamental analysis, technical analysis, etc. Tracking these may not be an easy task for most retail investors. As SIPs ensure regular and automatic investment, opting for SIP mode will average out the investment cost during market corrections and thereby, save investors from the dilemma of timing their equity fund investments.”Investing a lump sumThis is like shopping for mutual funds when you have enough money in your hand. If you are inclined to allocate a large portion of your earnings to mutual funds or have benefited from a windfall gain that you would like to divert towards mutual funds, a lump sum investment may be the best option. All you have to do is to choose your fund(s) and decide how much you would like to invest in it. Archit Gupta, founder and CEO, ClearTax, an online e-Filing website, said, “You may invest a lump sum amount in debt mutual funds rather than equity funds. It is suitable for people looking to attain short-term financial goals. For instance, if you invest for a short time of around two to three years, the safety of the capital is vital, and debt funds are a relatively safe fixed-income investment.”Most people choose to make lump sum investments in mutual funds when the market and stock valuations are low, ie, reeling under the effect of a bearish market. This is because low NAVs of mutual funds allow them to garner more units that they can later sell when the market is high.Which one’s better?Investments in both SIPs and lump sum have their benefits. Contrary to lump sum investors who have to eye the market movement regularly, SIP investors can rest as their investments ride through the market cycle. Harshad Chetanwala, co-founder of MyWealthGrowth.com, a financial and wealth planning company, said, “Stock markets are not meant to move in a straight line, it is this volatility that creates opportunities to invest as well as create wealth over a period.”To grow wealth with time, investments must be methodical and regular. Adhil Shetty, CEO, BankBazaar, an online marketplace for financial products, said, “Compounding interest yields better results when money is saved over longer durations. If you start a SIP of ₹5,000 every month at the age of 25, at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.5%, you will have with you funds worth about ₹1 crore by the time you reach the age of 50. If you stay invested for another 5 years at the same CAGR, your corpus will double to ₹2 crore. However, if you start with the same amount and return rate of interest at the age of 35, your retirement fund will amount to only around ₹26 lakh when you hit 50.”CAGR helps evaluate returns from investments whose value rise and fall with time. Though this method cannot be used to gauge risk, it can assess how one kind of investment performs against another or against the market index.If you have the necessary market experience, lump sum investments can help you earn a sizeable corpus over time. You must wait for the market to adopt a bearish attitude during which you can invest a large amount in a lump sum and stay invested for a prolonged period. Tarun Birani Founder and CEO of TBNG Capital Advisors, a SEBI registered investment advisor, said, “If mutual fund investors make a lump sum payment, their job is to then simply periodically review the funds and hold them for a longer time horizon. For example, consider an investor who invested a sum of ₹10 lakh in a certain set of mutual funds expected to grow at a CAGR of 12%. If he remained invested for 10 years, at the end of 10 years he would have built a sizeable corpus of approximately ₹31 lakh. Now compare that with another investor who invested ₹15 lakh with the same growth assumption of 12% compound annual growth rate. However, if he remained invested only for five years, then at the end of that period, he would have built a corpus of only ₹26 lakh even though 50% more amount is being invested. Thus, the power of compounding lies in remaining invested for longer periods and thus leading to sizeable wealth creation.”The key to earning from the market is to invest when the market is low and sell when the market is high. Investors new to equity schemes can opt for SIP investments as it relieves them of the worry of having to time the market. Lump sum investments suit best those who know how to time the market accurately.Personal Finance is a weekly feature that aims to provide our readers pertinent and helpful financial information.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/personal-finance-how-to-choose-between-sips-and-lump-sum-for-better-returns-from-mutual-funds-101619377388325.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||At 832, Maharashtra sees highest deaths in a day||Maharashtra on Sunday reported its highest single-day deaths – 832 – due to Covid-19, taking the toll to 64,760. The state continued to report over 60,000 new cases for the sixth day in a row, with 66,191 fresh infections, taking the tally to 4,295,027. Nagpur’s rural areas reported the highest toll on Sunday, with 69 deaths, followed by Pune district, which comprises Pune city, its rural areas and Pimpri-Chinchwad, with 69 deaths. Solapur district reported 62 deaths. Nanded district reported 59 deaths, while Nashik district saw 57 fatalities. Yavatmal and Aurangabad districts saw 45 deaths. Ahmednagar district saw 44 deaths. Of the 832 deaths reported on Sunday, 360 occurred in the past 48 hours and 244 in the past week. The remaining 228 deaths are from the period before last week, state health department said. Health experts attribute the rise in deaths to late arrivals at the hospital. However, they maintain that the case fatality rate of the state is in control and the virus is less virulent than the first wave. Dr Subhash Salunkhe, former director general of health services in the state and advisor to the state on the Covid-19, said with sheer number of infections a large chunk of them, will land up in hospitals. “Roughly 10% of the cases usually are clinical cases. In that, there are late arrivals which make it difficult for doctors to save the person. There could be some stray cases of deaths due to oxygen shortage, but it is not the main factor.” Dr Shashank Joshi, state Covid task force member, said the sheer load on the healthcare infrastructure could hinder providing treatment to all, which could result in deaths. “The deaths, in absolute numbers have gone up, but compared to last year, our case fatality rate is lower. When you see the healthcare infrastructure clobbered, due to lack of ability to provide health-care deaths, tend to go up. It is less virulent compared to last year,” he said. Mumbai, meanwhile, continued to see a dip in daily cases, with 5,498 fresh cases on Sunday. Over the past three days, the city saw a decline in cases 7,367 (April 22), 7,199 (April 23), and 5,867 (April 24). It also reported 64 deaths, pushing death toll to 12,790. While Mumbai has shown a decline in its numbers, the rest of the state is still hovering around the 65000-mark in daily figures. The numbers in the state, excluding Mumbai, have not reduced even after the state government imposed a curfew, restricting movement of people, from April 14. Twelve days since, the state has added a whopping 775,819 cases, at a daily average of 64,651. In the first 13 days—before the curfew was imposed—the state had added 706,228 Covid-19 across the state. Dr Joshi said that while Mumbai is declining, but Maharashtra [figures] is “static”. He also pointed out that the testing capacity in Mumbai and the state has “saturated”. “Mumbai is definitely seeing a decline. Mumbai is flattening, but Maharashtra is static, but it is not growing. The testing both for Maharashtra and Mumbai has saturated. We cannot expand the testing beyond this point. Mumbai is testing between 40,000 and 50,000 daily, while Maharashtra tests about 250,000. The cases in the state have been hovering around 65,000,” Dr Joshi said. Experts believe that poor health infrastructure, inadequate following of Covid protocols, and lack of Covid-19 appropriate behaviour in parts of Maharashtra could be the reasons behind the spike. “Our testing isn’t going up, while its turnaround time has gone to two days, which is an issue. Only when we test up to 300,000 for a few days, we will know the extent of the spread; if the positivity rate continues in proportion to the higher tests, we will take more time. Another factor is that the curfew was not followed as we desired. We will wait another week to assess the situation,” said a senior health department official, requesting anonymity. Dr Joshi added that protocols are largely being followed by the people and district administration. “The geometric progression of this wave has brought in sheer numbers. People need to self-test, self-isolate, get connected with a health-care provided at the earliest and not delay their treatment. Breaking of the chain will happen.” He added that Mumbai could come out of the second wave by next month-end, while Maharashtra could take a couple of more weeks. “Mumbai probably will come out of this in about 10 days. Overall, we will see Mumbai come out [of the wave] with a thick tail by May-end. The cases in Maharashtra are expected to linger around longer. It will depend upon how it handles the testing and infrastructure ability. Maharashtra will take two to three more weeks than Mumbai,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-832-maharashtra-sees-highest-deaths-in-a-day-101619377278339.html
26-04-2021||Other||11 Kerala MPs seek CJI’s help to shift jailed journo Kappan to Delhi AIIMS||Thiruvananthapuram Eleven members of parliament (MPs) from Kerala wrote to Chief Justice of India NV Ramana on Sunday, seeking his intervention to shift Kerala-based journalist Siddique Kappan, who is jailed in Uttar Pradesh, to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi as his condition deteriorated after testing positive for Covid-19. In the letter, MPs said Kappan was admitted to the Mathura Medical College Hospital in Uttar Pradesh, where his condition was serious, and he has to be shifted to another hospital for better medical care. Earlier, Kappan’s wife Raihanath Siddique also wrote to UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath and others on Friday, pleading for their help. In the letter, she alleged that even in serious condition, the journalist was chained to the bed in the hospital, and he was denied proper medical help. She said he was suffering from many ailments including acute diabetes. “He managed to call us a couple of days ago. He told us he was chained to the hospital bed like an animal and medicines were not given to him properly. My husband is innocent, and his life is in danger,” she told HT over phone from Malappuram. Kappan, who is the secretary of the Delhi unit of Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ), along with three other alleged Popular Front of India (PFI) activists, was booked on sedition and other serious charges in Mathura on October 5 last year while they were heading to Hathras, where a 19-year-old Dalit woman was allegedly gang-raped and murdered. KUWJ had approached the Supreme Court seeking Kappan’s release from jail while terming his arrest illegal and an attempt to silence the media. Kappan was working with an online portal when he was arrested. However, Uttar Pradesh Police maintained that Kappan and the three alleged Popular Front of India activists were planning trouble in the state citing the Hathras incident. They were charged under stringent provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act and sedition for alleged criminal conspiracy to create social unrest. KUWJ had moved another plea in the Supreme Court on April 20, saying he was tested positive for Covid-9 after he collapsed in the bathroom, and he needs urgent medical care. His wife had also written to chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan and others seeking their help. A habeus corpus petition was filed on October 20 last year, but it is pending for more than six months, she said. In the letter, MPs also pointed out the inordinate delay in hearing the habeus corpus petition. Congress MP K Sudhakaran and Muslim League MP P K Kunhalikutty are among signatories of the letter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/11-kerala-mps-seek-cji-s-help-to-shift-jailed-journo-kappan-to-delhi-aiims-101619377277763.html

26-04-2021||Other||TN govt urges Centre to stop diversion of oxygen||Chennai: Chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami on Sunday wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking immediate cancellation of 80 KL (kilolitre) of liquid oxygen being diverted from the Sriperumbudur manufacturing plant in Tamil Nadu to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana. The Tamil Nadu government said that since a high number of patients are dependent on oxygen, the state would soon require 450 MT of oxygen surpassing its daily production capacity of 400 MT. As per data from the Petroleum and Explosives Safety Organisation (PESO), the consumption of oxygen in Tamil Nadu has reached 310 MT, the letter stated. Palaniswami also said the latest central medical oxygen allocation for Tamil Nadu is incorrectly fixed at 220 MT. ‘...based on this wrong allotment, 80 MT of liquid oxygen has been diverted. This is based on the wrong position that the existing oxygen consumption in Tamil Nadu is lower than the manufacturing capacity.”Palaniswami pointed out that Tamil Nadu’s active cases were higher than those of the two Telugu-speaking states and that there is “no justification” for diversion since this plant supplies oxygen to Chennai, which is the worst affected in the state. As compared to the maximum number of active cases -- 58,000 during the previous surge in 2020 -- the active caseload has already increased to over 100,000 this time, he said. As of April 24, Tamil Nadu reported 14,842 new cases taking the total to 1,066,329, of which 100,668 are active cases. Chennai accounts for the highest caseload in the state with 4,086 fresh cases.“The states to which the allotment has been made have (a) lower number of active cases than us and also have major steel industries located within their states (or) close to their states,” he said. “This needs to be immediately corrected. While Tamil Nadu has never imposed any restrictions so far and is always ready to support other states, such mandatory diversion of liquid oxygen from the needs of our state can lead to (a) major crisis in Chennai and other districts.”On Saturday, the state set up a round-the-clock helpline, 104, specifically to address oxygen shortage in hospitals and nursing homes. A green corridor along with police security would be provided for tankers carrying oxygen. “Currently we are taking supplies from four vendors in Tamil Nadu and also from Puducherry with a combined capacity of 370 MT,” said P Umanath, director, Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC). He had earlier said that the state would raise this issue of mandatory diversion with the Centre so that it doesn’t create problems in the future. Last Thursday, the state government had informed the Madras high court that there was no shortage of oxygen, adding that the 65 tonnes of oxygen being diverted wouldn’t affect the state. Tamil Nadu has a storage capacity of 1167 tonnes. As of Thursday, the government said only 250 tonnes was being used for Covid-19 treatment. Additionally, Puducherry has a production capacity of 150 tonnes. The submissions were made after the HC had taken suo motu cognizance that the Centre had diverted oxygen to other states without the consent of Tamil Nadu and on the issue of shortage of Remdesivir drug. The matter has been adjourned to Monday; the state is expected to submit more data on availability of hospital beds, oxygen, and vaccines. On Monday, the state will also file its affidavit in the Supreme Court in response to Vedanta’s petition to reopen the Sterlite Copper plant in Thoothukudi for medical oxygen production. After months of protests led by locals and activists, the state had in 2018 shut down the plant for environmental violations. A public consultation was conducted by Thoothukudi district collector Senthil Raj on Friday where people opposed re-opening of the plant. “The consultation was held only regarding the re-opening of the oxygen plant and the smelter and thermal plants would remain shut, but a majority were still against it,” said Raj. Besides environmental concerns, local residents opposed the move because on the 100th day of the protest, police had opened fire in which 13 civilians were killed in May 2018. The case is being probed by the CBI and by a one-woman retired justice Aruna Jagadeesan committee. The top court had earlier rejected Vedanta’s plea to re-open its facility for administrative purposes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/tn-govt-urges-centre-to-stop-diversion-of-oxygen-101619377213402.html

The state has been enforcing lockdown-like curbs in the last two days, suspending all activities other than essential services. Vijayan had said on Saturday that the situation was critical and the state was sitting atop a live volcano. According to the state health ministry data, after 1,26,773 samples were tested in last 24 hours, 28,469 were tested positive. Three districts reported more than 3000 cases -- Ernakulam topped with 4468 cases, Kozhikode recorded 3988 cases and Malappuram 3123. For the first time, the active caseload crossed 200,000 mark, overstretching health system at many places; the active cases stood at 2,18,893. With 30 fatalities, death toll went up to 5110. A close look at the statistics shows cases are mounting rapidly and transmission is taking place quickly. The number of intensive care unit patients is also on the rise --- on Sunday the state has 1400 critically ill patients with 420 requiring ventilator support. Experts said the state may touch a daily caseload of 50,000 overwhelming hospitals. “We have to channelise all our resources to contain infections and accelerate vaccination. We need drastic measures. Going by the present rate, cases may surge by next week,” said medical expert Dr Sreejtith N Kumar. Many hospitals now admit only serious patients and many have turned exclusive Covid hospitals. The government has asked all private hospitals to reserve 25% beds for Covid patients. As of now the state is oxygen surplus and catering to neighbouring states, officials said. “Now the state is using 79 tonne oxygen daily and supplying 74 tonne to Tamil Nadu and 30 tonne to Karnataka. There is demand from many other states, including Delhi, and we have raised the capacity,” said R Venugopal, nodal officer for medical oxygen supply. He said the state’s present production is 204 tonne and all hospitals have been strictly told to maintain their oxygen storage system properly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kerala-govt-plans-more-curbs-as-state-reports-over-28k-cases-101619377212794.html
26-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ace flautist Ravinder Singh succumbs to Covid||Tributes are pouring in from aggrieved city musicians for accomplished flautist Ravinder Singh, 76, who succumbed to Covid at a hospital in Mohali on Saturday night. As the news of his death spread, many well-known musicians took to social media, to express their grief over the loss of a great talent.Born in Lahore, he moved to India with his parents as a child . His father, the late Anant Singh Kabli, a well-known Punjabi poet, was settled in a government job in Chandigarh where Ravinder grew up. Talking about Ravinder’s rare ease with the flute, Atul Sharma, well-known music director and chairman of Chandigarh Sangeet Natak Akademi, told HT: “His was a rare talent on the flute and he learned from the best. An A- grade artist of All-India Radio (AIR) and Doordarshan, he accompanied greats like Sitara Devi, Reshma and Jagjit Singh. In spite of all this, he had rare humility.”Well-known musician-actor Kamal Tewari, said: “We were childhood friends in the fledgling city of Chandigarh and our association dates back to youth festivals. His contribution to music and his dedication was unmatched.” Veval, a well-known flautist, said: “He was my Guru and I owe the techniques on the flute I learnt to him.”Ravinder is survived by wife Tejinder Kaur and sons Kamaldeep and Sandeep Singh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ace-flautist-ravinder-singh-succumbs-to-covid-101619377212259.html
26-04-2021||Chandigarh||24X7 water supply project in Chandigarh to cost ₹151 cr more||The 24x7 water supply project in the city will now cost an additional ₹151 crore. The ambitious project, which in 2019 was pegged to cost ₹440 crore, will now cost ₹591 crore. A major chunk of the additional cost, ₹98 crore, will be financed through a European Union grant which was approved in December last year. But, the rest will have to be borne by the municipal corporation, in the form of additional loan repayments and direct costs, which ultimately, are likely to be passed on to residents as water tariff. As per the estimates approved by the MC general House in 2019, the French firm Agence Française de Development (AFD) was to give a loan of ₹380 crore for the project. This has been increased to ₹413 crore now. The original commitment of ₹60 crore by the Chandigarh Smart City Limited (CSCL) stands. But, the MC will now have to bear an additional ₹22 crore in direct costs. “We have additional components to the project, because of which the cost estimates have been revised. It includes upgrading the Kajauli water works, replacement of a total of 2-km length pipelines in different areas (in chunks) and upgrading the Sector-39 water works. In total, around ₹54 crore has been added to the total project costs,” said CSCL chief general manager NP Sharma. Notably, the AFD loan is to be repaid in 15 years with six years moratorium period. For loan repayment, as per the MC House resolution, the water tariff will have to be increased. With the loan amount increasing now, and MC to pay additional costs, there is a concern that city residents will have to shell out much higher water tariff than earlier envisaged. Residents anticipate hiked water tariff Vinod Vashisht, convener of the City Forum of Resident Welfare Organisations, said, “This will only increase the financial burden on residents. They should have first implemented the pilot project in Manimajra before starting the pan-city project. The loan will have to be ultimately be repaid by the city’s residents.” Allaying such tariff hike apprehensions, Sharma, said, “There will be no water tariff hike because of the additional costs. The hike will be as per the resolution passed by the MC House.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/24x7-water-supply-project-in-chandigarh-to-cost-151-cr-more-101619377210997.html
26-04-2021||Chandigarh||All Covid beds occupied in Haryana’s Panchkula district||The district health authorities were scrambling to make alternative arrangements after all beds dedicated to Covid-19 patients got occupied at private and government facilities in Panchkula by Sunday evening.There are 451 Covid-19 beds in Panchkula, of which 58 are with ventilators, 323 with oxygen support and 70 for patients just requiring isolation.“All beds are occupied. We had vacant beds till morning, but all got filled by the evening,” said Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula.Also read: No bed for critical Covid patients in MohaliKaur said around 50 beds are being added at the community health centre in Raipur Rani, while arrangements are being made for 15 beds at a private facility in Kalka and 25 in Panchkula. Meanwhile, district magistrate Mukul Kumar on Sunday directed all government and private hospitals to ensure that at least 50% of their total bed capacity in general category and 70% in ICU/ventilator category are dedicated for Covid-19 cases, with adequate availability of human resource and medical logistics.According to the order, in case of an urgent need to divert the beds, any change in the above reservation can only be made with the prior approval of the district magistrate and civil surgeon.Panchkula has seen a steep surge in the pandemic this month, with 6,076 cases and 29 deaths, which account for 30% and 15% of the total tally, respectively, since the outbreak. The civil surgeon said that at least 50% Covid-19 patients admitted to the district hospitals are from outside. “We might even request the Mohali administration to adjust our patients,” she said.Chandigarh is better placed amid crisis
26-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh airport footfall drops by 50%||Amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the region, the footfall at Chandigarh International Airport has dropped by 50%. Even as the summer schedule that came into force on March 28 had listed 47 flights instead of 38 operating during the winter, most airlines have curtailed their operations and only 29 flights are taking off at present. Consequently, the number of daily fliers has gone down from around 7,000 in March to 3,500 in April. Before the pandemic, the airport was recording a footfall of 12,000, both at arrivals and departures, daily.Ajay Bhardwaj, chief executive officer of the airport, said: “Most of the airlines have reduced their flights, and in April only 29 are operating. The footfall has dropped to 50%. Last year, we incurred a loss of nearly ₹40 crore on various accounts due to the pandemic and lockdown.”Vaneet Sharma, director, Sheetal Travels, Sector 17, said: “People are only travelling for work, while families that had planned vacations have either cancelled or deferred their trips due to the second Covid-19 wave.” Amid a drop in demand, even the last-minute fares of popular domestic sectors have gone down by 10-15%, he said.The airport incurred heavy losses during the lockdown in 2020. Its main source of earnings is the aeronautical revenue, wherein it charges ₹800 per passenger from the airlines. For instance, a Delhi-bound flight with 80% occupancy fetches about ₹65,000 to the airport. The other sources of revenue are retail shops, office spaces, vehicle parking, and advertisements. Only Sharjah flight passengers being testedAt present, the Mohali health authorities are only testing international passengers for Covid-19 at the airport. While the Dubai flight has not resumed, only Sharjah flight is being operated, that too just twice a week.Harmandeep Kaur, nodal officer for Covid-19 in Mohali, said: “We are testing only international passengers, twice a week. Domestic passengers are randomly tested at times, but not on a regular basis.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-airport-footfall-drops-by-50-101619377027719.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra may import 25,000 tonnes of oxygen||Amid the shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir in Maharashtra, the state health department has put up a proposal to import 25,000 tonnes of oxygen and 10 lakh vials of Remdesivir, an antiviral drug. The health department officials said that as the number of Covid cases are increasing, they want to keep oxygen and the drug stock ready. Besides that, the state also wants to import oxygen tankers and concentrators.While Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has alleged a lack of or delayed assistance from the Centre to Maharashtra in its fight against Covid-19, Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) on Sunday claimed that the state government has not set up oxygen generation plants from the sum allocated to Maharashtra from PM Cares funds.BJP legislator Prasad Lad said that had the state added these plants, the shortage of oxygen would not have been acute and some lives would have been saved.“We have sent a proposal to the chief secretary (Sitaram Kunte) to import 25,000 tonnes of oxygen, 10 lakh Remdesivir, oxygen tankers, and oxygen concentrators. A decision on this will be taken by the high-power committee by Monday,” confirmed N Ramaswami, commissioner, health services (Maharashtra).With 1,750 metric tonnes of supply there is no shortage of oxygen in the state as of now, chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said. “The state produces 1,250 metric tonnes and is getting 500 metric tonnes of oxygen from the allocation made by the central government. Though we are utilising the entire stock, there is no shortage of oxygen in the state as of now.”Meanwhile, former chief minister and leader of Opposition Devendra Fadnavis said that the Centre has increased its supply of oxygen to the state to 1,784 metric tonnes. Till last week, the supply was 1,661 metric tonnes. “Thank you Hon PM @narendramodi ji for such strong support to citizens of Maharashtra. Maharashtra got allotment of 1784 MT oxygen supply which is more than double as compared to any of the major states including Gujarat, UP, Karnataka, MP,” Fadnavis said in a tweet.He shared the information in response to MVA allegations that the Centre has been allocating less oxygen supply than what is required by the state. As the BJP and the MVA spar over oxygen supply, the Centre allocated funds to set up 551 Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) medical oxygen generation plants inside public health facilities in the country. Earlier, the Centre had released ₹201.58 crore to set up 162 dedicated oxygen plants in government hospitals.While speaking to the media on Sunday, Lad slammed the Thackeray government on various issues including handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. “Modi government had in January 2021 released ₹201 crore to set up 10 oxygen plants in Maharashtra. Five months on, the state government could not even utilise it properly when the oxygen is much needed to treat the Covid-19 patients. The question arises here, Has the fund released for the oxygen plants been siphoned off by this extortionist government?” he questioned.Countering Lad’s claim, Congress spokesperson Sachin Sawant said that no funds were given by the Centre to MVA. Instead, the installation was to be done by the engineers of the appointed agency by the Centre. “BJP is the biggest liar party. Let us expose this blatant lie. No funds were given by GOI to MVA government; agency [was] finalized by GOI. Machines supplied after 5th April 2021 on different dates. Installation is done by the engineer of the agency appointed by GOI. State govt has no role but still, BJP has audacity to level false allegations. Modi govt has clarified that out of 162 plants only 33 commissioned. Now they have declared additional 551plants. Only Modi ji knows their fate (sic.),” Sawant said in a series of tweets.Meanwhile, state urban development minister Eknath Shinde has taken the initiative to set up 14 oxygen generating plants in local bodies falling under the Mumbai Metropolitan Region. These plants will be operational in the next few days in Thane, Kalyan Dombivali, Bhiwandi, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, Badlapur, Mira Bhayander, Vasai Virar, Navi Mumbai and Panvel Municipal Corporations, said Shinde. The oxygen plants are expected to add 2 metric tonnes of production daily, which can support 200 beds daily.The administration will replicate the Pressure Swing Absorption Technology (PSA) technology which has been successfully adopted by the district authorities of Gadhinglaj town in Kolhapur district and other parts of the state and country to generate oxygen directly from atmospheric air.Considering the oxygen requirement in MMR, three plants have been started in the Thane civic region, two each in Kalyan Dombivali and Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation areas and one each in Bhiwandi, Ulhasnagar, Ambernath, Badlapur, Mira Bhayander, Vasai Virar and Panvel.Once operational, the plant will not only eliminate the hospitals’ complete dependence on oxygen refilling companies for cylinders and tankers, it will become a personal asset of the civic body to treat Covid-19 patients and also for other cases of respiratory illness in future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-may-import-25-000-tonnes-of-oxygen-101619377028271.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Researchers document 150 Warli shrines dedicated to big cats||Wildlife researchers documented the presence of a total of 150 shrines dedicated to Waghoba — the Warli deity representing big cats — across Mumbai (suburban), Thane and Palghar districts. The term Waghoba comes from the Marathi word “wagh” (tiger and/or leopard), and “ba” (a suffix denoting respect, usually for the elderly).These findings build on existing research published in 2018 which had recorded the presence of 20 Waghoba shrines in and around Mumbai, largely in Aarey Colony. Some shrines have also been documented in Goa, Gujarat, Pune and south Maharashtra. So far, a total of 176 such Waghoba shrines have been documented across this larger region, though several others are sure to exist, researchers believe.The new research paper, which is yet to be published, titled Sharing Spaces and Entanglements with Big Cats: The Warli and their Waghoba in Maharashtra was helmed by first authors Ramya Nair and Dhee of Wildlife Conservation Society, India. Over six months between November 2018 and April 2019, Nair and team travelled approximately 2,125kms to villages in Dahanu, Palghar, Talasari, Boisar, Vasai, Wada and Jawhar in pursuit of these artefacts.Crucially, Nair said, this led her to personally discover the vast extent of the Waghoba myth (geographically and culturally) in northwest Maharashtra. Nair and her colleagues also found that reverence for Waghoba was more prevalent in multi-use landscapes, where indigenous and even urbanising populations share space with leopards, than in protected areas (like Sanjay Gandhi National Park (SGNP) and Tungareshwar Wildlife Sanctuary (TWLS).“We were honestly a bit surprised. Nearly every Warli village we visited had at least one Waghoba shrine where prayers were being offered regularly,” said Nair, whose work also identifies at least four other Indigenous groups — namely Mahadeo Kolis, Malhar Kolis, Thakkers and Dublas — in the study area who also worship Waghoba.Though documented as a powerful cultural and social institution in the community, the concept of Waghoba (and the broader Warli cosmology) does not figure prominently in conservation literature. But through an ethnographic rather than ecological approach, this study affirms mounds of anecdotal evidence, scientific inquiry and media reports about leopards (and even tigers) in the study area. The last tiger sighting in the selected region, the authors pointed out, dates back to 2003.But modern taxonomy — with its focus on separation of species — may not account for how the Warlis who live in the closest proximity to these big cats perceive them. For example, Nair explains, “These areas were historically home range to both tigers and leopards, though today in a large part of these areas, only leopards remain. For people in such communities, biodiversity may be perceived as a whole rather than through the eyes of modern taxonomy, resulting in both the tiger and leopard being referred to as wagh.”Mainstream conservation literature, for its part, also abides by the theory that predators (like lions and tigers) originally ate wild animals in their natural habitat, and then transitioned to hunting livestock. This also perpetuates the view that “livestock depredation is a new phenomenon that we have just had to start making sense of”. But the Warli belief system, particularly that of Waghoba which is rooted as much in the human-livestock equation as the human-wildlife one, pre-dates mainstream conflict discourse “by at least a few hundred years”.In as much, the paper suggests, a purely biological approach to leopard conservation within the study area would have inherent limitations. Conservation need not follow only a “techno-managerial” approach, it argues, but can also rely on “socio-cultural drivers” of coexistence.“When conservationists focus on only the ecological aspects of conservation without engaging with its social dimensions, it leaves local communities (who face direct impacts) feeling neglected and often pitted against the species being conserved… This can perhaps result in uncooperative responses... Acknowledging these beliefs and integrating them into bureaucratic practices lends these communities the respect and justice they deserve,” the authors note.Information was gathered for this study using three methods. The first included tracking down individual shrines, geo-tagging and photographing them, and analysing their iconography. The visuals that the authors discovered were predominantly that of “a feline under the sun and moon, carved on either stone or wood (specifically teakwood) slabs covered with a bright vermillion paste”.“Some participants explained that the sun and moon symbolised energy. Many villages had Waghoba shrines built at the entrance of the village indicating that Waghoba might be considered as a gatekeeper, protecting the entire village,” the authors noted.The second approach involved semi-structured interviews with 34 individuals and gathering information through “snowball sampling”, an interview method commonly used in sociology and cultural studies. Both Warli and non-Warli subjects were interviewed, largely elderly or middle-aged men.“Even though we also aimed to interview women, many factors restricted this,” the study clarifies.Researchers also gathered information using “participation observation”, using “direct observations, group discussions, and off-the-record conversations”. For example, first-hand observations recorded (mainly by Nair) at annual Waghbaras or Wagh festival celebrations at three locations have also been interpreted to arrive at the study’s conclusions.Held annually as an appeasement for Waghoba, Waghbaras festivities typically take place on the day of Vasu Baras, which marks the first day of Diwali on the Hindu lunar calendar. The occasion, as observed by researchers, can last up to two days, and are marked by ritual animal sacrifice, shamanic rituals, feasting, singing and dance.“Participant observations revealed that members of the community who have converted or expanded their religious beliefs continue to worship Waghoba as one of their chief deities and take part in Waghbaras festival. This indicates that Waghoba is not just a deity who is worshipped within the confines of one belief system but is an integral part of the cultural fabric, entwined with the traditions and social life of this landscape,” the study notes.The larger dominant narrative of Waghoba is one of a protector who is prayed to for protection from human-animal conflict, as well as disease and other natural disasters. “Participants spoke of the wagh as the junglacha raja (king of the jungle). One participant also called Waghoba the main boss,” the authors noted, highlighting that these perceptions stem from a mix of fear and awe.Another oral tradition which lends credence to the notion of Waghoba as a protector is the anecdote of leopards following people back home in the dark. “This narrative is present not only in our study site but also in other parts of India and South Asia,” states the study.“The thing to remember is that the idea of Waghoba is in fact born out of conflict,” Nair emphasises. But, as her research reveals, Waghoba also embodies the trust that indigenous populations wilfully place in the animal (and in nature) — a necessary prerequisite to establishing co-existence.One of the study’s interviewees, quoted in the paper, said, “About 35 years ago, my father was going to my mother’s village before they got married by road, on foot. He saw a wagh right in front of him. Now what do you do in these situations? The person cannot attack it, right? So my father said, “If you are going to eat me then go ahead. You are our god.” Then he closed his eyes. The wagh just walked away, did not do anything.”BOX:Waghoba origin story:The Waghoba does not have one single origin story but a common thread uncovered through interviews. It involves a woman who gives birth to a baby out of wedlock. The child shape-shifts into a tiger and eats livestock of the village. When the villagers decided to kill the animal, the mother asked that her child be sent to the forest. In exchange, people would install shrines for the wagh and give an offering once a year. While some participants, especially shamans, shared elaborate origin stories, most of the other participants narrated fragments of these stories, containing similar underlying beliefs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtraresearchers-document-150-warli-shrines-dedicated-to-big-cats-101619376848278.html
26-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh tricity area’s daily Covid count again goes past 2,000||The number of Covid-19 cases being recorded daily in the tricity went past the 2,000 mark once again on Sunday, with 2,010 people testing positive for the virus. As many as 893 cases surfaced in Mohali, followed by 749 in Chandigarh and 368 in Panchkula.The tricity had recorded 2,000+ cases for the first time on Thursday (2,024), which went up to a record 2,201 on Friday. However, Saturday saw a dip with 1,765 cases.In terms of deaths, there was a dip on Sunday, as 10 patients succumbed to the virus in the tricity, down from a record 14 on Saturday. Mohali continued to report bulk of the fatalities, with five on Sunday, followed by three in Panchkula and two in Chandigarh.Chandigarh had reported record 828 cases on Friday, while Mohali and Panchkula had logged their all-time high on Thursday, with 931 and 459 cases, respectively. During the second wave, Chandigarh and Panchkula have reported a maximum of four deaths in a day, while Mohali hit an all-time high of 11 on Saturday.Amid a surge in both cases and deaths, which took their total to 41,862 and 545, respectively, Mohali district also had some positive news with 932 people being cured and discharged on Sunday. It brought the number of active cases down to 7,998 while taking the total number of recoveries to 33,319 (79.6%).In Chandigarh, the death two men, aged 31 and 51, from Sector 32 and Daria, respectively, took the toll to 435.Of 38,692 cases reported so far, 33,021 (85.3%) have been cured while 5,236 remain active. At 19.7%, the positivity rate on Sunday continued to be on the higher side.In Panchkula, though 666 people have tested positive in the past 24 hours, only 368 were confirmed to be locals by the night. Addresses of others will be verified on Monday, said the health authorities. Those found positive included 34 personnel of paramilitary forces.Meanwhile, three women, aged 60, 66 and 80, succumbed to the virus. All belonged to rural belts of the district. As many as 19,105 people have tested positive in the district so far, of whom 16,297 (85.3%) have been cured, 183 have died and 2,625 are still battling the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-tricity-area-s-daily-covid-count-again-goes-past-2000-101619376847725.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Change in ‘course’ of action: Rise in students applying to foreign varsities||On Thursday, 17-year-old Bengaluru resident Praajna GB received a conditional offer from the University of British Columbia, Canada, for admission to its Bachelors of Applied Sciences course. Almost a month ago, he received a similar offer from University of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Both offers will stand only if he secures a certain score in his class 12 board exams. However, on April 14, Union education minister Ramesh Pokhriyal announced that Class 12 board examinations for CBSE students would be deferred till June in light of the exponential rise of cases.On June 1, the ministry will review the situation and announce fresh dates for the exams that were earlier scheduled to be held from May 4 to June 14. Praajna is now unsure if he can make it to either of the universities for the fall session that starts in August. “I am watching the news constantly,” said Praajna. iSchoolConnect, an artificial-intelligence-powered digital platform that facilitates university admissions around the globe, has registered a spike in the number of inquiries for study abroad, its head of Alliances and Marketing Vaibhav Gupta said. “While earlier, we courted around 5,000 inquiries about admissions a month on an average, they’ve climbed to 10,000 inquiries now,” he said.OnCourse Vantage Pvt Ltd, an education consulting and test-prep company that guides students with applications, also reported a similar trend, chief executive officer and co-founder Alisha Mashruwala Daswani said. “This spike can be attributed to two factors. Last year as Covid-19 cases surged and travel restrictions were imposed by countries, many prospective students decided to defer their admission by a year. Another reason could be that with uncertainties over admission and entrance exam schedules in India, students want to keep their options open and are applying abroad,” she said. Last year, most universities around the world struggled to fill their foreign student quotas as travel restrictions and uncertainty over classes made prospective students defer their plans. To attract more international students, universities are now waiving off application fees, lowering their criteria for standardised entrance tests or even doing away with tests altogether and offering scholarships, making it relatively easier to apply. Admissions to universities in most countries are based on marks secured in standardised tests such as the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT) for business administration courses and Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) for science and technology courses. Additionally, prospective students may be required to take language proficiency tests such as Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL). “Many universities in the United States of America, including the one I secured admission in, have relaxed their entry criteria. Some have waived off GRE scores or reduced the minimum score to attract more students,” said 30-year-old Yash Nayak from Bhilai, who graduated as a civil engineer in 2013. Having secured admission in the State University of New York at Buffalo for a Master of Science in Management Information Systems, Nayak aims to join the fall session. While study abroad is a preferred choice among those wishing to pursue higher education such as Masters and postdoctoral work, this year, many prospective students are applying for undergraduate courses, too, owing to ambiguity over admission schedules in India. Last year, common entrance exams such as the Joint Entrance Exam (JEE) and National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET) were delayed by several months; this year, too, they have been deferred. NEET-UG, usually conducted in May, is scheduled to take place in August this year. The third session of JEE Mains was scheduled to take place in the last week of April but has now been postponed indefinitely. Maharashtra common entrance test (CET) cell has not yet announced registrations for entrance exams to professional courses, which would usually be held in the month of May. “As cases are rising every day, many parents have expressed concern about delays in entrance exams for admissions to undergraduate courses. They are worried their ward will lose precious time waiting for admissions to begin in India. Meanwhile, most universities abroad have been able to stick to their timelines and parents find it a more pragmatic option,” said Gupta. While the pandemic has made it slightly easy for Indians to apply for and secure a seat in a foreign university, physically making it to the campus continues to remain a challenge as the Covid-19 pandemic has so far affected more than 145 million people across the globe, as on Sunday.Growing anxiety over travel plans Nayak has been trying to schedule a visa appointment with the US embassy for weeks now with no luck. “The embassies in New Delhi and Mumbai are shut because of the lockdown. There are very few slots available for visa appointments and they get booked very fast. Most of my time is spent online keeping track of the slots,” he said. Nayak, like many such students, doesn’t want to take the course online. “I am applying to a foreign university to get world-class, hands-on training. I am investing a considerable amount for this through my fees, for which I am taking a loan. I don’t think online classes can match up the experience one has on campus,” he said. Sakhi Dua, 26, had applied to six universities in the US last year for pursuing MBA in finance. After delaying her plan by a year due to the lockdown situation, Dua is now worried she may end up losing another year. “The universities are still contemplating hybrid course-plan (mix of online and offline) for the first-year batch, but that defeats the purpose of applying for the course altogether,” said Dua, a Mumbai resident, who is currently working with a multi-national company. She has already decided to opt for the February-intake session instead of the September session in the hopes that the situation would have improved by then. “My friends, who got admission last year, are currently attending online lectures, and are facing a lot of trouble due to the time difference. If the situation doesn’t change, I might opt for a one-year certificate course in a foreign language in India and opt for my Masters course only next year, when hopefully the situation will be back to normal,” said Anuj Patel, 23, who wants to pursue a degree in Data Science in London. Most universities in the US have made it mandatory for students to take both vaccinations before coming to campus, making Indian students worry about their turn to get the jab. Although the Centre recently opened up vaccination to all adults, those between the ages of 18 to 45 can only get the jab once states procure them from vaccine makers, in India and abroad. “Many universities in the US are now asking students to come to campus and get the vaccine there,” Gupta said. As countries such as Australia, New Zealand, Canada and Singapore put India on a ‘red list’ that restricts travel from here to these countries, students have another reason to worry. Ayush, a 28-year-old from Mumbai, was admitted to the Parsons School of Design for a Masters course in Strategic Design Management in New York last year. Having completed his first year online, he intends to fly to New York ahead of the classes in the fall semester. “My visa appointment keeps getting cancelled and there is no certainty of flights,” said Ayush. Aviraj Singh, 27, had secured admission for the February session this year for a master course in Data Science at RMIT University in Melbourne. Unable to go to campus, Singh is now taking online classes. “Since the pandemic seems to be severe in many parts of the world still, it looks like my entire year will be spent online. The point of attending an MBA programme in Australia was to be able to pursue internships between semesters and gain work experience there but now, I’m stuck at my home attending lectures, which defeats the purpose of joining this course in the first place,” said Singh. Student-run portal to help aspirants with applications A group of Indian students studying in various foreign universities in different parts of the world have come together to help students who wish to get help with the application process to these institutes. Founded by Devika Ghosal, a student of the University of Warwick, and Yash Gulati, a student of Queen Mary University of London, Inforens is an online platform that connects aspirants to existing students and helps them with their applications free of cost. Both Ghosal and Gulati are the first generation of students in their family to study abroad and wanted to help many like them reach good universities without having to shell out a lot of money. “A lot of money is being charged by private educational consultants, so only rich people reach up to them. Talented students, who have skills but are not rich, don’t even dream to go abroad for education so we want to change this and help them get scholarships in good universities across the world,” said Gulati.With the pandemic and the resultant restrictions around the globe, Gulati said the entire university experience has changed, as institutes have adopted a blended approach that is likely to continue to some extent even in the future. “While in-person teaching is likely to start as soon as the pandemic settles, universities will continue to use online examinations, programmes, etc to allow flexibility to the teaching faculty as well as students. Thus, international students can use this as an advantage as they have more time and flexibility to focus on career development, job applications, or future planning,”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/change-in-course-of-action-rise-in-students-applying-to-foreign-varsities-101619376667232.html
26-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Activists offer ₹15,000 reward for info on animal attackers||On Saturday evening, Bandra police registered a case against an unidentified serial killer of animals for allegedly mutilating six cats since March 24. Animal activists have also announced a reward of ₹15,000 for information about the accused. The case was filed based on a complaint by an employee of Dr Jyotsna Changrani, a resident of Perry Cross Road in Bandra (West), who said she has been feeding street animals since the past 10 years and it is for the first time that she noticed six cats injured on the mouth and jaws, which appear to be done deliberately. According to Changrani, three of the six cats have succumbed to injuries.Changrani’s employee Shaam Kevat, 40, who feeds around 130 cats and dogs in the vicinity, said the first incident took place on March 24. When he went to feed the cats, he saw that a cat, named Lockdown, was brutally beaten up and had injuries on his mouth. Kevat took the cat to the local veterinary, but the cat died shortly. The second incident took place on the same day with another cat sustaining injuries.The third incident and fourth incidents were reported on April 18. One of the two cats succumbed to the injuries on April 22. After two more such incidents on April 22 and on Saturday (April 24), Dr Changrani approached Bandra police to file a complaint under section 11 of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960.“We want to create awareness among Bandra residents to keep a lookout for the animals around them and people who take out their frustration and anger on mute and helpless animals,” said Vijay Mohnani, an animal activist. Mohnani said they are trying to help the police in nabbing the accused as fast as they can, to protect other animals. “We know police personnel are overworked in enforcing the lockdown, so we want to help them in catching this serial killer,” added Mohnani.According to animal activists, brutality on animals has increased during and post lockdown last year, as at least eight animal abuse cases were registered in Mumbai every day, as compared to three to four cases daily in 2019. Last year, despite the lockdown, 886 cases were registered, with maximum cases registered after September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-activists-offer-15-000-reward-for-info-on-animal-attackers-101619376547190.html

As many as 109 people have succumbed to the virus in April alone, which accounts for 20% deaths since the outbreak last March.Also read: All Covid beds occupied in Haryana’s Panchkula districtAccording to data provided by the district authorities on Sunday evening, Mohali has 781 beds for critical patients, of which 220 are with ventilators (Level-3) and 546 with oxygen support (Level-2). While all L3 beds are occupied, only 15 L2 beds are available at the civil hospital in Phase 6.There are around 30 big private hospitals in Mohali, which has emerged as a medical tourism hub, but all have been refusing admission to critical patients after running out of beds.While none of the nine government facilities has ventilators, patients needing oxygen support are kept at only two civil hospitals, in Mohali’s Phase 6 and Dhakoli, and those needing critical care are being referred to Rajindra Hospital in Patiala, said civil surgeon Dr Adarshpal Kaur. Meanwhile, patients who are not in the need of any urgent medical attention are mostly in home isolation or admitted to Level-1 facilities.Pvt hospitals turning back patients“I took my 75-year-old mother who is suffering from Covid-19 to Fortis Hospital in Mohali, but they kept us in the emergency for a night, as they had no bed. I had to late shifted her to a private hospital in Chandigarh,” said, Simerjeet Singh Sohata, a resident of Phase 10. Abhijit Singh, zonal director of Fortis Hospital, said: “As of now, all our beds are full. We are trying to expand the capacity by Monday.” Dr Ankush Mehta, general manager, Max Hospital, said: “Our Covid-19 occupancy in 100%. We have increased our overall bed capacity from 82 to 126, but still, we don’t have any bed. We have no option, but to refuse admission to patients.”Rush from Delhi responsible: DCReassuring the public that there was no reason to panic, Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said: “The beds at private hospitals have been occupied due to rush from Delhi. We are asking all private hospitals to increase their bed capacity and reserve beds for critical patients.” Seven hospitals, which have been assessed by experts to have provided quality Covid care in the past, have been directed for compliance, he said. These are Max, Fortis, Ivy, Indus, Sohana, Grecian and Mayo. Dayalan said the 200-bed L1 facility at Chandigarh University, Gharuan, is also being upgraded to 1,000 beds, as per requirement. “As the number of patients being cured and discharged is also increasing, beds are becoming vacant. So, we have ample facilities to cater to the increasing number of cases,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-bed-for-critical-covid-patients-in-mohali-101619376488596.html

26-04-2021||Mumbai||Maha likely to provide free vaccine shots to all||Maharashtra may give free vaccine shots to all those in the 18 to 45 age group. State minority affairs minister Nawab Malik said a consensus was reached by the ministers in the last cabinet meeting that the state should give free vaccines to all in this category. He said a global tender will be called and the bidder that will provide the best vaccine at a lower price will be chosen by the state.State environment minister Aaditya Thackeray in a series of tweets, too, said the state has decided to vaccinate its citizens for free, but later deleted the tweets and apologised, adding that the official policy of vaccination will be declared by the empowered committee.Taking the nationwide vaccination drive into the next phase, the Central government allowed all those in the 18-45 age group to get vaccinated against Covid-19 from May 1. Declaring a change in its policy, it has asked the states to vaccinate this age group by procuring doses from the open market.“The issue was discussed in the state cabinet meeting and there was consensus among all the ministers that the state should give free vaccines to all those between 18-45 years of age … The state will require around 140 million vials to get this done and are planning it accordingly… deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday has said that they will call a global tender and will select the bidder that will provide the best vaccine at a lower price,” Malik said.Another NCP minister Jitendra Awhad said that they have taken a major decision of vaccinating all for free. He also deleted the tweet after a few hours. “We all had urged that the vaccine should be free for all. However, the decision has to be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” said revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat on Sunday.“The Govt of Maharashtra has decided to vaccinate its citizens free of cost. This is not something that we think of as a choice, but a duty that we consider of utmost importance: protecting the citizens from Covid,” tweeted the environment minister.“We are also ensuring that the procurement happens at the earliest so that we have ample vaccines to keep the momentum of efficient, smooth and fast vaccination of all citizens of Maharashtra. A safer Maharashtra is our way to ensure a safer India! Likewise for other States,” he added in a series of tweets.He also deleted the tweets in the next few hours and issued a clarification. “I have deleted the earlier tweet as to not cause confusion regarding the official vaccination policy of Maharashtra that would be fully ensuring fast, efficient vaccination and would leave nobody behind. The official policy of vaccination will be declared by the empowered committee and we must await its recommendation for a fair policy for all sections of society. My apologies for the confusion if it all it may have caused,” Thackeray said.The state has formed a five-member committee which has been tasked to draft a tender to purchase vaccines from global vaccine makers. Headed by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte, the committee will facilitate the process of purchasing vaccines as well as drugs like remdesivir, an antiviral drug that is part of the Covid-19 treatment protocol, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said on Saturday.The state is expected to float the global bid by early next week by taking the cabinet’s nod or the expenditure.“The decision over giving free vaccines has to be taken by the state cabinet,” said a senior official, privy to the development.Last week, Kunte had said a plan is being worked out as foreign import is now allowed and there is Bharat Biotech, we will get in touch with them. The vaccination drive for [age] 18 to 44 will start on May 1, but the stock is expected to be limited. In that age group, there are roughly 55 or 57.5 million people. So, we will require about 120 million doses, including the wastage, over a span of four to five months, depending on how soon we get the stock.Additional chief secretary of finance department Manoj Saunik, principal secretary of public health Dr Pradeep Vyas, secretary of medical education department Saurabh Vijay and principal secretary of industries department Baldev Singh will be part of the committee.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-likely-to-provide-free-vaccine-shots-to-all-101619376247187.html

26-04-2021||Pune||God’s “incognito son” who made “every jam a masterclass” bids farewell to earthly stage||PUNE The music fraternity across India set social media abuzz on Sunday as they paid rich tributes to India’s finest guitar player, Derek Julien, who died of post-Covid pneumonia at Jehangir Hospital in Pune on Sunday morning. Derek was 70 and is survived by his wife Maria and daughter Danielle.Julien was diagnosed with Covid-19 in early April and had been in the ICCU at Jehangir Hospital. The music fraternity across India rallied to support Julien and after a stoic battle, he overcame Covid and was moved to the regular ICU on April 17. His condition took a turn for the worse on April 19 and subsequent tests showed significant lung damage. Julien battled till the end, conveying his gratitude to everyone for the overwhelming support. He passed away at 1 am on April 25.Born in Mumbai on August 19, 1950, Derek Julien was instrumental in elevating jazz and blues-rock guitar playing an ethereal form of the art, holding audiences mesmerised every time he took stage. In a career spanning more than 50 years, Julien was associated with bands such as Mystiks, the legendary Waterfront, Azure Hades, Airwave, and the Dragonette Project, among others.Julien’s long-time friend, collaborator and brother-in-law, bass maestro Roger Dragonette is devastated. “The grief is so much I can’t think straight. Derek was one of God’s incognito sons. It’s been like 50 years of playing together as musicians, friends, brothers, right from Waterfront days - it’s heartbreaking. Something in me has died. I am totally lost now,” Dragonette said.Music composer, producer and guitar player Koco of Agnee, expressed dismay over Derek’s passing. “It’s truly, truly sad that we had to lose him to Covid. I have worked with him, jammed with him at events. Derek was a musician and guitar player that everyone across generations respected. We were always in awe of his playing, his skillset, personality - everything. If you look at the social media tributes, he’s earned bigger riches than anyone else,” said Koco.Pune guitar genius and composer, Sanjay Joseph, currently based in Goa, was distraught at the news. “It’s a sad day bro. You think guys like Derek will live forever. Giants like Derek have done the work for all who came after. I have never heard Derek repeat himself as a musician. Every guitar player has a bag of licks they fall back on when uninspired. I have heard Derek play many, many times, and he never repeated himself. Muscle memory didn’t come into play with him - he was always in the moment. That is huge,” said Joseph.Pune-based guitarist singer and composer, Christopher Fonseca, who was in close touch with the family through Julien’s illness, told us, “I’m heartbroken and dumbfounded and still cannot accept that our dear Derek has gone. I recall his gentleness, humility and constant encouragement to us younger musicians. He never failed to compliment, advise, and even ask about your musical wellbeing… just by his presence he would make you stand up to the occasion for the fact that he enjoyed playing with you ...just makes him a bigger legend to me - every jam, rehearsal or gig with him was a masterclass.”Mukherjee is a writer, blogger and former journalist, covered the music scene in Pune, and India, extensively from 1996 till 2007.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/gods-incognito-son-who-made-every-jam-a-masterclass-101619375527140.html
26-04-2021||Chandigarh||Covid surge: Chandigarh MC increases contact tracing staff to 100||Ramping up contact tracing in the city, the municipal corporation has deployed more teams, increasing their members from 54 to 100.From the earlier 18, now there are 25 teams, each comprising four members, that aim to trace 20 people per positive case assigned to them. While this number is still lower than the 30 people per patient advocated by the Union government, MC has increased it from an average of six to 20 in a month amid the surging cases.MC commissioner KK Yadav said, “Due to the high rate of new Covid cases, we have decided to add more people and teams for contact tracing.” This is the third time in a span of one month that the MC has increased the number of teams and personnel deputed for contact tracing.In mid-March, there were only three teams with 12 members. These were increased to nine with 27 members. But, with the second wave hitting the city hard, the teams were doubled to 18 and personnel increased to 54, and now to 25 and 100, respectively.Meanwhile, the teams have been struggling to keep up with the multiplying cases. “Every day, we trace contacts of around 800 patients as the pending cases have been piling up,” said a member of one of the teams. 43 city areas get micro-containment tagAs many as 43 areas were notified as micro-containment zones in the city on Sunday. Over the last one month, the administration has declared around 250 such zones to check the spread of Covid-19 cases in the city. Among the 43 areas, four are in Sector 35; three each in Sectors 46 and 50; and two each in Sectors 10, 21, 23, 32, 36, 48 and 49. Besides, one micro-containment zone each is in Sectors 8, 11, 15, 18, 31, 38, 41, 43, 51, 52, 63, Ram Darbar, Phase 1, and Darashano Bagh, Old Indira Colony, Pipliwala Town, Morigate and Modern Housing Complex – all in Manimajra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-surge-chandigarh-mc-increases-contact-tracing-staff-to-100-101619374987932.html

26-04-2021||Gurugram||Four critically ill Covid-19 patients die as hospital runs out of oxygen||Four critically ill Covid-19 patients who were on ventilator support at Kathuria Hospital died on Sunday afternoon due to a shortage of oxygen, according to the hospital management. Staff at the hospital alleged that they had raised the alarm with the authorities concerned around 11am, but did not get the supply despite assurances.The four patients, aged between 45 and 67, died around 3pm after the oxygen cylinders ran empty. The incident also caused a furore among relatives of other patients, who rushed to industrial units to fetch oxygen from private suppliers, the hospital authorities said.Kathuria Hospital on Khandsa Road has a capacity of 30 beds, all of which are occupied by Covid-19 patients.Dr AK Kathuria, the owner of Kathuria Hospital, said that they had informed the health department and the subdivisional magistrate (SDM) concerned regarding the critical situation around 11am. “I called the health department and they asked me to contact the nodal officer and SDM concerned responsible for oxygen supply. We were assured by authorities that the oxygen supply would reach the hospital within time, but nothing happened. Around 3pm, the oxygen cylinders went empty and four critical patients lost their lives,” he said.However, officials of the district administration said that they were not informed about the shortage and there was no demand raised for supply.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram, said, “I was neither informed about the matter nor was any request made regarding the shortage. Duty magistrates were deployed and I am making further enquiries.”He said that there was ample oxygen available in the city and the same could have been supplied without any problem. Later in the evening, Garg ordered a magisterial inquiry into the matter by subdivisional magistrate Jitender Kumar.Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram said that the supply of oxygen is not the prerogative of the health department but they will probe the reasons for the death of four patients. “We will probe if the deaths were caused by lack of oxygen or any other reason. I had told the hospital management to contact the official concerned responsible for oxygen supply,” he said.Amit Shandilya, executive engineer and nodal officer for the hospital said that he was not informed about the matter by the hospital authorities. “I am on record that no message or call was made to me in this matter. If they had informed, we would have managed supply,” he said.Pradeep Kumar, subdivisional magistrate, Pataudi, said that the charge of oxygen supply management was given to another official on Saturday. “I received a call from the hospital authorities but since I was busy, I messaged them that they should raise the matter with the new in-charge of supply in the district,” he said.Kathuria alleged that the system of oxygen supply in the district was faulty. “We informed them within time and despite that, this tragedy happened. Relatives of other patients were forced to rush to get cylinder filled themselves,” he added.A relative of a patient who is admitted to the hospital said that relatives of all patients rushed to industrial areas in Manesar and Gurugram to get cylinders filled. “We ran on car and bikes as cylinders finished and lives of many were in danger,” the relative said, requesting anonymity.Kathuria said that they managed to arrange oxygen cylinders from private sources around 4pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/four-critically-ill-covid-19-patients-die-as-hospital-runs-out-of-oxygen-101619373006989.html
26-04-2021||Pune||Second dose beneficiaries struggle to get appointment for vaccine in Pune||PUNE Residents across Pune city have complained that they are unable to book a slot of their second shot of Covishield on the Co-WIN app. Senior citizens and those aged 45+, who are waiting for their second dose of Covishield are having appointments cancelled the day before.The PMC has failed to regularly provide real-time information on the availability of the second dose at the respective centres. The Co-WIN app does not show any centres in Pune city.While earlier the second dose was recommended to be given after four weeks, it has now been extended to six-eight weeks in the case of Covishield. For maximum efficacy against the virus, experts have recommended that citizens must receive both shots of the vaccine. Siddharth Shirole, MLA from Shivajinagar, earlier asked the PMC to publish a daily report of the vaccination centres with the type of vaccine available. However, the civic body does not publish a daily list. Shirole said, “I am aware that sr.citizens (&45+) who are awaiting their 2nd dose of COVISHIELD are having their appointments get cancelled the day before. Also that there is no real-time information on availability of second dose of either vaccine. I have once again urged PMC commissioner Vikram Kumar to regularly and accurately publish info of vaccination centres at-least a day in advance, so that citizens can plan, avoid the risk of visiting multiple centres and prevent creating hot-spots at walk-in centres itself.”However the inconvenience to citizens continues, One Bharati Parashar said, “Vaccination centres in Pune municipal limits are not appearing on CoWin application. The PMC should regularly update the list. I am not able to take an appointment for the second dose due to non-availability of the vaccination centre’s on the list.” Another Suyash Kulkarni said, “No Covishield slots available for next three weeks on any of the pincodes in Pune. I checked this for the second dose for my senior citizen parents. Whom do we contact?” Manish Chauhan said, “Vaccines are not properly available in Pune since yesterday. The situation seems to be slightly better in PCMC. People due for a second dose are facing problems in Pune city.”Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer said, “The irregular supply of the vaccine is also an issue. Although we do create session sites in advance for people to book due to shortage of vaccines, they are booked out. Also there are technical issues with the app. Sometimes there are appointments which show that the person has been vaccinated, but in fact they have not. In such a case we ask them to manually register themselves it at our centres.” A senior PMC officer, requesting anonymity, also said, “On Sunday morning we had only 5,000 doses in the pipeline, as in those already with the hospitals ready to be administered. We got a fresh stock of 35,000 vaccines on Sunday afternoon which we again started distributing. This new stock will last for another two days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/seniors-struggle-to-get-second-dose-of-vaccine-as-appointments-cancelled-101619361666418.html
26-04-2021||Pune||PMC, PCMC cremation count continues to belie administration’s death toll||The number of Covid-19 fatalities being cremated in Pune and neighbouring Pimpri-Chinchwad for the past two weeks, has far outnumbered the official death toll being reported by the state health department. Officials from Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) involved in monitoring the crematoria claimed that 170 bodies have been cremated each day in the past one week. Of these 170 bodies, 120, on average, are Covid victims, the official said. This is in sharp contrast to the 11 deaths that the state health department reported on Saturday in Pune city, or the 23 deaths in Pune district. The PMC on the other hand reported 55 Covid deaths in the city. On Sunday, the state health department reported 47 fatalities in Pune, while PMC reported 55 deaths.The Indian Council for Medical Research, Central Health Ministry and WHO consider the state health department’s data, which differs from numbers provided by the PMC or the district health office. Municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar denied there is mismatch in the PMC death count and cremation figures. “In the PMC report, we always show the PMC-plus-outside figures also. Cremations are happening of people who died in Pune city. “In the report we are showing the deaths of PMC residents. In our report we clarify that every day. We will check both the numbers,” said Kumar. On April 20, HT had reported that over a few days a total 150 cremations have happened in the city, of which, 100 were Covid cases. “There is an immense load on the crematoria due to Covid deaths. Daily cremations of Covid bodies have gone up to 110-120 per day. This number includes all deaths from all faiths. Bodies received from Sassoon hospital alone account for an average of 45-50 cremations per day,” said Shrinivas Kandul, head of PMCs electric department and man incharge of crematoria.Kandul is also tasked with coordination for last rites of Covid-19 bodies. In pre-Covid period, there used to be 80-90 cremations in a day, said KandulIn the past week there has been a waiting period of at least five-six hours for cremation in Pune. To ease the burden, civic body has already roped in all the 21 crematoria in city.To facilitate the process further, PMC has started an online process to issue a cremation pass to relatives of the deceased. “We are hoping this will ease the process. Earlier, all the people used to call two numbers and PMC had to note down all the details in order to issue the pass. “Now it can be filled online and a pass code is sent to a relative’s phone. They can take the body to the nearest crematorium and last rites can be performed. This has reduced the waiting period,” said Shrinivas Kandul.Numbers do not add up in PCMC The situation is no different in Pimpri-Chinchwad where out of 40 crematoria five have been allotted for cremations of Covid bodies. According to data available from PCMC administration, between April 1-24, a total of 622 patients have died due to the Covid-19 infection. Numbers coming in from crematoria paint a different picture. From April 1-24, as many as 1,820 bodies have been cremated at PCMC crematoria designated for Covid. According to registered numbers at the four dedicated Covid crematoria in PCMC – 743 bodies have been cremated at Nehru Nagar, 601 in Bhosari, 358 in Nigdi, and 118 in Sangvi; all in April.“A person who has died due to Covid is denoted by the letter ‘K’. The death is registered in the PCMC record next day, so the number of deaths registered in the crematorium register and the PCMC record varies,” said a doctor from PCMC health department, on condition of anonymity. Firms managing crematoria in PCMC limits have been feeling the load.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-pcmc-cremation-count-continues-to-belie-administration-s-death-toll-101619360826394.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||I am a true Punjabi through and through: chef Dipna Anand||Cooking is all about experimenting with flavours and pairing together ingredients, chef Dipna Anand believes. She says, “It is about making everything work together. It’s also about enjoying the experience of creating new innovative dishes and I have always found that to be quite addictive.” She grew up in London among a family of chefs and has been cooking passionately since the age of 18. The chef visited India recently and shares her secret of cooking. “I am one of these chefs who does like a little bit of fusion, however if you ‘fusionise’ something so much, it confuses the dish and over-complicates the flavours, thus when I am cooking a dish and want to give it an Indian twist, I believe in doing so by adding the maximum amount of flavour yet without muddling up tastes too much. This theory for me has always worked. A classic example is my mandarin cheesecake which is lightly spiced with spices such as green cardamom and fennel and the flavours work wonders together,” says Anand. The chef won National award from The British Nutrition foundation for The Best Food Technology project in the country. She says, “The project focussed on low fat Indian cooking aimed at people who had heart disease or were trying to control their diet. I wanted to prove that Indian food could be tasty without causing strain on the waistline and problems to your health and by doing this project I did just that. My award winning dish in the project was soya and aalu stuffed giant flat masala mushrooms. A baked dish stuffed with a masala flavoured soya and potato mix, packed full of flavoursome spices giving the dish taste and added health benefits that our Indian spices give. In the project I experiment curry dishes also, for example managed to make a low calorie chicken tikka masala, a few Indian vegetarian dishes and also a few dessert dishes. I chose to carry out this project as my dad had suffered a heart attack during that time and this was due to his diet.” The chef’s father was born in Kenya and her grandparents were from Gujranwala, now in Pakistan. “My grandfather, Bishen Dass Anand was known as the king of all chefs. A true Punjabi and a master at his game. My grandfather passed his Punjabi roots and recipe on to my father and in turn my father has passed those down to me. It’s fair to say cooking is therefore in my blood and that I am a true Punjabi through and through. My specialist area as a chef is Punjabi food and our restaurant in Southall in UK which was established in 1975 is known to serve some of the best Punjabi food in the country. We were recently awarded the ITV Food and Drink Award for Best Family run restaurant in the UK.” Celebs love to visit Anand’s restaurant. “We have been fortunate to have many celebrity guests and public figures dine at our restaurant including Bollywood and Hollywood celebs, Royalty, Political Figures and Sporting heroes. His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales has visited us three times. Gordon Ramsay has visited twice for two of his famous television shows and another frequent visitor is Sir Cliff Richard. Kevin Kostner has also dined at the restaurant, Ted Heath, Princess Anne and Chris Tarrant to name but a few. The late Jagjit Singh would not leave London without dining at The Brilliant and Lata Ji has also dined with us on several occasions.” Author tweets @ruchikagarg271Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/i-am-a-true-punjabi-through-and-through-chef-dipna-anand-101618911580234.html
26-04-2021||Delhi||Ramzan: A period of bonding over food||The month of Ramzan beautifully blends the spirit of fast, feast and faith. With prayers, celebrations and delicious food at its core, the holy period of joy and compassion will be more of an intimate affair this year, owing to the Covid-19 safety protocols. Staying indoors and collectively praying for the world to heal and win over this pandemic, it is also the perfect time to bond with your friends and family over food. “One is supposed to spend the month in devotion, worship and charity. I also run a daily Dastarkhan E Ramzan, where I post food recipes related to the festival along with a post on some monument related to it. Since we can’t talk about devotion as it is supposed to be personal, food becomes a topic of discussion. That is why there has always been an emphasis on food, and that’s the connection between food and Ramzan,” says historian and author, Rana Safvi.And what makes the Ramzan feasts more special is the fasting period that’s the focus of the month. Fasting during Ramzan involves not eating food or drinking water between sunrise and sunset for the entire month. “Food is an integral part of Ramzan’s traditions. Family and friends gather to share and enjoy the two meals that are served – Iftar is held at sunset when people break their fast, and Suhoor/Sehri is consumed early in the morning before the day starts,” says Indian masterchef, Sadab Qureshi, from The Westin Gurgaon. During Sehri, people usually have things that would not make them feel thirsty. Food like milk, dates, sooth pheni, eggs, fruit and vegetable salads are preferred for Sehri, while pakodas, sharbat, kabab, fritters, chole are a staple on every iftar table. The dinner consumed after is usually pretty heavy.While the core rituals and significance of Ramzan have remained unchanged, the spread of Islam over the globe gave texture and diversity to the global Ramzan experience. “Iftar, until a few years back, was more about serving the poor and consisted of three-four items to break the fast, which included dates, fruits and a simple meal. Today, it has become a grand affair,” says Qureshi. Moreover, every country and region has a particular delicacy that’s especially enjoyed during this month. Food flavours that erupt In India are stews, paaya, kormas, biryani, nihari, sheermal, keema, kaliya, zarda, haleem, shawarma, sheer kurma, seviyan, malpuas and more. “Dates are common as they contain nutritional value. Few years ago when I was in Ladakh during the month of Ramzan, I asked owner of a shop about how he opens his fast and he replied it’s usually by eating momos. For us, in UP the usual is samosa and pakodi. In South, I’m sure people would be eating idli and dosa. It is about comfort food,” says Safvi.Several food walks were conducted earlier to introduce people to Ramzan special delicacies . “Everything has changed due to the pandemic. People who love going for food walks are waiting for better days to come. I used to lead some Ramzan food walks in Old Delhi but this year, I am strictly at home and doing some restricted Iftaar dawats through our home cooked meals by our delivery kitchen,” says chef Osama Jalali, founder of The Mughal Plate by Jalalis. This year, they have Ramzan special haleeem in menu. Over the years, food patterns have also changed. “Nowadays people are more health conscious. Food items such as milk, cheese, yoghurt, eggs are being consumed, as they raise the blood sugar level slowly and also keeps an individual’s stomach full to sail through the day. As drinking water is not permitted during the day, one adds fruits with high water content in the respective meal. Fruits such as watermelon, pineapple, mangoes, plums along with dry fruits and rich salads are widely consumed,” says chef Brajesh Ghansiyal from Pracheen, India before 1947. The restaurant has curated a special menu in Ramzan that includes nihari mutton, gosht biryani, chicken korma and mutton seekh, informs Vidit Rawat of the restaurant. Seekh Kabab recipe Mutton leg 500gmginger paste 70gmgarlic peeled 70gmcoriander green chopped 15gm green chilly chopped 50gm mutton fat (minced to consistency of Keema) 100gm amul cheese grated 100gm garam masala 10gmFried onion paste 30gmdeggi mirch 40gmsalt 50gmbutter for basting 10gmBesan 3gmMethodIn a bowl mix together the mutton mince by your hands and add ginger-garlic paste to it along with onion paste, red chilli powder, coriander powder, cumin powder, powdered pepper, Butter, Mutton fat, Cheese grated and mashed salt, green chilly, fresh green coriander, Mix nicely.

26-04-2021||World||China censors Zhao’s historic Oscar win over controversial interview in 2013||Beijing-born Chloe Zhao on Monday became the first woman of colour to win the Oscar award for best director - for her film Nomadland - but the country of her birth censored the coverage of her landmark achievement, with leading Chinese state-run media ignoring the news.Beijing’s anger against Zhao stems from an interview she had given to the Filmmaker magazine in 2013 where she had said that China is “a place where there are lies everywhere”.As of late on Monday, official news agency Xinhua, national broadcaster CCTV, and the Communist Party of China’s (CPC) mouthpiece People’s Daily didn’t report on Zhao’s success at the Academy Awards. Posts on Chinese social media were blocked as well.According to a Reuters report, a livestream of the Oscars ceremony in Shanghai hosted by alumni of Zhao’s alma mater ran into China’s censors with the organiser saying access to his virtual private network (VPN) service was blocked for nearly two hours.“One of the exceedingly rare pieces of coverage, on private news site 163.com, actually used the occasion of her victory as an opportunity to not-so-subtly assert one of China’s most important - and contentious - geopolitical priorities,” Hollywood Report said in an article.Until Zhao’s 2013 remarks resurfaced recently, her work had been praised by Xinhua.“The evocative feature film, Nomadland, the latest effort by insightful Chinese female director, Chloe Zhao, is sweeping the awards circuit in the United States, putting her on the fast track for Oscar contention… Zhao has a unique vision which is serving her in good stead now,” Xinhua had written about her back in December.But state-backed opinion on her quickly changed after the interview was shared on Chinese social media.Much later on Monday, the tabloid Global Times published reports on Zhao’s victory, almost grudgingly praising her work.“No matter how much controversy Zhao previously caused in China, the nominations as well as the awards she won at the Golden Globes, Oscars and other international film festivals show her talent is great and should be praised,” Xiao Fuqiu, a film critic based in Shanghai, told the tabloid.Zhao’s acceptance speech at the Oscars showed her Chinese cultural roots when she quoted classic Chinese philosophical ethos, saying people are born with goodness and kindness within them.“The speech that Zhao gave shows the positive influence of Chinese culture and could help her win more support among Chinese moviegoers,” said Xiao.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-censors-zhao-s-historic-oscar-win-over-controversial-interview-in-2013-101619458458704.html
26-04-2021||World||US Supreme Court to take up right to carry gun for self-defense||The Supreme Court agreed on Monday to hear an appeal to expand gun rights in the United States in a New York case over the right to carry a firearm in public for self-defense.The case marks the court’s first foray into gun rights since Justice Amy Coney Barrett came on board in October, making a 6-3 conservative majority.The justices said Monday they will review a lower-court ruling that upheld New York’s restrictive gun permit law. The court's decision to take on the case follows mass shootings in recent weeks in Indiana, Georgia, Colorado and California and comes amid congressional efforts to tighten gun laws. President Joe Biden also has announced several executive actions to combat what he called an “epidemic and an international embarrassment” of gun violence in America.The case is especially significant during the coronavirus pandemic, said Eric Tirschwell, the legal director of Everytown for Gun Safety, a gun control group backed by former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg. “Gun violence has only worsened during the pandemic, and a ruling that opened the door to weakening our gun laws could make it even harder for cities and states to grapple with this public health crisis,” Tirschwell said.The court had turned down review of the issue in June, before Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s death.New York is among eight states that limit who has the right to carry a weapon in public. The others are: California, Delaware, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and Rhode Island.In the rest of the country, gun owners have little trouble legally carrying their weapons when they go out.Paul Clement, representing challengers to New York’s permit law, said the court should use the case to settle the issue once and for all. “Thus, the nation is split, with the Second Amendment alive and well in the vast middle of the nation, and those same rights disregarded near the coasts,” Clement wrote on behalf of the New York State Rifle & Pistol Association and two New York residents.Calling on the court to reject the appeal, the state said its law promotes public safety and crime reduction and neither bans people from carrying guns nor allows everyone to do so.Federal courts have largely upheld the permit limits. Last month an 11-judge panel of the federal appeals court in San Francisco rejected a challenge to Hawaii’s permit regulations in an opinion written by a conservative judge, Jay Bybee.“Our review of more than 700 years of English and American legal history reveals a strong theme: government has the power to regulate arms in the public square,” Bybee wrote in a 7-4 decision for the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals.The issue of carrying a gun for self-defense has been seen for several years as the next major step for gun rights at the Supreme Court, following decisions in 2008 and 2010 that established a nationwide right to keep a gun at home for self-defense.In June, Justice Clarence Thomas, joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, complained that rather than take on the constitutional issue, “the Court simply looks the other way.”But Barrett has a more expansive view of gun rights than Ginsburg. She wrote a dissent in 2019, when she was a judge on the federal appeals court in Chicago, that argued that a conviction for a nonviolent felony — in this case, mail fraud — shouldn’t automatically disqualify someone from owning a gun.She said that her colleagues in the majority were treating the Second Amendment as a “second-class right, subject to an entirely different body of rules than the other Bill of Rights guarantees.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-to-take-up-right-to-carry-gun-for-selfdefense-101619455775344.html
26-04-2021||World||Germany, Australia working to rush equipment, ventilators for India’s Covid-19 response||Germany and Australia are working to rush equipment such as an oxygen production plant and ventilators to India to bolster the country’s Covid-19 response in the wake of record-breaking Coronavirus infections over the past few days. The German Army will provide a large oxygen production plant and efforts are on to transport the broad-spectrum antiviral medication Remdesivir and other medicines from emergency stocks, German ambassador Walter Lindner said on Monday. The Australian government is considering donating non-invasive ventilators to India from stocks created at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, health minister Greg Hunt was quoted as saying by ABC News. The National Security Committee of Australia’s Cabinet will meet on Tuesday to finalise the assistance for India. In a separate development, Anthony Fauci, the Biden administration’s chief medical advisor, said the US could “actively consider” providing vaccines from its stock of 30 million AstraZeneca Covid-19 shots to India. On Monday, India set a global record for the rise in Coronavirus infections for the fifth consecutive day, with 352,991 cases reported since Sunday. The number of deaths too rose to an all-time high of 2,812, according to official data. Lindner said Germany understands the urgency of the situation and authorities are “working day and night” to airlift critical equipment and medical supplies to India. People across Europe have been moved by the scenes of loss emerging from India, he said. The German Army will ship a large oxygen production plant and other authorities are working to provide respirators, ventilators and huge quantities of Remdesivir and other medicines from German emergency stocks. In the private sector, Tata and Linde Group have partnered to provide more than 20 oxygen tanks to increase transport capacity between oxygen producers and Covid-19 hot spots, while more than 20 oxygen plants being purchased by the Indian side from a company in southern Germany will be airlifted by the Indian Air Force, Lindner said. Cooperation between UNICEF and Germany, which was started last year, will be intensified to provide cooling chains for vaccines, he added. Australian health minister Hunt said a specific request had been received from India for the physical supply of oxygen and authorities would check if any oxygen supplies could be donated. The government could donate non-invasive ventilators from Australia’s national stockpile that was created last year. “We are in a strong position on that front because we don’t need them [ventilators] at this point in time,” Hunt said. A cleared picture on the aid from Australia is expected after the meeting of the National Security Committee on Tuesday. Fauci told ABC News’ This Week programme that the US needs to do more to help India’s current Covid-19 response. “I don’t think you can walk away from that,” he said. He said discussions were underway “about really ramping up what we can do on the ground – oxygen supplies, drugs, tests, PPE, as well as taking the look into the intermediate and long run about how we can get vaccines to these individuals, both immediately now, as well as in the situation where you help them to be able to essentially make vaccines themselves”. Asked specifically if the Biden administration could help India with its stock of about 30 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which hasn’t been approved for use in the US, Fauci replied: “You know, I think that’s going to be something that is up for active consideration...I don’t want to be speaking for policy right now with you, but I mean, that’s something that certainly is going to be actively considered.” People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that critical equipment and supplies was coming into India as a mix of donations – such as the assistance being provided by Germany, Australia and the US – and commercial purchases, such as the oxygen tanks airlifted Singapore and United Arab Emirates. The people said China’s offer to provide support hadn’t been taken up so far, and pointed out that tweets and statements by Chinese officials about equipment being sent to India – such as a tweet from the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka about 800 oxygen concentrators airlifted from Hong Kong to New Delhi on Sunday – involved commercial purchases made by Indian firms. Chinese embassy spokesperson Wang Xiaojian said in a statement that China “will encourage and guide Chinese companies to actively cooperate with India to facilitate acquiring medical supplies”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/germany-australia-working-to-rush-equipment-ventilators-for-india-s-covid-19-response-101619456238588.html
26-04-2021||World||Myanmar junta postpones court proceedings against Aung San Suu Kyi||Myanmar's junta again postponed court proceedings against deposed leader Aung San Suu Kyi on Monday, her lawyers said as they fight for permission to visit her 12 weeks after she was detained.The country has been in turmoil since the military ousted the Nobel laureate in a February 1 coup, shunting the country back into junta rule after a brief experiment with democracy.Large swathes of the population have taken to the streets in protest, with security forces unleashing a brutal campaign to quell the massive uprising.Meanwhile Suu Kyi has been under house arrest, with the junta charging her under six cases -- including for sedition and having unlicensed walkie-talkies.But movement on her case was once again delayed until May 10, her lawyer Min Min Soe said Monday after a hearing.Twelve weeks since Suu Kyi was detained, Min Min Soe said they still have not received permission to meet their client face-to-face -- one of many hurdles the team has faced."When the judge asked (police) which stage they have reached, they replied they couldn't tell specifically," she told AFP, adding that Suu Kyi was frustrated by the slow pace."I think she is not getting access to watch news and TV. I do not think she knows the current situation happening in the country," she said.Besides not being able to meet with Suu Kyi, junta-imposed mobile data shutdowns have also prevented video-conferencing in previous hearings.The most serious charge Suu Kyi faces falls under Myanmar's official secrets law, with a hearing due in Yangon on May 6.'Eradicate the fascist army'Nationwide protests continued Monday, with demonstrators in the south holding signs that said "Free our leaders" and waving red flags emblazoned with a golden peacock -- the symbol of Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy Party.In commercial hub Yangon, dozens of protesters took part in a flash mob which lasted only 10 minutes -- a lightning-quick show of resistance to avoid confrontation with security forces.Waving a three-finger salute, they chanted "Eradicate the fascist army!"The junta has justified its power grab by claiming it is protecting democracy, alleging electoral fraud in November elections which the NLD won in a landslide.Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing had travelled to Jakarta over the weekend for a top-level meeting with the 10-country bloc of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) -- his first overseas trip since his power grab.The meeting produced a "consensus statement" that called for the cessation of violence, but stopped short of demanding a release of political prisoners.It drew condemnation from much of Myanmar's civil society -- already angered by ASEAN's invitation to the general."The statement does not include what the civilians are asking for -- respect for their basic human rights, democracy and peace," said the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP), a local monitoring group that has tracked post-coup Myanmar's escalating death toll."People in Burma are not asking for humanitarian aid, but for the international community to stand for the truth," it said, referring to Myanmar by its former name.According to AAPP's latest figures, security forces have killed more than 750 people.The junta has given a much lower death toll and blames the violence on "rioters".State-run television news on Monday night called AAPP an "illegal association", and action will be taken against it.It also reported that one member of the security forces was killed in Chin state, when their convoy was attacked by people with homemade guns.'Solve its own problems'Also present in Indonesia over the weekend was the UN special envoy to Myanmar, Christine Schraner Burgener -- who has so far been denied a visit to the country.According to UN sources, Burgener spoke with senior General Min Aung Hlaing briefly on the sidelines of the ASEAN meeting.A spokesperson from Indonesian Foreign Ministry confirmed that she was "in communication" but no further detail was provided.The special envoy had previously implored the UN Special Council to take action against the generals, warning that "a bloodbath is imminent" if the international community continues to stall.So far, western powers like the US, EU and Britain have imposed sanctions targeting military top brass and army-affiliated businesses.But Myanmar's allies Russia and China have been seen to be blocking efforts for a wider response, such as imposing an arms embargo, according to the EU foreign policy chief.On Monday Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia is following Myanmar's situation "with great attention"."However, Russia is bound by long-standing relations with Burma, and we are keen on it," he said, adding that Myanmar must "solve its own problems".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-junta-postpones-court-proceedings-against-aung-san-suu-kyi-101619455114480.html

Today, we're twice that."He said that 42 percent with one shot wasn't "enough," but added: "42% close to number at which we should see steady declines in infections. In Israel, once 45% of population was fully vaccinated, case numbers started to plummet."Experts are however worried by the vaccination rate, which peaked earlier this month at an average of more than 3 million doses per day and is now down to 2.6 million per day.Many people who wished to get vaccinated have received jabs, though some access issues persist, particularly among communities of color.On the other hand, vaccine skepticism remains high among some demographics, including political conservatives.A government survey last month found the 10 states with the largest share of people who said they definitely or probably won't get vaccinated are all conservative-leaning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-covid-19-cases-in-united-states-declining-7-day-average-goes-below-60000-101619451424363.html

Alexander Gintsburg also highlighted that the interval will not affect the immune response spurred by the vaccine and in some cases may even prolong or enhance the effect of the vaccine.“Regarding the Sputnik V vaccine designed by our Gamaleya Research Centre, we believe it is possible to increase the minimum interval between the first and second vaccine shots from the earlier approved 21 days up to three months. Extending the interval will not affect the vaccine-induced immune response, and, in some cases, will enhance and prolong it,” Ginstburg was quoted as saying in a statement released on Sputnik V’s official website. Gintsburg, however, left the decision to increase the interval of the doses on the respective national regulators.“We also believe that, given the exceptionally high demand for the vaccine among the population, this decision would significantly expedite immunization. We believe that it is up to each national regulator to decide whether to retain the 21-day interval between shots or to extend it to up to 3 months,” Gintsburg added.The research centre said that the observation was aided by the mass vaccination camps which were continuously testing data on vaccination in Russia as well as other countries. It also cited reports from the Argentine health ministry which had also witnessed results after prolonging the interval between the doses. The South American nation heavily relied on the Sputnik V vaccine as it faced difficulties in getting other vaccines, news agency Reuters reported last week.Sputnik V was also granted emergency use approval by an expert panel earlier this month. The vaccine will be used along with Covaxin and Covishield to battle the surging Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/gap-between-sputnik-v-doses-can-be-increased-say-makers-101619445514281.html

"Nazanin Zaghari was sentenced to one year in prison and a one year ban from leaving the country on charges of propaganda against the Islamic Republic," Kermani told the website.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it would be wrong to send her back to prison."I don't think it's right at all that Nazanin should be sentenced to any more time in jail," Johnson told reporters during a campaign appearance. He added that Britain was working with the United States on the issue of dual-nationals jailed in Iran.Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation charity, was arrested at a Tehran airport in April 2016 and later convicted of plotting to overthrow the clerical establishment.She was released from house arrest last month at the end of a five-year sentence, but immediately ordered back into court to face the new propaganda charges.Iran’s judiciary was not immediately available to comment about Zaghari-Ratcliffe's sentence. Kermani said he would appeal the new sentence within 21 days under Iranian law.Zaghari-Ratcliffe's family and the foundation, a charity that operates independently of media firm Thomson Reuters and its news subsidiary Reuters, deny the charges.

But the slow pace of deliveries has frustrated the Europeans and has been blamed in part for holding up the EU's vaccine rollout.European Commission spokesman Stefan De Keersmaecker said that Brussels launched the legal action against AstraZeneca last Friday “on the basis of breaches of the advance purchase agreement.”He said the reason for the legal action was that “some terms of the contract have not been respected” and that “the company has not been in a position to come up with a reliable strategy to ensure a timely delivery of doses.”AstraZeneca’s contract with the EU foresaw an initial 300 million doses for distribution among member countries, with an option for a further 100 million.But only 30 million doses were delivered in the first quarter of 2021, and the company says it can provide 70 million in the second quarter, rather than the 180 million it had promised.AstraZeneca has previously said that its contract with the EU contained vaccine delivery targets, not firm commitments, and that the company was unable to meet them because of early problems with rapidly expanding its production capacity.Last month, the Commission launched a dispute resolution mechanism aimed at amicably addressing its differences with the company. Brussels said that its focus is to ensure timely deliveries of vaccines.It since said that its option for extra AstraZeneca doses will not be taken up.Last week, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen announced that a new vaccine contract is set to be concluded with BioNTech-Pfizer for 1.8 billion doses for the 2021-23 period. She said the deal will ensure doses for booster shots, vaccines adapted to new variants, and, potentially, vaccines for children and teenagers.Von der Leyen said that the EU, home to around 450 million people, has “already passed 123 million vaccinations" and is on track to have vaccinated 70% of all adults by July. Previously the target had been September.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/european-union-initiates-legal-action-against-covid-vaccine-maker-astrazeneca-101619442550251.html
26-04-2021||World||Top Chinese cargo airline suspends flights to India||The largest cargo flight operator from China to India, the Chinese state-owned Sichuan Airlines has suspended its services to India for 15 days because of the surge in Covid-19 cases.It is likely to disrupt frantic efforts by Indian private companies to import medical supplies including oxygen concentrators to fight the pandemic from China.The suspension comes despite Beijing’s repeated offers of “support and assistance” to India to fight the pandemic.The airlines operated 10 flights on six routes to four India cities comprising Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai and Bangalore.In a letter to the sales agents on Monday, the Sichuan Chuanhang Logistics Co. Ltd, part of the Sichuan Airlines said the airline has suspended its cargo flights on all six routes - Xi’an-Delhi, Xi’an-Mumbai, Chengdu-Chennai, Chongqing-Chennai, Chengdu-Bangalore, and Chongqing-Delhi - for 15 days,The airlines said “…in the face of sudden changes in the epidemic situation (in India), in order to reduce the number of imported cases, it is decided” to suspend the flights.The airlines added the India route has “always been the core strategic route for Sichuan Airlines” but added that the Indian Covid-19 outbreak had not only caused “…a record number of deaths but also caused a surge in imported cases in China, many places in the world have grounded flights to India.”The Chinese foreign ministry, however, did not offer any comment on the suspension of cargo flights from the Chinese mainland to India.“With regard to the operation of airlines, I will refer you to the relevant airlines for more information,” foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin said when asked to comment on the development.The ministry also did not confirm or deny a tweet by the Chinese embassy in Sri Lanka, which said 800 oxygen concentrators have been airlifted from Hong Kong to Delhi with another 10,000 to be dispatched in the coming week.“800 Oxygen Concentrators have been airlifted today from #HongKong to #Delhi; 10,000 more in a week. #China is keeping in touch with #India for urgent needs. Stay Strong,” the tweet published by the Chinese embassy in Colombo early on Monday said.When asked to comment on the tweet, Wang only said: “As I said, China is willing to provide necessary support and help to India in its fight against the virus. If India raises specific demands, we will provide help and support to the best of our capability.”“We have stated that we are ready to help India fight the virus in the first opportunity available. (The) two sides are in communication regarding this,” Wang said at the ministry briefing.“China has been following closely the epidemic situation in India. We show our sincerest sympathies to the worsening situation in India,” Wang said.“About India’s readiness to buy medical supplies from China, I understand this is a commercial activity. If India raises specific demands, China is ready to provide help and support to the best of capability,” he added.To a question on three other Quad members (the US, Australia, and Japan) not helping the fourth member, India, during this crisis, Wang said countries should work together to fight the virus.“With regard to some mechanisms that you mentioned, we hope we can also follow this principle and work towards building a community with a shared future and to provide support and help to other countries in their fight (the) virus and show their true responsibilities and obligations.”Wang reiterated that the Covid-19 outbreak is a common challenge for mankind.“On this issue, countries should work together. We have to fight the virus together. We also made it clear that China stands ready to provide support and help to India in fighting coronavirus. We hope that all countries should unite as one, to defeat the virus, which is a common enemy for mankind.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-chinese-cargo-airline-suspends-flights-to-india-101619436915377.html

It took the total caseload since the pandemic first struck Nepal to 300,119, and there have so far been 3,164 deaths, according to government data."We have detected the UK variant and the double mutant variant detected in India," Krishna Prasad Paudel, the director of Nepal's Epidemiology and Disease Control Department Paudel told Reuters, adding that experts were checking for other variants too. Nepal launched its vaccination campaign in January and gave shots to 1.9 million people, all provided by India and China. But health experts feared that continuation of the vaccination drive was uncertain after officials had failed to procure more vaccine shots from India or any other source.Over 90 developing nations, including Nepal, rely on India, home to the Serum Institute, the world's largest vaccine maker, for the doses to protect their own populations, but India has now prioritised its own needs as a second wave of the epidemic there has run out of control."The virus is mutating very fast...what started in India has now entered Nepal too," said Rabindra Pandey, a public health expert, adding that if the trend continued for a week then new patients will be unable to find any beds as hospitals were already stretched.Wedged between China and India, Nepal shares a 1,751-kilometre (1,094 miles) border with its southern neighbour India. The border was closed for some time duping a lockdown last year, when the first wave of the epidemic struck, but it has since been reopened.Nepal's former king Gyanendra and his wife, who tested positive for the virus after returning from India where they attended a religious festival, were undergoing treatment at a private facility in Kathmandu."The situation is really frightening," said Prakash Thapa, a doctor at Bheri hospital in Nepalgunj, a city in the southwest plains bordering India.He said the hospital was inundated with coronavirus patients requiring intensive care and ventilators."This time even children and young people are brought in critical condition and patients are even sleeping on the floor and corridors," he said.Nepal's ruling Communist party has been embroiled in a power struggle for months, and Prime Minister K.P. Sharma Oli has been criticised for his response to the crisis.Foreign Minister Pradeep Gyawali told reporters on Sunday that despite the surge in cases a national level lockdown was not required.Nepal's economy contracted for the first time in four decades in the last fiscal year due to a months-long lockdown to contain the Covid-19 pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-infections-surge-in-nepal-fuelled-by-mutant-strains-from-india-101619430834078.html

I encourage everyone who is 44 to book an appointment to get the jab – it will protect you and your loved ones, and help put this pandemic behind us,” he said.The NHS said the decision to move to the next group of people aged between 40 and 43 will be set out in the coming days with the NHS vaccinating in line with Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) advice and as supply allows."Thanks to NHS staff, people aged 45-49 have been hot on the heels of millions of people most at risk who were quick to take up the offer of a vaccine with more than two thirds getting their lifesaving jab, marking another medically important milestone in the biggest vaccination campaign in NHS history,” said Sir Simon Stevens, NHS England Chief Executive.“When the time comes, and you get that text, book an appointment to get your vaccine – it is the best protection you and your loved ones will receive from this deadly virus,” he said.Since the UK’s vaccination rollout began in December 2020, more than 28 million people have been vaccinated with a first dose in England, 63.8 per cent of the total population of adults aged over 18.NHS staff have also carried out more than 10 million second doses and has been reminding people to attend their second dose to ensure they receive maximum protection.NHS Medical Director, Professor Stephen Powis, said: “It is testament to the hard work of NHS staff that we are now able to vaccinate people in the next age group.“If you are aged 44, when you are invited to do so, please do book your jab as appointments become available – it is simple, effective and provides vital protection against the coronavirus.”The NHS currently vaccinates against Covid-19 using three approved vaccines, Pfizer/BionTech, Moderna, and Oxford/AstraZeneca. People who cannot go online can call the service on 119 instead to book their jab.Text invitations appear as an alert from “NHSvaccine”, including a web link to the NHS website to reserve an appointment.Vaccinations are now being administered at more than 1,600 sites across the country, including churches, mosques, temples, museums and rugby grounds, to ensure the vast majority of people live within 10 miles of at least one vaccination service.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-britain-to-now-vaccinate-people-above-the-age-of-44-and-above-101619427291653.html

Reuters is unable to confirm the death toll, as the junta has significantly curbed media freedoms, and many journalists have been detained.A civil disobedience campaign of strikes has crippled the economy and raised the prospect of hunger, international aid agencies have warned.Pro-democracy activists have called for an intensification of their effort from Monday by refusing to pay electricity bills and agricultural loans, and for children to stop going to school."All of us, people in townships, wards and then regions and states must work together to make a successful boycott against the military junta," activist Khant Wai Phyo said in a speech at a protest in the central town of Monywa on Sunday."We don't participate in their systems, we don't cooperate with them.”A spokesman for the junta did not answer calls seeking comment.Activists criticised a five-point agreement that came out of the ASEAN meeting, to end violence, start a dialogue among all parties, accept aid, and appoint a special ASEAN envoy who would be allowed to visit Myanmar.The agreement did not mention political prisoners although the statement said the meeting heard calls for their release.Suu Kyi, 75, has been charged with various offences including violating a colonial-era official secrets act that could see her jailed for 14 years.She won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1991, and has led Myanmar’s struggle against military rule for decades. The won a second term in a November, and even though the election commission said the vote was fair the military, whose candidates suffered humiliating defeats, alleged it was a fraudulent election.Suu Kyi is due to appear via video link for another hearing in her case on Monday.She has only been allowed to talk with her lawyers via video link in the presence of security officials and it is not known if she is even aware of the turmoil that has engulfed the country since the military seized power.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/myanmar-activists-call-for-new-non-cooperation-campaign-101619415021668.html

"It was a circuit-breaker we needed to limit community spread and keep our community healthy."Two million people in Perth and Peel's near 150,000 residents were ordered to stay home until 12:01 a.m. on Tuesday, except for essential work, healthcare, grocery shopping or exercise.People can leave their homes when the lockdown ends but will have to wear masks at all times. Home gatherings will be limited to 20 guests while restaurants and supermarkets will need to follow strict social-distancing rules.These interim restrictions will remain until Friday night, McGowan said, when they would be reviewed.Snap lockdowns, speedy tracking systems and border closures have helped Australia keep its Covid-19 numbers relatively low, with just over 29,600 cases and 910 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australias-perth-to-exit-covid-19-lockdown-101619415367726.html
26-04-2021||World||UK denies report that PM Johnson said 'let the bodies pile high'||A newspaper report that British Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that he would rather bodies piled "high in their thousands" than order a third lockdown is not true, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said on Monday.Johnson is facing a stream of allegations in British newspapers about everything from his muddled initial handling of the Covid-19 crisis to questions over who financed the redecoration of his Downing Street flat.The Daily Mail newspaper said Johnson said at an October meeting at Downing Street: "No more ****ing lockdowns – let the bodies pile high in their thousands.""It's not true - it's been categorically denied by practically everyone," Wallace told Sky when asked about the reported remark, adding that Johnson was focused on the Covid response."We're getting into the sort of comedy chapter now of these gossip stories - you know unnamed sources by unnamed advisers talking about unnamed events. You know - look - none of this is serious," Wallace said.The Daily Mail did not immediately respond to a request for comment.After Downing Street named Johnson's former chief advisor, Dominic Cummings, as the source of leaks about the prime minister, Cummings hit back on Friday, denying he was the source and casting Johnson as incompetent and lacking in integrity.Cummings, architect of the Brexit campaign for Britain to leave the European Union, left Johnson's staff suddenly late last year having previously been his most influential adviser over Brexit and a 2019 election campaign.Cummings said Johnson's plans to have donors secretly pay for the renovation of his Downing Street plan were "unethical, foolish, possibly illegal and almost certainly broke the rules on proper disclosure of political donations".Asked about the refurbishment plans in March, Johnson's spokeswoman said all donations, gifts and benefits were properly declared and no party funds were being used to pay for the upgrades.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-denies-report-that-pm-johnson-said-let-the-bodies-pile-high-101619420522948.html
26-04-2021||World||Determined to help India in Covid fight: US President Joe Biden||US President Joe Biden on Sunday said the assistance offered by his country to India to combat a devastating surge in Covid-19 cases is in exchange for the help provided by India last year when America was struggling to tackle the outbreak.He also said Washington was “determined” to help New Delhi, pushing back on narrative that America was late to come to India’s rescue.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” Biden wrote in a tweet on Sunday, retweeting a post from his National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who announced the assistance after a phone call with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval.People familiar with discussions leading up to the announcement on both sides echoed the framing of the assistance as a gesture between partners, with the US returning the favour.Biden did not specify in the tweet, but he meant the assistance announced by his administration on Sunday was similar in nature - and reciprocal - to the lifting of an export ban by India to release a consignment of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April last year on a request from then president Donald Trump.HCQ, an antimalarial drug, was being used as a prophylactic in some cases against the coronavirus. Trump, however, had touted it as a “game changer” in his bid to control the outbreak, which he saw as a drag on his re-election chances.Trump pushed Modi to release a consignment of HCQ last April despite the export ban, with a threat of retaliation. India made an exception for Trump and released the consignment. He himself later took a course of the drug after a possible exposure to the virus.The exception made by Modi then was similar to the one made by Biden now to release raw materials for vaccines being made in India, in contravention of restrictions in force since February, when Biden had invoked the Defense Production Act to make it mandatory for American suppliers of such raw materials to prioritise orders placed by American buyers over those by outsiders.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India in its time of need,” US national security council spokesperson Emily Horne said, announcing US support and supplies for India.People familiar with these talks and developments said the first shipments of US supplies announced on Sunday could arrive in India as early as this week, including the most urgent of them all: oxygen, which has been in short supply in hospitals across India.The United States and India are looking are four options on how best to address the immediate crisis. They are looking at oxygen concentrators, fan-like devices that enhance oxygen in an enclosed room; oxygen generator plants, small units that supply oxygen to hospitals; oxygen cylinders, which are in short supply in India; and containers to ship oxygen, which are like cryogenic containers supplied to India by Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-is-returning-the-favour-with-covid-19-aid-package-for-india-says-biden-101619418010611.html

Two of the races -- one in the northern island of Hokkaido and another in Hiroshima -- were to replace ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmakers who stepped down over graft charges. The LDP didn’t field a candidate in the Hokkaido election.The opposition also won a third election in the central prefecture of Nagano, held after the death of a lawmaker from Covid-19. Despite the losses, the LDP-led coalition kept its majority in both houses of parliament.While Suga’s LDP is unlikely to be toppled in the near future, the losses could weaken support for the prime minister, who has come under fire since he took office last year over scandals and his handling of the pandemic.

The International Monetary Fund has projected a 5.3% expansion.But since those forecasts were made there have been signs of an acceleration in the pace of recovery with the country now having given a first coronavirus vaccine to more than half of its total population."The UK economy is rebounding sharply from the Covid crisis," Goldman Sachs said."The April flash PMI was much stronger than expected in the UK, with the services PMI moving strongly further into expansionary territory," it said.The bank also noted a much-stronger-than-expected 5.4% monthly jump in retail sales in March.The note did not provide a comparison forecast for U.S. economic growth this year. In February, Goldman said it expected U.S. GDP would grow by 6.8% in 2021 as President Joe Biden pushed ahead with a huge fiscal stimulus programme.Britain's economy shrank by nearly 10% last year as it was hit by longer coronavirus lockdowns than many of its peers. By comparison, the U.S. economy shrank by an estimated 3.5%, according to the IMF.On Saturday, Bank of England Deputy Governor Ben Broadbent was quoted as saying he expected "very rapid growth at least over the next couple of quarters" as the country lifts its coronavirus restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-economy-set-to-grow-faster-than-the-us-this-year-goldman-sachs-101619403662379.html
26-04-2021||World||Mexican minister visits Russia, vying to bring vaccine production home||Mexico's top diplomat traveled to Moscow on Sunday for a visit with Russian officials, his office said, amid talks to hammer out plans for Mexico to bottle Russia's Sputnik V Covid-19 vaccine domestically after delays in shipments.The government is aiming to quicken its pace of vaccinations, with just more than 4% of its population of 126 million people fully inoculated.Mexico has registered 214,947 deaths, the fourth most worldwide, and 2,328,391 infections from the pandemic. The government has said the real number of cases is likely significantly higher.Mexico's state-run vaccine manufacturer, Birmex, is working with Russia on a plan to bottle Sputnik V in Mexico, Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard said last week, just as Argentina produced test batches of the two-shot vaccine."Birmex is working jointly with Russian institutions so that Mexico can bottle the vaccine," Ebrard told Russian media outlets on Friday. "There is already significant progress."Health ministry official Ruy Lopez told reporters on Sunday that the government's aim is to ramp up distribution of Sputnik V not only in Mexico, but also other parts of Latin America.Russia has shipped 1.1 million Sputnik V doses to Mexico to date, far fewer doses than those originally slated to have arrived by now.Mexico's Health Ministry said in late February it expected to receive 7.4 million doses of Sputnik V by April and an additional 16.6 million shots in May. Mexico has signed an agreement to acquire a total of 24 million doses.Mexico is increasingly aiming to bottle vaccines domestically following delays from providers, and has already bottled 2.6 million shots of China's CanSino vaccine.It also plans to bottle AstraZeneca shots using vaccine material produced in Argentina. But the first doses are not expected until May due to delays at the Mexican production laboratory.Ebrard's visit to Moscow will last through Wednesday and include a meeting with his counterpart, Sergei Lavrov.The minister will also visit China, India and the United States as part of his government's efforts to make sure that its supply agreements for vaccines against Covid-19 are honored.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexican-minister-visits-russia-vying-to-bring-vaccine-production-home-101619400714118.html

He was taken to Harlem Hospital in critical but stable condition, police said.Surveillance video released by the police appears to show the attacker stomping on the victim's head. The police department's hate crimes task force is investigating the attack, the latest in a troubling rise in anti-Asian hate crimes in New York and around the country.Police have not specified a motive in the attack.Mayor Bill de Blasio called it “outrageous” on Twitter. “Make no mistake, we will find the perpetrator and they will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law,” de Blasio said Saturday.UPDATE: The @NYPDHateCrimes task force has a solid lead on the vile acts of anti-Semitism in the Bronx and we will take swift action against the perpetrators.If you have any more information on this case, contact the NYPD right away. https://t.co/CC15V2KMSaThe attack recalled last month's assault near Times Square in which a woman who immigrated from the Philippines was knocked to the ground and stomped on by an attacker who shouted anti-Asian slurs. A parolee convicted of killing his mother nearly two decades ago was arrested in that attack.The U.S. Senate passed legslation last week aimed at fighting the rise in hate crimes against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. The measure would expedite the review of hate crimes at the Justice Department and provide support for local law enforcement in response to thousands of reported violent incidents in the past year.Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Sunday he would direct the state hate crimes task force to offer assistance in investigating Friday's attack in East Harlem.“I’m sickened to learn of yet another bigoted act of violence against an Asian American man,” the governor said in a statement. “This is not who we are as New Yorkers, and we will not let these cowardly acts of hate against members of our New York family intimidate us."Police did not release the victim's name, but multiple news outlets identified him as Yao Pan Ma, a former restaurant worker who lost his job because of the pandemic and was collecting cans to make ends meet.The victim’s wife, Baozhen Chen, 57, pleaded for police to find her husband’s attacker in an interview with the New York Post."Please capture him as soon as possible and make him pay,” Chen said in Mandarin through a translator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-york-police-probe-hate-crime-against-chinese-american-man-101619397905398.html

The speech will be co-hosted by UN. permanent representatives of Argentina, Japan, Norway and South Africa.The Biden administration will mark its first 100 days in office this week. President Joe Biden is scheduled to address Congress on Wednesday and is certain to highlight the headway his administration has made in responding to the worst public health crisis in the US in more than a century.Harris, according to the excerpts, will broadly outline how the administration thinks the US and other nations should consider focusing their attention. The steps include improving accessibility to health systems, investing in science, health workers and the well-being of women, and surging capacity for personal protective equipment and vaccine and test manufacturing.Harris says much has been learned over the last year about pandemic preparedness and response but that it would be unwise to rest easy.“We have been reminded that the status quo is not nearly good enough, and that innovation is indeed the path forward,” Harris says.Biden’s ambassador to the UN, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, is also scheduled to deliver remarks at Monday’s virtual event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-vice-president-kamala-harris-to-tell-un-body-it-s-time-to-prepare-for-next-pandemic-report-101619393989344.html

As we provide assistance, we pray for the people of India —including its courageous healthcare workers,” Harris said in a tweet.The tweets by Biden and Harris are the first reactions by the top American leadership after the recent outbreak of deadly Covid-19 pandemic in India. The two have been criticizsed by friends of India in the US, including some of their own party leaders, for slow response to the American help to their natural ally.Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman said she has been in close touch with Foreign Secretary Harshvardhan Shringla and India’s Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu in recent days on the issue.“The American people stand in solidarity with our friends in India during these difficult times. We are rapidly providing therapeutics, ventilators, PPE, raw material for vaccines, and more,” Sherman said.Earlier on Sunday, US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan spoke to his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval during which the White House announced that it is urgently sending medical supplies and equipment to save lives in India.The Indian-American community, which had been critical of the Biden administration so far, welcomed the move.“Great to see our US India partnership at work at this critical time,” Indiaspora said after Biden’s tweet.“Good first steps,” Indian-American Democratic bundler Shekar Narasimhan said after Sullivan announced details of the assistance to India.In a tweet, he described it as “moving the needle”.“I am also counting on private and corporate actions to make a difference. Many have a big stake in India and it’s not just Indian Americans,” he said.India’s Ambassador to US Sandhu thanked both US Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Sullivan for their prompt response. “Thank you Sullivan for your reach out and support. We will fight the global pandemic through our collective action!” he said in a tweet.“Thank you Secretary Blinken for your solidarity and support. Together, we will fight the global pandemic!” Sandhu said in another tweet.Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna, Congressional India Caucus Vice Chair and Member of the House Armed Services Committee, applauded the Biden administration.“International cooperation and humanitarian assistance are the hallmarks of a truly progressive foreign policy. In the face of apocalyptic numbers of Covid-19 cases & new variants exploding in India, I applaud the Biden administration's decision to put people over profits and provide additional Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), oxygen, and other medical supplies to India,” Khanna said.“I am also pleased to see the deployment of raw materials for India to produce more vaccines and USAID’s work with the CDC to expedite the mobilisation of emergency resources for India through the Global Fund. This must be done with the utmost speed and urgency,” he said.Khanna said the Biden administration can still do more, like give India “our stockpile” of AstraZeneca vaccines that won’t be used in the US and have already opened up to Mexico and Canada. “And we should facilitate the Indian diaspora in America to help assist hospitals in India.”Khanna said the administration should also call on Pfizer and Moderna to provide an intellectual property waiver for six months to a year as India grapples with the Covid-19 crisis. It will buy them an inordinate amount of goodwill in one of the largest emerging markets, he added.“The White House should also convene Indian business leaders to make the case for why this is in these companies’ long-term strategic interest. Many Indian American business leaders such as Vinod Khosla are happy to make the case to them why this is a good business decision. Mr. Khosla has committed to financially help any hospitals in India in need of supplies and will also be speaking with the India Caucus leadership to discuss what else can be done to assist,” Khanna said.In a statement, Khanna said he is looking forward to joining the India Caucus leadership on a call with Indian Ambassador to US Taranjit Singh Sandhu to discuss what additional steps the US can take to help India during this “incredibly difficult time”.“This is a very tough time for the Indian people and underscores the continued threat of Covid-19. These new strains of the virus are gravely alarming and could pose a threat here in America and across the globe if we do not do all we can to contain the virus and its new variants,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-harris-assure-india-of-support-in-fight-against-covid19-101619390918721.html
26-04-2021||World||35 years on, the ruins of Chernobyl draw warnings, tourists||The vast and empty Chernobyl Exclusion Zone around the site of the world’s worst nuclear accident is a baleful monument to human mistakes. Yet 35 years after a power plant reactor exploded, Ukrainians also look to it for inspiration, solace and income.Reactor No. 4 at the power plant 110km north of the capital Kyiv exploded and caught fire deep in the night on April 26, 1986, shattering the building and spewing radioactive material high into the sky.Soviet authorities made the catastrophe even worse by failing to tell the public what had happened — although the nearby plant workers’ town of Pripyat was evacuated the next day, the 2 million residents of Kyiv weren’t informed despite the fallout danger. The world learned of the disaster only after heightened radiation was detected in Sweden.Eventually, more than 100,000 people were evacuated from the vicinity and a 2,600-square-kilometer exclusion zone was established where the only activity was workers disposing of waste and tending to a hastily built sarcophagus covering the reactor. Radiation continued to leak from the reactor building until 2019, when the entire building was covered by an enormous arch-shaped shelter. As robots inside the shelter began dismantling the reactor, officials felt new optimism about the zone.“This is a place of tragedy and memory, but it is also a place where you can see how a person can overcome the consequences of a global catastrophe,” said Bohdan Borukhovskyi, Ukraine’s deputy environment minister.“We want a new narrative to appear — it was not a zone of exclusion, but a zone of development and revival,” he said. For him, that narrative includes encouraging tourism.“Our tourism is unique, it is not a classic concept of tourism,” he said. “This is an area of meditation and reflection, an area where you can see the impact of human error, but you can also see the human heroism that corrects it.”The Chernobyl zone saw its tourism increase twofold after the lauded TV miniseries of 2019 and officials hope that level of interest will continue.One of the prime draws for tourists is to see the ruins of Pripyat, the once-modern town of 50,000 now being taken over by decay and vegetation. Work is underway to build paths to make it easier for visitors to navigate the ruins. The Chernobyl plant is out of service, but there is still much work to be done at the decommissioned plant.“We are doing everything possible so that this territory, where it is now impossible for people to live, is used with benefit and gives the country a profit,” said Serhiy Kostyuk, head of the agency that manages the exclusion zone.Although the radiation level in the zone is low enough that tourists can visit and workers can carry out their jobs, permanent residence is banned. However, more than 100 people still live in the zone that extends 30 kilometers around the nuclear power plant, despite orders to leave the site.Among them is 85-year-old former teacher Yevgeny Markevich, who said “It’s a great happiness to live at home, but it’s sad that it’s not as it used to be.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/35-years-on-the-ruins-of-chernobyl-draw-warningstourists-101619387562187.html
26-04-2021||World||US says it will provide India with raw material for vaccines||The US said on Sunday it will provide India raw materials urgently needed for making the Covishield vaccine and supply equipment such as ventilators and oxygen generation gear to support the country’s response to a massive surge in Covid-19 cases.The pledge, made by US National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval, came against the backdrop of calls from lawmakers and businesses for the Biden administration to do more and criticism from some quarters for what is being seen as Washington’s lethargic reaction.“Just as India sent assistance to the US as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the US is determined to help India in its time of need,” US national security council spokesperson Emily Horne said after the conversation between the NSAs.The European Union (EU) and Germany too said on Sunday they were mobilising aid to support India, while the UK announced it was sending more than 600 pieces of medical equipment, including ventilators and oxygen concentrator devices. The first package from Britain will arrive in New Delhi on Tuesday, with further shipments later in the week.Canada, Iran and Pakistan said they were ready to supply equipment and medical supplies to help India tackle the crisis caused by a second wave of infections.The US has “identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India”, US national security council spokesperson Horne said.Therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) will also be immediately made available to treat patients and protect frontline health workers. The US is “pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis”, she said.The US will deploy an expert team of public health advisors from the Center for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID to work with the US embassy, India’s health ministry and Epidemic Intelligence Service staff, while USAID will work with CDC to fast-track mobilisation of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund.The US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is funding an expansion of the manufacturing capability of Indian vaccine manufacturer BioE to produce at least a billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022, Horne said.While speaking to Doval, Sullivan expressed deep sympathy for the Indian people and affirmed America’s solidarity with India, “the two countries with the greatest number of Covid-19 cases in the world”. Building on the seven-decade health partnership between the two sides, Sullivan and Doval resolved the two countries will continue to jointly fight the global pandemic.Earlier, Sullivan and secretary of state Antony Blinken had expressed the Biden administration’s support for India in separate tweets. “Our hearts go out to the Indian people in the midst of the horrific COVID-19 outbreak. We are working closely with our partners in the Indian government, and we will rapidly deploy additional support to the people of India and India’s health care heroes,” Blinken tweeted.The Biden administration has faced mounting calls to do more on several fronts related to the crisis in India.Lawmakers from the House of Representatives and Senate – all Democrats – called on the administration to back a proposal by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization to grant a temporary waiver from intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines to make them easily accessible.There was also the issue of raw materials for making Covid-19 vaccines, raised by Indian companies with popular support. US suppliers of these items are required to prioritise orders from American buyers after President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act.The Serum Institute of India had called for the US to “lift the embargo” on raw materials and the matter was discussed by external affairs minister S Jaishankar with Blinken, while foreign secretary Harsh Shringla raised it with deputy secretary of state Wendy Sherman.US experts believed the Biden administration could have done more. “Tweetments are good, action is better. Time is crucial here,” said Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, referring to the tweets by Blinken and Sullivan.The US Chamber of Commerce called on the Biden administration to release millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses from its stockpile, which the US is unlikely to use because Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson shots will more than meet its needs. The US has also not authorised the AstraZeneca shot.Vinod Khosla, a Silicon Valley tech billionaire and investor, and Raja Krishnamurthi, an Indian American Democratic lawmaker, echoed that call. Khosla offered to fund oxygen supplies for India. “I’m willing to fund hospitals in India that need funding to import bulk planeloads of oxygen or supplies into India to increase supply,” he tweeted.Janez Lenarčič, the EU commissioner for crisis management, said on Sunday the bloc’s Emergency Response Coordination Centre (ERCC) was coordinating with member states to rapidly provide urgently needed oxygen and medicines to India.German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who caused a stir in New Delhi last week with her criticism of the slowdown of vaccine exports from India, expressed solidarity in the “common fight” against Covid-19 and said Germany was preparing a “mission of support”. Lenarčič, responsible for EU’s humanitarian aid and the European emergency response coordinator, said the support was being provided in response to a request from India.“Upon request for assistance by #India, we have activated the #EU Civil Protection Mechanism. The [EU] will do its utmost to mobilise assistance to support people of [India],” he tweeted.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that details of aid to be provided by EU and Germany were in the final stages of being worked out and a clearer picture would be available by Monday.Canada’s public services minister Anita Anand told a news conference on Saturday that Ottawa has communicated its willingness to assist New Delhi. “We will stand ready with PPE (personal protective equipment) and ventilators and any items that might be useful for the government of India,” she said. Anand was quoted by the outlet Global News as saying that the Canadian government was in touch with India and through its envoy in New Delhi, Nadir Patel, “about a number of options that may be on the table for us to assist”.In a statement issued late on Saturday, Pakistan’s foreign ministry offered to provide relief support to India, including ventilators, bilevel positive airway pressure (Bi PAP), digital X-ray machines, PPEs and related items, as a gesture of solidarity.“The concerned authorities of Pakistan and India can work out modalities for quick delivery of the relief items. They can also explore possible ways of further cooperation to mitigate the challenges posed by the pandemic,” the statement said.Iran’s health minister Saeed Namaki offered help in a letter sent to his Indian counterpart Harsh Vardhan. “The government and people of Iran are ready to spare no technical assistance, expertise and equipment in these difficult days and at the height of the plight of the dear citizens of India with the Covid-19 epidemic,” he said.“We hope that the exchange of experiences with scientific, research and production centres of the two countries can create a brighter future for the two countries with a long history of scientific, cultural and production exchanges,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-it-will-provide-india-with-raw-material-for-vaccines-101619381265227.html

Addressing a press conference, minister Himanta Biswa Sarma informed about the present status of oxygen supply, intensive care unit (ICU) beds and Remdesivir injections. “Assam is consuming 20 metric tons (MT) of oxygen daily. In the past 10 days, we have rejuvenated some of our old oxygen plants and also established pressure swing absorption (PSA) plants in different medical college and civil hospitals our oxygen generation capacity has increased to 61 MT daily,” Sarma said. “We have also enhanced our oxygen storage capacity to 468 MT. Therefore, I personally feel that for the next 10 days our oxygen situation will remain stable and there should not be any panic. In the next week we will set up three more small oxygen plants in three hospitals,” he added. Assam has been witnessing around 1,500-2,000 new Covid-19 positive cases in the past week. On Sunday, the state recorded 1844 new cases and 14 deaths. There were 15,470 active cases on Sunday. “Though the number of cases has gone up in the past week, the situation hasn’t gone out of hand as yet. We expect the number of cases to increase this week as well,” Sarma said. The minister informed that the state has a stock of 25,000 Remdesivir injections and they are being provided to both government and private hospitals as well as per requirement. “We have been able to add a substantial number of ICU beds in last 10 days. Almost 220 more ICU beds have been added and efforts are on to add more beds in the next few days. As of today, we are comfortable about oxygen, beds, medicine and ICU availability for next 10 days,” Sarma said. Sarma, who also holds the education portfolio, informed that in amendment of an earlier order closing down primary schools in districts where 100 Covid-19 cases are recorded in a day, from now on all classes in private and government schools till Class VII will be conducted via the online mode in all such districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-management-in-assam-on-track-for-next-10-days-himanta-biswa-sarma-101619461578937.html
26-04-2021||India||UK variant, African virus strain detected in Kerala, says CM Pinarayi Vijayan||In Kerala, the presence of deadly Covid-19 mutant strains from the United Kingdom and South Africa have been confirmed, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan said on Monday even as the state added 21,890 new cases with a high test positivity rate of 22.71 per cent. This is the first time that the state government has admitted the presence of deadly virus strains in Kerala.The CM said preliminary studies have found that mutant strains fanned the second wave in the state. “Among new patients at least 40 per cent are infected with mutated variants. Of these 30 per cent are the UK variant and 7 per cent with double mutants and 2 per cent have the South African variant,” he said. When asked about more details he said experts will divulge further details in the coming days.“Detection of UK and African variants calls for stricter restrictions. The situation is really critical. We don’t want to create panic but people will have to be extra vigilant. We are going through a bad phase. Now experts have advised people to wear double masks in public places to avoid rapid infection,” he said. The CM said vigil has been stepped up in areas where mutant strains were reported. Last week the Rajiv Gandhi Centre for Biotechnology in Thiruvananthapuram had done an extensive study on the spike protein of the virus with the help of the Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology in Delhi. Going by the rapid spread and nature of the second wave experts have warned about presence of strong mutants.Earlier in the day the CM chaired an all-party meeting which decided not to enforce a complete lockdown but suggested partial closure on weekends and restrictions in containment areas that will be tightened. The meeting has also decided not to hold victory processions or rallies on counting day on May 2. The results of the assembly elections will be declared on May 2. Almost all political parties have agreed that a complete lockdown will affect people who are already reeling under the impact of the pandemic.“Mini lockdown will continue during weekends for the time being. Shops and business establishments will be allowed to remain open till 7.30 pm. Bars and malls will be shut. We will tighten measures in containment zones and effective policing will be there,” said the CM adding it is the duty of respective political parties to ensure that big victory rallies or processions won’t take place on counting day. As cases rise alarmingly the core committee formed for the pandemic had earlier recommended a two-week lockdown but the all-party meet felt that complete closure and curfew will impact people badly and it will affect their livelihood.In terms of daily viral caseload, Kerala is on the third spot with 21,890 cases and active cases have also risen to 2,31,812. Out of 96,378 people tested, 21,980 tested positive, according to the data released by the state health ministry. The state has also reported 28 fatalities taking the death toll to 5138. Among the infected are 70 health workers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-variant-african-virus-strain-detected-in-kerala-says-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-101619461098976.html

This restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by DGCA,” it said in a circular.The statement added that this was done in view of the Covid 19 situation in the country.The Centre fixed fare bands when airlines resumed their services in May 2020 after the national lockdown in a bid to ensure that passengers were not overcharged. On March 19, Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Puri announced a 5% in the lower fare band due to rising Aviation Turbine Fuel prices. According to DGCA data, 15.5 million passengers travelled on domestic airlines in February 2021, as compared to 7.7 million in January. Though domestic departures and total distance flown are still under pre-pandemic levels, they were steadily improving till February.

Four hailed from Hisar and one from Punjab. Hisar deputy superintendent of police Rajbir Singh confirmed that five Covid-19 patients died at the hospital but added that the exact cause of death was yet to be ascertained.“The relatives of the deceased alleged that all of them were on ventilator support and died due to shortage of oxygen supply. The hospital authorities have not spoken on the issue yet,” he added.Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said a magisterial probe was ordered into the incident. ”There is no oxygen shortage either in Hisar or at any other place,” he said. But relatives of the deceased said the lack of medical oxygen was responsible for the incident. “The doctors failed to provide proper treatment to my uncle and he died due to shortage of oxygen supply,” the nephew of a 42-year-old deceased said.The brother of a 43-year-old victim said he visited another hospital to bring a cylinder for his brother but in vain as the patient passed away before his arrival.The oxygen reportedly ran out of supply at 12 am on the intervening night of Sunday and Monday. After several efforts to ensure supply, the hospital staff later allegedly brought two gas cylinders from another private hospital but till then, all five had died.Three manufacturing units in Hisar provides nine metric tonnes of oxygen to various hospitals in Hisar, Agroha and Sirsa, which is more than sufficient, an official said. “The oxygen is being supplied to various hospitals as per patients numbers. There is no shortage of oxygen in the district,” the official added.This is the third incident of Covid-19 patients dying, allegedly of oxygen shortage in the state, in the past 24 hours. A day ago, four patients each died at private hospitals in Gurugram and Rewari respectively, allegedly due to shortage of oxygen supply. An inquiry was ordered in both the cases. Four people died at Rewari’s Virat hospital on Sunday afternoon and four other critically Covid-19 patients, who were on ventilator support at Kathuria hospital in Gurugram, died due to shortage of oxygen supply, according to hospital management. Kathuria Hospital owner Dr AK Kathuria said they had informed the health department regarding the oxygen supply. However, around 3pm, the cylinders went empty and four patients lost their lives, he said.Virat Hospital operational head Dharmender Kumar said that 114 Covid-infected patients were undergoing treatment at the hospital. “Three patients died in ICU, while one died in the ward. We need over 300 oxygen cylinders on a daily basis, but our supply has been reduced. We have been repeatedly reporting this to the administration,” he added.Hisar deputy commissioner Priyanka Soni said a probe will be conducted into the deaths. “ A medical negligence board has been setup to analysis the reasons behind the deaths,” she added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/5-covid-patients-die-in-hisar-hospital-kin-allege-oxygen-shortage-101619460738387.html

He pointed out that the new prices are different from the prices at which the Union government is procuring vaccines. “Some manufacturers have already announced a higher, increased rate for procurement of vaccines by the state governments,” he said adding that this would put a higher financial burden on the states which have lesser financial resources compared to the Central government. “Since budgetary provision of ₹35,000 crore has been made in the Budget Estimates for 2021-22 for the Covid-19 Vaccination Programme, states have a legitimate expectation that the Government of India would supply the Covid-19 vaccines for phase 3,” Palaniswami wrote in his letter.On Friday, the chief minister had written to PM Modi urging the Centre to allocate an assured supply of 20 lakh doses of Covid-19 vaccines. He had also asked for permission to be granted for an Integrated Vaccine Complex in Chengalpattu district near Chennai as it was ready and could augment production of Covid-19 vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cm-eps-writes-to-pm-modi-urges-centre-to-supply-vaccines-for-all-age-groups-101619458938721.html

The phone call came after the US president expressed his solidarity with India as the nation faces a second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the country.Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that he discussed the Covid-19 situation in both countries in detail and said he thanked his US counterpart for his support. "Had a fruitful conversation with @POTUS @JoeBiden today. We discussed the evolving COVID situation in both countries in detail. I thanked President Biden for the support being provided by the United States to India," Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a tweet. He also said that the Covid-19 can be beaten by India-US healthcare partnership and his discussion with Biden focused on ensuring 'smooth and efficient' supply chains of vaccine raw materials and medicines. My discussion with @POTUS @JoeBiden also underscored the importance of smooth and efficient supply chains of vaccine raw materials and medicines. India-US healthcare partnership can address the global challenge of COVID-19.Earlier on Monday, Joe Biden in a tweet had assured India that United States would take required actions to help India in its time of crisis. "Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need," Biden said a tweet.The United States government in February had invoked the Defense Production Act, which allows the government to regulate distribution of products which led to the curb in export of raw materials critical for vaccine production. This was done after pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. cut short its vaccine production target by almost fifty percent citing shortage in raw material and creating an obstacle for the Biden administration which promised 100 million vaccination shots within Joe Biden's first 100 days in office.The US administration decided to take steps to help India after Union minister S Jaishankar and NSA Ajit Doval spoke with US secretary of state Anthony Blinken and US NSA Jake Sullivan respectively. Following Doval's conversation with Sullivan, US national security council spokesperson released a statement saying US is identifying resources needed by India as it fights the second wave. "The United States has identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India," the statement said. Germany, Australia and Saudi Arabia has also extended their support as India battles a second wave of Covid-19. Germany and Australia are working to spend oxygen production plant and ventilators to India to strengthen India's response to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-us-president-joe-biden-speak-to-each-other-over-phone-101619454786789.html

The central government has been requested for 240 MT of oxygen, he said.Khattar said that industrialist Naveen Jindal, who is a former MP, has also said that he will send 5 MT of liquid oxygen and people will not be allowed to suffer from the lack of the life-saving gas.He said that in view of the raging Covid-19 pandemic, an additional 650 beds are being arranged at PGIMS, Rohtak, whereas earlier 350 beds are already available for Covid-19 patients.He also said 1,250 additional beds are being arranged in different medical colleges of the state and space has already been identified for setting up 500 such beds.The structure will be erected there in the coming three-four days and soon all these beds will be available for the Covid-19 infected patients, he said.He said private hospitals are being monitored at the state level so that these do not admit more patients than their capacity and the oxygen supply for Covid-19 patients remains constant.He said Covid-19 patients with mild symptoms who do not require oxygen should remain in isolation in their homes. A health kit is being provided by the Health Department so that all of them can take care of themselves properly at home, he added.The Chief Minister said in this hour of crisis, the entire administration and the people of the state should work together to defeat this pandemic.In view of the surge in demand of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients, the Haryana government on Monday appointed nodal officers/District Drug Controller officers at the district-level to ensure that there is adequate supply and proper distribution of oxygen in all the districts of Haryana, an official statement said.As per the statement, Haryana would be getting supply of 50 MT of oxygen from Jharkhand's Bokaro, which would be used for emergency and treatment of critical Covid-19 patients.In Hisar meanwhile, Khattar held detailed discussions with top officials including Principal Secretary to Chief Minister, V Umashankar; Deputy Commissioner, Hisar, Dr Priyanka Soni and other officers for exploring the possibilities of setting up a 500-bed hospital in the premises of O P Jindal Modern School.The Chief Minister directed that immediate action should be initiated for setting up this hospital.In Panipat district, the 500-bed hospital would be set up in the premises of the Indian Oil Corporation Refinery, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-shortage-of-medical-oxygen-in-haryana-says-cm-khattar-101619450016080.html
26-04-2021||India||Military starts recalling retired medical staff for Covid-19 relief as crisis worsens||Military medical personnel who retired or took pre-mature retirement during the last two years are being recalled to work in Covid-19 facilities near them, chief of defence staff (CDS) General Bipin Rawat told Prime Minister Narendra Modi in a briefing on Monday. This comes at a time when the country is reeling under a public health emergency and its healthcare resources are at breaking point. Medical officers who retired more than two years ago have also been requested to make their services available for consultation through medical emergency helplines, the PMO said in a statement after the CDS briefed the PM who reviewed the military’s preparations to assist in Covid-19 management. At a meeting held on April 20, defence minister Rajnath Singh asked the military to explore the possibility of utilising the services of vaccinated retired military personnel to help the civil administration and state governments to deal with the health crisis. India reported 354,709 new cases on Sunday, taking the total number of infections in the country to 17.3 million. A total of 2,808 new deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Sunday, the highest ever in the country, pushing the total number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 195,137, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard on Sunday. The CDS told the PM that all medical officers on staff appointments at Command HQ, Corps HQ, Division HQ & similar HQ of the navy and the Indian Air Force will be employed at hospitals. “The CDS informed the PM that nursing personnel are being employed in large numbers to complement the doctors at the hospitals. The PM was also briefed that oxygen cylinders available with armed forces in various establishments will be released for hospitals,” the PMO statement said. The PM reviewed the operations being undertaken by the IAF to transport oxygen and other essentials in India and abroad. The IAF is making a significant contribution in the fight against Covid-19 by transporting much-needed empty oxygen containers to filling stations across the country to tackle the oxygen crisis. The IAF on Monday ferried six empty cryogenic oxygen containers from Dubai to Panagarh in West Bengal in a C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, with the airlift of six more containers from Dubai planned on Tuesday. On Monday, the IAF also airlifted two containers from Jaipur to Jamnagar for refilling. The containers will be filled up and transported to different centres for Covid-19 relief by rail or road. Last week, the IAF airlifted four such containers from Singapore to Panagarh, apart from carrying out several domestic shuttles. The IAF is using a variety of aircraft for Covid-19 relief including C-17, C-130J, IL-76, An-32, Avro, Chinook and Mi-17 helicopters, as previously reported by Hindustan Times. General Rawat informed the PM that the armed forces are setting up a large number of medical facilities and, wherever possible, military medical infrastructure will be made available to civilians. “The PM also discussed with the CDS that Kendriya and Rajya Sainik Welfare Boards and officers posted in various headquarters in veterans’ cells may be instructed to coordinate the services of veterans to extend the reach to maximum extent possible including in remote areas,” the PMO statement added. The armed forces and other wings of the defence ministry can play an important role in the fight against Covid-19, Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former director general of the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS), said last week. “They have the manpower, resources and discipline to provide relief in these hard times. The military especially has a culture of quick response, be it enemy action or natural catastrophes. It can do a lot to alleviate the sufferings of our countrymen during the pandemic too,” Chopra said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-starts-recalling-retired-medical-staff-for-covid-19-relief-as-crisis-worsens-101619450717813.html
26-04-2021||India||Jammu man breathing life in poor Covid patients with free oxygen||A gas manufacturer in Jammu is providing free oxygen to poor Covid-19 patients in Jammu and Kashmir at a time when its shortage has led to loss of lives across states and engendered a healthcare crisis in the country, grappling with the highly virulent second wave of Covid- 19, resulting in a record number of new patients being reported daily.Manu Rana, the proprietor of Raj Gas Industries, located in Jammu, has been providing oxygen cylinders free of cost to the poor.“On Sunday, we distributed approximately 80 oxygen cylinders. On an average, we are distributing over 100 cylinders free to the needy people. However, those who can afford are being charged for it,” said Rana. Though he launched the initiative about two weeks ago, enquiries picked up pace since Sunday after his message was put out on social media and he has given away nearly 500 oxygen cylinders so far till now. On Monday, he distributed around 40 to 45 cylinders.The number of Covid cases are also on the rise in Jammu and Kashmir but has not reached overwhelming proportions as seen in many other Indian states, where several patients have died after hospitals ran out of oxygen supplies, resulting in Central government diverting the life-saving gas to crisis-ridden states with the help of railways and air force aircraft among other modes of transport. The number of patients requiring oxygen support has drastically increased in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19, largely driven by the new double-mutant variant virus. Rana’s initiative at such a time is inspirational for many.Sunny Khajuria, a Covid patient’s relative, who came to Rana’s office to check if the free oxygen cylinder offer was true, was left pleasantly surprised. “It’s a very good initiative. Others should also get inspiration from them. These are difficult times and the people with means should chip in with their bit to save others.”Rana’s Raj Gas Tower office, located at Gandhi Nagar in the city, is currently the base of his philanthropic operation. He is currently giving 10 litres of free oxygen to each person, who must bring their own cylinders to get their quota.“...it is more than sufficient to meet the requirement of a Covid patient. How long it lasts depends upon its usage. If the oxygen level is less than 80%, the patient has to inhale oxygen for 10 to 15 minutes and the level will go up to 93 to 94%. They should use it judiciously,” said Rana.He says his plant at Samba industrial estate was presently filling over 300 cylinders daily and could easily scale up if the situation in J&K deteriorates.“We have 20 kl set up with us, biggest in J&K. We have two tanks of 20 kl capacity each,” said Rana. One kiloleter equals 10,000 litres. Rana says his move was driven by his desire to give back to society at a crucial time.“We just want to ensure people don’t die due to scarcity of oxygen,” he said before handing out his phone numbers--0191-2459144, 9419187356 and email address - gm.rajgas@gmail.com for anyone who needs help with oxygen.Financial commissioner health and medical education Atal Dulloo appreciated the initiative saying, “anyone who can be of help to the poor under these trying circumstances should come forward. ...Every drop matters but much more needs to be done.”Dulloo, however, clarified that there was no shortage of oxygen in hospitals across Jammu and Kashmir, but described the situation as “challenging.”The Jammu and Kashmir government has approved establishment of 36 oxygen generation plants to cater to the rising demand for oxygen. A total of 1743 Covid beds were also available out of the 3,062 across the UT. Similarly, 203 Covid ICU beds out of 338 were vacant. In Jammu region, there are 1,354 Covid dedicated beds, out of which 577 are occupied. The region has 227 Covid ICU beds, of which 126 were vacant till Monday.Kashmir has 1708 Covid dedicated beds, out of which 742 were occupied till Monday. Similarly, out of the 111 Covid ICU beds, 77 were lying vacant till Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-man-breathing-life-in-poor-covid-patients-with-free-oxygen-101619449757853.html
26-04-2021||India||Rich Indians flee by private jet as Covid-19 infections spiral||India’s mounting crisis surrounding a surge in coronavirus infections is prompting wealthy families to flee the country by private jet.With reports of hospital bed and drug shortages sweeping social media, Indian tycoons and others able to afford fares running into millions of rupees are booking flights to boltholes in Europe, the Middle East and the Indian Ocean.“It’s not only the ultra rich,” said Rajan Mehra, chief executive officer at New Delhi-based private jet firm Club One Air. “Whoever can afford to take a private jet are taking private jets.”Watch: Top Biden official reveals how US is helping India battle Covid crisisIndia reported 352,991 new infections on Monday, the highest daily tally worldwide since the pandemic began. With the country’s health infrastructure creaking under the strain, Bollywood movie superstars were spotted escaping to destinations including the Maldives, while at least three Australian cricketers have quit the Indian Premier League, the sport’s leading club tournament.Some of the impetus for the wealthy to fly out of India has come from overseas nations taking measures to restrict travel from the South Asian state as the new wave of Covid-19 cases has taken hold.Canada, Hong Kong, the United Arab Emirates and the UK are among more than a dozen states that have imposed curbs, with others poised to announce measures. The Maldives will restrict Indians from visiting all but a handful of resort-only islands from Tuesday, leading to a last-minute rush in departures.“There was a huge surge to London and Dubai just before the restrictions took place, and the Maldives too before they announced the ban,” said Mehra, who was previously the head of Indian operations at Qatar Airways.A one-way flight from New Delhi to Dubai costs as much as 1.5 million rupees ($20,000), including ground handling and other fees, though private-jet operators also charge for the return leg if the plane is empty, Mehra said.The exodus has echoes of last year, when India banned medical evacuation flights amid concern that the super-rich might falsely claim they need treatment in order to jet around the nation during lockdown after the government banned commercial services.While private fares were already high and haven’t generally been bumped up, the cost of airline tickets has climbed.Nishant Pitti, co-founder of Easy Trip Planners India, said there’s limited availability to locations such as London following a surge in bookings for “immediate travel.”One-way economy-class trips to Dubai are going for the equivalent of $1,300, more than 10 times the regular price, according to Mehra.“That shows how desperately people are trying to get away,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/rich-indians-flee-by-private-jet-as-covid-19-infections-spiral-101619448267544.html
26-04-2021||India||DGCA extends fare cap on domestic flights, operations at 80% of pre-Covid level||The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) on Monday extended the capping of fares on domestic flights till May 31 and limited capacity at 80% of pre-pandemic levels due to the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the country. Last year, the aviation regulator put a cap on airfares after the resumption of flights following a lockdown imposed by the government due to the first wave of coronavirus pandemic in the country. DGCA also raised lower and upper limits on domestic airfares by 10 to 30% in February owing to a price rise in aviation turbine fuel.“In partial modification of circular dated 26-6-2020, the competent authority has further extended the validity of circular issued on the above subject regarding Scheduled International commercial passenger services to/from India till 2359 hrs IST of April 30. This restriction shall not apply to international all-cargo operations and flights specifically approved by DGCA,” it said in a circular.The aviation body last month also allowed 18,843 flights per week from 108 airports to operate under the summer schedule. “It may be noted that 18,843 departures per week have been finalised to/from 108 airports. Out of these 108 airports, Bareilly, Bilaspur, Kurnool and Rupasi are the new airports proposed by the scheduled airlines,” the DGCA informed in a tweet. It said that the decision was taken keeping in mind the limited occupancy inside flights due to the Covid-19 situation in the country. DGCA has also banned international flights till April 30.The DGCA has also asked airport authorities to take steps against people who are flouting Covid-19 norms and has also requested airlines to consider deboarding passengers who disagree with the Covid-19 preventative measures put in place to break the chain of transmission. “During the surveillance of some airports, it has come to notice that compliance of Covid-19 protocols is not satisfactory,” the regulator had highlighted in March.There have not been any changes to air travel due to lockdown-like measures imposed across several states in the country. People travelling to and from airports will be allowed to travel on showing their tickets which will be considered as e-pass.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-extends-fare-cap-on-domestic-flights-operations-at-80-of-pre-covid-level-101619444008638.html

Monday’s request by the Centre came after a row erupted over the vaccine prices ahead of the third phase of the vaccination drive from May 1, when all adults will be eligible for the jabs.SII along with British pharmaceutical company AstraZeneca is producing Covishield while Bharat Biotech is making Covaxin in collaboration with the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Both the vaccines were granted approval for emergency use by the Drugs Controller General of India (DGCI) on January 3 this year.Also Read| 141.9 million Covid-19 vaccine doses administered till date: GovtUnder the third phase, there will be two segments with regard to the supply of doses—vaccine manufacturers will supply 50 per cent of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) doses to the central government and will also be free to supply the remaining 50 per cent doses to the states and in the open market. State government hospitals and private hospitals can now directly purchase vaccine doses from the manufacturers.SII has said Covishield will be sold to states at ₹400 per dose while private hospitals will have to pay ₹600 per dose. Covaxin will be sold at ₹600 per dose to the state government hospitals and ₹1,200 for private hospitals, Bharat Biotech has said.

In a four-page letter, Vardhan added this quota is also open for the private and the corporate sector to pool in their resources so that the combined effort can be deployed to inoculate every adult in this country in the earliest possible time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-tells-serum-institute-bharat-biotech-to-lower-their-covid-vaccine-prices-101619444078473.html

"In this Covid-19 situation, please don't go out unnecessarily, and even within the family wear a mask. It is very important to wear a mask. Do not invite people into your home," Dr Paul said. "Social distancing is key and masks and sanitisers reduce risks," he added."If exposure through physical distancing is reduced by 50% 1 person ends up infecting only 15 people instead of 406, reducing it by 75% means 1 individual can infect only 2.5 people.

"It's time people start wearing masks inside their homes as well," said Dr VK Paul, Niti Aayog’s member (health), while briefing the press. The statement comes at a time when India is dealing with the deadlier, more infectious new wave of the pandemic, with hospitals in several states across the country reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds in view of the rising number of infections.It's time people start wearing masks inside their homes as well: Govt on second wave of COVID-19In view of the worsening oxygen crisis in India, the central government said that rational use of oxygen is important, as are appropriate prescriptions for drugs such as Remdesivir and Tocilizumab. Dr Randeep Guleria, the chief of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, said that "misuse" of oxygen is a major factor contributing to "unnecessary panic" among people over oxygen, causing a rush outside hospitals and a shortage of essential drugs and oxygen. "If the saturation is 94% or above, then there's no need to worry," the doctor said during a press briefing over the ongoing Covid-19 situation in the country.To drive home the idea that the second wave of the pandemic is considerably more infectious than the last, officials from the Union health ministry said that inability to follow proper physical distancing measures can result in one individual infecting 406 people in the span of just 30 days.

An official of the Union ministry of home affairs said the Union ministry of road transport and highways has devised a system to track the status of tankers in real-time. “We were facing difficulties as we did not have an idea regarding where the tankers were and lacked preparation when the tankers arrived. We wanted to devise a method where the distribution of oxygen was done efficiently and accidents are also averted. The GPS tracking system will help us know when the tanker has left the plant and how far away it is from the destination allowing us to prepare when it arrives,” additional secretary Piyush Goyal said.He also said that the Indian Air Force’s participation has helped in making oxygen available to states which are badly affected by coronavirus disease (Covid-19). “Empty tankers which are carried by aircraft have shortened the time span. Earlier trains and trucks were used to send empty oxygen tanks to production plants which took two to three days to reach, the journey has now decreased to a matter of two to three hours,” he said. He also highlighted that fully filled oxygen tanks cannot be carried by aircraft as it is not technically feasible and is also risky. He added that road transport and railways ministries are working round the clock to decrease the amount of time it is taking for oxygen to reach hospitals from production plants while reiterating that at this point oxygen should be treated as ambulances.The crisis of oxygen in several states and cities of India has led to several deaths as the nation battles a second wave of Covid-19. The Prime Minister at a review meeting has asked states and Union territories to work together and help each other with oxygen procurement. Delhi High Court has also asked stakeholders to ensure that lack of oxygen should not lead to more deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gps-tracking-enabled-for-oxygen-tankers-to-boost-preparedness-says-govt-101619438673359.html

Experts suggest that the second wave is majorly impacting the younger generation and it is important to get vaccinated."Younger generation need to be very careful now. Young people with no comorbidities are dying. The second wave is seeing more of the younger generation, including children, getting affected,” Dr Shekhar Salkar of Manipal Hospitals said. "They don't even have symptoms of fever," Dr Salkar added while addressing a webinar on 'Why you Need to Get Vaccinated'.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19Urging citizens to be careful, Dr Salkar said, "Covid has challenged health care systems and the economy. The 2nd wave has now set in with all its fury, we need to be very very careful."The second wave has hit the country terribly with healthcare reaching its capacity as a fresh record of infections are reported every day. The country on Monday registered the highest single-day spike of 352,991 fresh Covid-19 infections in the last 24 hours, taking the tally to over 17.3 million, the Union health ministry's data showed.The coronavirus disease (Covid-19) has taken more than 195,000 lives in India to date but the massive hike in the rate of infections in the last two months led the nation to gasp for breath as hospitals are overwhelmed with cases and patients die due to lack of oxygen supply.Dr Salkar also advised other measures to stay safe amid the raging virus. He said one should wear a two or three-layered mask or double mask and that the chance of getting infected is more than one per cent even if a simple mask is worn. In a scenario where there are two people and only one of them is wearing a mask, the chance of infections goes up to 10 per cent, while it is 95 per cent when both are not wearing a mask.Surgical mask enough? It is advisable to wear a 2 or 3-layered mask or double-mask. Even if one wears a simple mask, chance of getting infected is < than 1%If there are 2 persons, where only 1 wears mask chance goes up to 10%; when both don't wear chance of infection is 95% pic.twitter.com/6OR0RvX1bSVaccination and following Covid safety protocol like washing hands regularly, maintaining social distance and wearing a mask are the only shields that can protect against the fatal virus. "Vaccine not only gives you immunity but it prevents you from the second infection Even if there is a 2nd infection, the rate of infection is extremely less. Deaths due to Covid (after getting vaccinated) is negligible," Dr Salkar said.India will begin the third phase of its vaccination drive on May 1, which will make every adult in the country eligible for the vaccine against Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/young-need-to-be-more-careful-suggests-doctor-amid-raging-covid-19-second-wave-101619431570219.html
26-04-2021||India||Oxygen should be used judiciously, there should be no leakage: AIIMS director||AAs hospitals across India are reporting a shortage of oxygen to treat critical patients of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) director Dr Randeep Guleria said on Monday that it has to be used judiciously and hospitals must ensure there is no leakage of the gas.Addressing a press briefing along with the official of the Union health ministry, Guleria said, “At present, there is an unnecessary panic created among people. If people test positive for Covid-19 and are asymptomatic and their oxygen saturation is normal, they hospitalise themselves with a fear that they might need oxygen or a hospital bed in the future. Due to this, there is a huge rush outside hospitals and genuine patients suffer as they are unable to get proper treatment. Such assumptions are wrong.”Guleria also said that oxygen is an important treatment strategy for the Covid-19 disease and its misuse is also an important factor. He advised there is no need for people to take it if their oxygen saturation is above 94. “There is no point in using oxygen if your saturation is at 94 or 95 and further take it to 98 or 99. This is a misuse. We should ensure there is no misuse of the gas as it will be needed for some other person with saturation less than 90,” he added.Reiterating the fact that the antiviral drug Remdesivir does not save the lives of Covid-19 patients, the AIIMS director said the benefits of the drug are not well-established and cited a study from the United States which pointed out Remdesivir might reduce hospital stay but there is no mortality benefit from it.India’s Covid-19 disease caseload on Monday breached the 17 million mark after a record jump of 352,991 new cases was recorded in the last 24 hours. More than 2800 people succumbed to the disease during the same period, taking the death toll to 195,123 while 14,304,382 have recovered so far.With the oxygen crisis deepening in the country day by day, the Centre is undertaking measures to ramp up its supply such as banning its non-medical use, transporting oxygen tankers through the Indian Railways’ Oxygen Expresses and taking help from countries such as the US, the United Kingdom, European Union.During the health ministry’s press conference, an additional secretary of the Union home ministry Piyush Goyal said the Centre is ordering oxygen tankers from abroad on a purchase or hiring basis and also using real-time tracking to monitor its movement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-should-be-used-judiciously-there-should-be-no-leakage-aiims-director-101619437521621.html
26-04-2021||India||Fly ash utilisation deadline extended for thermal power plants||The Union environment ministry has extended the deadline for thermal power plants to ensure 100% utilisation of fly ash by 3 to 5 years, according to a new draft notification issued by the ministry on April 22.It also gives 10 years to thermal power plants to utilise the unutilised fly ash, or legacy ash which is stored. For the first time, the notification has a provision of imposing fines on thermal power plants that don’t comply with the new timelines.The previous deadline for 100% fly ash utilisation was December 31, 2017, as per a notification issued by the ministry on January 25, 2016. As per the new draft notification, thermal power plants (TPP) with fly ash utilisation of 60% to 80% will get 4 years while those with fly ash utilisation of less than 60% will get 5 years’ time to ensure 100% fly ash utilisation.Non-compliant power plants will be slapped a fine of ₹1,000 per tonne on unutilised ash during the end of the deadline. Coal or lignite plants which are not able to utilise 100% of ash in the third year of the next three-year cycle, would be liable to pay a fine of ₹1,000 per tonne on the unutilised quantity.For legacy ash, if the coal- or lignite-based thermal power plant has not achieved utilisation equivalent of at least 20% (in the first year), 35% (in the second year), 50% (from third to tenth year) as stipulated in the notification, a fine of ₹1,000 per tonne of unutilised legacy ash during that financial year will be imposed. And, if the utilisation of legacy ash is not completed at the end of 10 years, a fine of ₹1,000 per tonne will be imposed on the remaining unutilised quantity.Also Read | Earth Day: A reminder there’s no plan(et) B“The new deadlines have been decided based on the current utilisation of fly ash at thermal power plants. The provision of fines has been made under the ‘polluter pays’ principle,” said a senior environment ministry official.“The fine collected by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) from the thermal power plants and other defaulters shall be used towards the safe disposal of the unutilised ash. The liability of ash utilisation shall be with TPPs even after imposition of fines on unutilised quantities,” the notification states.Ash generated from thermal power plants can be utilised for manufacturing brick /blocks/tiles; cement manufacturing, ready mix concrete; construction of road and fly over embankment; ash and geo-polymer-based construction material; construction of dam; filling up of low lying areas; filling of mine voids; manufacturing of sintered/ cold bonded ash aggregate etc.All agencies (government, semi government and private) engaged in construction activities such as road laying, road and flyover embankments, shoreline protection structures in coastal districts and dams within 300 km from the lignite/coal-based TPPs shall mandatorily utilise fly ash, provided it is delivered at the project site free of cost and transportation cost is borne by the thermal power plants. Thermal power plants may charge for ash cost and transportation as per mutually agreed terms, in case the plant is able to dispose the ash through other means and agencies make request to procure it.Also Read | 8 states most prone to climate crisis: Study“This notification is the most elaborate than any previous fly ash utilisation notifications that have been in place since the late 1990s in that it acknowledges legacy problems of fly ash non-utilisation and introduces fines for non-compliance. But it also falls short on some significant questions. Fly ash management is a financial problem for generators of fly ash which is what leads to indiscriminate dumping. It is also a result of hiding the amount of ash that will be generated by making operations appear acceptable while seeking pollution consents and environmental approvals. In places where ash dykes routinely leak, pipelines regularly burst, and fly ash is habitually dumped indiscriminately, impacts of fly ash are not only about technical compliance. It is a reality that affects ecology, public health and food security,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher at Centre for Policy Research.The environment ministry had last month issued new norms which give an extension of 1 to 3 years to all thermal power plants to comply with the emission norms. A Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) analysis had found that the penalty charged to companies for not complying with the extended deadline is lower than the cost of complying. CSE’s analysis showed that while installing the equipment for pollution control would cost between ₹40-100 lakh/MW, the penalty that thermal power plants would have to pay to keep running without installing the equipment is only ₹5-11 lakh/MW as per the new amendment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/fly-ash-utilisation-deadline-extended-for-thermal-power-plants-101619436851227.html

26-04-2021||India||Covid Crisis: 7 steps India took to ramp up oxygen supply amid shortage||After the first wave last year, it appeared as though India’s response against coronavirus pandemic – barring a few hiccups like the migrant crisis - had largely worked. The Centre imposed a 68-day lockdown, the citizens abided – and the Centre and state governments used that time to strengthen the healthcare infrastructure, stocked up on ventilators, PPE kits, planned and initiated the vaccine drive. By mid February, it seemed that India had weathered the Covid-19 storm with its vaccine program well underway.And then the second Covid-19 wave hit. To say that we as a nation were caught unawares about this second 'Covid Tsunami' will be an understatement. At the government level – both Centre and state - we had dropped the guard. Politicians held mega election rallies, states delayed putting in place curbs that would have prevented spikes in infections, and people like you and me had started partying and vacationing thinking the worst was behind us.The wakeup call came only when the Covid-19 caseload spiked to a worrying high; overcrowded hospitals started raising oxygen SOSes, even turning patients away for lack of oxygen and beds. The tragic death of at least 20 Covid-19 patients of Jaipur Golden Hospital in northwest Delhi following a dip in oxygen pressure at the facility highlighted the scarcity. Heartbreaking visuals of mass cremations in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat exacerbated the ugly face of the ongoing pandemic.Over the last several days, there has been anger and demands that the Centre ensure adequate oxygen supply. The Centre has since swung into action.Here’s a look at the urgent steps initiated to address the shortage so that at least India does not lose more lives for lack of access to treatment than the virus itself.STEP 1: BANNING NON-MEDICAL USE OF LIQUID OXYGENIn order to ease the oxygen supply situation at hospitals treating Covid patients, the government on Sunday restricted the use of liquid oxygen to only medical use. The order also applies to the existing stock of liquid oxygen with manufacturing units. The government in its order has clarified that ‘No industry will be exempt from this order’.STEP 2: 551 PSA MEDICAL OXYGEN GENERATION PLANTS OKAYEDAgain on Sunday, the Centre approved allocation of funds for installation of 551 dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSO) Medical Oxygen Generation Plants inside public health facilities in the country. These plants will be established in identified Government hospitals in district headquarters.STEP 3: STATES ADVISED ON LOCAL CONTAINMENT ZONESThe Union health ministry on Sunday also issued local containment guidelines for districts that have reported a test positivity of 10% or more in the last one week, or have more than 60% occupancy of oxygen-supported or ICU beds. The Ministry stressed on local containment zones for 14 days with clear boundaries and stringent controls to stop the spread of the virus.STEP 4: RAILWAYS GEARS UP WITH OXYGEN EXPRESSMeanwhile, Indian Railways has stepped up operations of the Oxygen Express trains to transport liquid medical oxygen to various states across the country. An ‘oxygen express’ train carrying about 70 tonnes of medical oxygen from the Jindal Steel Works plant in Raigarh is expected to reach oxygen starved Delhi by tonight. More such plans are being chalked out to ferry oxygen to the capital.STEP 5: NAVY, IAF HELP TACKLE OXYGEN SHORTAGEThe Navy has also kicked off oxygen express ferries to island territories. On Sunday, INS Sharda transferred essential medical supplies to the Lakshadweep administration including 35 Oxygen cylinders, Rapid Antigen Detection Test kits, PPE gear and other items. The IAF has also been airlifting oxygen containers to filling stations to tackle oxygen shortage.STEP 6: ITBP RE-OPENS COVID CARE FACILITY IN DELHIThe Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) today reopened its Covid care centre in south Delhi with 500 oxygenated beds. This was the world's largest centre and was closed down in February this year. The facility has now been re-opened on the request of Delhi government to the Home Ministry.STEP 7: GLOBAL SUPPORT POURS INAnd finally, international support. Over the last 24 hours, the United States, Germany, UK and the European Union have shared their respective plans to provide assistance to India battling this severe pandemic. While the US has agreed to send raw materials needed for vaccine production in India, the UK has also announced sending life-saving medical equipment including ventilators and oxygen concentrator devices. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has also said that her government is "urgently" preparing a "mission of support" for India.Some experts are of the view that these urgent measures are coming a little late in the day and we should have been better prepared for the second wave. But we will have time for recriminations and blame games later.

The government this month paid Indian vaccine makers in advance, for the first time, for supply of doses.After cases began soaring this month, Modi's government urged Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson to seek permission to sell their shots in India, and he relaxed rules for them.But the sources said New Delhi was now leaving it up to India's states and companies to sign deals with foreign drugmakers while it buys in bulk most of the output of domestic producers - the Serum Institute of India, which is manufacturing the Anglo-British AstraZeneca vaccine, and Bharat Biotech, the maker of a home-grown shot.India's new coronavirus caseload hit a record daily peak for a fifth day on Monday as countries including Britain, Germany and the United States pledged to send urgent medical aid to help tackle the crisis overwhelming its hospitals.'The worst-hit state, Maharashtra, has said it will float a global tender to import vaccines. It is the richest state in India but many poorer ones may fall behind without financial support from the federal government to buy doses from abroad."The situation is desperate," one of the government officials, told Reuters. "India will allow import of vaccines" by local partners of the drug companies but the federal government "won’t buy".The second government official said: "I don't think the government will be buying foreign vaccines."Both officials have direct knowledge of the matter but declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue.The ministries of external affairs, health and commerce did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Pfizer has said it is talking to Modi's government about vaccines. J&J has sought approval to conduct a small local trial but made no plans to market its vaccine in India. Moderna has not commented.Under fire for his uneven handling of the world's worst Covid-19 surge, Modi has opened vaccinations for all adults from next month but supplies are already running short.India has administered nearly 140 million doses to its frontline workers and those aged above 45 years. About 118 million people have received at least one dose of the vaccine, which is only about a tenth of the 1.35 billion population.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-won-t-import-covid-19-vaccines-leaving-it-to-states-report-101619428379471.html

The post claims that this home remedy was discovered by a student of Pondicherry University and has been approved by the World Health Organization (WHO). None of which PIB said were true.“It is being claimed in the news that a student of Pondicherry University has found home remedies for Covid-19 and it has also been approved by WHO. Do not share such confusing messages. Trust only the official sources for the correct information related to,” PIB tweeted on April 25.Although ginger, honey, and black pepper have been known to help with common cold there is no scientific proof of it helping to fight Covid-19. WHO has also not approved of any home remedies for Covid-19 till date.PIB had fact-checked a similar claim of onions and rock salt curing Covid-19. “In a viral post and audio on social media it is being claimed that intake of rock salt with raw onion helps in recovering from Covid-19. This claim is fake. There is no scientific evidence that raw onion and rock salt intake can treat Covid-19,” the bureau had tweeted on April 21.India recorded upwards of 3,00,000 daily Covid-19 cases for the fifth consecutive day. The country has been witnessing an unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases as the second wave wreaks havoc on the nation’s healthcare. People everywhere are desperate for a cure and are settling for unvetted methods of prevention circulating online every day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/claims-of-black-pepper-honey-ginger-curing-covid-19-is-fake-tweets-pib-101619427423854.html

That will be one of the things we are looking at, in particular with the states,” the minister said.The federal government also confirmed to send oxygen, ventilators and personal protective equipment to India as part of an immediate support package to be announced on Tuesday, according to the report.However, Australia would not send vaccines.Hunt further said: ''We are in a strong position on that front because we don't need them at this point in time. We will still keep a reserve, but if they can be of assistance (they will be donated)."The National Security Committee of Cabinet is set to meet on Tuesday to discuss any assistance for India, as well as any extra steps that may need to be taken to minimise the risk of infections spreading to Australia.The government was also considering banning all flights from India following the massive spike of coronavirus cases in the country.The Cabinet meeting will discuss temporarily halting all repatriation flights out of India.The move could affect thousands of people, including Australian cricketers currently playing in the Indian Premier League in India.Foreign Affairs Minister Marise Payne, Australia’s ambassador to India Barry O’Farrell and officials from the Health Department, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the Department of Home Affairs were holding discussions over recent days on how to deal with the emerging situation.India is struggling with a second wave of the pandemic with more than 3,00,000 daily new coronavirus cases being reported in the past few days, and hospitals in several states are reeling under a shortage of medical oxygen and beds.India's tally on Monday climbed to 1,73,13,163 while active cases crossed the 28-lakh mark, with 3,52,991 people testing positive for coronavirus infection in a day, the highest so far, the Health Ministry said.The death toll rose to 1,95,123 with a record 2,812 new fatalities, it said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-to-send-oxygen-ventilators-ppe-to-india-as-part-of-immediate-support-package-101619425049464.html

The plant will be allowed to operate temporarily for only four months, which is subject to extension on a need basis, they added. The decision was taken after an all-party meeting.The Sterlite Plant in Thoothukudi was closed by the Tamil Nadu government in May 2018 for the violation of environmental norms.Officials said the production of oxygen in the plant will be monitored by a panel and supply to Tamil Nadu would be prioritised. While the state earlier opposed the plea by Vedanta Limited to reopen the plant, the change in stance comes after the demand for medical oxygen has increased due to the Covid-19 crisis in the country.Also read | Covid Crisis: 7 steps India took to ramp up oxygen supply amid shortage“As per the Supreme Court directive, the power supply may be allowed for Vedanta's Sterlite Industries in Tuticorin for four months to repair and operate oxygen producing and related equipment only,” it was resolved during an all-party meeting, news agency PTI reported.Earlier in the day, chief minister Edappadi K Palaniswami chaired the all-party meeting to discuss the re-opening of the plant for the production of medical grade oxygen, ANI reported. Leaders of the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) and other opposition parties attended the meeting in Chennai. The meeting came after a plea by Vedanta Limited in the Supreme court last Thursday (April 22) saying that the plant should be allowed to operate to produce 1000 tonnes of oxygen, which could be given for free to treat Covid-19 patients, according to news reports. However, the TN government opposed the plea and also mentioned that the top court earlier rejected appeals to reopen the plant.The Supreme Court last Friday also considered the possibility of the state government taking over the plant for the production of oxygen, highlighting that "people are dying due to lack of oxygen." Emphasising the need to produce oxygen, the bench headed by the then chief justice SA Bobde noted,” We are not interested that Vedanta or A, B or C runs it. We are interested that oxygen should be produced. Somebody should say something concrete because people are dying due to lack of oxygen," news agency PTI reported.“We have absolutely no problem if the state of Tamil Nadu take over the plant and produce oxygen. Why are they not producing oxygen when people need it?” the bench also asked, according to PTI.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tamil-nadu-allows-sterlite-plant-in-thoothukudi-to-reopen-for-4-months-to-produce-oxygen-101619426060391.html
26-04-2021||India||How Biden admin changed stance on supply of vaccine raw materials to India||US President Joe Biden on Monday took to Twitter to say that his administration is determined for India to tide over the crisis of coronavirus as the country has been witnessing more than 300,000 daily cases of infection for the fifth straight day. His administration has assured India to supply raw materials required by Pune-based Serum Institute of India (SII) to ramp up the production of Covishield vaccines.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” Biden posted from the official Twitter handle of the POTUS.Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need. https://t.co/SzWRj0eP3yEarlier curbs on export of raw materialsThe United States had in February invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the power to control the distribution of products, to curb the export of raw materials critical for vaccine production.External affairs minister S Jaishankar raised the matter with secretary of state Antony Blinken when they spoke on April 19; the same was also taken up in Washington by Indian envoy Taranjit Singh Sandhu.However, the US defended the curbs saying the Biden Administration’s priority is to meet the vaccine requirements of the American people.At that time, US state department spokesperson Ned Price had pointed to arrangements between the US and the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad on vaccine production, including increasing production capacity in India, but did not say whether or when the US would ease curbs on export of vaccine raw materials.Why did the US block the export?In November last year, American pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. cut short its vaccine production target by half, citing a shortage of raw material. Pfizer, which is producing mRNA Covid-19 vaccines, had earlier planned to roll out over 1.2 billion shots in 2021 but reduced the target by half due to raw material shortage in the United States and Europe.The revised target was a major hindrance to Biden’s poll promise of administering 100 million vaccination shots in his first 100 days in office. The US government has purchased 600 million doses of Covid-19 vaccines from both Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., which will be delivered in regular increments through the end of July 2021. In order to accelerate vaccine production, the Biden administration decided to invoke the Defense Production Act for the short term.Appeal by India to lift the banThe matter was taken up by Indian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu soon after the Defense Production Act was invoked by President Joe Biden in February. External affairs minister S Jaishankar raised it with secretary of state Antony Blinken when they spoke last week.Hindustan Times reported that the US side has promised to “give the matter due consideration” and to work with India to “find appropriate solutions”, according to the people cited above.Earlier this month, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla had urged US President Joe Biden to lift the export ban on raw materials required for the production of vaccines against the coronavirus disease.Change of stance by Biden AdministrationPresident Biden’s post on the microblogging platform comes close on the heels of India’s national security advisor Ajit Doval's telephonic conversation with his US counterpart Jake Sullivan on Sunday.“The United States has identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India,” said a statement issued by NSC spokesperson Emily Horne on Sullivan’s conversation with Doval.The statement also said the US is working “around the clock to deploy available resources and supplies”.The U.S. is deeply concerned by the severe COVID outbreak in India. We are working around the clock to deploy more supplies and support to our friends and partners in India as they bravely battle this pandemic. More very soon.A statement by the White House on the conversation between Doval and Sullivan further read, “To help treat Covid-19 patients and protect front-line health workers in India, the United States has identified supplies of therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that will immediately be made available for India. The United States also is pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis.”Fund to boost vaccine productionThe US also said the US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is funding a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer in India, enabling BioE to ramp up to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022.“Additionally, the United States is deploying an expert team of public health advisors from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID to work in close collaboration with the US Embassy, India’s health ministries, and India’s Epidemic Intelligence Service staff,” it said.The USAID and the CDC will also “fast-track the mobilisation of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund”.Voices of solidarity for IndiaThe US Vice-President also took to Twitter to reaffirm her country’s support for India to fight the pandemic and lauded the healthcare workers.The U.S. is working closely with the Indian government to rapidly deploy additional support and supplies during an alarming COVID-19 outbreak. As we provide assistance, we pray for the people of India—including its courageous healthcare workers.Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi called the Biden Administration's commitment to export raw materials needed for life-saving vaccines to India as an “essential first step”.The Biden Administration's commitment to export raw materials needed for life-saving vaccines to India is an essential first step, but we must double down by also shipping AstraZeneca vaccine doses, oxygen concentrators, and other supplies in our stockpiles not being used. pic.twitter.com/YaZrGXOwzeLast week, the Indian-American Congressman called on President Biden's administration to release doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to countries currently experiencing massive and deadly surges in the spread of Covid-19, including India."We are currently sitting on close to 40 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine in the US stockpile, a stockpile which we're not using and which we've already opened to combat Covid19 in Mexico and Canada," Krishnamoorthi said in a statement.India gets global supportMedical support to India from countries like the US, France, UAE, Denmark, Singapore Israel and some EU nations has started to come in as New Delhi stood firm with the democratic world in supply of much needed drugs and vaccines.On Monday, 318 oxygen concentrators were dispatched from New York to India on a special Air India flight to New Delhi.ALSO READ: Vaccine Maitri pays off, US medical supplies on way to IndiaIndian Ambassador to the US Taranjit Singh Sandhu thanked both US Secretary of State Tony Blinken and Sullivan for their prompt response.

Google & Googlers are providing ₹135 Crore in funding to @GiveIndia, @UNICEF for medical supplies, orgs supporting high-risk communities, and grants to help spread critical information."India reported 3.52 lakh fresh coronavirus cases in the last 24 hours. This is the highest single-day spike registered since the onset of the pandemic.Pichai's tweet also had a link to a blog where Google detailed ways to help in with their efforts to fight the worsening situation.On the blog, Sanjay Gupta, country head and VP, Google India wrote, "Today we're announcing ₹135 crore (USD 18 million) in new funding for India. This includes two grants from Google.org, Google's philanthropic arm, totalling ₹20 crore (USD 2.6 million). The first is to GiveIndia to provide cash assistance to families hit hardest by the crisis to help with their everyday expenses. The second will go to UNICEF to help get urgent medical supplies, including oxygen and testing equipment, to where it's needed most in India. It also includes donations from our ongoing employee giving campaign -- so far more than 900 Googlers have contributed ₹3.7 Crore (USD 500,000) for organizations supporting high-risk and marginalized communities."Moreover, Gupta also informed about Ad Grant support for public health information campaigns."This funding also includes increased Ad Grant support for public health information campaigns.

26-04-2021||India||US returned the favour with Covid-19 aid package for India, says Biden||US President Joe Biden on Sunday made it clear that the assistance offered by his administration to India to combat Covid-19 is in exchange for India’s aid earlier. He added the US was “determined” to help India, seeking to push back on narrative that his administration was late to come to India’s rescue.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need,” Biden wrote in a tweet Sunday, re-tweeting a post from his National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan, who announced the assistance after a phone call with his Indian counterpart Ajit Doval.People familiar with the discussions leading up to the announcement on both sides echoed the framing of the assistance as a gesture between partners, with the US returning the favour this time.Biden did not specify in the tweet, but he meant the assistance announced by his administration Sunday was similar in nature — and reciprocal — to the lifting of an export ban by India to release a consignment of hydroxychloroquine by Prime Minister Narendra Modi in April last year at the personal urging of President Donald Trump.Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug, was being used as a prophylactic in some quarters against the virus that causes Covid-19. President Trump however, touted it as a “game changer” in his bid to put behind the epidemic, which he saw as a drag on his re-election chances.Trump forced Modi to release a consignment of hydroxychloroquine last April despite the export ban, with a threat of retaliation. India made an exception for Trump and released the consignment. He subsequently took a course of the drug after a possible exposure.Also Read | 10 states account for 74.5% of new Covid-19 cases in India. All you need to knowThe exception made by Modi then was similar to the one made by Biden to release raw materials for vaccines, in contravention of restrictions in force since February, when Biden had invoked the Defense Production Act to make it mandatory for American suppliers of these raw materials to prioritise orders placed by American buyers, over those by outsiders, such as India.“Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, the United States is determined to help India in its time of need,” US national security council spokesperson Emily Horne said, announcing US support and supplies for India.People familiar with these talks and developments said the first shipments of US supplies announced Sunday could be landing in India as earlier as this week, including the most urgently pressing of them all: oxygen, which has been in short supply in hospitals around the country in India.The United States and India are looking at four options currently on how best to address this issue: oxygen concentrators, which are fan-like devices that enhance oxygen content in a room; oxygen generator plants, small units to supply small clusters of recipient structures such as hospital; oxygen cylinders, which are apparently in short supply in India; and containers to ship oxygen, like the cryogenic container supplied to India by Singapore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-returned-the-favour-with-covid-19-aid-package-for-india-says-biden-101619417590144.html

Owing to this, Sidhu who was arrested on February 9 in connection with the Red Fort violence on January 26 during the farmers' tractor parade against the Centre's three farm laws, can walk free if not arrested in any other case. In its bail order, the court said that Sidhu's "further incarceration in the present case would bear no fruit and therefore would be unjustified." Sidhu was granted bail on a personal bond of Rs. 25,000 with one surety of like amount by the court. In its order, the court observed, "The prosecution seeks to make an example out of the case of the accused, he being a popular public figure, such an endeavour however hazards a failure of justice as a result of compromised objectivity’.""The sweeping power of investigation does not warrant subjecting a citizen each time to fresh investigation by the police in respect of the same incident, giving rise to one or more cognizable offences, consequent upon filing of successive FIRs whether before or after filing the final report," the order added. The court also noted that Sidhu had already been interrogated in police custody for 14 days and been in custody for about 70 days when he has been granted regular bail in the first case earlier this month by a local court in Delhi. After the bail then, Sidhu was arrested again on the same day on the basis of an FIR filed by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in connection with Republic Day violence. Remarking on the bail granted to Sidhu on April 17, the court said in its order, "The need and timing of the arrest is highly questionable because despite knowing that the accused has been lodged in JC since 09.02.2021, he was arrested only on 17.04.2021, when he was granted regular bail in FIR No.96/2021. This clearly suggests that it was an attempt to defeat the bail order dated 16.04.2021 of the Ld. ASJ and is a grave affront to personal liberty of the accused and runs foul of rights guaranteed under Article 21."Sidhu, who is a Punjabi actor was arrested on charges of inciting protesters during the tractor rally which was organised by farmers protesting against the three contentious farm bills on Republic Day. The rally turned violent with farmers breaking police barricades and clashing with the personnel at several places. Hundreds of farmers also stormed Red Fort, damaged property and clashed with the policemen there.Thousands of farmers, mostly from Punjab, Haryana and western Uttar Pradesh, have been camping at three border points of Delhi- Singhu, Tikri (along Haryana), and Ghazipur- demanding a repeal of the three farm laws enacted by the Centre in September last year. The three contentious laws include the Farmers' Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Act.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deep-sidhu-accused-in-jan-26-violence-granted-bail-by-delhi-court-in-2nd-case-101619415930575.html

UAE is sending a huge shipment of oxygen concentrators and Saudi Arabia large number of oxygen generators to India.While both Indian and US interlocutors noted the insensitivity of US spokesperson's earlier remarks on supply of raw material, Washington’s decision to support India’s fight against the raging pandemic on Sunday night came after National Security Advisor Ajit Doval spoke to his US counterpart Jake Sullivan in a detailed conversation.“The United States has identified sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India,” said a statement issued by NSC spokesperson Emily Horne on Sullivan’s conversation with Doval.The statement also said the US is working “around the clock to deploy available resources and supplies”.US President Joe Biden in his tweet said: “Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need.” The US President attached the conversation between Doval and Sullivan to his tweet.Just as India sent assistance to the United States as our hospitals were strained early in the pandemic, we are determined to help India in its time of need. https://t.co/SzWRj0eP3yAt the instructions of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, both Doval and external affairs minister S Jaishankar have been talking to the US and other Indian allies like UAE and Saudi Arabia. It is understood, that while Doval spoke to Saudi Arabia and UAE, Jaishankar has been in touch with EU, particularly France, for seeking help with oxygen concentrators, Remdesivir and raw materials for producing vaccines.According to official sources, UAE has informed India that it is sending a huge consignment of oxygen concentrators, while Saudi Arabia is sending oxygen generators with promise of more support. However, the US has offered all support and shipments will be flying from its bases in the Indo-Pacific. “The India-US ties remain as close as ever,” said a top official.A statement by the White House on the conversation between Doval and Sullivan further read, “To help treat Covid-19 patients and protect front-line health workers in India, the United States has identified supplies of therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators, and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) that will immediately be made available for India. The United States also is pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis.”The US also said the US Development Finance Corporation (DFC) is funding a substantial expansion of manufacturing capability for BioE, the vaccine manufacturer in India, enabling BioE to ramp up to produce at least 1 billion doses of Covid-19 vaccines by the end of 2022.“Additionally, the United States is deploying an expert team of public health advisors from the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and USAID to work in close collaboration with the US Embassy, India’s health ministries, and India’s Epidemic Intelligence Service staff,” it said.The USAID and the CDC will also “fast-track the mobilisation of emergency resources available to India through the Global Fund”.US Vice-President also took to Twitter to reaffirm her country’s support for India to fight the pandemic.The U.S. is working closely with the Indian government to rapidly deploy additional support and supplies during an alarming COVID-19 outbreak.

However, they maintain that the case fatality rate of the state is in control.Also Read | 16 critical Covid-19 patients rescued after fire at Gujarat hospitalDr Subhash Salunkhe, former director general of health services in the state and advisor to the state on the Covid-19, said with sheer number of infections, a large chunk of them will land up in hospitals. “Roughly 10% of the cases usually are clinical cases. In that, there are late arrivals which make it difficult for doctors to save lives. There could be some stray cases of deaths due to oxygen shortage, but it is not the main factor.”Dr Shashank Joshi, state Covid task force member, said the sheer load on the healthcare infrastructure could hinder providing treatment to all, which could result in deaths. “The deaths, in absolute numbers have gone up, but compared to last year, our case fatality rate is lower. When you see the healthcare infrastructure clobbered, due to lack of ability to provide healthcare, deaths tend to go up,” he said.Mumbai, meanwhile, continued to see a dip in daily cases, with 5,498 fresh cases on Sunday. Over the past three days, the city saw a steady decline in cases 7,367 (April 22), 7,199 (April 23), and 5,867 (April 24). It also reported 64 deaths, pushing death toll to 12,790.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-cases-continue-to-rise-maharashtra-tally-rises-to-66191-101619406970321.html
26-04-2021||India||Odisha announces free vaccine for 19.3mn people in 18-45 years group||Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Sunday announced free vaccination for nearly 19.3 million residents, aged between18 and 45 years, in the third phase of the Covid-19 inoculation drive, at an estimated cost of ₹2,000 crore.It was announced even as state officials feared the number of daily infections could go past the 10,000-mark by May first week, registering higher mortalities than the first wave, before declining significantly from June first week. With 6,599 new cases reported on Monday, the number of active cases in the state raced towards 50,000-mark, far higher than last year's peak.So far 17 Indian states including Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Kerala, Goa, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Tamil Nadu have decided to vaccinate their population against the coronavirus disease free of cost. As on Sunday, the disease has killed 192,311 people in the country. The third phase of vaccination will begin from May 1.Health department officials said the state has placed orders for 37.7mn Covishield doses from Serum Institute and 1.034mn doses of Covaxin from Bharat Biotech. Odisha State Medical Corporation will procure the vaccines from the two manufacturers at the prices fixed by them. Covaxin was being administered only to people in Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation area while Covishield was being used in the rest of Odisha.Patnaik said if the people do not become aware of their responsibilities, the government will not be able to fight against the pandemic all on its own. "I request you with folded hands to religiously follow all Covid appropriate protocols. Wear masks, maintain social distancing at all costs. Until very necessary, do not go out of the house. I request everyone to realise (that) this (is) a grave situation that we are currently going through. For me each and every life is precious,” he saidDue to the massive rise in Covid cases, the daily oxygen consumption in the state has surpassed the peak demand during the first wave of the pandemic last year. The peak oxygen demand in the Covid-ICUs was 23 metric tonne (MT) per day last year, but it has now gone past 37 MT per day."We expect the daily cases to cross 10,000 by the first week or latest by the second week of May and then plateau out for the entire month. Cases would start declining significantly from June first week," said a senior health official, giving a sense of the challenges ahead.While Odisha has ample oxygen supply due to the presence of steel plants in the state, officials said the surge in Covid cases would still overwhelm the health infrastructure. "Though we have over 20,000 Covid beds in dedicated hospitals, Covid care centres, the caregivers are tired after battling the pandemic for over a year. There is a limit to which the healthcare workers can be stretched. They are trying their best to deal with the rising cases, but it is not easy," said a senior health official.State industry secretary Hemant Sharma said Odisha is currently producing 350 tonne of liquid medical oxygen everyday in public sector and private sector steel plants at Rourkela, Angul, Dhenkanal and Kalinga Nagar. "Of the 350 tonne, we need 70 tonne everyday while 80 tonnes are being kept as dead storage. The rest 200 tonne are being sent to other states through tankers. If necessary, the oxygen production can be ramped up in no time," said Sharma.Dr Sarit Kumar Rout, additional professor of Public Health Foundation of India, said though the health infrastructure in Odisha is adequate for the time being, it may not stand up to scrutiny when the expected peak comes in May first week."If we would have 10,000 cases and half of them require hospitalisation, the current bed availability may not be enough. But more importantly, we don't have adequate medical manpower to deal with rising cases. As it is, the distribution of medical manpower is skewed with urban areas having all the experts such as medicine specialists and pulmonologists. How would critical Covid patients get treatment in rural areas where pulmonary doctors and medicine specialists are almost absent," asked Rout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-announces-free-vaccine-for-19-3mn-people-in-18-45-years-group-101619406370412.html

The flight ban will be in place until at least 00:01 a.m. on May 1," Sputnik quoted Dutch Aviation Ministry's statement.India is witnessing a deadly Covid-19 wave, with the country reporting over three lakh daily cases from the last few days. The country on Sunday reported 3,49,391 new Covid-19 cases and 2,767 deaths According to the union health ministry, five states -- Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Karnataka, Gujarat and Kerala -- contribute 54 per cent of the cases.The flight ban was announced on Sunday night after the Cabinet received new advice from public health agency RIVM, NL Times reported citing Infrastructure Minister Cora van Nieuwenhuizen in a letter to Parliament."The epidemiological situation on the ground is very serious," she wrote. The minister noted that there are several variants of the coronavirus there, and there are many uncertainties about their "infectivity, pathogenic capability, and possible reduced protection of antibodies after vaccination or a previous infection".The flight ban is set to expire on May 1, unless the Cabinet decides to extend it during meetings next week. Cargo flights and flights with medical personnel will be exempted from the ban.With the Covid-19 situation worsening, many countries have imposed travel restrictions on travellers from India.France had on Wednesday imposed a 10-day quarantine for travellers arriving from India in the coming days to prevent the spread of a Covid-19 variant found in India.Recently, the United Kingdom added India to its travel "red list" on a precautionary basis after reporting 103 cases of a coronavirus variant first identified in India.The Russian Embassy's visa section temporarily ceased its operations until further notice due to India's Covid-19 situation, it announced on Monday.As Covid-19 cases soar, the United States has also issued a 'Level 4 (Very High)' warning for potential travellers to India asking them to "avoid all travel" to the country even if they are fully vaccinated.Hong Kong had on Tuesday announced the suspension of all flights connecting with India for 14 days amid the rising number of Covid-19 cases in the region. The authorities have also suspended flights from Pakistan and the Philippines.Canada has also temporarily banned passenger flights from India for 30 days from Thursday amid rising coronavirus cases in the two countries.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-netherlands-suspends-flights-from-india-till-may-1-101619404230246.html
26-04-2021||India||Indian and French navies begin 3-day wargame in Arabian Sea||The Indian and French navies on Sunday kicked off a three-day mega wargame in the Arabian Sea in the backdrop of rising concern over China's growing maritime presence in the Indian Ocean region.The French Navy has deployed its nuclear-powered aircraft carrier Charles de Gaulle, and its entire carrier strike group in the exercise, reflecting the seriousness of the drill.The French Embassy said the 19th edition of the Varuna exercise underscores the shared interests and commitment of both nations in promoting maritime security in the Indo-Pacific and bears testimony to the vitality of the bilateral strategic partnership."The joint exercise comprises various drills across the spectrum of maritime operations, with the goal of fostering interoperability and mutual learning between the two navies and reinforcing their capability for joint action in a strategic area," it said in a statement.The Indian Navy has deployed guided missile stealth destroyer Kolkata, guided missile frigates Tarkash and Talwar, fleet support ship Deepak, a Kalvari class submarine and a sleet of P-8I long range maritime patrol aircraft, officials said.Besides Charles de Gaulle, the French naval assets at the exercise included multi-mission frigate Provence, air defence destroyer Chevalier Paul, and command and supply ship Var.The Charles de Gaulle with a displacement of 42,500 tons (four times the weight of the Eiffel tower), carries a crew of 1200, 15.4 per cent of whom are women, and an air wing consisting of 20 Rafale marine jets, two E-2C Hawkeye aircraft and several helicopters.Its 75-meter deck with catapult launching enables the launch of Rafale marine jets in less than three seconds every 30 seconds.Indian Navy Spokesperson Commander Vivek Madhwal said both the navies will endeavour to enhance and hone their war-fighting skills to demonstrate their ability as an integrated force to promote peace, security and stability in the maritime domain.The embassy said Varuna exercise is part of the French carrier strike group's 'CLEMENCEAU 21' deployment, which the French Navy is conducting from February to June 2021 in the eastern Mediterranean, the Gulf and the Indian Ocean."Its goal is to contribute to the stabilisation of these strategic zones and strengthening cooperation with the navies of partner countries, in particular India for the Indian Ocean component," it said.As part of this deployment, the carrier strike group is also taking part in anti-ISIS operations," the embassy said.Initiated in 1983, Indo-French naval cooperation plays a key role in the two countries' joint vision for a free, open and inclusive Indo-Pacific, it said."It has intensified in recent years with increasingly ambitious joint exercises that have raised the degree of the two navies' interoperability to a new level," the embassy said."In early April, the Indian Navy took part for the first time in the France-led naval exercise 'La Perouse' with the navies of the United States, Australia and Japan," it added.The Indian side at the exercise is being led by Rear Admiral Ajay Kochhar, Flag Officer Commanding Western Fleet, while the French side is headed by Rear Admiral Marc Aussedat, Commander Task Force 473."The three-day exercise will see high tempo-naval operations at sea, including advanced air defence and anti-submarine exercises, intense fixed and rotary wing flying operations, tactical manoeuvres, surface and anti-air weapon firings and other maritime security operations," Commander Madhwal said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-and-french-navies-begin-3-day-wargame-in-arabian-sea-101619403747305.html

26-04-2021||India||2nd wave a storm: PM Modi||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Sunday assured people that the central government is helping states overcome the Covid pandemic with all its “might” and urged citizens to get vaccinated at a time when the “storm” of infections has “shaken the country”.The explosion of cases is “testing our patience; it is testing the limits of all of us at enduring misery…”, the Prime Minister said in his monthly radio address Mann Ki Baat, adding: “After successfully confronting the first wave of corona, the country was full of enthusiasm, full of self-confidence, but this storm has shaken the country.”PM Modi’s remarks come at a time India has topped all global records of daily new cases and several states – including the national capital – are reeling under a massive caseload of infections amid scarcity of hospital beds and oxygen supplies. India on Sunday breached the 350,000 mark for daily Covid-19 cases, and daily deaths linked to the viral illness (at 2,808) neared 3,000 per day threshold, according to HT’s dashboard.Asserting that the Centre is backing the efforts of the state governments, Modi said: “The Government of India is applying its entire might to give a fillip to the endeavours of State Governments. The State Governments too are trying their best to fulfil their responsibilities.”The Centre and state governments across the country have been criticised for being caught off-guard by the recent surge of infections. Last week, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal appealed to PM Modi to direct neighbouring states not to obstruct the supply of medical oxygen to the Capital city. The city administration has also sought the Centre’s help to get its full quota of oxygen supply to meet rising demand for the element that is crucial for the treatment of Covid-19 patients.Hospitals and medical facilities across the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) on Sunday continued to send distress calls seeking replenishment of their oxygen stocks. A day before, a hospital in Delhi’s Rohini said 20 Covid-19 patients, mostly in the critical care unit of the facility, died as oxygen pressure dipped while they were waiting for their stock to be renewed.Modi has chaired several high-level meetings to discuss boosting the supply of medical equipment and on Sunday, the Prime Minister’s Office announced that 551 oxygen generation plants financed by the PM CARES fund will be set up in states and Union territories across India.Separately, the Centre also scrapped basic customs duty and health cess on oxygen and oxygen-related equipment to ease imports and ramp up supply.In his 30-minute address on Sunday, Modi spoke to doctors, nurses and frontline workers who shared their experience and views on battling the viral illness that has infected over 17.3 million people in India so far.He also said that the 76th edition of his address was focused only on the pandemic because the country’s “biggest priority is to defeat the disease”.In this regard, he urged all people to get vaccinated at the earliest as phase 3 of the drive – covering all adults – begins on May 1, and warned against heeding rumours against inoculations.“In this period of Corona crisis, all are getting aware of the importance of vaccine … so it is my appeal that don’t get swayed by any rumour about the vaccine... I once again urge all of you to get vaccinated and we also have to take full care. Dawai bhi, Kadai bhi – (get vaccinated and maintain all precautions),” Modi said.The Prime Minister reiterated that people should avail the Centre’s “free vaccine” programme, which is “going on” and “will continue further” too.From May 1, all people over the age of 18 will be eligible to get the coronavirus shots and the vaccines can be sold by manufacturers directly to the state governments and to private hospitals at pre-decided prices. Along with this, the central government will continue to procure vaccines and administer jabs for free at government-run medical facilities.“I appeal also to the states to extend the benefit of this free vaccine campaign of government of India to maximum number of the people of their state,” he said, adding: “This time, for emerging victorious in this battle, we have to accord priority to expert and scientific advice.”While Prime Minister Modi’s address was ongoing, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi launched an offensive with his “Jan ki Baat” tweet as he urged his party workers to provide aid to people at this difficult time.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-wave-a-storm-pm-modi-101619389439422.html

A total of 2,808 new deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Sunday, the highest ever in the country, pushing the total number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 195,137, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.Sunday was the fifth day running that the single-day cases in the country have broken all previous global records. India’s outbreak became the world’s largest ever on record earlier this week when the country’s daily tally breached the 300,00 mark for the first time on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-caseload-hits-all-time-high-as-3-54-709-test-covid-19-positive-101619389211981.html
26-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What really matters||What really matters? No, it’s not what you think.When a country is faced with a pandemic such as the coronavirus disease, the priorities (for both State and individuals) write themselves — health, well-being, economy, education, then everything else. The phrasing may vary, but the priorities, and their order, largely remain the same.In India, for some time, it looked like the response of the Union and state governments, and also of people, was ideal. Governments scrambled to strengthen health infrastructure. And people, at least those who could afford to, hunkered down to stay safe and abided by the 68-day lockdown. The Centre announced a stimulus programme, although it was criticised by some for an over-emphasis on monetary measures over fiscal ones. It also tried to make life better for the poor, although it mishandled the migrant labour situation till at least May 1 (when it launched special trains for migrant workers to return home).Case numbers rose sharply after the lockdown, despite restrictions remaining in place, but by September, India had seen off the peak of the first wave. The festive season passed without incident. The Bihar elections came and went, and cases continued to fall. By early February, India’s cases were well off their peak, and its vaccine programme was underway. The economy was almost where it was before the pandemic (Nomura’s NIBRI, a business resumption index, touched 99.3 in the week of February 21; 100 indicates pre-pandemic level of business activity).But, by then, things had already started to go wrong.By the end of 2020, people were partying and vacationing. Schools reopened for physical classes in many parts of the country. Restaurants, bars, malls, and multiplexes all rushed to make up for lost time (and money). Emboldened by the low Covid-19 footprint of the Bihar elections — the state’s testing has always been suspect given the predominant use of rapid antigen tests — the Election Commission decided to hold elections in four states and a Union territory.All parties participated enthusiastically. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), especially, pulled out all the stops, scenting victory in West Bengal, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi donning the avatar of campaigner-in-chief. It was only in the third week of April that the BJP finally decided it would no longer hold large rallies. And it was only on April 22 that the PM decided the situation warranted his presence in New Delhi, and cancelled a campaign trip — this was a day after India crossed 300,000 daily cases for the first time, and recorded 2,102 deaths, its highest till then.Uttarakhand decided to go ahead with the Mahakumbh, which had a high probability of turning into a classic super-spreader event. The Centre did nothing to stop the state. A belated appeal from the PM to observe the festival in spirit (and without the usual crowds) went out only on April 17.The second wave broke in late February, and is continuing to rage. On Thursday, cases touched 332,394 and the death toll was 2,255. By Saturday, it went up to 349,158 and 2,759, respectively. Both numbers are likely under-reported; the first because many of those infected remain asymptomatic and testing is inadequate, and the second because states appear to have instructed hospitals to not record Covid-19 as the cause of death. And NIBRI’s latest value, for the week ending April 18, stood at 83.8.The one thing that could have delayed, may be even prevented, the second wave was a more aggressive vaccine drive. Challenging as the logistics are, the reason why India didn’t push for more vaccinations was perhaps because no one saw the second wave coming. India’s approach to vaccines was unlike that of the United States, which pumped billions of dollars into companies developing vaccines — it was among the few things the Trump administration got spectacularly right. Only on April 19 did the finance ministry sanction ₹4,500 crore as credit to the two vaccine makers (SII and Bharat Biotech).And the one thing that could have warned of a coming second wave was sequencing of enough viral genomes to track the mutating variants of the virus that are clearly responsible (in some measure), for it — and India wasn’t and isn’t sequencing enough.All decisions involve trade-offs and those made by India’s political leadership, officials, and citizens, are accurate indicators of what really matters to them.For the leadership, this has clearly been politics and the economy. It’s almost as if it was alright for India to lose if that’s what it took for elections to be held in four states. And as cases surged, states delayed instituting curbs that would have prevented spikes in infections (they didn’t, the spikes happened, cases overran health systems, and then the states locked down, resulting in even more damage to the economy).For those managing India’s Covid-19 response, the only thing that matters appears to be validation. For some of the rich, or young, or both, it was having a good time even amid the pandemic. For the faithful, it was religion, and few political leaders dared criticise them for fear of offending an existing or potential vote bank. Even a state that touts its progressiveness, Kerala, hemmed and hawed before finally deciding to scale down the Thrissur Pooram festival.And so, at a time when only science and data should have driven all decisions, we allowed ourselves to be driven by politics and religion and short-term economic concerns, sought instant gratification by flocking to Goa or Nainital, and when challenged, validated our actions by pointing to dubious science or data that showed India was doing better than other countries.The results of this are all around. As a famous band once sang, “If you plant ice, you’re gonna harvest wind.” This is a whirlwind.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-really-matters-101619387950824.html
26-04-2021||India||Defence PSUs, OFBs go full steam ahead to fight Covid||Defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) and the Ordnance Factory Board (OFB) are firing on all cylinders to help state governments fight the Covid-19 crisis that is worsening by the day and has stretched the country’s health resources, people familiar with the developments said on Sunday.State-run plane maker Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) has started work on setting up a 250-bed Covid-19 hospital in Lucknow, with the facility expected to be functional in early May, the defence ministry said in a statement, detailing steps being taken by DPSUs and OFB to help state governments deal with the deadly second wave of the pandemic.HAL has already set up two Covid-19 facilities in Bengaluru with 250 and 180 beds each. It will now focus on providing more ventilators and oxygen points at both Lucknow and Bengaluru.It has also operationalised a 70-bed facility in Odisha’s Koraput and a 40-bed hospital in Maharashtra’s Nashik.The OFB is providing Covid-19 care at its medical facilities in 25 locations scattered across Maharashtra, West Bengal, Madhya Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Odisha and Uttarakhand, the official statement said.“It (OFB) has earmarked nearly 60% its existing strength for Covid care…813 beds out of a total of 1,405 are now reserved for Covid patients… In this hour of crisis, they (OFB and DPSUs) are catering to the civilian population from their existing services in coordination with the state governments,” it added.The OFB is the country’s main producer of military arsenal. It controls 41 ordnance factories engaged in the production of tanks, armoured personnel carriers, bombs, rockets, artillery guns, anti-aircraft guns, parachutes, small arms and clothing for soldiers.DPSUs are fast-tracking the procurement of oxygen plants for state government hospitals under their corporate social responsibility (CSR) scheme. These include Bharat Dynamics Limited (BDL), BEML Limited, HAL, Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders Limited (MDL), Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) Limited and MIDHANI.On Saturday, defence minister Rajnath Singh said the armed forces and the defence ministry “will leave no stone unturned in providing all possible assistance to the civilian administration”.The DRDO is among the organisations that are at the forefront of fighting the pandemic that has ripped through the country.It has so far set up or is in the process of setting up state-of-the-art Covid-19 hospitals in six cities to treat more than 3,100 critical patients.The Indian Air Force (IAF) has also intensified its efforts for Covid-19 relief, with its transport aircraft ferrying large oxygen containers to filling stations in different parts of the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/defence-psus-ofbs-go-full-steam-ahead-to-fight-covid-101619387722158.html
26-04-2021||India||Free vaccines for all in Rajasthan, Maharashtra decision soon||Rajasthan on Sunday joined at least 17 other states and Union territories in India to have announced to administer vaccine against the coronavirus disease free of cost to all adult population in the third phase of the vaccination drive starting on May 1, even as the Maharashtra government said that a decision on the matter was likely soon.Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot on Sunday announced the state government will provide free Covid-19 vaccine to people above 18 years of age. He said the state government will spend about ₹ 3,000 crore on the exercise. “The state government will provide free coronavirus vaccine to all people above 18 years of age in the state at the cost of about ₹3,000 crore,” Gehlot said.Maharashtra minority affairs minister Nawab Malik, meanwhile, said that the issue was discussed at a cabinet meeting and a consensus regarding free vaccination for the state’s adult population was reached. “The state will require around 140 million vials to get this done and are planning it accordingly… Deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar on Saturday has said that they will call a global tender and will select the bidder that will provide the best vaccine at a lower price,” Malik said.“We all had urged that the vaccine should be free for all. However, the decision has to be taken by the chief minister Uddhav Thackeray,” said revenue minister Balasaheb Thorat.The statements from the two ministers came hours after a series of tweets by various state ministers announcing the government’s decision of providing free vaccinations were deleted.Last week, Chhattisgarh, Bihar, Madhya Pradesh, Kerala and Sikkim said they will vaccinate the adult populations for free.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/free-vaccines-for-all-in-rajasthan-maharashtra-decision-soon-101619381513008.html
26-04-2021||India||UP to procure 10mn Covid vaccine doses||Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Sunday informed that an order for 10 million Covid-19 vaccine doses has been placed for the third phase of the vaccination drive beginning May 1.“Uttar Pradesh government has placed an order for 1 crore doses of anti-Covid vaccines for the vaccination drive beginning May 1,” the CM tweeted.“An order of 50-50 lakh doses has been placed for both indigenous vaccine manufacturers. In addition, the dose will be made available by the Government of India. A comprehensive action plan is being prepared in this regard,” he added.The Centre on April 19 had announced a ‘’liberalised’’ policy, making all above 18 years of age eligible to get vaccinated from May 1. It has also allowed state governments and private hospitals to purchase vaccines from manufacturers.Meanwhile, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh on Sunday wrote to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, urging for an increase in the state’s medical oxygen quota. This is the second time in as many days when the chief minister has written to the Centre, highlighting depleting supplies.Currently, the daily consumption of medical oxygen in the state is around 200 metric tonnes (MT), which is expected to rise to around 250-300 MT in the next two weeks. The CM directed chief secretary Vini Mahajan to pursue the matter with the Centre, with the caseload increasing due to an influx of patients from neighbouring states, pushing up the demand for medical oxygen, a statement said.Odisha chief minister Naveen Patnaik on Sunday announced free Covid vaccination for all above the age of 18, days before the nationwide drive to inoculate a vast population is launched.Immediately after Patnaiks announcement, the state government placed an order for over 38 million doses of vaccines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-to-procure-10mn-covid-vaccine-doses-101619380793648.html
26-04-2021||India||Why the second wave nudges us to Bhopal||We have all spent sleepless nights during the last few weeks, as the second wave of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) unfolded. We tried being useful, without becoming infected. Even for a healthy person, it’s been a difficult time.Amidst all of this, one is reminded of the 1984 Bhopal Gas Tragedy. What was it like to wake up, choked? To be attacked by a killer in the air? Watch your loved ones die? My father would routinely quiz me on the news of the day, before dinner, after school homework. The day after the gas leak, he asked what I thought about it. He answered the question himself, saying approximately that it was a tragedy of the highest order.Looking around today at the intensity of the pandemic, I wonder if Indians would have reacted differently if the Bhopal Gas Tragedy happened not in the past, but after COVID? Would there be more empathy, help and voice? We can’t sequence history differently, but we can lend heft to the needs of the Bhopal Gas victims.The toxics still flow in their water, leaving multiple generations gravely ill. Genuine compensation and punishment is still elusive. Toxics still flow unabated into the ecosystem, poisoning people. Having collectively experienced loss and injustice in recent times, do we not owe support to those who need it to recover and move on from the world’s worst industrial disaster? As we heal from the pandemic, shall we not seek healing for all others?||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-the-second-wave-nudges-us-to-bhopal-101619380407511.html
26-04-2021||India||SC judge Mohan Shantanagoudar dies after prolonged illness at 62||Supreme Court judge Mohan M Shantanagoudar, 62, passed away on Saturday night at a hospital in Gurugram after a prolonged illness, the apex court’s administration said on Sunday.He was elevated to the Supreme Court in February 2017 from the Kerala high court, where he served as the chief justice. He had a tenure in the apex court till May 5, 2023.One of his closet colleagues in the Supreme Court, justice Vineet Saran, with whom justice Shantanagoudar shared the Supreme Court bench in his last working days, still remembers the last coffee he had with justice Shantanagoudar. “When I went over for a cup of coffee with him recently, he (justice Shantanagoudar) was as lively as he always had been... although not as strong. I had known him since our days at the Karnataka high court which was his parent high court. We shared an excellent rapport. Even as Supreme Court judges, our houses were right opposite each other in Delhi. And the deal was to meet as often as we could,” recounted justice Saran.Recalling some fond memories about justice Shantanagoudar, justice Saran told HT that he was enamoured by the late judge’s sense of humour. “Off the bench or on it, justice Santanagoudar would often come up with a great sense of humour. He brought liveliness to the regular court proceedings. We would break into laughter along with the lawyers and the pressure of the proceedings was out. I feel privileged to have sat with him on the bench during his last days,” he said.Justice Shantanagoudar, who was suffering from lung cancer and was also infected with Covid-19 last year, sat with justice Saran during the last four months. He was not able to speak properly after one side of his vocal cord was paralysed due to the cancer.“But justice Shanatanagoudar would still want to sit on the bench, hear arguments and will also want to write judgments. I would advise him not to exert so much. But he used to tell me that the court and the judgments kept him going. He said this kept him occupied,” reminisced justice Saran, who was there at Gurugram’s Medanta Hospital when justice Shantanagoudar breathed his last on Saturday at around 10.15pm. Justice Saran said he will remember justice Shantanagoudar as a compassionate man and an excellent, thorough judge.Chief Justice of India NV Ramana also issued a statement at his demise, expressing grief: “I was hoping for his speedy and complete recovery and his return to the bench at the earliest. The news of his passing has come as a rude shock. I have lost a valuable colleague.”Justice Shantanagoudar, during his short tenure, was associated with many significant judgments.Through a ruling in February, justice Shantagoudar obligated the banks to ensure safe custody of valuables in their lockers, holding that the banks cannot wash off their hands and claim that they bear no liability towards their customers for the operation of the locker.Authoring another important judgment, he showed his concerns for private liberty and said that trial courts were duty-bound to inform the accused about their right of default bail when the investigating agencies fail to complete the probe within the time limit mandated by law. In yet another judgment evoking concerns for personal liberty, a justice Shantanagoudar-led bench ruled that courts must not punish an accused if they have not been provided proper legal aid.When a man filed a habeas corpus petition for his wife who was lodged in a shelter home in Uttar Pradesh’s Bareilly against her wishes, justice Shantanagoudar recorded that a major woman must “live as per her wish” and ordered for her immediate release.Coming to the rescue of small farmers, justice Shantagoudar held in a judgment in March 2020 that a farmer is entitled to file a consumer complaint against a seed company for deficiency of service.Within a year of coming to the top court, he made his presence felt by going against the majority of two senior judges in a bunch of cases relating to land acquisition. While the two senior judges in February 2018 held an old judgment delivered by a bench of same strength of three judges as per incuriam (lacking in care), justice Shantanagoudar dissented with the majority view and said the case should be referred to a larger bench. This case was eventually decided by a larger bench of five judges, as he had opined.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-judge-mohan-shantanagoudar-dies-after-prolonged-illness-at-62-101619378108431.html
26-04-2021||India||Set up Covid helpline for hospital beds, states told||The Centre has directed the states to set up a centralised call centre-based service for allocation of hospital beds for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients, as people are facing acute bed shortages in many parts of the country because of rising cases.The states have also been asked to maintain a real-time record of available beds for the convenience of people looking for a hospital bed.Rajesh Bhushan, Union health secretary, held a high-level meeting with representatives of all states and Union territories regarding infrastructure augmentation for effective clinical treatment of hospitalised Covid-19 patients.The states were advised to review their existing hospital and other Covid-19 treatment infrastructure in the light of daily new cases, daily fatalities and those that would require hospitalisation.“Identify additional dedicated Covid-19 hospitals and prepare field hospital facilities either through DRDO, CSIR or similar agencies in the public and private sector… Deploy requisite Human Resources with proper Training & mentoring of doctors and nurses for management of patients and Strengthening ambulance services. Establish sufficient referral linkages for districts with deficit infrastructure through deployment of additional ambulances...,” the states were told.In terms of Covid-19 vaccination, the states were asked to make suitable arrangements for accommodating a large crowd as the cohort of eligible beneficiaries has been substantially increased to include those 18 years and above from May 1.“The states and UTs would have to make the necessary preparations, well in advance, to ensure that the eligible citizens are able to access the vaccination services seamlessly and conveniently. Since, the cohort of eligible beneficiaries has been significantly enhanced, suitable arrangements must be made to avoid overcrowding and consequent law and order situations at the vaccination centres,” Bhushan wrote to all states and Union territories.It will be mandatory for all government and private vaccination centres to register on the CoWIN platform, regardless of the source of vaccine doses. It will also be mandatory for all centres to record all vaccinations, issue digital vaccination certificates, and report all adverse events following immunisations on the Co-WIN system that is the backbone of the vaccine delivery management system.The eligibly criteria for any centre to conduct Covid-19 vaccinations remain the same. The facility should have sufficient cold chain equipment and capacity; sufficient room to act as the waiting, vaccination, and post vaccination observation area; sufficient number of vaccinators and verifiers; and ability to manage the adverse events following immunisation as per the norms.There is a special provision for registration of industrial establishments as vaccination centres provided they fulfil the criteria laid down by the Union health and family ministry.“Wherever an industrial establishment has a hospital that is eligible for registration as a Covid vaccination centre… it can register on CoWIN as an industrial establishment CVC, with mapping to any other existing private CVC… The state government may designate an appropriate authority at state/district level that will ensure only eligible facilities as per the criteria are registered on CoWIN as CVC.The designated authority must take a decision on registration, within in two days of the receipt of application…,” the health ministry has directed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/set-up-covid-helpline-for-hospital-beds-states-told-101619377931772.html

Hours later, the party announced the setting up of control rooms in Delhi and the states to assist people affected by Covid-19.“‘System’ failed, so it’s important to do Jan ki baat: In this crisis, the country needs responsible citizens. I request my Congress colleagues to leave all political work- just provide all help and ease the pain of our countrymen. This is the Dharma of the Congress family,” Gandhi appealed to his party colleagues.In another tweet, Gandhi posted a front page of The New York Times and criticised Modi. “Shroud the truth Deny oxygen shortage Underreport deaths GOI is doing everything... ...to save his fake image!” he tweeted.The Congress party has set up a four-member control room to assist people amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic as many call party leaders or local offices every day seeking help. The central control room, to be managed by Manish Chatrath, Pawn Khera, Ajoy Kumar and Gurdeep Sappal, will coordinate daily with the state units.Earlier, Indian Youth Congress (IYC) chief BV Srinivas set up a core team to help families of Covid-19 patient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/after-rahul-s-appeal-cong-sets-up-control-rooms-for-covid-aid-101619377087120.html

Both these steps are contingent on availability which, in turn, depends on technological prowess. But the most important clarification needed is this: Can the Government of India make funds needed for this enterprise available by suitable budgetary re-appropriations?” Gandhi said.“If yes, then surely it ought not to be necessary to make state governments buy the vaccines for free or subsidised distribution. And if no, will it divert the funds needed from all money-guzzling projects that can wait for better times?”Gandhi joined Communist leader Yechury in his plea and urged the government to suspend such projects and re-appropriate those sums to making , procuring and supplying vaccines to the states free of cost and make oxygen cylinders available as a national priority.“The production and distribution of vaccines and oxygen cylinders is more urgent today than the production and distribution of any product has ever been in independent India. And certainly more urgent than the building of refurbished government precincts, not to mention temples and mosques,” Gandhi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/gopalkrishna-gandhi-supports-yechury-s-free-covid-jabs-appeal-101619376787148.html
26-04-2021||India||ED money laundering probe likely against Deshmukh||The Enforcement Directorate (ED) is likely to launch a money laundering probe against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on the basis of a case registered by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), people familiar with the developments said on Sunday.Mandated to probe financial aspects in a scheduled offence, the central anti-money laundering agency is currently analysing the CBI case, which claims that Deshmukh and “unknown others” used their official position to obtain undue advantage, as well as influenced the transfers and postings in the Mumbai Police, as alleged by former city police commissioner Param Bir Singh.Singh said that Deshmukh asked suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze, currently behind bars in the February 25 Antilia explosives scare case as well as the alleged murder of businessman Mansukh Hiran on March 5, to collect ₹100 crore every month from hotels, bars and restaurants in Mumbai.The Bombay high court had asked CBI to look into the allegations as part of a preliminary enquiry. The premier anti-corruption agency found “prime facie” truth in these allegations after which the PE was converted into a regular case (FIR) on April 21 and agency teams raided Deshmukh’s residences in Mumbai and Nagpur on Saturday.“According to the allegations, the amount involved ( ₹100 crore every month) is huge and it is a case of public importance. We are looking into the CBI FIR. A call will be taken very soon,” said an ED officer who didn’t want to be named.Unlike CBI, ED can record statement of any person in a case under section 50 of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) and it is admissible as evidence in the court.CBI has alleged that Deshmukh not only took undue advantage in his position as the state home minister but was also aware of the fact that Vaze was being entrusted with all sensational and important cases of Mumbai Police, something officers want to further investigate as it may involve a money angle, said a CBI officer, requesting anonymity.The “unknown others” named by CBI in its FIR are suspected to be other government officials in Maharashtra who will now be probed formally. Several officers of the Mumbai Police are likely to soon receive summons from CBI.Nationalist Congress Party spokesperson and state minister Nawab Malik on Saturday called the action being taken in the alleged extortion racket case as politically motivated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ed-money-laundering-probe-likely-against-deshmukh-101619376607148.html
26-04-2021||India||Ensure liquid oxygen not used for any non-medical purpose: Centre to states||The Centre on Sunday directed states and Union territories to ensure that use of liquid oxygen is not allowed for any non-medical purpose and all manufacturing units must maximise their production to make it available for medical use only with “immediate effect until further orders.” There will be no exception for any industry, according to the order issued by the ministry of home affairs.Even the existing stock of liquid oxygen will also be diverted for medical purposes, the Centre ordered.This the government’s latest measure to ensure the uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen across the country as several states have reported a shortage of the gas to treat critically ill coronavirus disease patients amid rising deaths.“The Central Government has reviewed the oxygen supply situation and has decided that with immediate effect, use of liquid oxygen, including the existing stock, will be allowed for medical purposes only, and that all manufacturing units may be allowed to maximise their production of liquid oxygen, and make it available to the Government, for use for medical purposes only,” the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) letter to the states said.It added that “no exception is allowed to any industry with regard to use of liquid oxygen”.The ministry said it was considered necessary to restrict industrial usage of oxygen for ensuring availability of adequate and uninterrupted supply of medical oxygen across the country for management of Covid-19 patients and necessary order in this regard was issued on April 22 to restrict the use of industrial oxygen.Several states have been reporting a shortage of oxygen supply amid the Covid-19 surge.The government has also exempted customs duty on medical-grade oxygen, oxygen-related equipment and Covid-19 vaccines till July 31, 2021. It has granted full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess on import of 16 items related to oxygen and oxygen-related equipment.The government also said on Sunday it has directed all major ports to waive all charges for ships carrying oxygen and related equipment amid a massive surge in coronavirus infections across the country.The ministry of ports, shipping and waterways said it has directed all major ports to accord the highest priority in the berthing sequence to the vessels carrying consignments of medical grade oxygen, oxygen tanks, oxygen bottles, portable oxygen generators and oxygen concentrators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-liquid-oxygen-not-used-for-any-non-medical-purpose-centre-to-states-101619376427153.html

From Kavaratti, the ship continued with its mission to the Minicoy island for disembarkation of oxygen cylinders and medical supplies, Madhwal said.“Additionally, 41 empty oxygen cylinders from the islands have been embarked onboard Indian Navy hired vessel Meghna. The vessel is now headed to Kochi for refilling of the empty cylinders and will head back to Lakshadweep with filled cylinders soon to ensure that the Oxygen Express continues unabated,” he added.The navy has also reserved 10 beds for patients from Lakshadweep at INHS Sanjivani, Kochi, to cater to shortage of beds at the islands.The Indian Air Force (IAF) continued to ferry empty oxygen containers to filling stations on Sunday. “One C-17 aircraft airlifted two cryogenic oxygen tankers of 15000 litres capacity each from Gwalior air base to Ranch,” a defence ministry official said.The IAF has intensified its efforts for Covid-19 relief with its transport aircraft ferrying large oxygen containers to filling stations in different parts of the country, as previously reported by HT. The containers will be filled up and transported to different centres for Covid relief by rail or road. The IAF also ferried three containers from Jodhpur and Udaipur to Jamnagar as well as another three from Indore to Jamnagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warship-carries-medical-supplies-to-lakshadweep-for-covid-relief-101619376367083.html
26-04-2021||India||Can declare districts containment zones: Centre||The Centre has asked the states to declare cities, towns or districts reporting high disease burden as containment zones that would include those with a test positivity rate of 10% or more in the past one week, or bed occupancy of more than 60% on either oxygen-supported or intensive care unit beds, and impose measures such as night curfews.Focus will be on containment as a major approach to flatten the current curve of the disease.In a letter written to the states on Sunday, Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, “...fulfilling any one of the above two criteria should be considered for taking intensive action and local containment measures… primarily focusing on restricting intermingling of people for a period of 14 days for breaking the chain of transmission duly following epidemiological principles. Classification of districts requiring intensive action and local containment may be undertaken by the state on a weekly basis…”The State Nodal Officer should submit details of all such areas identified for local containment to the state government for approval.Intensive containment measures would include night curfew, which means movement of individuals shall be strictly prohibited during night hours, except for essential activities. The local administration shall decide the duration of the night curfew hours and issue orders, in the entire area of their jurisdiction, under appropriate provisions of law, and ensure strict compliance.Social, political, sports, entertainment, academic, cultural, religious, festival-related and other gatherings and congregations will be prohibited. All shopping complexes, cinema halls, restaurants and bars, sports complexes, gyms, spas, swimming pools and religious places will remain closed.Essential services and activities such as health care services, police, fire, banks, electricity, water and sanitation, regulated movement of public transport including all incidental services and activities needed for a smooth functioning of these activities will be allowed in both the public and the private sector.Public transport (railways, metros, buses, cabs) will operate at a maximum capacity of 50%; and there will be no restrictions on interstate and intrastate movement, including transportation of essential goods.The restrictions will continue for a period of 14 days.However, the Centre has asked states to make a public announcement, outlining the rationale for the same and the kind of restrictions that will be in place by also distributing a leaflet in the local language, if possible, highlighting the gravity of the situation and restrictions to be followed, before declaring a containment area.All offices, both government and private, will function with a maximum staff strength of 50%. All industrial and scientific establishments, both government and private will be allowed subject to the workforce following physical distancing norms. They shall also be tested through rapid antigen test, in case of individuals identified with flu-like symptoms, from time to time.Weddings (attended by up to 50 persons) and funerals or last rites (attended by up to 20 persons) will be allowed.All these measures will be in conjunction with the Centre’s fivefold strategy of test, track, isolate, treat, vaccinate strategy.A daily status report will be submitted by the district and municipal authorities to the state, and also shared with the central government on a regular basis.“A very high number of daily new Covid cases are being reported for the past few days. Considering this unprecedented surge, there is an urgent need for states to consider strict Covid management and control measures in surge areas to bring the situation under control,” the health secretary said in his letter.Experts in the field of epidemiology agreed.“The transmission rate is already high in some states. The reproduction number is 3.01 in Bihar, 2.81 in UP, over 2 in 8 other states. We need to implement aggressive containment strategy in avoiding 3 Cs: Crowd prevention and control strategies along with enforcement of masks and physical distancing closed spaces and close contact settings,” said Dr Giridhara R Babu, head, epidemiology, Indian Institute of Public Health.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/can-declare-districts-containment-zones-centre-101619376247859.html
26-04-2021||India||551 O2 plants to be set up via PM-Cares: PMO||The Prime Minister’s Office on Sunday gave “in-principle approval” for 551 dedicated medical oxygen generation plants at public health facilities across the country using the PM Cares fund, which was set up last year to collect donations to battle Covid-19, as cases of the infectious disease continued to see a steep rise across the country, with the health care infrastructure overwhelmed by the caseload, and life-saving supplies running low.Hospitals across the country are reporting shortages of medical oxygen and hospital beds as cases of Covid-19 continue to climb at an alarming rate.“In line with Prime Minister’s direction of boosting availability of oxygen to hospitals, the PM CARES Fund has given in-principle approval for allocation of funds for installation of 551 dedicated Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Medical Oxygen Generation Plants inside public health facilities in the country. PM has directed that these plants should be made functional as soon as possible,” the PMO said in a statement. “He said that these plants will serve as a major boost to oxygen availability at the district level,” the statement added.The Centre and state governments have faced criticism for being unable to provide ample medical oxygen as the health care infrastructure in the country continues to crumble under the weight of new infections, which have crossed the world’s highest single-day tally with nearly 350,000 cases. The Centre has held several high-level meetings to address the shortages and asked states to ensure the ease of supply across borders.The government’s press statement added that the dedicated plants will be established in identified government hospitals in district headquarters in various states and Union territories. “The procurement will be done through Ministry of Health and Family Welfare,” it said.The PM Cares fund earlier allocated ₹201.58 crore for the installation of 162 dedicated PSA medical oxygen generation plants inside public health facilities in the country, the statement said. “The basic aim behind establishing PSA Oxygen Generation Plants at Government hospitals in the district headquarters is to further strengthen the public health system and ensure that each of these hospitals has a captive oxygen generation facility. Such an in-house captive oxygen generation facility would address the day-to-day medical oxygen needs of these hospitals and the district.”According to a Scroll.in report, the central government took eight months into the pandemic to float a tender for the 162 plants. “Six months later, only 33 of 162 plants have been installed despite a deadly second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic sweeping through the country,” the report said.After Sunday’s announcement, a government official familiar with the matter said: “In view to increase medical oxygen capacity of the State, eight Pressure Swing Adsorption (PSA) Oxygen Generation plants are being installed in Delhi by the support of PM CARES Funds. These plants would enhance capacity of medical oxygen by 14.4 Metric Tonnes.” “Eight PSA Plants to be installed in Delhi, one Plant in Burari Hospital, Kaushik Enclave has already been installed on 17.3.2021,” the official added on condition of anonymity.The official added that four plants, one each at Deen Dayal Upadhya Hospital, Lok Nayak Hospital, Baba Saheb Ambedkar Hospital Rohini and Deepa Chand Bandhu Hospital Ashok Vihar, were expected to be completed by April 30. “The site readiness of these hospitals was delayed by the State Government despite weekly reviews with them since November 2020. For Ambedkar Nagar Hospital, Dakshinpuri, the site has been readied as late as only 19th April,2021 by the State Government. Site readiness certificate of Satyawadi Raja Harishchandra Hospital, Narela has not yet been submitted by the Delhi Government,” the official said.In a statement, the Delhi government said: “It is well known that Central government decided to setup 162 PSA plants all over India and issued tenders for the same in October 2020. The plants were to be setup by Union Health Ministry through PM Cares fund, and not a single rupee was given to State governments. All these plants were supposed to have been installed by December 2020 and handed over to State governments. However, Central government gave the contract for 140 of these plants to a single vendor, who ran away. As a result, across India not even 10 of these 162 plants have been made operational till date. In Delhi, 7 of the 8 plants were to be set up at Delhi government hospitals, and one at Central government hospital - Safdarjung. After multiple follow-ups with Central government, plants for 5 hospitals were delivered in early March 2021. Typically these plants take 3-4 days for installation. However, once again, the vendor was non-responsive and after multiple follow-ups with Centre, only 1 of the 5 plants has been made operational till date. As for the remaining 2 hospital locations, the plants have not even been received on site. We are shocked to learn that Central government is now making the excuse of site certificate not being available from the Delhi government as a reason for delay in plants.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/551-o2-plants-to-be-set-up-via-pm-cares-pmo-101619376187168.html

26-04-2021||Today's||Why Biden delayed offering help to India||On Sunday, the United States (US) announced that it will immediately make available raw materials requested by vaccine manufacturer Serum Institute of India (SII) and will also send supplies of therapeutics, rapid diagnostic test kits, ventilators and personal protective equipment to India.A statement released by the National Security Council, after a telephone conversation between US national security adviser Jake Sullivan and his Indian counterpart, Ajit Doval, said additionally that Washington is “pursuing options to provide oxygen generation and related supplies on an urgent basis.” The statement, which came after two overnight tweets by Sullivan and secretary of state Antony Blinken, both indicating that help was on the way, put an end to a period of speculation on whether the US was abandoning India during what may be its worst humanitarian crisis since Independence.This concern arose because of the time it took the US to state exactly what assistance it would provide to New Delhi after the current cataclysmic wave of Covid-19 overwhelmed India’s health care infrastructure. The period of uncertainty began after Adar Poonawalla, CEO of SII, appealed to President Joe Biden in an April 16 tweet to lift an “embargo of raw material exports out of the US so that vaccine production can ramp up” in India.Six days later on April 22, when asked by a reporter whether the White House would lift the ban on the export of vaccine raw materials that threatened to slow down India’s vaccination drive, a state department spokesperson, answered in a way that sounded like Washington might not allow the export. The next day, White House press secretary Jen Psaki clarified the issue, stating that the US is “working closely with Indian officials at both political and experts’ level to identify ways to help address the crisis.” Despite Psaki’s reassurances, there was an impression created that the Biden administration might not help India. On social media, there was speculation that the bilateral relations between India and the US were strained. A few Indian analysts questioned the reliability of the US as a partner and suggested Russia may be a better ally. While many of these theories have since been put to rest, questions arise as to why there was this period of uncertainty about what relief and support the US would provide to India. There are three possible reasons for this: America’s own unfinished battle with the virus. The deliberative nature of the Biden White House decision-making process. And, the understandable desire to avoid a political controversy in the middle of the pandemic in the US.First, even though Biden has exceeded his vaccination targets for his first 100 days in office, the US is still not out of woods, as far as the pandemic is concerned. On Saturday, April 24, more than 50,000 Americans tested positive for the dreaded virus and around 750 lives were lost. That is why state department spokesperson Ned Price pointed out on April 22, while responding to the question on lifting the embargo on vaccine raw materials, that the country “has been hit harder than any other country around the world” and the administration has “a special responsibility to the American people.” Second, when it comes to decision-making, Biden who served decades in the Senate and for eight years as vice-president to President Barack Obama is an institutionalist. He believes in getting feedback and inputs from different stakeholders before making a commitment to action.Sunday’s announcement came following days of intense intra-agency discussions at the highest level, involving, among others, officials from the National Security Agency, the department of state and the office of the US Trade Representative. Interestingly, until the Sullivan-Doval call, there was no official statement from the Indian side on the issue, indicating that those discussions were going on. Finally, in these divisive times in the US, the administration must be mindful of potential attacks from the nativist “America First” crowd if it appears to chart a course in the international arena that suggests that it cares more about foreign nationals than its own citizens. It is true that there is a bipartisan support for relations with India. But there are some elected officials who could use the administration’s humanitarian and completely appropriate support for India and the world for exploitative purposes.The good — and I should add expected — news is that the US is doing the right thing in lifting the embargo on vaccine ingredients and sending other critical supplies to India. The surprising thing is that there was ever any doubt or question that it would. The Biden administration also brings a compassion and moral understanding to the table that empowers it to do this as the right thing to fight this virus globally.Frank F Islam is an entrepreneur, civic leader, and thought leader based in Washington DC The views expressed here are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/why-biden-delayed-offering-help-to-india-101619437331181.html
26-04-2021||Today's||Only a centralised vaccine management system will work||India’s new vaccine policy, which comes into effect from May 1, will expand the population base to be vaccinated to anyone over 18 years. With the new strains of the mutated virus proving to be equally dangerous to the younger population, this is a welcome move on the part of the government. However, from now on, 50% of the supply from Indian manufacturers is earmarked for the Centre, which will continue its existing vaccination process, which offers free vaccinations for health care workers, frontline workers and for those over 45 years.The remaining 50% of the supply is allocated for the open market that includes states, private hospitals and facilities that can administer the vaccine. Those between the ages of 18 and 45 have to get vaccinated from this lot. The central government has seemingly moved the responsibility of vaccinating the bulk of India’s young population on to the states and the private sector. The new policy has many areas that require further clarity and fine-tuning, without which our vaccination drive will not be as smooth as we want it to be. Under the new policy, various state governments and private players will be competing with each other for procurement of vaccine from a limited number of vaccine manufacturers. Serum Institute of India (SII) has priced its vaccine, Covishield, at ₹400 for states and ₹600 for private players. Meanwhile, Covaxin has equivalent prices of ₹600 and ₹1,200 respectively. With the Centre not putting in place any pricing regulations, other manufacturers, including possible new entrants, could create some amount of confusion in the market by offering a range of prices. All manufacturers will definitely be more inclined to sell to higher-paying private purchasers than to any of the state governments. The bigger states, with more purchasing power, may get preference over smaller ones. In these difficult times, everyone involved could use the time and resources spent on procurement negotiations, and processing orders on much more productive causes.Ideally, the Centre should have created a centralised vaccine procurement and management system. The cumulative purchasing power of a single buyer would have enabled the lowest possible price for our population. The Centre should also have made efforts to provide the vaccine free of cost to everyone. All states are going through a massive financial crisis. It would have been easier for the Centre to raise additional revenues as it has a lot more flexibility in taxation and borrowing. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman had set aside ₹35,000 crore for vaccinations in the 2021 budget. Vaccinating the entire adult population will cost India ₹67,200 crore or 0.36 % of the Gross Domestic Product. The financial costs incurred as a result of the pandemic being prolonged have already proved to be much higher. The government will have to drastically scale up the vaccination rate. As things stand now, it could take us years to vaccinate the entire adult population. Production capacity also has to be enhanced considerably. SII produces almost 2.4 million doses a day, and Bharat Biotech will produce around two million shortly. This is not enough to vaccinate the population quickly enough. In a recent letter to Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi, former PM Manmohan Singh suggested invoking compulsory licensing of vaccine technology, similar to what Israel has done, allowing other prospective manufacturers to make the vaccines, supporting them with funds and other concessions to encourage expansion of capacity. As production increases, there will also be a greater need for storage and distribution facilities, especially as the vaccination campaign has to reach rural areas. All these will be easier and efficient to implement in a centralised system where the partnering states could work on the last-mile execution of the vaccination drive. Universal adult vaccination is the most effective means to protect our people. Getting our population inoculated against this deadly virus is the only way to recover and rebuild after this massive economic and social upheaval caused by the pandemic.Anil K Antony is the national co-coordinator of the AICC social media and digital communications department and co-founder of PIIndia.org, a Covid-national action groupThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/only-a-centralised-vaccine-management-system-will-work-101619436914092.html
26-04-2021||Editorials||Economic fallout of the second wave||As India completes the first month of fiscal year 2021-22, it is facing a severe second wave of Covid-19 infections. Daily cases continue to remain high. Some parts of the country are under lockdowns or similar restrictions, and more are expected to join them. The Nomura India Business Resumption Index had fallen to 83.8 in the week ending April 18. This will most probably go below 80 in the week ending April 25 and could fall further in the days to come. All this suggests that the second wave will extract a large economic cost. Usual economic indicators, however, will not capture the true magnitude of this cost. The reason is a favourable base effect, on account of the 68-day lockdown, which was imposed on March 25, 2020. For example, the index of eight core sector industries for March will be released this week. It contracted by 4.6% on a year-on-year basis in February 2021. We could see a statistical improvement in the number March onwards because it suffered a huge contraction March 2020 onwards. These numbers were a contraction of 8.5%, 37.9% and 21.4% in March, April and May 2020. The same logic will hold for other economic indicators. It is extremely important that these numbers, skewed by the base effect, do not lead to complacency on the economic policy front. The Controller General of Accounts will release the provisional revenue and expenditure situation of the central government for the fiscal year 2020-21 soon. Media reports suggest that revenue collection has surpassed the revised estimates. But this does not mean all is well. Petroleum taxes have played a big role in pushing up indirect tax collections. There are genuine doubts on the sustainability of this route without stoking inflation. And the revised estimates themselves were a sharp reduction from the budget estimates. If the GDP growth for 2021-22 is compromised because of the second wave, then revenue numbers for 2021-22 could also disappoint. This will adversely affect spending too. Both the Centre and states are focused on boosting medical infrastructure to save lives at the moment, and rightly so. This, however, should not lead to negligence on the vaccination front, either in terms of poor states being left behind in procuring vaccines or vaccine makers being unable to expedite supplies. Immediate universal vaccination is the only effective stimulus at the moment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/economic-fallout-of-second-wave-101619435833802.html
