The problem is that we are using similar framings across countries. Instead, we need universal but different action. Asking all countries to bring emissions to zero in, say, 30 years, is both too liberal for high-emitters and too constraining for low-emitters.On average, the world has, at most, only a few years before it has to start a dramatic move towards zero-emissions. But this average figure is misleading. If we split countries around the average 2019 fossil CO2 emissions — 4.43 tonnes CO2 per capita — the high-emitters, with less than 42% of the global population, emitted 78% of global emissions.The problem is that we mix up the poor with low-emitters. China likes to count itself as a developing country when it comes to carbon, but it emits 50% more than the world average per capita. South Africa’s emissions are even higher. India is below half the world average. Emissions from the poorest of the poor are a rounding error in global emissions. And that is why if the world needs to reach zero-emission level, everyone need not reach zero in similar timeframes.Also Read | Xi, Modi among 40 leaders at Biden-led climate summit starting on ThursdayDeveloped countries, rather, the high-emitters, need to come down dramatically and immediately, while low-emission developing countries have to first slow down their emissions growth and avoid fossil fuel lock-ins. The real problem isn’t rising emissions from the poor. It’s the lack of sufficient action by the high-emitters. While their share is declining, their absolute emissions are still rising by 0.79% annually averaged over 2017-2019.The counterargument is that developing regions are where the emissions growth will come from. Canadian politician Peter Mackay stated, “What about China and India? They are far worse than us. Why should we do anything when China and India’s greenhouse gas emissions are growing?” Such statements are common, but conveniently ignore not just per capita emissions but also historical emissions. Growth in emissions from low-emission countries has been less than the failure to reduce emissions by high-emission countries.In a rush to show strong action, the world is pushing three narratives that are a distraction from the more equitable but still low-carbon futures for developing countries. First, the focus on decarbonisation risks distracting us from the real need for very low-emission countries — access to electricity. If we give a billion people who lack electricity or quality supply entirely coal-based electricity, and they consume 35 kilowatt-hours/month per home, enough for a fridge, fan, and TV, they would only emit about 0.25% of global CO2 emissions today. Restrictions based on the incoming fuel amount to putting the cart before the horse. The good news for electricity is that it’s easy to decarbonise, especially because of falling renewable energy prices. Second, the push to end coal, while important because coal is the dirtiest of fossil fuels, masks high consumptions of other fossil fuels. Most coal is consumed in 10 countries, and China consumes over half the world’s total coal. India is the second largest consumer in total, predominantly for electricity production. But if we consider per capita consumption, not total, and normalise for the low coal quality (low energy content also means low emissions per tonne), India consumed half the world’s average coal in 2019. In countries such as Germany and the United States, not only was the per capita coal consumption much higher, their share of energy coming from coal was close to just one-sixth, instead of about 50% in India. This is because they use a lot of other fossil fuels, namely, oil and gas, whose use isn’t anywhere near plateauing globally. Also Read | European Union seeks deal on climate change law, ahead of global summitThird, announcements of zero are actually “net-zero”, with not just sequestration plans, but relying on offsetting emissions by high-emitters against avoided emissions from low-emission countries. Unfortunately, many such plans are accounting tricks, and sometimes not incremental, permanent reductions. The fact that developing regions are at a lower point on their emissions trajectory shouldn’t be taken advantage of by the high-emitters, who will claim all CO2 is equal. But the economics is not equal. High-emitters should move to true zero, which is expensive, instead of using up some of the carbon space of developing regions. The challenge is large enough that developing regions also have to be ambitious. “Not my fault” shouldn’t become “not my problem” — in part because the impact of the climate crisis on them will be disproportionately higher. They should also introspect whether their carbon space should be used up by their elites.But it would be impractical and unrealistic to expect them to dramatically shift their emissions trajectories downwards without immense global support, both for finance and technology. Much of what passes as climate finance (such as debt-funding for solar projects) fails to pass the test of additionality, and thus shouldn’t count towards the $100 billion of support to developed regions by 2022 pledged at COP15 in Copenhagen. We need collective action, but let’s not make developing countries a distraction, perhaps a convenient distraction, in the fight against the climate crisis.Rahul Tongia is a Senior Fellow at the Centre for Social and Economic Progress (CSEP) The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-the-climate-battle-focus-on-the-highemitters-101619002722928.html
21-04-2021||News||How the 2nd Covid wave is different and why the next 4 weeks are crucial||The second surge of coronavirus sweeping the country is frightening. There is an unprecedented surge in new infections, more and more deaths are being reported and the healthcare system is caving under the pressure of patients lining up even as essentials like medicines, oxygen, ICU beds are in short supply. Tragic stories of long queues outside hospitals, medical stores and overflowing crematoriums are not just limited to a few hotspots anymore as the disease seems to be spreading at a faster pace than any time before in the last one year.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereHere’s a brief look at some top line numbers with some perspective to understand how this second wave is different and the manner it is affecting India.DAILY CASELOADEven as several states have imposed curfews and lockdowns hoping to break the transmission chain, India witnessed a fresh high of 2.95 lakh new Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours. To put that number in perspective, till about a fortnight ago, the number of people infected was just about a third of this figure at 1 lakh cases per day. Till two months ago India was recording just 10,000 fresh cases per day. That’s the speed with which new infections are growing.India’s total active caseload crossed the 2 million mark earlier this week with a mammoth surge in new infections. This number has doubled dramatically in barely 10 days. It was only on April 10 that active cases in the country had crossed the 1 million mark.POSITIVITY RATEAnother remarkable feature about this second wave in India is the very high positivity rate or the number of people infected versus total tests conducted. India’s daily positivity rate has doubled from 8% to 16.7% in the last 12 days according to health ministry data – a grim milestone, reinforcing the view that the virus has spread at a much faster rate during the last month.“The numbers are likely to go up further in the coming days. The healthcare system is already on the verge of collapse,” says Dr. Rommel Tickoo, Director of Internal Medicine at Max Healthcare who believes that the more virulent mutant strains could be behind this second surge. “It is quite common for viruses such as these to mutate and stronger mutated variant virus will spread faster,” adds Dr Tickoo.India announced detection of the new "double mutant" variant of the coronavirus in March. Termed B.1.617, this variant carries markings of two virus mutations - E484Q and L452R – and experts believe it to be more infective and faster spreading. “In this second surge, we see that transmission is faster. If one person in a household is getting infected, the whole family gets the virus, including the staff,” says Dr Tickoo.“This time around we are not seeing many asymptomatic positives. Every person has some or other mild symptoms. The disease is spreading faster than before. Lung condition is also deteriorating a little earlier than before,” says Dr Amit Thadani, Director, Niramaya Hospital in Navi Mumbai.CASE FATALITY RATETake a look at the case fatality rate or the percentage of Covid-positive patients who did not survive and the situation looks grim again. In the six months before the start of the second wave, India’s CFR was only 1.1%.But if we look at the number of deaths in the last week then this number is rising. According to an HT Analysis - which accounts for a two-week lag in deaths occurring on average since infection - 1.6% of the people who got infected in the week ending April 4 are dead.The percentage may appear small but look at absolute numbers and you realize that even a slight uptick in fatality rate means hundreds of additional deaths. In fact, the death toll in the last 24-hours has crossed 2,000 for the first time since the pandemic's outbreak.India’s health infrastructure is already overwhelmed with the second surge and the steep spike in cases. Doctors believe that the next three to four weeks are absolutely critical in terms of the spread of the infection. “We need people to take all necessary precautions and abandon all carelessness. Wear double masks, wash hands frequently and maintain social distancing,” they urge unanimously, adding that everyone eligible should immediately get vaccinated.And with faster-transmitting variants of the virus at play in this second wave, that may well be the right way forward.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/how-the-2nd-covid-wave-is-different-and-why-the-next-4-weeks-are-crucial-101618985790591.html
21-04-2021||News||What do Indian voters want?||What is it that voters want? My seven years of conducting electoral surveys across India have given me a crystal clear answer — what matters is “delivery” of promises by the incumbent government. Election after election, this remains the single message from the voter.Repeat governments are the best examples of this. Prime Minister Narendra Modi came back with a bigger mandate in 2019 because of his pro-poor schemes such as Ujjwala Yojana, Jan Dhan accounts, Ayushman Bharat. Naveen Patnaik is the longest serving chief minister of Odisha, re-elected each time for his good governance. The 2020 Delhi assembly elections gave Arvind Kejriwal a third win, and a thumping majority for the second time because of his school reforms, mohalla clinics, free buses to women, among other steps — just eight months after the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) lost all seven seats in Delhi in the general elections.Most other factors play a very limited role in election outcomes. Yes, elections are being held against a backdrop of extreme polarisation. But I don’t believe it swings votes.Also Read | BJP, TMC scale down campaigns amid spikeThe Delhi assembly polls 2020 were held in the backdrop of sharp polarisation following the Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests and the Shaheen Bagh sit-in. But people chose AAP. In the Bihar 2015 polls, the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) ran a highly polarised campaign but the Mahagathbandhan of Nitish Kumar-Lalu Prasad won. Voters continue to judge their representatives on the basis of how their lives have improved.The rural and poor vote comprise 80% of the total electorate. Their expectations from their government are different from the urban and rich. They vote more than the urban and rich, as they are heavily dependent on the government for their livelihood. And they almost always throw their weight behind a trusted pro-poor candidate (or party) who will look after their basic needs.Voters, in fact, sometimes tend to believe pro-poor promises and give parties a chance to deliver. Remember the Congress’s promise of loan waivers for farmers and new minimum support price rates that became the gamechanger ahead of the Chhattisgarh polls in December 2018 ? In the 2019 general polls, I believe that Congress mishandled its Nyuntam Aay Yojana (Nyay) plank — that could have been decisive, not their Rafale allegations.Also Read | Election Commission announces re-election in 4 polling booths in AssamFinally, Indian electoral patterns are changing because women voters have emerged as a crucial votebank. Successive governments have tried to empower this electorate through welfare schemes and with direct transfer to their accounts. Whenever I have called an election wrong — most recently in the Bihar 2020 assembly polls — it’s because we didn’t have the exact male-female voter turnout data. In the recent case of Bihar, overall female turnout was 5.13% more than men and they voted in favour of NDA.These are broad-brushed observations. Of course, actual poll predictions are more complex. But these are the insights that have come up time and time again in our numerous conversations with voters.Voters have also helped me see through some popular preconceptions. For instance, there is a belief that the attendance at rallies tells us which direction the wind is blowing. While the crowds at any rally point towards the strength of that political party’s organisation, it is no measure of that party’s poll prospects. In the Bihar assembly polls last year amidst the pandemic, Tejashwi Yadav managed to draw huge crowds despite the Covid-19 scare but that did not get him votes. It was the same for the NDA in Bihar in 2015 —NDA leaders drew crowds but Mahagathbandhan won.The media peddles yet another myth that incumbent governments are judged on the state of the economy, which is essentially GDP growth and stock market. Nothing can be farther from the truth. Take Bihar again. The NDA won a narrow but clear victory in 2020 in an environment of economic gloom. Their pro-poor schemes such as prohibition and five kg food grains as ration turned out to be the determining factors.Also Read | Single-phase, decisive Tamil Nadu election on Tuesday: All you need to knowPsephology remains a tricky science — a combination of psychology and sociology. Increasingly though, in India, it will become more rigorous and scientific. While I rely on my understanding of human psychology to get to the bottom of voter preferences, I feel there is absolutely no alternative to an exhaustive field survey, reaching out to the last voter on the ground.We cannot afford, for example, the polling approach of phone calls as practised in the United States. Here, each state has different regional parties apart from the national parties, language is different, there are different caste equations at play and literacy levels differ. Hence, it is not possible to communicate with them over the phone.Nor do we expect our respondents to tell us what is on their mind immediately. In a state such as Bengal that sees a great deal of violence, it is particularly tricky to get the subjects to speak openly. We have to spend a lot of time assuring our respondents that their answers will remain confidential, women surveyors are sent to talk to women voters as much as possible, and we also create incentive schemes such as lucky draws.This is why psephology is so complex and so exhilarating — we need both rigour and empathy, to work with numbers and our gut. Even as poll work becomes more scientific, this will remain.Pradeep Gupta is the founder of Axis My India and author of How India Votes and What it MeansThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/what-do-indian-voters-want-101618910438266.html

Chief medical officer Dr Anil Mishra, who accompanied district judge to the hospital for admission, has filed the FIR against the hospital, its owner Amit Narayan, duty doctors and the staff. In the FIR, a copy of which is available with HT, Dr Mishra said he accompanied the judge to hospital with the chief metropolitan magistrate. The lift was not working and all of them remained stuck inside. Thereafter, no one attended the judge, nor the treatment was started, he alleged. When they reached the portico, many patients complained to them about the “complete chaotic situation” in the hospital, according to the FIR. As the CMO spoke to the hospital owner, the latter shouted and said, “send me to jail, get my hospital sealed”, according to the FIR. Dr Mishra said the case was lodged because of utter negligence shown by the hospital with regard to the district judge and shabby management of the Covid-19 facility. District judge RP Singh and hospital owner Amit Narayan were not available for their comments. DCP (Kanpur) South Ravina Tyagi said, “I am looking into the matter and action will be taken.” The Panki police said the case was being investigated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/fir-against-kanpur-hospital-4-doctors-in-custody-after-judge-needing-treatment-faces-chaos-101619029544059.html

21-04-2021||Gurugram||Industrialists save the day with oxygen supply||Manesar-based industrialists on Wednesday answered the district administration’s request for oxygen supply, providing 10,000 litres, as city-based hospitals were running low on their supplies earlier in the day, officials of the health department said.Officials of the district administration said that although the volume was not high, it helped hospitals tide over short supply till the evening, when the stock from their distributor in Panipat was expected to arrive. Officials of the health department confirmed in the evening that a tanker was on its way to Gurugram.Yash Garg, deputy commissioner, Gurugram confirmed that help was sought from the industrialists in Manesar to source oxygen. “Yes, we have got it,” said Garg, on Wednesday afternoon.Health department officials said that industrial units supply oxygen directly to hospitals and they have no role to play in it. “Since the regular supply from Bhiwadi is disrupted, the hospitals have sought our help,” said a health department official requesting anonymity, adding that surge in Covid-19 cases led to excess demand and the problem was complicated due to disruption in supply. The health department official said that a tanker ferrying 22 metric tonnes of oxygen is on its way from Panipat. “We will distribute to all the hospitals using liquid oxygen,” the official said. Pawan Yadav, the president of IMT Industrial Association, said that they were told that oxygen supply in Gurugram hospitals would last only until the afternoon and they needed help to tide over the situation as the regular supply would be provided by the evening. “We got a call from deputy commissioner, Gurugram, in this matter and soon after, the industry owners started an exercise to reach out to one another,” said Yadav. He said that the owner of an industrial gas production company in Manesar supplied 10,000 litres of oxygen through cylinders to the district administration.The demand for oxygen shot up in the last two weeks due to an exponential rise in Covid-19 cases in the district, said officials. While the consumption of oxygen prior to the surge was five to six metric tonnes, it has now risen 13 to 14 tonnes per day. On Wednesday, the number of cases reported in the district stood at 2,988, the highest single-day spike since the start of the pandemic.Yadav said that the 10,000 litres of oxygen were given to the district administration free of cost and that industrialists will pool in money to bear the cost. “This gas is worth ₹16 lakh, but it was decided that no money would be charged and it would be a free service for the people of the city. The industrialists will contribute towards the cost,” said Yadav. “We had stock of few hundred cylinders in our factory and some in large tanks. We decided to recall supplied gas from large customers and this was filled into cylinders for delivery to hospitals,” said Deepak Shami, managing director, Star Specual Air Gas Pvt Ltd, which provided the supply to the administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/industrialists-save-the-day-with-oxygen-supply-101619027985320.html
21-04-2021||Gurugram||Gurugram inches closer to 3,000 daily infections||The district on Wednesday reported 2,988 Covid-19 cases, which is the highest single-day spike since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, according to the health department data, surpassing the previous high of 2.549 cases reported last Saturday.With the record spike, the number of active cases increased to 16,027, with the health department officials contemplating to increase the number of containment zones, despite isolating several clusters since the spike began over four weeks ago.The health department also reported four deaths on Covid-19 on Wednesday, with the fatality rate at 0.4% at present. The weekly case positivity rate stood at 16%.Officials of the health department attributed the spike in number of daily cases to increased testing, with over 10,000 conducted every day. “Heavy testing is being carried out to identify local spread and these are notified as containment zones,” said Dr Virender Yadav, adding that to manage the emerging situation, the health department is working with the district administration to increase the number of beds. Officials said that 1,227 Covid-19 patients recovered on Wednesday, taking the total number of recoveries in the district to 72,448. The rate of recovery in the city stands at 83% while the total deaths caused by Covid related complications stood at 391. According to the data, 15,010 people in Gurugram are in home isolation, while 74 patients were sent to institutional quarantine on Wednesday. The health department on Wednesday collected 10,108 samples for testing. Health department officials said that 4,019 people took the vaccine shots at 100 session sites on Wednesday. Out of the eligible 428,000 people, over 340,000 beneficiaries in the prioritised age groups have already taken the jab. “The vaccination outreach will be expanded to cover maximum people in the new few days,” said Yadav, adding that fewer vaccination sites were set up on the day at government establishments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-inches-closer-to-3-000-daily-infections-101619027984525.html
21-04-2021||Gurugram||Portal launched for reserving beds||The district administration on Wednesday launched a portal that allows residents to request Covid-19 hospital beds and also provide real time data on the availability of beds in hospitals. Officials said that reservations can be made only by those who have a local address, as per their Aadhaar card.On Wednesday, the data available on the portal -- covidggn.com -- showed that there were 43 beds with oxygen support and three ICU beds were available, while no ventilator beds were free, at 10pm.Health department officials said that they were also working on increasing the bed availability at Civil Hospital, SGT Hospital and Medeor Hospital in Manesar.Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said that hospital beds at SGT Medical College and Civil Hospital were increased on Wednesday by around 200 and the health department and district administration were working in tandem to ensure increased availability. “Beds in the two hospitals were increased today and a portal was also launched for people to get registered for a hospital bed, which shall be allotted on the basis of requirement. The portal provides real time information on beds, ventilators, ICUs and other facilities,” said Yadav.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, said that all efforts would be made to segregate patients through the portal and ensure that those in need of hospitalisation receive the necessary support. “We are working to increase the number of beds in hospitals and it would also be ensured that Covid safeguards are followed strictly,” he said.The district administration on Wednesday reiterated that there would not be any lockdown in the state and warned traders and shopkeepers not to indulge in black-marketing essential items. “The shopkeepers should not try to take advantage of the situation and overcharge for essential items or any other items. There is no possibility of any lockdown in the state and people, in general, should refrain from spreading panic,” said Garg.Garg also referred to the statement by Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, who stated that economic activities would not be stopped. “The district administration is ready to meet the emerging situation caused by the surge in Covid-19 cases,” said Garg, adding that the district administration had already appointed nodal officers for management of hospital beds and to work towards better facilities for Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/portal-launched-for-reserving-beds-101619027983927.html
21-04-2021||Gurugram||Officially, only 8 died of Covid in Gurugram in 2 days, but crematoriums handle over 100 such bodies||The health department in Gurugram reported four Covid-19 deaths on Tuesday and four more on Wednesday, but cremation ground staff say they have performed the last rites of at least 106 bodies, as per Covid-19 protocols, over the past two days(till 10pm Wednesday). While a few of these bodies were sent from Ghaziabad and Delhi, a majority of them are from Gurugram, the staffers said.The crematorium records, accessed by Hindustan Times, show that the Sector 32 crematorium alone recorded 17 and 40 Covid-19 deaths of city residents on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, while the Madanpuri crematorium recorded 23 and 26 Covid-19 deaths, respectively, over the past two days. According to the health department data, however, 13 deaths were reported in the past three days from Gurugram, including five on Monday. Sandeep Sharma, the in-charge of Mokshdham cremation ground in Sector 32, said, “Over 45 bodies arrived within the past 12 hours (from Wednesday noon). Of these, 40 were of Covid-19 deaths from Gurugram. The others were from Ghaziabad and New Delhi. In the past four days, the count of bodies has increased and we have been cremating bodies till 11 in the night.” “We fill all details of the deceased and follow protocols set by the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG). All bodies of Covid-19 deaths cremated here are recorded,” he said. Sharma said they receive at least eight to 10 calls daily from people informing them of Covid-19 deaths at home and enquiring about funeral proceedings. In some cases, the Covid-19 test reports are awaited, but cremation is done as per Covid-19 protocols. Such cases are not recorded as Covid deaths, he said.Officials of the health department attributed the discrepancy in numbers to differences in protocols followed by the MCG. The health department data shows that 31 deaths were recorded in the district from April 1 to 21.Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said, “Only those deaths confirmed by hospitals as Covid-19 are shown as official in the health department bulletin. The crematorium data comes under the MCG.” However, officials of the MCG said their data is based on hospital reports.Ashish Singla, chief medical officer (CMO), MCG, said, “We collect death summary and Covid-19 positive reports. We are not aware why the data of the health department is not matching with crematoria data. We are collecting our data on a daily basis.”The city has three Covid-19 cremation grounds at Sector 32, Sukhrali village near Atul Kataria Chowk, and Madan Puri near Pataudi Chowk, while three burial grounds have been earmarked in Sector 58 near the Power House, Sector 58 near Ghata village, and Badshahpur village. Singla said they presently have two dedicated ambulances for transporting Covid-19 bodies to crematoriums from hospitals and that two more vehicles will be addedto handle the surge. “The two ambulances are transporting over 30 Covid-19 bodies daily. Before handing over the bodies to the ambulance drivers, the hospital staff issue death summary and Covid-19 positive reports and these are duly handed over to the crematorium staff,” he said. Amit Kumar (33), a private ambulance driver for the past 10 years, said on average, he is transporting two Covid-19 bodies to cremation grounds daily. “I have never seen this kind of rush. There is no space to even park vehicles and bodies are lined up on platforms,” he said. A spot check by an HT team at the Madanpuri cremation ground found that bodies were lined up on all 26 cremation platforms, of which two are electric. Grieving kin in PPE overalls stood at a distance and watched as MCG workers placed the bodies on pyres. A team of four workers prepared one pyre after another, as ambulances kept arriving without a break. “The rush has been ongoing for days. Families are not allowed to come near the body. The family member who has to perform the last rites lights the torch. But it is the MCG worker who puts the torch to the pyre,” said Vinod Kumar, who has been working 12-hour shifts at the electric crematorium since the pandemic started. “Every day, over 30 bodies of Covid-19 patients arrive here for last rites,” he said. It is in the last week that hospitalisation has increased dramatically from at least 171 on April 1 to 806 on Wednesday, stretching the existing health infrastructure to saturation point. The situation is constantly deteriorating due to a record surge in daily new infections. Gurugam on Wednesday reported 2,988 new infections, the highest single-day spike since the outbreak of the pandemic. The total number of cases now stands at 88,866, of which 16,027 are active. Families of Covid-19 victims continued to opt for last rites instead of electric cremations, even as protocols state that electric cremations should be preferred to avoid the spread of infection. “There are only two electric furnaces, but most of the people refuse an electric cremation. Since rituals take time, there is a waiting time of at least an hour for a cremation on platforms,” said Kumar. The teams performing last rites have undergone basic training on sanitising the body, covering it in a transparent, protective sheet even as families watch from a distance. MCG officials said the ashes are handed over to the family later.

In the past few months, when Covid-19 cases reduced, people stopped donating plasma and now, suddenly, there is a peak in cases, with increased demand for plasma.”However, Dr Kilhor could not provide data about stock availability or the demand at present.Virendra Yadav, the chief medical officer said, “We are constantly working with the district administration to increase the stock of plasma in the bank. We have roped in societies like Red Cross to help us ensure availability of plasma and are also trying to motivate public to come forward and donate voluntarily.”According to the health department data, Gurugram’s active caseload stands at 16,027 cases, with over 12,000 patients in home isolation. Due to the rising number of cases, the rate of recovery in Gurugram has gone down from 90-99% and stands around 82% at present. The fatality rate in the district currently stands at 0.44%.“At present, the requests that we are getting for plasma are being met with replacements. If anyone is Covid-19 positive and needs plasma, then their family members, relatives or friends are donating the same. A particular data has not been maintained regarding the demand, but it is quite high, and we are getting calls on a daily basis,” added Dr Kilhor.A person, who has fully recovered from Covid-19, can donate plasma, which contains antibodies to fight the infection. In July last year, the district administration inaugurated Gurugram’s first convalescent plasma bank for coronavirus disease (Covid-19) patients at the Rotary Blood Bank in Sector 10. The bank has a capacity of storing over 1,000 units of plasma, with each unit costing ₹8,500.When asked if any sensitisation campaigns are being planned, she said that appeals have been made to recovered patients to donate plasma, “but the willingness to do so is lesser this year among people.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/plasma-stock-low-amid-rising-demand-due-to-case-spike-101619027864632.html
21-04-2021||Gurugram||Residents allege lack of dedicated waste collection from Covid households||Residents of Mayfield Gardens and South City-2 alleged a lack of separate waste collection facilities for households with Covid-19 patients and raised concerns over the risk posed to the general public as well as sanitation staff.SP Thakran, a resident of Mayfield Gardens Block J, said, “Waste from houses where Covid-19 positive patients are isolating is being collected along with waste from other houses, with no segregation. This increases the chances of the virus spreading to other houses and exposure to the person collecting the garbage. Not just this, waste collection is also not taking place on a daily basis.”SN Bharadwaj, a member of the South City-2 residents’ welfare association (RWA), said, “Waste is being collected regularly, but the separate collection of waste is an issue. Waste is dumped by residents in a common dustbin, from where it is collected. There is no segregation and we do not know how this is being monitored.”Officials from the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) called on the RWAs to help them ensure that waste from houses where positive patients are isolating is collected separately.Dheeraj Kumar, MCG’s joint commissioner for Swachh Bharat Mission, said, “Residents need to understand that if they are mixing biomedical waste with household waste, then segregation automatically becomes difficult. We have dedicated vehicles deputed to collect waste from houses where Covid-19 positive patients are isolating, but residents need to also understand that waste should not be mixed.”“Adequate arrangements have been made by the MCG for cleaning, sanitisation, fogging and lifting of garbage from the houses of Covid-19 infected persons across Gurugram,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner, MCG.However, RWA members said that residents who are testing positive for the coronavirus disease are not informing authorities, due to which segregation becomes difficult.Navin Jha, office in-charge of RWA Mayfield Gardens, said, “Residents are not informing us if they are testing positive, and in such a situation, how are we supposed to inform the garbage collectors to pick up waste from those houses separately? At present, I have information from only three houses, but cases must be more than that.”YC Bharadwaj, a resident of Mayfield Gardens Block C, said, “Waste from all houses is being collected together. The waste is kept in a single area by residents and then it is collected together, no such separate segregation is taking place.”Amid complaints from residents, the MCG issued a statement on Wednesday reiterating that Ecogreen, the concessionaire for waste management in the city, has eight dedicated vehicles for this task, two in each of its four zones.The MCG’s joint commissioner for Swacch Bharat Mission said that the corporation regularly updates Ecogreen of locations where positive cases are being reported, so that waste can be collected separately.Sanjeev Sharma, the official spokesperson for Ecogreen Energy, said, “We have eight dedicated vehicles for collection of waste from houses where positive patients are isolating, which can be increased to 10 also if the need arises; but residents should cooperate with us and not give mixed waste.”Mobile phone numbers of supervisors of these vehicles were made public by the MCG on Wednesday.Ecogreen’s supervisors a call away for waste segregation:Zone 1 - 7428841966Zone 2 - 8882231294Zone 3 - 9319050212Zone 4 - 8383937376||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-allege-lack-of-dedicated-waste-collection-from-covid-households-101619027863990.html

Meanwhile, hospitals in various districts of the state, including Lucknow, continue to battle for oxygen.Four years back, in August 2017, the district was in the limelight after the death of 60 children in the BRD Medical College due to the oxygen crisis. An inquiry was ordered and the medical officers including the then principal of the medical college were suspended.With the surge in Covid-19 cases in the second wave, the district witnessed a large flow of patients to government and private hospitals. On Wednesday, the district reported 987 fresh cases taking the tally of active cases (number of patients under treatment) to 6,909. According to the chief medical officer Sudhakar Pandey, cases are being reported from both the urban and rural areas of the district and the details of the patients are being uploaded on the portal for allotment of beds by the integrated command and control centre.District magistrate K Vijyendra Pandian said that there is no crisis of oxygen to hospitals in Gorakhpur, rather the oxygen plants in the district are supplying oxygen to 25 districts in Faizabad, Basti, Azamgarh and Prayagraj divisions. If required we will supply oxygen to Lucknow and Varanasi as well, he said.This is the result of meticulous planning that has ensured a regular supply of oxygen to hospitals even as the flow of critical Covid-19 patients increased. The capacity of Modi Chemicals factory had been increased from 800 metric tonnes to 2,600 metric tonnes, the closed RK Oxygen factory has been started with the production of 3,600 MT, while a liquid oxygen tank has been set up at BRD Medical College to supply oxygen to the wards, he said.An effort is also on re-start the closed Annapurna Oxygen Factory, located in the industrial development area of the district. The North Eastern Railways has supplied 500 oxygen cylinders and we have received 200 cylinders from the Gorakhpur Fertilizer Factory. A bank of 2,000 oxygen cylinders has been set up in the district collectorate for emergency supply to hospitals and needy as well, the DM said.Regular supply of oxygen is being maintained to 40 private hospitals that have started admitting Covid-19 patients with a 48-hour oxygen supply back up, Pandian said.The owner of Modi Chemicals, Praveen Modi, said that the factory has enhanced its production capacity by installing new technology. There will be uninterrupted supply of oxygen to all hospitals, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lesson-learnt-after-oxygen-tragedy-gorakhpur-now-supplies-it-to-25-districts-101619026483746.html

Contrary to their claim, Swaroop Narayan Srivastava, 82, was taken to LLR Hospital suffering from pneumonia and in desperate need of oxygen. His relative, Deepak Srivastava, said that doctors told him to bring his own oxygen cylinder. “Now, we are moving him to a non-Covid private hospital. We are lucky, we got a bed. LLR people were not ready to begin treatment without the cylinder,” he said. LLR Hospital, the biggest hospital, has seen oxygen demand shoot up to 12,000 litres in a day, said the doctors, adding that the situation became critical in the early hours of Tuesday. Somehow it was managed. The LLR Hospital arranged for some 100 cylinders from Bharua Sumerpur in Hamirpur and one tanker is coming from Dehradun daily, said doctors, on condition of anonymity. They said still the supply was not enough considering the influx of patients. Meanwhile, at Anurag Hospital in Sharda Nagar, an announcement was made for people to take away patients or arrange for oxygen cylinders. The hospital had run out of oxygen and it was not made available. A patient, Ashutosh, was also allegedly assaulted when he registered his protest with the hospital staff. He had to call the police to save himself as the guard allegedly held him at gunpoint. SHO Kalyanpur Vir Singh confirmed the incident said it was being looked into. Oxygen consumption in Covid-19 hospitals has also risen to 53 tonnes in Kanpur. While the city had 12 tonnes in stock, 16 tonnes was made available additionally. Another 25 tonnes was on the way from Chandauli. “At the most it will last less than 24 hours; we need consistent supply,” said a hospital owner whose hospital ran out of essential items for treatment at 3 am on Tuesday. At present, the overall demand was of 8,500 cylinders and the availability was roughly between 5,500, and thus, a shortfall of 3,500 cylinders, said doctors of GSVM Medical College and private hospital owners. In his briefing, the Kanpur DM said that he had deputed magistrates at four oxygen plants to ensure that the oxygen reaches the right places. Similarly, magistrates have been deployed in all Covid-19 hospitals to check ‘black marketing of beds’ so that patients get a bed conveniently. Meanwhile, a private company has been hired to run the integrated command centre more efficiently, and it will take over the centre in a day or two, municipal commissioner Akshay Tripathi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kanpur-gasps-for-oxygen-but-brass-says-all-is-well-101619026003749.html

The incident happened at Naiyaka Tola village.According to Achhelal Yadav, son of the deceased woman Sushila Devi, she died after the police personnel hit her. “My mother slumped on the ground and died immediately. The policemen escaped, leaving behind their vehicles,” Yadav said. However, Nitin Kumar, station house officer (SHO), Kotwa police station, refuted the allegations. He said the police team, which was raiding the house of Acchelal Yadav following inputs about liquor trade, came under attack from the villagers when it stumbled upon liquor manufacturing machines. “Caught unawares, a woman began writhing in pain, holding her chest. She had probably suffered a heart attack. In the meantime, Acchelal raised alarm and a group of villagers attacked and snatched arms from one of the policemen. In all, seven policemen, including two sub-inspectors, were injured in the attack,” said Kumar, who himself sustained injuries on his arms. Sources quoting eye-witnesses said the village resembled a battle ground as locals went after the police team, pelting stones at them. “The INSAS rifle snatched from a policeman was returned after pressure was brought upon by the village headman,” said a village resident. Arun Kumar Gupta, subdivisional police officer (SDPO), said, “The reason behind the woman’s death could only be known after autopsy.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/woman-dies-7-cops-hurt-as-villagers-clash-with-raiding-police-team-101619023544126.html

One of them agreed on the condition that oxygen supply would be my concern. In the government hospitals, the seats are only available for VVIPs,” said Kavita Srivastava, a resident of Friends Colony.Oxygen supply is a big concern for the private hospitals. Kin of several patients are already weighing options of shifting them to Delhi. “You ask the government and they say everything is fine, while the situation is so bad that even for a thermometer or a steam inhaler, one has to keep running from one medical shop to another, let alone oxygen,” said Ravish Kumar, a resident of Patna City area. Ravish Narayan (48), a Covid-19 patient and a resident of Danapur, had to face an even more harrowing ordeal. After his health deteriorated on Tuesday evening, his family rushed him to a leading hospital near their residence in Rajabazar area. Despite their pleas, they were advised to take him home. “There is no vacant bed and he will be managed better at home,” they were told. As the night progressed, his condition worsened, with oxygen levels dipping to dangerous levels, leaving him gasping for every breath that he took. Their efforts to find “a bed with oxygen cylinder” also failed in hospitals. After hundreds of frantic phone calls to friends and beyond, Narayan was finally accommodated at a private hospital. Currently, he is struggling for life. Attendant of another patient said he had to cough up ₹54,000 for Remdesivir injection. “I paid as I needed it. My doctor had asked for it. I was left with no choice but to pay. Remdesivir has become like liquor in dry Bihar. It is officially not available, but the black market provides the facility of home delivery. What I am saying is no hearsay. I have myself paid for it and I am thankful that the black market at least makes it available,” he says, not wishing to be identified.With the number of fresh Covid-19 cases creating a record each day, the situation is likely to aggravate fuehrer. AIIMS is the first choice for patients in Patna, but it has limited number of beds and VVIPs hardly leave enough space for the commoners. Rajabazar’s private hospital was packed to capacity on Wednesday when this correspondent reached there. “There’s no bed at all,” a hospital employee on duty told this.At AIIMS, patients and attendants were seen waiting for admission, without success.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patna-hospitals-packed-put-up-no-bed-notices-101619023483625.html

The upcoming panchayat polls in the state will be delayed as the State Election Commission (SEC) on Wednesday decided to take a decision on holding the elections for rural local bodies only after reviewing the situation of Covid-19 cases after 15 days in the wake of surge in infections owing to second wave of the Coronavirus. In a press statement, the SEC said there were plans to send the proposal for notification of panchayat polls to the state government by end of April, but the situation has changed owing to the recent spike in Corona cases. It said the entire administration in districts was had been mobilised to tackle the situation and many in the state poll panel and other departments had contracted the virus. Officials said the training programme for officials drafted for election duty has been also suspended. The current five-year term of elected representatives for 2.54 lakh posts in three-tier rural local bodies ends on June 15. With panchayat polls set to be delayed, chances are that these bodies would be run it through administrators after June 15 till the time elections are held, sources said. The panchayat raj department has already started working on a proposal to appoint administrators to run these bodies by notifying designated officers so that development works carried through the rural local bodies continues smoothly. SEC officials, however, said the election date would be fixed once the situation normalises and that the preparations for holding the polls were already in place. Recently, the SEC and Election Commission of India (ECI) resolved the dispute over the procurement of EVMs by deciding to hold panchayat polls through simple EVMs ( which are used in assembly/parliamentary polls), instead of multi-post EVMs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/panchayat-polls-set-for-delay-decision-only-after-15-days-101619023423517.html

21-04-2021||Pune||Civil society members want detailed clarification on riverfront project||Civil society organisations and citizens have written to Pune municipal commissioner Vikram Kumar expressing serious concerns and demanding a public presentation of the riverfront rejuvenation and improvement project. Many organisations have also requested a rethink of the entire project. They have raised concerns on the lines of flooding, destruction of the river ecosystem, biodiversity, and have demanded a public presentation of the project. “The project does not address the core issues of water quality and need for scientific ecological restoration of the degraded river ecosystem, and it proposes to narrow the river channels with a view to commercialising adjoining land which is currently within the flood lines, putting lives at risk and destroying biodiversity for commercial interests,” said Shaileja Deshpande of Jeevit Nadi. Deshpande also pointed out that a hydro-geological study has not been done. “As a group of concerned citizens and civil society organisations, we want to understand the proposed River Rejuvenation and Improvement Project in detail,” said the letter addressed to Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) commissioner Vikram Kumar. The PMC, PCMC, Cantonment boards are to jointly take up this project for which a special purpose vehicle will be set up but what the members fear that the project is ill-conceived and will add to issues of river flooding, and destruction of the river ecosystem and biodiversity. The members have raised questions about how the project will benefit the residents of Pune. “The key issues related to the river systems in Pune include pollution, primarily due to untreated sewage in flows, encroachment, degradation, and destruction of the right of way of the river, banks, riverbed, channel and other physical attributes of the river due to the construction of roads, metro pillars, dumping of debris have reduced the carrying capacity of the river,” stated the letter. “Given the situation of climate change and the impacts Pune is already facing, the priority of river-related projects should be to improve the city’s resilience to extreme rainfall, flash floods, and restoring the degraded river ecosystem. These urgent needs are not considered. The city should focus on projects to improve resilience, and not land development and beautification,” said Sanskriti Menon, Centre for Environmental Education (CEE)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/civil-society-members-want-detailed-clarification-on-riverfront-project-101619020123444.html

The Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) is carrying out road development work in Sangvi due to which MSEDCL has registered 405 underground high tension and low-tension cable damages in the past one year. In Pimpri division, Sangvi is a subdivision which includes Wakad, Tathavade, old and new Sangvi, Pimple Saudagar, Pimple Gurav, Pimple Nilakh, Vishal nagar and Thergaon area. The MSEDCL supplies power to around two lakh residents. Sandesh Pawar, resident of Mamtanagar, Sangvi said, “Our whole family tested positive. We have had a home quarantine for the last eight days. We are suffering a frequent power failure in our areas. We cannot go outside, and have to sit at home despite power failure. One one side, patients are struggling to get oxygen bed, ambulance, Remdesivir injection, vaccination and on the other, we have to struggle to get uninterrupted power. We are facing a very difficult situation.” Rohit Suryawanshi, resident of Sangvi, “I am working in an IT firm and doing work from home but, frequent power failure creates huge problems at work from home. In a day, we face power failure almost twice in a day, the situation is very unbearable one.” Shivaji Waifalka, executive engineer of Pimpri division of MSEDCL said, “In Sangvi area, the PCMC has undertaken road development work in which daily two-three underground cables of MSEDCL are damaged and residents have to face power failure problems during summer season. We have written several letters to PCMC officials to take care of underground cables and coordinate with MSEDCL officials during their work. However, the PCMC officials, especially contractors, are not co-operating with MSEDCL officials. Due to which, people have to face frequent power failure problems. In the last month, MSEDCL conducted a load shedding in Sangvi as 132 kilowatt high tension underground cables were damaged.” Vijay Bhojane, additional city engineer of PCMC said, “The PCMC is carrying out development work of road, water and drainage department as well as smart city work. We have given instruction to the contractor to contact the MSEDCL person before doing any digging work. However, MSEDCL is not able to provide a person who can guide contractors and workers about underground electrical cables.” MSEDCL cautions PCMC MSEDCL officials have informed PCMC about the interruption of power supply to Covid hospitals in Sangvi. MSEDCL mentioned in a press release that if PCMC fails to take precaution during development work there are chances of power failure in Covid-19 hospitals as well as other hospitals located in Sangvi area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sangvi-residents-irate-over-frequent-power-cuts-msedcl-blames-pcmc-101619019943408.html

It is necessary to make a proper system for FYJC admissions for this batch, or else there would be lot of issues in their career,” said Harishchandra Gaikwad, president of Pune district principals’ association. “In the last one year, no internal assessment of students was done in any of the schools due to the Covid-19 pandemic and so we cannot give proper marks for Class 10 students. While cancelling the board exams, what was the policy decided and its impact on future Class 11 admissions was taken into consideration or not? All this needs to be scrutinised and then further important decision of Class 11 admissions should be taken,” said Avinash Takwale, principal of Poona Night school. Umesh Chavan whose daughter is in Class 10 said, “We are happy that the state government considered safety of students first and took a decision to cancel the board examination. However, if my daughter gets less marks in the internal assessment from school which will impact her college admissions, then who will be responsible for it? There are lot of unanswered questions and confusion amongst students and parents.” Bandopant Bhuyar, state president of coaching classes teachers federation said, “The decision taken by the state government to cancel the board exams of Class 10 is completely wrong and it is going to have a long-lasting impact on students’ career. Not only for further Class 11 admissions, but at every step of their career when they will be marked Covid passed on their passing certificates.

21-04-2021||Delhi||‘Heavens won’t fall’: Court upbraids Centre on Delhi hospitals’ SOS for oxygen||The Delhi high court on Wednesday lashed out at the Centre for depleting supply of oxygen at many private hospitals in the national capital. The court was hearing a petition filed by Max Healthcare, which runs many hospitals in Delhi."Today, Max is before us, and we are sure soon there will be other hospitals too. Whatever Inox is supplying, is fine, but we are surprised that despite yesterday's order you haven't done anything," the bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said.The court had on Tuesday directed immediate implementation of an order to stop oxygen for industrial use to meet the demand by hospitals, ramping up of medicine supplies and vaccinating more people.The judges sought to know that why the Centre isn't diverting oxygen from petroleum and steel industries to give to Covid-19 patients who are in dire need of it. "Even if these industries are run at lower capacity since medical oxygen is needed, heavens are not going to fall. But with the stoppage of oxygen at this stage hell will break loose," it said, calling the Centre's decision to not stop the supply of oxygen to the industries as "completely ridiculous"."We don't care, beg, borrow, steal or requisition new plants if you want," said the judges asking the Centre to fulfill the hospitals' need of oxygen, critical for treatment and recovery of Covid-19 patients.Justices Sanghi and Palli also took note of the tragedy in Maharashtra's Nashik where 24 Covid-19 patients lost their lives due to disruption in oxygen supply.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, told the court that oxygen has been delivered at two of the Max hospitals - at Patparganj and Shalimar Bagh. He said that more oxygen is on its way and will reach the hospital shortly. "I have spoken to the highest authority, all efforts are being made to get oxygen supplied," said Mehta.The lawyers appearing for Max hospital hold the court that they have oxygen stock for just eight hours at Vaishali and Gurgaon facilities. The court then said that shortage of oxygen has become a national emergency and called for exercising sovereign power. Mehta replied saying there could be some constraints and that he will talk to the Centre. The court will hear the matter on Thursday.Many hospitals in Delhi, including Sir Ganga Ram, sent SOS to the government about their depleting stocks of oxygen. Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia also held a press conference where he pleaded the Centre to intervene and ensure adequate supply to the hospitals in the city.He also asked for increasing the oxygen quota of Delhi, which was okayed by the Centre late on Wednesday. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal thanked the Centre for it."Why is the Centre not waking up to the gravity of the situation? We are shocked and dismayed hospitals running out of oxygen but steel plants are running," the high court said.Meanwhile, the Centre said on Wednesday that of the total 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen being produced in India per day, 6,600 metric tonnes, as on date, is being allocated to states for medical use and assured that efforts are being made to increase its supplies in the coming days.At a press conference, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul appealed to the states, hospitals and nursing homes to ensure rational use of oxygen.Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan further said that a 24x7 control room has been set up where state governments can raise the problems bring faced by them like if their truck is stuck somewhere or the if movement is being hindered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/beg-borrow-steal-delhi-high-court-slams-centre-over-depleting-oxygen-supply-101619019513133.html

Smaller hospitals are solely dependent on oxygen cylinders and earlier, they were getting 30 per day, but now they are getting only two or three in a day,” said Dr Sanjay Patil, chairman, Pune Hospital Board of India. To deal with the situation of increasing Covid patients, many hospitals, since April, had started to take in more oxygen cylinders, but now the situation has changed. “In initial days, smaller hospitals managed to provide support to bigger hospitals with oxygen, but now it is not possible. In multi-speciality hospitals they have two options - either they have their own oxygen plant or have cylinders. This is not the case with small hospitals,” added Patil. “Large hospitals are not having a problem, only smaller ones as they depend on multiple cylinders,” said Bomi Bhote, head of the Private Hospital Association in Pune. “My father’s oxygen level is fluctuating and the hospital in Karvenagar where we take treatment now says that we need to approach another hospital. Most multi-speciality hospitals prefer doing all the diagnosis tests again, so my father will have to face these primary tests again,” said Chetan Kumbhar, a resident of Karvenagar. “We have been using an oxygen concentrator since the last two days for my aunt and her situation is all good. Our regular doctor is suggesting that we should admit her for a few days in a hospital where an oxygen bed is available as a precautionary measure. His own clinic has a facility, but they are not admitting any patients since they don’t have spare oxygen cylinders,” said Bharat Khadpe, a resident of Bavdhan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/oxygen-scarcity-small-hospitals-in-pune-referring-patients-to-multi-speciality-medical-centres-101619017663270.html

21-04-2021||Pune||Higher number of post-Covid patients in Pune report Mucormycosis, a rare fungal infection||Pune: More hospitals in the city are reporting an increased number of people diagnosed with Mucormycosis. Most of these reported cases are from those who have recovered from Covid-19. Mucormycosis is rare and serious fungal infection coupled with a high mortality rate. Earlier only a nominal number of cases were being reported throughout the year. Now almost every hospital is reporting about 10 more cases every month. Dr Sudhir Halikar, head of department, ENT, at Noble Hospital, said, “Mucormycosis is a serious fungal infection of sinonasal cavities which is usually seen in patients with uncontrolled diabetes with very high blood sugar levels and ketoacidosis. However, recently we have witnessed this serious fungal infection in patients treated for and recovering from Covid infection. Use of high doses of steroids, other medications leading to high blood sugar levels with compromised immunity probably is a reason for this dreaded infection.” A 60-year-old man was recovering from Covid, but he developed some cellulitis and redness on his cheek area which spread to the eye and was diagnosed with Mucormycosis. Dr Abhishek Ghosh, a microvascular reconstructive surgeon who treated the patient, said, “He was seen by the local ophthalmologist near Daund. Then they got an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) done and they came to our hospital. We started with advanced antifungals and put him up for surgery the next day. We did orbital exenteration and endoscopic sinus clearance. He is doing well and doesn’t need ICU and is on antifungal treatment which will last for three to four weeks.” “Last month, we treated six patients in the age group between 36 years and 70 years in our hospital alone. Two of them were non-diabetic, but developed high sugar levels during the course of treatment for Covid. Early diagnosis and treatment are critical in saving vision and life in such patients. We have saved two patients with intact vision and eyeballs, but in four cases the disease has already spread to orbit with the dead eye (and complete loss of vision),” Dr Ghosh added. Symptoms of Mucormycosis post-Covid may include redness or induration near the cheek or the eye or may have some sinusitis infection, bouts of headache, heaviness, blackish discharge from the nose, vision will suddenly deteriorate. Sudden onset of headache on one part of the brain along with redness or induration near the cheek or eye should be considered a warning signal in these post-Covidpatients. Once the vision is lost, the eyeball has to be completely removed along with sinus clearance through a surgery called orbital and sinonasal exenteration. Dr Halikar said, “There is a high mortality rate while treating Mucormycosis, but surgery is the only option. If that is not performed then the infection is likely to spread to the brain.” Dr Ameet Dravid, infectious disease control specialist from Poona Hospital, said, “India being the diabetes capital of the world, more number of cases of Mucormycosis post-Covid-19 are seen in India. Previously, we used to see two to three cases of Mucormycosis in a year. Now, we have started seeing 8 to 10 cases a month. This is an alarming rise. Poorly controlled diabetes and random prescription of steroids are leading to patients coming up with Mucormycosis at tertiary care centres. There is a high possibility that many cases are underreported, and people are losing their lives. This is happening because the symptoms are very subtle and timely investigations is not done.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/higher-number-of-post-covid-patients-in-pune-report-mucormycosis-a-rare-fungal-infection-101619016283235.html
21-04-2021||Kolkata||2nd Covid wave Modi-made disaster, says Mamata, rules out lockdown in Bengal||West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday sharpened her attack on the prime minister over the resurgence of Covid-19, terming it a "Modi-made disaster" and demanded that he quit if unable to provide adequate medical supplies to combat the disease.She also ruled out the possibility of a lockdown in the state amid spurting Covid-19 cases and said a universal vaccination drive for people aged 18 years and above will start from May 5.She alleged that 65 per cent of the drugs manufactured in the country for tackling the pandemic have already been exported."The Covid-19 pandemic had subsided in the country but has surged in a second wave owing to the monumental failure of the central government and negligence and total incompetence on its part," she said addressing public meetings at Chanchal in Malda and at Harirampur in Dakshin Dinajpur districts.As the Election Commission did not accede to Trinamool Congress' request to hold the last three of the eight-phase election in West Bengal on a single day, Banerjee said she is forced to combat the sharp rise in infections in the state as its chief minister as well campaign for Trinamool Congress, her party.Later, addressing a press conference in Malda, she said a lockdown will not be imposed but underscored the need for following Covid-appropriate behaviour."We are not in favour of a lockdown. We want everyone to adhere to Covid norms such as wearing masks, social distancing and using sanitisers. We don't want people to go back to those days of staying back at home. Lockdown is not a solution as it takes a heavy toll on people, jobs and economy," she said.She also said she will write a "strong letter" to Modi over "discriminatory" prices of Covid vaccines to be supplied by manufacturers to the Centre and states.The chief minister said around one crore people have so far been vaccinated against Covid in the state.Hitting out at Prime Minister Narendra Modi at her election rallies, Banerjee said, "The country is facing a Modi-made disaster. Modi Babu will have to take responsibility . Why medicines to treat Covid-19 are not available? You have to provide medicines or leave the chair. Either you control Corona or move out.""The second Covid wave is more intense. There are no injections or oxygen. Vaccines and medicines are being shipped abroad even as there is a scarcity of these items in the country," she earlier told a rally at Balurghat in Dakshin Dinajpur district."It is not a man-made disaster, it is Modi made." she added.Alleging that 65 per cent of drugs manufactured in the country to treat coronavirus have been exported, she said, while medicines may be given to other countries, it has to be also ensured that Indians get adequate supply on a priority basis."The BJP is attempting to break the spine of Bengal (but) we (TMC) have resolved to break its backbone," the feisty TMC supremo claimed, adding that none other than her party had the strength to fight Modi."Bengal is the land of Royal Bengal Tiger and we fight like one," Banerjee asserted.The chief minister claimed that her government has done a lot for the welfare of Rajbanshis, an ethnic group inhabiting parts of North Bengal, Assam and Meghalaya, and minorities in the state.Banerjee urged the people "not to allow division of votes" and to unitedly support the TMC.She said if the TMC is re-elected for a third consecutive term, her government will arrange soft loans of up to ₹10 lakh for higher education.Addressing a gathering in the Muslim-dominated Malda district, Banerjee asked the electorate to cast their votes in favour of the TMC irrespective of their religious beliefs as it is the "only party which has not allowed any division on grounds of religion".There is "no one else in the market" that can provide a government which will protect religious faith and rights of all people other than the TMC, Banerjee asserted and urged people not to divide anti-BJP votes by supporting the Congress or the Left Front.Earlier addressing an election rally at Balurghat, the TMC chief asserted that West Bengal will be run only by a "Bengal engine government" and not by "Modi's double-engine"."We will not allow Gujarat to capture our state or run it from Delhi. Bengal will rule Bengal," she said.The term "double-engine government" often used by BJP leaders denotes the government of the same party at the Centre and the state.The TMC chief also urged people not to vote for Left- Congress-ISF alliance candidates claiming that voting for them will strengthen the BJP's hand.She said that her administration is finding it difficult to set up safe homes for Covid patients as many government buildings are being used to house central forces.Banerjee claimed that the BJP is saying different things at different places on the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and the National Register of Citizens (NRC).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/2nd-covid-wave-modi-made-disaster-says-mamata-rules-out-lockdown-in-bengal-101619015156660.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Covid vaccine wastage in Haryana declines to 5.65%||Over three months after the start of anti-coronavirus vaccination drive, Haryana’s average vaccine wastage has come down to 5.65% from the 9.43% reported in January-end.Additional chief secretary (ACS), health, Rajeev Arora said that their vaccine wastage is much below the programmatic wastage of 10% allowed by the Union ministry of health.“The wastage has been declining here. It came down to 8.30% in February, 6.09% till April 9 and is at 5.65% by April 20,” the ACS said.Arora said that the vaccine wastage data is sourced from the electronic vaccine intelligence network (e-Vin) portal. “Till April 20, the state has vaccinated 33,47,548 people against total vaccine consumption of 35,48,130. Thus, the consumption is 94.35%,” he said.“E-Vin is data source for calculating consumption. The data source of coverage is taken as per actual reported coverage of vaccination reported by districts on daily-basis at state headquarters in Chandigarh. The portal gives actual consumption in real time. The Union health ministry is taking consumption data from e-Vin but considering Co-WIN data source for coverage,” the ACS said on discrepancy in state and central data.The ACS said that maximum vaccine wastage was in Covaxin, which has 10ml vials (20 doses). However, the new Covaxin vials are expected to be of 5ml (10 doses) and this will further reduce the wastage, he said.Meanwhile, the state government on Wednesday constituted a committee of three officers to examine the new vaccine policy announced by the central government and suggest a roadmap for achieving maximum vaccination in light of ‘vaccination for all’ starting from May 1.The committee — comprising Haryana Medical Systems Corporation managing director Saket Kumar, NHM mission director Prabhjot Singh, and director general health services Dr Veena Singh — has been asked to submit its report by Thursday.Under the new policy, vaccine manufacturers will supply 50% of their monthly Central Drugs Laboratory (CDL) released doses to Centre and will be free to supply the remaining 50% doses to state governments and in the open market.The Serum Institute of India which manufactures Covishield fixed the price at ₹600 per dose for private hospitals and ₹400 per dose for state governments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-vaccine-wastage-in-haryana-declines-to-565-101619015446812.html

A day after Hindustan Times highlighted how Covid testing and vaccinations were being carried out in close proximity at the civil surgeon’s office, no corrective steps were taken.Though the health department and civil surgeon’s offices were closed on Wednesday, on account of Ram Navami, residents continued to throng the premises for testing and vaccination. Some residents complained that they had started queuing up since 8am, which is the official time for the start of vaccinations, but the health professionals did not turn up till about 9am.Rakesh Kumar, a resident of Civil Lines, said he had arrived at the vaccination unit around 8am but there were no health officials present. He added that the cotton swabs given after administering the vaccine were also seen scattered at the spot. “It was only after a few of us raised the issue that a dustbin was placed to discard cotton swabs. Also, initially people were queuing up at the site haphazardly. We took up the matter with a cop on duty there following which the authorities started issuing tokens,” said Kumar. Gaurav Kumar, another resident, who was waiting for his turn to get tested, said, “In government offices, it is now mandatory to show a Covid negative report before entering. I have to visit the RTA office so I am getting a test. But there seems to be no one to regulate the crowd here. It is very risky,” Sunil Kumar, another resident who had turned up for testing, said, “There are so many rooms lying vacant on the premises. But the authorities are still adamant on packing everyone together.”Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar said due caution was taken to avoid mingling of the two groups. The issue will be resolved soon, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/poor-planning-at-civil-surgeon-s-office-continues-to-put-people-at-risk-of-infection-101619012743036.html

Since last year, the entire country has together fought against Covid-19. State governments, central government, societies, colonies cannot fight this on their own and everyone has to join hands and fight this together. The Centre has always supported us (Delhi) and I request them to keep up this spirit and increase the quota,” Sisodia said.Also Read| Only 5 hours of oxygen left at Ganga Ram hospital as Covid-19 crisis worsensHe also alleged that the set quota of oxygen is unable to reach Delhi.

21-04-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: Killa-é-Hissar... The forgotten stronghold of medieval Pune||If you look at the extent of present Pune city, Sinhagad fort lays almost on its boundary and may soon be part of the city limits. Fort Sinhagad is quintessentially identified as a fort of Pune and during some part of the Maratha rule it served as an administrative centre, too. But, do you know of a fort which is hidden in plain sight right in the heart of Pune? And no, it is not Shaniwarwada, with its fortified walls.To know more, we have to go back in time to medieval Pune of the 15th century. The change of rule in Deccan after Khilji and Tughlaq dynasties had finally led to rise of the Bahamani kingdom, the first independent Muslim power of the Deccan. Junnar Paragana was under the Bahamani kingdom then. The Vazir (prime minister), who also had the title Maliku’t-Tujar (Prince of Merchants), was appointed to look after this important Junnar Pargana, which included Pune. He is credited with building a formidable land fort in Chakan called “Sangramdurg”. Shortly after his death in a battle in the Konkan, Kasam Beig Shafaat Khan an Arab sardar was appointed in his place as Maliku’t-Tujar. Being a senior Sardar from Arabastan, he was popularly known as “Bada Arab”.“Purandare Daftar”, an important archival document recording the important political events of medieval Deccan and Pune, informs us that Bada Arab ruled from Chakan and over Pune till the year 1480. It was around 1460, that he commissioned the fort at Pune on the “gaon-pandhar” (archaeological mound of the then settlement). This reference to “pandhar/pandhari” is interesting, as such mounds are formed due to extended period of occupation by humans. The burning of dung, biomass and soil due to cooking turns into ash and this ash accumulates over centuries to form mounds of whitish soil known as “pandhari” in Marathi. “Pandhari” is relatively white grey in colour as compared to the blackish or brownish soil of the Deccan. Thus, the “pandhari” of Pune which was an elevated mound denotes that the settlement of Pune existed some centuries before the fort was built on the previous ruins.This pandhari of Pune is located on about an acre around present Surya hospital, opposite Shaniwarwada. This is the exact area or epicentre of Pune where signs of previous settlements have been unearthed. The records tell us that name of the fort was “Killa- é –Hissar” (Hissar, too, means fort in Persian). Popularly, it was known as “Pandharicha Kot”. A small garrison was stationed at the fort. However, history is unaware of any significant battles fought where these defences were put to use.The fort was roughly rectangular in size. The details of the fort walls were recorded in the Pune Gazetteer of 1885. They extended from the Mutha river banks near Dhakta Sheikh Salla Dargah, west, upto 118 metres; 268 metres to the south and 186 metres to the east. These walls had openings to fire at the enemy called “janga”. An intact part of the wall can be still seen as one walks on the footpath from Surya Hospital to Kasba Ganpati.The fort had three entrances or gateways. The one near the present day Shaniwarwada is called “Konkan darwaja”. It was customary to name the gateways facing west, where the Konkan lies, to be named as such. Even though the gateway is lost today, the stairs coming down from the fort walls are still seen. Recently, a group working to generate awareness about Pune’s heritage, Varasa Prasarak Mandali, cleaned the stairs, lit lamps and displayed historical information, to generate awareness about this forgotten heritage. The other gateway known as “Nagar darwaja” (city gate) was located to east of the fort, at the present Pawale chowk. Recent road works have erased any signs of the plinth of this gateway. However, one can still witness patches of stone wall with large dressed stones near Mote Mangal Karyalay and around Tambat Ali.The third gateway was to the north, according to historian Pandhurang Balkawade, and opened to the river Mutha. A Bahamani period structure following Dakkhani Indo-Islamic architecture is still buried near the boundaries of the fort wall. The shed near Deshpande Church has a building with wide arches in stone. It was once open on all the sides. The conjectural drawing indicates that it might have been used as a “Sarai” or “Dharmashala” to host travellers, traders and pilgrims. Today, only the top portion of the arch with a keystone can be seen above ground. Massive damage to “Killa-é-Hissar” was caused during Nizam Shahi Sardar, Murar Jogdeo’s campaign and destruction of Pune in the early 17th century. We also know Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj was not particularly in favour of raising land forts which would invite enemy attention. So, the Bahamani fort suffered further neglect during his occupation of Pune. Subsequently, the expanse of Pune, under the Marathas and Peshwas, the building of Shaniwarwada, and rearranging of the entire Kasba area, reduced the fort to few patches of walls. Today, buildings have come up even over the fortified plinths at certain places. And yet history is not easily erased. The fort vestiges peep out from centuries of neglect, to tell you that Pune once hosted a fortified stronghold in its heart.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-killa-hissar-the-forgotten-stronghold-of-medieval-pune-101619003025775.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat harvest done, Punjab farmers head for Delhi border||Despite the Covid-19 curbs, hundreds of Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ekta-Ugrahan) activists headed for Delhi’s Tikri border via Khanauri on Wednesday after completing the wheat harvest to intensify their struggle against the three laws. Farmer leaders claimed that the Centre was trying to thwart their agitation on the pretext of the pandemic. The protesters were seen without masks and did not observe social distancing. BKU (Ugrahan) chief Joginder Singh Ugrahan said the protesters will intensify the agitation at Tikri on April 22. “The BJP government wants to vacate the protest sites in the name of coronavirus. The government can use any tool like day or night curfew, but we will continue the protest.” Also read: Farmers’ protest: Delhi-Haryana border points remain closedManjit Singh Gharachon, a senior vice-president of BKU (Ugrahan), said, “If there is any coronavirus, it will kill a small number of people. But the laws will kill thousands of people with hunger. We choose to die at the battleground instead of hunger.” The farmers from Malwa assembled at the Khanauri border in cars, mini trucks, Canters and tractor-trolleys. Administration looks the other wayWhen contacted, the Patiala district administration denied any information about the gathering of farmers in large numbers. “It was not in my knowledge. I will ask the SDM concerned to look into the matter. We will act accordingly,” Patiala deputy commissioner Kumar Amit said. Patran sub- divisional magistrate Palika Arora also denied information about the gathering and said, “There is no action against farmers. Neither the administration sent them nor do they march under our supervision.”Sangrur SSP Vivek Sheel Soni said that the area where farmers assembled was not in his jurisdiction.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-harvest-done-punjab-farmers-head-for-delhi-border-101619002663127.html

The head was also found buried in the house. Police said Harpal Singh was murdered by his son Pipal with the help of his friend Gursewak Singh and domestic help Jaswinder Singh at Deep Singh Wala village early on Sunday when he refused to give money to his son for drugs. Also read: 22 Covid patients dead after oxygen leak at Nashik hospital; probe orderedSuperintendent of police Bal Krishan Singla said that during a random check, they found the head buried inside the house on Tuesday and also recovered the rope that was used to strangulate him. “After the recovery of the head, we rounded up the family members and domestic help. Pipal and the other accused confessed to committing the crime during interrogation,” he said. “Pipal is a drug addict and was recently admitted to a de-addiction centre. A case is registered against him under the NDPS Act in the Gur Har Sahai police station. Harpal used to stop his son from taking drugs and refused to give him money for it, which led to the murder. Pipal thought if his father dies, all the property will belong to him, and he won’t have to ask him for money. So, along with Jaswinder and Gursewak, he drugged his father with an injection while he was sleeping and strangulated him to death. Later, they hanged the body, using a plastic rope to make it look like a suicide. But the body fell on the floor and with the force of the drop, the head got severed,” he said. Police have recovered the syringe used to drug the victim and the remaining part of the rope used to hang him. A case was registered under Sections 302 (murder), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence) and 34 (common intention) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) at Sadiq police station.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/drug-addict-son-held-for-killing-father-for-refusing-to-give-him-money-101619000982978.html

21-04-2021||Mumbai||Have sufficient supply but use Remdesivir, oxygen wisely: Maharashtra health minister Tope||Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope on Wednesday said that the state has sufficient supply of the drug Remdesivir to fulfil the demand for the day but asked doctors to properly use medical oxygen and the anti-viral drug. Demand for Remdesivir soared manifold across several states as India is facing a second wave of Covid-19 infection. The drug is listed for use to treat serious Covid-19 patients.“We have sufficient (supplies of Remdesivir) as per today’s demand but the only challenge is of distribution. I appeal to doctors to use medical oxygen and Remdesivir properly,” Tope was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi government and the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party have also blamed each other over the shortage of Remdesivir. The BJP accused the Maharashtra government over mishandling of the Covid-19 pandemic while the state government said that the BJP is trying to create a law-and-order situation over the supply of Remdesivir.Pune, Mumbai, Nagpur and Thane which are among the worst affected cities faced a crisis of Remdesivir injections which led to widespread fear and concern among people whose friends and families have been infected by Covid-19. They expressed concern over Remdesivir stocks not reaching small hospitals, according to a report by HT.Mumbai Police also warned medicine shops over hoarding of Remdesivir. The city police questioned Bruck Pharma director over the alleged stocking of vials and claimed the consignment of Remdesivir has been moved to a storage in Daman.The health minister said he was hopeful that the state would receive imported medical oxygen to meet its medical oxygen requirement. Along with Remdesivir, medical oxygen demand went up due to the second wave. Tope said that 15% of the active cases in the state would require medical oxygen. Maharashtra currently has 683,856 active cases.“We are anticipating that 15% of current active cases may need oxygen. We have an arrangement for 1,550 metric tonnes of oxygen in Maharashtra. We are also producing 1,259 tonnes of liquid oxygen all of which will be used for medical purposes only. We are expecting oxygen which the Government of India will import,” Tope further added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/have-sufficient-supply-but-use-remdesivir-oxygen-wisely-maharashtra-minister-101618998688753.html
21-04-2021||Lucknow||UP man says ‘hospital called to offer bed for Covid-19 positive father day after he died'||As Sushil Kumar Srivastava's breathlessness worsened, his family bundled the 70-year-old into a car and drove him to a hospital in the capital of India's northern Uttar Pradesh state, where he tested positive for the coronavirus.After the private hospital turned the retired government official away because it didn't have any vacant beds, his son Ashish brought two oxygen cylinders and drove his father on a hunt for a hospital that could admit him.Followed latest updates on Covid-19 here "All the hospitals asked for a referral letter from the chief medical officer's (CMO) office," Ashish said, referring to the top healthcare official of the city of some 3.5 million people.At the office, Ashish said nobody helped him. "I was shooed away by the police," he said, when he tried to meet the CMO.Three days later, Ashish said someone from the government called him offering a bed for his father - a day after Srivastava had passed away at a private clinic.The family's ordeal reflects the worsening Covid-19 crisis in Uttar Pradesh, where people are battling bureaucracy along with the disease.To get a Covid-19 bed in Lucknow, families say they need to show the result of an RT-PCR test, which are already in short supply.Next, patients are required to register with the CMO's office, which then forwards the request to the Integrated Command Control Centre for COVID management that makes the final bed allocation, a government official said.The cumbersome process has come under criticism, including from the state's Human Rights Commission that has asked the government to ditch the referral rule."There are expert doctors in hospitals who can decide if the patient needs to be admitted or not," the commission said on Tuesday. "This referral letter system is not required."Having already become the country currently being hit hardest by the pandemic, India has recorded more than 200,000 new Covid-19 cases daily for the last seven days, marking the world's steepest rise this month, and there is no sign yet that the second wave of infections is going to peak soon.In Uttar Pradesh, home to 200 million people, infections are rising by more than 22,000 cases daily, severely straining its creaky healthcare system.The state government has said it is turning several hospitals into Covid-only facilities and adding more beds. It did not respond to questions from Reuters.BEGGING FOR HELPAt Lucknow's CMO office, adjacent to two large hospitals, dozens of people line up daily, requesting, begging and sometimes crying for a referral letter required for hospital admissions.This week, local TV news channels aired footage of a young man lying on the road to block the CMO's car in his desperation to get a letter for an ailing relative.Patients need to show an RT-PCR test confirming infection before being given a referral letter.But these tests are increasingly hard to access for most patients, with long queues outside hospitals and clinics over-burdened due to the surge in infections."Getting an RT-PCR done in U.P. is next to impossible," said journalist Shreya Jai, whose family members had to wait for a week to get a rapid antigen test.Many Lucknow labs are working with less than half their staff, the rest sickened by the virus, a lab worker said, asking not to be named.The state government has said that nearly 230 private and state-run labs were being used for coronavirus testing.On Monday, the state government led by Yogi Adityanath, who himself is currently down with Covid-19, was pilloried for its handling of the crisis by a regional court."It is a shame that while the government knew of the magnitude of the second wave it never planned things in advance," the state's Allahabad High Court said.In the Srivastava household, in a middle-class neighbourhood in central Lucknow, there is anger and sadness after the cremation of the head of the family."I blame the officers sitting in air conditioned chambers for my father's death," said 39-year-old Ashish, who himself is now COVID-19 positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/up-man-says-hospital-called-to-offer-bed-for-covid-19-positive-father-day-after-he-died-101618996827234.html

The relatives [of victims] are very angry.”Angry relatives alleged that the hospital did not inform them about the incident. “It was only after we barged inside that we got to know that our loved ones were dead,” one of them said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/22-covid-patients-at-nashik-hospital-die-following-leakage-from-oxygen-cylinder-101618998283382.html

The SGPC had initiated a probe into the withdrawal of ₹10 lakh from the account of a former assistant professor, Sukhjinder Kaur, after the complaint by her husband Harjinder Singh Minhas that the money was withdrawn from his wife’s account using a cheque carrying her forged signature. After the complaint, the college credited the money back into Sukhjinder’s account. According to the chargesheet, Sahib Singh has been asked to explain how the money was credited back into the victim’s account. It said that Sahib Singh allegedly received ₹1.86 lakh out of the money withdrawn from Sukhwinder’s account as per superintendent’s statement. Charge sheet says Sahib was entitled to get ₹5,000 monthly car allowance when he was holding additional charge of principal of Sant Baba Dalip Singh memorial Khalsa college, Dumali, between 2014 to 2016 but he continued to claim car allowance 2016 to 2020 even though he didn’t hold the additional charge. Sahib Singh was further charged of claiming ₹1,000 mobile allowance instead of entitlement amount ₹500. Also, he received ₹19 lakh advance loan in six years without any approval from higher authorities. Jasbir Singh was chargesheeted for financial irregularities in the Sukhwinder Kaur matter. Sahib Singh denied all charges, saying he has submitted his reply to the director education of SGPC and he didn’t commit any financial irregularity. He said he didn’t receive any communication from SGPC regarding this, but was told to retire on April 30. Minhas lodged a complaint with SGPC president Gobind Singh Longowal on October 4, 2020, saying that his wife Sukhjinder Kaur had taken premature retirement in 2016 due to health problems and moved to Canada for the treatment. “My wife never returned to India since 2016,” he said. As per the complaint, In May 2016, the SGPC’s directorate of public instructions (DPI) colleges transferred nearly ₹10 lakh to Sukhjinder’s account against her arrears. Minhas said when his wife checked her account , ₹10 lakh were found to be withdrawn in 2016 through a cheque carrying her forged signatures. “We approached the bank and accessed the cheque used to withdraw the money and detected the forgery,” Minhas said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sgpc-chargesheets-its-jalandhar-college-principal-supdt-for-financial-irregularities-101618997565249.html

He added that a fresh set of standard operating procedures (SoPs) for healthcare centres was also expected. District authorities have also been instructed to ensure primary, referral and district hospitals are equipped with necessary equipment, medicines and personnel to ensure effective diagnosis and treatment at the local level, reducing pressure on big centres in major cities.On Tuesday, as many as 10,455 Covid-19 cases, the highest in a single day, were registered in Bihar. Of these 2,186 infections were reported in Patna and 1,081 in Gaya- the two worst hit cities. The state has a total of 56,354 active cases, as per the health department’s data.Chief minister Nitish Kumar earlier asked for drastically cutting down the waiting time for RT-PCR tests and results, identifying it as one of the reasons for late diagnosis, which has proven fatal in several Covid cases.The state government’s crisis management group met on Tuesday and asked the district magistrates (DMs) to ensure oximeters, basic pathology laboratories, medicines and Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) kits were sufficiently stacked at the primary health centres (PHCs), community health centres, sub-divisional and district hospitals for effective medical management of Covid patients at the local level.“Only critically sick persons, who required critical care, shall be allowed admission in the premier hospitals like AIIMS, PMCH, NMCH, IGIMS, etc,” said the CM’s principal secretary. AIIMS - All India Institute of Medical Sciences, PMCH – Patna Medical College Hospital NMCH - Nalanda Medical College and Hospital and IGIMS - Indira Gandhi Institute of Medical Sciences are public hospitals in Patna.The CMG also set up a special task force, led by industries director Panka Dixit, to monitor and ramp up production and supply of liquid oxygen from refilling plants in neighbouring states—Bokaro and Jamshedpur plants in Jharkhand and Durgapur plant in West Bengal. Currently, three private plants in Patna are generating oxygen from air to refill up to 50 cylinders per hour. They are operational round the clock. Another oxygen plant in Begusarai has also begun production, and plants attached with premier hospitals have been told to optimise production.In other measures taken on Tuesday, the panchayati raj department has been told to distribute six face masks, free of cost to each household in rural areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-mulls-fresh-treatment-protocol-to-cope-with-new-covid-variant-101618997563769.html
21-04-2021||Delhi||Compassion first: Home chefs take to serving Covid patients||With so many families getting afflicted with Covid-19, getting a home-cooked nutritious meal often becomes difficult, even though it’s crucial. Most can’t cook on their own when unwell, and many are unable to get such food home delivered. Pitching in with help are home chefs and some newly turned home cooks, across NCR, who are coming forward to support Covid-19 patients and families, as an alarming number of people get gripped by the virus in the second wave. “A lot of Covid-19 patients complained that eateries have been declining their food orders because of them testing positive and their maids had stopped coming; the patients were themselves too weak to cook. That is what propelled us to step in,” informs Suman Tamang, a chef at Mini’s Home Kitchen, adding, “We prepare the meals in advance, and have shared our menus across Delhi and Gurugram to help as much as we can. We also customise the meals according to individual health requirements. Since the pandemic struck, we’ve served more than 100 families.”Gurugram-based Shachi Jain has been serving Covid-19 patients across Delhi-NCR, since last September. “I used to feed four to five families per day. That number has grown to eight families per day in the second wave,” says Jain, adding, “We’ve to be careful when serving someone who is Covid-19 positive. The nutritional value of the food, allergies, etc needs to be kept in mind. Their taste buds are so terribly disturbed, so one has to make the food look attractive without using much spices.” “Covid-19 itna fael chuka hai ki catering the home quarantining patients is on top priority for me right now. My phone doesn’t stop ringing... We need more people to show humanity and come forward to serve others at such a time,” says home chef Chiranjip Dabra, who, too, has had her hands full. She adds, “Whatever I serve to my own family is what I deliver to the clients. Covid-19 patients have a lot of throat issues, which I keep in mind. Khichdi, pulao, daliya are soothing for the stomach. One thali starts from ₹100 and goes up to ₹145. The delivery is completely contactless, and package is taped.” A Delhi-based primary school teacher, Megha Anubhaw Prasad, who is delivering food as a means to help people, says, “I’m getting a lot of orders from my society and neighbouring societies, too. I served for a month last year, and have started again since there are so many cases now. I’m serving them chapati, rice, dal and one vegetable and salad or egg curry to those who like it. Main jitna kar sakti hoon, utna koshish kar rahi hoon. This is my way to help anyone in need, while I work from my home kitchen.”Noida-based home chef Poonam Arora, who used to run a catering business, has also shifted her focus to help out Covid-19 patients. She says, “It’s more important to be human right now rather than concentrate on minting money! I’ve put out a Facebook post, with my direct contact number, to help cook meals for patients, and people have been contacting me. Whatever they require, I cook and send it.”Another Gurugram-based home chef Sonali Chatterji does about 100 meals per week and endeavours to serve good quality, value-for-money food. “In such deliveries, I don’t make profits. And it’s okay. I’m sending food all the way to Ghaziabad, twice a week. There are people who want dal, roti, sabzi, and some want continental non-spicy food, high on protein... I avoid making it too oily or spicy,” she shares.“I do about 100 meals per week,” says Sonali Chatterji, another Gurugram-based home chef. Talking about how the orders have increased, she says she endeavours to serve good quality, value for money food. “This is a lot of responsibility. In such deliveries, I don’t make profits. And it’s okay. I’m sending food all the way to Ghaziabad, twice a week. There are people who want dal, roti, sabzi, and there are some who want continental non spicy food that’s high on protein. Two of the people who I’m sending food to, requested for fish and chicken, and I prepare all this without it being too oily or spicy.” Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/compassion-first-home-chefs-take-to-serving-covid-patients-101618997509067.html

The government also set up a new 6 Kilo Litre capacity Medical Oxygen plant at the Chamarajanagar District Hospital. Sharing the information on Twitter, Sudhakar said the oxygen plant will be operational very soon. There had been an acute shortage of Remdesivir and oxygen in the state ever since the surge in Covid cases was noticed. To meet the oxygen shortage, the government asked the private companies to establish oxygen plants and supply medical oxygen as well. Shortage of Remdesivir amid a surge in coronavirus cases has led to illegal storage and blackmarketing of the important drug. Recently a few people were arrested in Karnataka for allegedly selling the drug at exorbitant prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-govt-sets-up-war-room-to-monitor-supply-of-oxygen-remdesivir-for-covid-19-treatment-101618994162543.html
21-04-2021||Delhi||Driven to save lives : Sunil Masta||“Jeevan daan sabse bada daan hota hai. If god has given me a second chance at life by healing me from Corona, it is my duty to use this life to save the lives of others who are battling the virus, by donating my plasma.” These words are of a plasma hero who saved lives of critical patients through plasma therapy, by donating his plasma sixteen times over, after conquering Covid, last year. Meet 54 years old Sunil Masta, a Haryana resident who apart from being a plasma donor amid the pandemic, has also been a blood donor from the age of seventeen, saving lives of children suffering from cancer through his donation. Masta first donated plasma, when a youngster from his office called him, requesting for plasma donation for his parents who were admitted in ICU because of Covid. Ever since then, Masta keeps going for regular check ups to donate plasma to save more people’s lives. Project Plasma is a Fever Network initiative to celebrate the super power of Covid recovered plasma donors like Masta, who are stepping forward amid the second wave of Covid, to donate their plasma to save lives of other infected patients. Driven to save lives and in search of a genuine NGO enabling plasma donation, Masta came across the Kamla Arora Blessings Welfare Foundation on social media. Founded by Bhawna Arora to continue her mother’s legacy of charity and service, this foundation has been working rigorously with the government to serve Covid infected patients amid the pandemic. It has enabled over three thousand plus plasma donors to donate their platelets and save the lives of infected patients through plasma therapy.Despite the earnest efforts of such foundations, however, there still remains a dearth of plasma donors. “There’s a dire need of plasma right now, in the second wave of Corona. The demand for plasma is much more than the supply. People should come forward and donate if eligible! My doctors told me that the more you donate, the more antibodies against the virus are built in your body,” says Masta, encouraging Covid recovered persons to come forward, use their power to save lives and become plasma heros.Inspired by an incident when a few strangers showed kindness and saved Masta’s father’s life by taking him to the hospital after the latter met with an accident, Masta feels compelled to save lives,”I understand the value of the life of a family member to their family and so, jab tak hai jaan aur jab tak hai antibodies main toh plasma donate karte rahoonga aur zindigiya bachata rahoonga.” Talking about how plasma donors needn’t be afraid of anything, he says, “There’s no risk in donating plasma. It’s as easy as donating blood. People are afraid of donating plasma because of the fear of catching the infection again. But they need to understand that donating plasma in a blood bank is the safest because blood banks are the most hygienic part of the hospital! Just carry a sanitiser, wear a mask and you’ll be perfectly fine, you already have antibodies against Corona.”Calling on Covid recovered people to show empathy, and donate their plasma to enable plasma therapy for others Masta says, “Put yourself in other people’s shoes who need plasma right now and are hanging by a thread for their lives. If you were in their shoes and you needed plasma, how would’ve you felt if no one came forward to help you? If you’re an eligible donor, use this opportunity to save a life.”You are a superhero if you have recovered from Covid 19 because you have the power to save a life! Call on 8800570768 to donate plasma and save lives.Author tweets @FizzyBuddhaFollow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/driven-to-save-lives-sunil-masta-101618991504010.html

The official added attempts are on to identify the people behind the incident and cases were being lodged.Madhya Pradesh is suffering from one of the worst surges of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) as the state recorded more than 12,000 cases on Tuesday taking its tally to 433,704. The death toll in the city also rose to 4,713 with 77 fresh fatalities. The state imposed restrictions akin to lockdown to check the transmission of the virus.Medical experts highlighted that during the second wave of Covid-19 there is a higher demand for oxygen. Oxygen remains an indispensable tool in treating Covid-19 as the disease leads to respiratory problems. “There has been a sudden surge in Covid-19 cases, creating panic among the people to get admitted to hospitals and, therefore, the oxygen requirement suddenly shot up, which is one reason. But this is limited data from hospital settings and more will have to be looked at,” ICMR director general Balram Bhargava said on Tuesday.Reliance Industries Ltd ramped up its production of medical oxygen and it is being supplied free of cost to states which are severely affected by Covid-19, including Madhya Pradesh. The demand for oxygen went up in Maharashtra and Delhi as well. Delhi high court on Tuesday pulled up the Centre amid reports of a crisis in medical oxygen being reported from the national capital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/miscreants-flee-with-oxygen-cylinders-from-hospital-in-mp-s-damoh-probe-ordered-101618990160966.html

All three died on the spot along with the driver of the van, Danish, said police officials.The workers identified as Jagru, Ganpat and Vijay, were residents of Karanpur Kala village in Bulandshahr district. They had been working in Haryana’s Jind district for some time and decided to return home on Tuesday due to the deteriorating Covid-19 situation, said a police officer placed at the senior superintendent of police (SSP) office, Bulandshahar.Police team from Anoopshahar rushed to the spot and bodies of the deceased were sent for post-mortems, before they were handed over to respective families.The accident was a reminder of unfortunate incidents witnessed last year during the peak of Covid-19-induced lockdown, when several migrants, devoid of regular transport, lost their lives in accidents when returning home from their respective workplaces. The renewal of restrictions in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 has reignited fears among the migrants, who are again on the move from major business centres, albeit in smaller numbers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/4-including-3-migrant-workers-killed-in-accident-while-returning-home-101618989822840.html

While most streets wore a deserted look, bus stops were massively crowded as migrants were seen rushing to their home states fearing the extension of the shutdown.Prime Minister Narendra Modi told the state governments on Tuesday to reach out to migrants and ensure their well-being. While announcing the shutdown on Monday, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal too had appealed to the migrants to stay back in the national capital as it is only a “short lockdown.” “I appeal to you with folded hands. It's a small lockdown, only for six days. Don't leave Delhi and go. I am very hopeful and that we won't need to further extend the lockdown. The government will take care of you," the chief minister said.On Tuesday, Delhi witnessed a spike of 28,395 coronavirus cases and 277 deaths, according to the data released by the Delhi government's health department.Here’s a look at the Delhi lockdown in photos||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-under-lockdown-migrants-rush-to-home-states-in-photos-101618984758164.html
21-04-2021||Lucknow||They laugh and joke at poll rallies as people cry for oxygen: Priyanka criticises Yogi Adityanath, PM Modi||Congress leader Priyanka Gandhi Vadra on Tuesday criticised the Uttar Pradesh government for failing to increase the number of tests to detect coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and not doing enough to boost medical infrastructure to deal with the increasing cases of the infection, news agency ANI reported.“Their (UP government’s) own sero-survey showed that five crore people came in contact with Covid-19. It was recommended to ramp up testing. The government started 70% antigen testing, which means only 30% of those tests were RT-PCR,” Priyanka Gandhi Vadra said.“What is more important? People’s lives or your numbers or the image of your government? Were the antigen tests done to lower the numbers. There are reports that private labs are being told to stop the testing,” she further added.Priyanka Gandhi’s reaction comes after Uttar Pradesh recorded more than 20,000 cases over the past few days. The state recorded 29,754 fresh cases on Tuesday pushing the state’s tally beyond nine lakh. Uttar Pradesh’s death toll crossed 10,000-mark after the state reported 162 deaths.She also criticised the Prime Minister for holding rallies in poll-bound states. “They are busy campaigning even today. At rallies they are seen laughing from stages while people are reduced to tears seeking oxygen, beds, medicines and you are holding huge rallies and laughing,” the Congress general secretary said.Prime Minister Modi is scheduled to hold rallies in Murshidabad, South Kolkata, Siuri and Malda on April 23. She also said that Modi needs to sit with people and discuss a solution to the prevailing crisis.The Congress leader also criticised the Union health minister for his response to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh’s letter to Modi where he suggested strategies to deal with the current Covid-19 situation. The former Prime Minister, who is also recovering from Covid-19, in a letter to his successor had said that more people should be vaccinated against Covid-19 and suggested that absolute numbers should not be taken as a standard to evaluate the success of the vaccination programme.“Everyone knows how dignified a person Manmohan Singh is. If he is suggesting measures at a time when our nation is facing pandemic, then suggestions should be taken up with the same dignity with which they were offered,” Priyanka Gandhi said.India on recorded 295,041 cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 2,023 deaths in the last 24 hours, both figures being the highest-ever since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the latest data released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare on Wednesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/they-joke-at-rallies-while-people-cry-for-oxygen-priyanka-slams-yogi-pm-modi-101618982269089.html
21-04-2021||Delhi||Above 18 happy to get the Covid jab? Well, mostly!||Excitement, nervousness and a few apprehensions — the news that all adults above 18 could get the jab in “a liberalised and accelerated Phase 3 strategy of Covid-19 vaccination” from May 1, has brought mixed reactions from the young. ‘We need to have faith in the system’After India reported a new record high of around 2.73 lakh cases in a day, the news of the vaccine becoming available to everyone above 18, came as a sigh of relief to many such as 19-year-old Political Science student Abhir Bhalla. He feels this decision was “much needed”, and adds, “Young people, after all, are the ones who are out and about the most and are carriers and spreaders of the disease. That’s also because people had started to believe that the young are somewhat immune from the virus, which is certainly not the case. If we look at what doctors have been saying, the second wave has witnessed a lot of youngsters with severe cases. Undoubtedly, there are apprehensions because there has been speculations around the efficacy of the vaccines and the whole situation with blood clots and all, but I think we need to have faith in the system.” A 24-year-old Aniketh Sircar, Delhi-based MBA student, shares the sentiment and adds that he will certainly take the shot “irrespective of the side effects and the probability of still contracting the virus”. “If the government had approved of the vaccine, it would’ve been for a reason, and hence I’m looking forward to the availability of the vaccine for the youth as well,” adds Sircar. “I have three main reasons to get the vaccine,” says Ruchir Gupta, a corporate professional, adding, “Firstly it’ll help us achieve herd immunity, secondly it’ll open up options for travelling for both work and leisure and thirdly, psychologically I would be relieved that I’ve taken the jab!” A “small discomfort” shouldn’t have bearing on the decision, feels Akshay Kumar, a 29-year-old business architect, who is glad that the government has announced the vaccination for the youth. “I would rather get vaccinated than get caught by the virus with no way to recover! A small discomfort would be far better than landing in an ICU,” he says. ‘No one can assure there won’t be long term side effects’ And then there are those that have certain apprehensions for taking the jab. “I feel very hesitant in getting vaccinated,” says 22-year-old Jacqueline Joseph, a BEd student in Noida, adding, “Most people who are getting vaccinated are also contracting Covid, which is a very alarming concern since it negates the purpose for which the vaccine was created! Since the beginning of the pandemic last year, I’ve pretty much stayed put at home. Fortunately for the time being I can work remotely. Although that still comes with constraints and worries.”18-year-old Chiquitta Oberoi says she would like to get vaccinated, but wishes to see some results of the vaccine before going ahead. She says, “I’ve seen my family and friends getting bad body aches, head aches, high temperature, cough etc. Since the Covid vaccine is really new in the market, no one can assure that there will be no long term side effects on the body, which also makes me sceptical.” Author Tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/above-18-happy-to-get-the-covid-jab-well-mostly-101618981843563.html

21-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi private labs halt Covid-19 test services for 2 days over delay in results||A rapid rise in Covid-19 cases and exceeding requests for either RT-PCR or antigen tests has abruptly forced a majority of private laboratories to stop collecting swab samples even from testing centres for at least two days.As per a government bulletin on Tuesday evening, in the last 24 hours, Delhi conducted 86,526 tests. Despite having sufficient infrastructure and equipped with machines and testing kits, many labs are closing themselves for three to four days citing overburden and shortage in manpower.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here As per ICMR guidelines, the data of results have to be uploaded within 24 hours. Centres overburdened with pressure are even failing to provide results even within 48 hours of collecting the swab samples.To keep pace with the Covid-19 surge and to check the delay in providing results, the Delhi government on April 16 issued an order stating, "Keeping in view the above and to ensure that districts (and Government hospitals) have an adequate number of slots available in labs to get their samples processed within a stipulated time frame (preferably 24 hours and latest within 48 hours) through the Gold Standard Test in continuation of order 1 tF.No.253/DGHS/PLIW-IV/COVID-19/ NCDC/2020/ 12205-12274 dated 15/01/202 the linkage of public and private sector lab with each District of NCT of Delhi is amended with immediate effect."However, failing to provide the results within the said time limit of 48 hours, labs are being forced toward closure for at least two days.Dr Gauri Agarwal, Founder-Director of Genestrings Diagnostic Center, Malviya Nagar told ANI, "My team and I have not slept for 72 hours. We are doing a collection of 8,000 to 10,000 samples per day and the only issue we are struck with is manpower. Most of the labs have proper infrastructure, be it machines or testing kits. We are running short of manpower. A lot of our technicians are contracting the virus. However, there is a continuous hiring process and also we have to keep training them.""The home calls have increased by about four to five times. We are trying our best but the home collection is not possible for all. I would request people to come to the centre for swab testing that helps in getting results faster," she said.Shyam Singh Chandel, Patient Relation officer of a private lab said, "The management system of hospitals and laboratories is deteriorating. Cases are increasing and hence the demand for tests is also propelling faster. We used to do 500 tests earlier, now we are not able to meet the demand even at 5000 tests, testing results are being delayed too. The burden has gone to such an extent where we were forced to stop home collection."Delhi is also witnessing a serious shortage in its oxygen capacity.Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal said, "Serious oxygen crisis persists in Delhi. I again urge the centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi.

21-04-2021||Delhi||Give more beds in central hospitals: HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday asked the Centre to immediately allocate more beds in their hospitals in the city for the Covid-19 patients after the Delhi government said that it was not being given enough beds by the Union government despite a massive surge in the cases and fatalities.A bench of Justice Vipin Sanghi and Justice Rekha Palli agreed to the submission of senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, that the cases in the current wave were far more than any other phase of the pandemic. Delhi reported 28,395 fresh cases of the infection on Tuesday at a positivity rate of 32.82%. As many as 277 people died of Covid-19 in the past 24 hours.“We direct the Centre to look into this aspect seriously. Considering the fact that the number of Covid patients, is far greater than the number that had come last year, the Centre should immediately allocate more beds from their hospitals for Covid patients,” the court said in its order.The directions were passed in a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, petitioner-lawyer, who had sought ramping up of tests in the city.The petition, which was disposed of, was again revived by the HC on Monday, noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and that the “healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.According to Mehra, the Centre had given only 2,000 beds as compared to 4,000 in November, when the cases were one-third of the current tally now. He said that in the wake of shortage of beds in the city, 8,000 beds be allocated to the Delhi government, even if for a week, to meet the crisis situation.“We are asking it for just for one week. Please ask the central government hospitals to give 8,000 beds. We don’t want it forever; we only need it for some time. The Centre has the capacity of 11,500 in all its hospitals..,” Mehra said.Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Chetan Sharma told the court that the Centre is taking every possible step to provide assistance to the Delhi government. He said that 250 ICU beds have been operationalised by DRDO and another 250 beds shall be operationalised by Thursday.“lt has been further decided to provide 25 medical officers and 75 paramedics to the centre set up by DRDO from Central armed paramilitary forces,” he said, adding that there are facilities like the Radha Soami Satsang Beas which has given its land in Chhatarpur for a Covid care centre; and the Railways which have also made beds operational in train coaches.Roli Khare, the director of hospitals, ministry of health and family welfare, told the court that the Centre was trying a makeshift arrangement where beds could be increased. But, they can only be increased up to a certain limit as it has to be done keeping in view the demand for trained staff to manage the beds.She said that till now 2,105 beds are currently available to Delhi in central hospitals, including AIIMS, and that by Tuesday, they will be increased 4,091.The bench also said that immediate action needs to be taken by the Centre to ramp up testing by simplifying the process. It said the current practice of mandatory filling a form despite the Aadhaar card of the individual being provided, is a waste of time and should be done away with.It also said that the officers should be sensitised and there should be urgency in completing work and giving clearances for setting up of new lab equipment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/give-more-beds-in-central-hospitals-hc-101618968573914.html

Officials said the situation normalised by 10am.Despite the lockdown, crowds were reported outside several stations as a result of DMRC’s reworked train schedule, in which trains left every 30 minutes during peak hours (8am to 10 am and 5pm to 7pm).Some of the other stations that were temporarily closed include Chandni chowk, Kashmere Gate, Rajiv Chowk, Jhandewalan, Karkardooma, Preet Vihar, Nirman Vihar, Supreme Court, Anand Vihar, ISBT Vaishali, and Shadipur.Anuj Dayal, executive director, corporate communication, DMRC, said: “Services during the morning (7am to 11am) and evening (4pm to 8pm) peak hours across the network will be available with a frequency of 15 minutes.

We are currently recording around 25,000 new cases a day. Going by the rate of increase, it looks like the number of daily cases will soon rise to 28,000 -30,000. In the last four or five days, we have been working round-the-clock on providing hospital beds to Covid-19 patients. We are also increasing the number of Covid-19 beds. On April 3, we had 6,071 beds in the city. As of now, we have 19,101 beds. We have increased beds by three times on a war footing in a short time,” said Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for Covid-19 management and inter-ministerial coordination..The Capital recorded 28,395 fresh cases on Tuesday.His comments came amid concerns regarding the rate at which hospital beds are getting occupied in the city. As of 7pm on Tuesday, 86% of Delhi’s 19,538 Covid-19 beds were occupied. Worryingly, 99.3% of the 4,585 Covid-19 ICU beds were occupied as well.“The DRDO facility opened on Monday, and all 250 beds got occupied within four hours. In that centre, 250 more beds are to be added. The city’s total Covid-19 bed capacity will increase by around 2,700,” Sisodia said.Also read: Centre targets 25% jump in oxygen supply by weekendHe was referring to the Defence Research and Development Organisation’s (DRDO) Covid-19 hospital in Delhi Cantonment that was reopened on Monday.He named several Delhi government hospitals — Burari hospital, Ambedkar Nagar hospital, DDU hospital, Acharya Bhikshu hospital, Raja Harishchandra Hospital and Lok Nayak hospital — that are likely to get more Covid-19 beds in the coming days.Addressing concerns about the burden on health care infrastructure in the city, Sisodia said, “We appeal to people not to panic. Don’t rush to hospital on being diagnosed Covid-19 positive. If severe symptoms surface, then consult a doctor and consider checking for hospital availability on the app (Delhi Corona) and only then go to hospital. Running from one hospital to another exhausts the patients and also burdens hospitals.”He said the government received some complaints that doctors were not attending to patients, and that these charges were unfounded.“Doctors are doing their best and are completely invested in their work, risking their own lives,” he said.The Delhi government on Tuesday issued an order notifying that the Covid Care facility at the Radhasoami Satsang Beas’s Chhatarpur campus will be attached to the Madan Mohan Malviya hospital – which will provide doctors, nurses, paramedics, and at least 10 dedicated ambulances for this centre.The centre is slated to have 5,000 beds for Covid-19 patients at capacity. Of these, 250 were functional as on Tuesday evening, official said. The centre will have facilities such as medical oxygen and testing. It can house patients with mild to moderate symptoms who will be under round-the-clock supervision of medical teams.(With inputs from Anonna Dutt)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-to-get-2-7k-more-covid-19-beds-sisodia-101618967197948.html

21-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC seeks reports from Punjab, Haryana, Chandigarh on Covid surge||Taking note of “alarming situation” due to Covid-19 outbreak in parts of Punjab, Haryana and Chandigarh, the high court on Tuesday sought reports from both the states and the UT. The high court was seized of a matter pertaining to Haryana, in which amicus curaie, senior advocate Rupinder Khosla had told the court that there was complete chaos due to the situation arising out of the spread of Covid-19. “Government guidelines are not being followed in the region. Beds are not available to those who are seeking admission in hospitals. Supply of oxygen is severely depleted. Situation demands immediate attention of this court,” he had told court further adding that situation to say the least is “alarming”. He had emphasized on the casual attitude of the public even at a stage when spread of Covid-19 is reaching its peak. Public places are crowded and government guidelines are not being followed. The situation is equally grim in all three states, he had told court, urging the bench to implead Chandigarh administration and Punjab too in this case as parties and seek reports on measures being taken. Earlier, Haryana government had told the court that appropriate steps are being taken and submitted an affidavit of secretary, home department, Haryana, Pankaj Yadav, who had told the court that a state-level monitoring committee headed by state health minister has been constituted to look into various issues, particularly timely supply of oxygen to the hospitals. Daily requirement of oxygen as on date is 70/80 metric tonnes while the production in the state is 270 metric tonnes. Khosla, however, had responded to the affidavit from the state stating that all issues raised by the court have not been responded to. The court taking note of the submissions of amicus curaie ordered impleadment of Chandigarh and Punjab as respondents and posted the matter for further hearing on April 22. The issue raised about Covid-19 situation in Haryana on the previous date of April 9 were about areas with more infections have been identified, whether some restrictions need to be imposed in such areas, whether the age limit for vaccination needs to be lowered to contain the crisis situation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-seeks-reports-from-punjab-haryana-chandigarh-on-covid-surge-101618952146548.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||At Ludhiana civil surgeon’s office, testing and vaccination go arm in arm||The health department does not practice what it preaches as it is conducting vaccination and testing at the same facility ignoring the threat it poses. Residents in large numbers, some symptomatic, were seen standing in close contact with each other to get their Covid tests done at the entrance of blood transfusion centre, while inside the room, people, majority of them elderly, were running into each other to get vaccinated. High drama took place in the afternoon when the Covid testing was suddenly suspended and people were asked to leave. Among those waiting were police officers who had recently come in contact with police commissioner Rakesh Agrawal. The residents complained that the timing of samples collection was till 2pm but it was suspended at 1.30pm. “I came here in the morning and saw people jostling with each other. At first I thought the queue was for vaccination but I was told that the crowd had gathered for Covid tests while the vaccination was taking place inside the room. I somehow managed to enter and got myself vaccinated,” said an elderly woman, refusing to be named. Vinay Kumar of Kundanpuri, who visited the civil surgeon’s office for the Covid test, returned home without getting the test done. “The doctor who was collecting the samples suddenly wrapped up the at 1.30pm and told those waiting to come tomorrow. There were nearly 50 of us,” he said. District epidemiologist Dr Ramesh Bhagat did not answer the call, civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar said he will ask Dr Ramesh Bhagat to look into the matter. The nodal officer of the vaccination drive, Dr Kiran Ahluwalia, said she will ask the SMO concerned to set-up the Covid and vaccination counters at separate locations. “The process of vaccination and testing were taking on the same premises. Earlier, very few people were turning up for sampling as well as vaccination but in past few days numbers have increased. So, it is important that sampling and vaccination should be done at separate locations,” Dr Ahluwalia said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-ludhiana-civil-surgeon-s-office-testing-and-vaccination-go-arm-in-arm-101618950825101.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||2015 Kotkapura police firing: Kunwar Vijay hits out at Punjab AG Nanda, says legal team didn’t defend case in HC strongly||Inspector general of police Kunwar Vijay Pratap on Tuesday hit out at Punjab advocate general Atul Nanda, alleging that that the legal team led by him didn’t strongly defend the Kotkapura police firing case in the Punjab and Haryana high court. “The home department had in writing issued instructions to the AG to appear in person in cases related to 2015 Bargari sacrilege. However, when the decisive hearing came up in the HC, the AG went on leave,” Kunwar said in an interview to a web channel. Kunwar’s statement came hours after his premature retirement request was accepted by chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh. The Punjab-cadre officer had resigned on April 11, two days after the HC quashed a probe by a special investigation headed by him into the Kotkapura firing incident. The court had also asked the state government to reconstitute the SIT without Kunwar. “For this legal team, including some high-profile lawyers from Delhi, the sacrilege case is like kuber ka khazana (a moneyspinner). The fee for one appearance is more than my three-year salary,” alleged Kunwar. “They even used to make me stand outside their office during case discussion as if I was a peon,” he added. “Whenever I met the CM in the matter pertaining to the case, the latter would call the AG,” said Kunwar. He also alleged that in the case in which the HC quashed the SIT findings, he pleaded several times before the legal team to contest the maintainability of the civil petition filed by a sub-inspector. “As a law graduate, I know that the civil petition can’t be filed when trial for the criminal case has started. It is very clearly stated in the law, but the legal team failed to notice this point,” he said. ‘Phoolka wasn’t of much help’The officer also slammed Supreme Court lawyer HS Phoolka for not fighting the case. “I used to consult him as he had openly announced that he would contest the cases related to sacrilege free of cost. I called him several times to appear in the high court but he expressed his inability saying that he doesn’t appear in the courts below the SC,” alleged Kunwar. “When I tried to convince him, he asked a junior lawyer to help me, who, I later found out, was helping the opposition parties,” alleged Kunwar. On his part, Nanda said the Punjab government had assigned the matters (pertaining to the police firing cases) to a specialised legal team headed by a senior advocate from the Supreme Court. “In his scenario, there is no question of my appearance or going on leave. The judgment in the case is awaited. That will clear all the facts,” he added. Earlier, the state home department accepted Kunwar’s voluntary retirement request with effect from April 15 and issued a notification. The department also waived the three-month notice according to VRS rules. Initially, Capt Amarinder Singh refused to accept Kunwar’s resignation and tried to persuade him to take back his plea, but the officer was firm on his stand. Shiromani Akali Dal leader and former minister Bikram Singh Majithia on Monday claimed that the officer was set to join the Aam Aadmi Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-kotkapura-police-firing-kunwar-vijay-hits-out-at-punjab-ag-nanda-says-legal-team-didn-t-defend-case-in-hc-strongly-101618950759576.html

He has now been sent to Amritsar’s Guru Nanak Dev hospital’s quarantine facility where he will stay for the next 14 days.“Dharam was 22-year-old when he had inadvertently crossed the border in 2003. Pakistan police had registered a case against him. He was lodged in Kot Lakhpat jail of Lahore after a court there announced a 14-year jail term to him. Besides completing his sentence, Dharam languished for another 4 years in Pakistan,” said Punjab Police’s protocol officer at Attari border, Arunpal Singh.Dharam was medically checked after his customs and immigration formalities were completed at the border. Naib tehsildar (revenue official) Jagsir Singh from Chogawan block had received Dharam from the BSF.“Dharam will be handed over to his family members once his 14-day quarantine period is over,” said an official of Amritsar district administration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/jk-man-now-40-returns-after-languishing-18-years-in-pak-101618950400086.html

Home deliveries and take-away account for only 10% of our business,” said Sukhkaran Gill, owner of Bistro 226 in Ghumar Mandi.They also opposed the extension of night curfew timings and said the government must focus on improving the medical facilities instead of imposing more restrictions. “Our business was already down by 70% due to the night curfew as most residents move out with their families only after 8:30pm. This decision to shut dine-in completely will further bring down the business to 8-10%. We have always been a soft target even when we maintain proper hygiene and follow all the norms,” said Vishal Malhotra, the owner of Flamme Bois on Pakhowal road. Amarvir Singh, president of the hotel and restaurant association, said, “There are over 450 restaurants in the city and around 300 are being run on rental properties. We were struggling to bounce back from last year’s losses but now, the government has brought in more restrictions. How are we supposed to pay the fixed charges in such a scenario? The government has taken its decision in a haphazard manner without giving a thought to our problems. We will move the high court against these restrictions.” Rajat Malhotra, the legal advisor for the hotel and restaurant body, said, “The government has announced restrictions only for the hospitality sector while other sectors are carrying on with their work. The government has not even provided the hotels and restaurants any sort of relief against their losses. We will file a civil writ petition in the high court under Article 226, 227 and 14 to challenge the government’s decision.”Closure of bars another blow The owners stated that the closure of bars is yet another blow to their sector. Vice-president of the hotel and restaurant association, Amarjit Singh, said, “Bars were allowed to operate in the month of March when the government had to collect the annual fees. But now, these have also been told to bring shutters down. A large portion of the restaurant business is dependent on bars and the government should reconsider its decision.” Shopkeepers in the same boatWith the state government extending the night curfew timings by another hour and enforcing more curbs for weekends, shop owners across the district are also ruing losses.The shopkeepers in old city markets such as Chaura Bazar and Akalgarh market, which are famous for ‘Sunday markets’, stated that the government should allow the markets to open on weekends when at least 30% of the week’s business is carried out. Manpreet Singh, president of the Akalgarh market garment association, said, “We also want the infection count to go down. But the government is just harassing the traders. The fresh curbs have only made residents more worried. Night curfew should be imposed from 10pm and the Sunday shutdown should be done away with. The government should focus on enforcing Covid norms rather than harassing us.” General Secretary of Chaura Bazar shopkeepers association,Gurcharan Singh Chann said, “More than 30% of the week’s business is done on Sundays in most markets in old city. If these markets are not allowed to open on Sundays, traders will face severe financial crisis and they will be forced to terminate the services of their employees and workers. The government should consider the repercussions of its decisions.” Members of Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal stated that they will take up the matter during the meeting of its core committee to chalk out an action plan against the irrational and unplanned decisions being taken by the state government.Punjab Pradesh Beopar Mandal general secretary Sunil Mehra said, “The state has already suffered a loss of over ₹3 lakh crore in the last one year and the government is still pushing its traders towards economic crisis. It is the failure of the government in improving the health care system, but the traders are bearing the brunt for the same.” Some others, however, said the curbs were necessary. Amarjit Singh, president of Model Town market association, said, “Imposition of restrictions is necessary in view of the recent spike in cases. But the government should also take into account the losses being borne by the traders and help them in some way.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-restaurants-body-decides-to-move-hc-over-capt-govt-s-fresh-curbs-101618949919885.html

Inderjit Singh (40), the victim, was accused of snatching an SUV from a doctor in Haryana’s Ambala district on December 8. A team of the crime investigation agency (CIA) unit of Amritsar commissionerate police that intercepted him had claimed that its members resorted to firing after the 40-year-old tried to run over them at a check-point near the Nijjarpura (or Manawala) toll plaza on the Amritsar-Delhi national highway. The SIT, headed by inspector general of police (border range) SPS Parmar, was constituted after the victim’s family moved the high court in March, terming the encounter as a “murder”. The court had asked the probe team to submit its inquiry report specifying as why no FIR was registered against the accused policemen so far. The HC bench had also directed sub-divisional magistrate (SDM) Vikas Hira to submit a magisterial report into the case on April 20. The SIT told the court that the pending reports of forensic examination are important for concluding the probe. Besides, the court was informed that the carjacking complainant, Dr Sanjay Aggarwal, has not joined the inquiry as he was tested positive for coronavirus and was quarantined.“The mobile phone of a farmer who had shot a video of the incident was sent for forensic examination for retrieval of the recording that was allegedly deleted by the CIA personnel. Besides, the CCTV footage captured in the cameras installed at the toll plaza is also needed. The forensic reports of both are awaited,” the SIT said in its report. It also claimed to have examined 49 witnesses.IG Parmar said, “The concluded report will be filed once we get forensic details.” The court has fixed the next date of hearing on May 27.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/carjacking-suspect-s-death-sit-seeks-time-from-hc-to-conclude-probe-citing-pending-forensic-reports-101618949683564.html

It may be mentioned that despite the change in guard on the top posts, the financial crisis continues to deepen at Punjabi University as several teachers, pensioners and non-teaching unions are presently protesting on the campus over the demands of releasing March’s salary. On March 8, the Punjab government had come to the rescue of cash-strapped Punjabi University with its announcement of a special grant of ₹90 crore in the annual budget presented by state finance minister Manpreet Badal. Varsity registrar Varinder Kumar Kaushik said they have received an official letter from the finance department regarding allocation of ₹90 crore to the varsity.“We have responded to the finance department to immediately release the special funds along with the monthly grant,” he said.The registrar said the employees will be given salaries at the earliest as meetings are on with senior officials at government level.The joint action committee comprising Punjabi University Teachers Association (PUTA), A-class officers association, non-teaching employees’ union and pensioners staged a protest march on the varsity campus on Tuesday over the ongoing financial crisis. The protesters have sought immediate financial bailout package and disbursement of salaries and pensions on the first date of every month. Rajdeep Singh from JAC said the government should urgently provide financial relief to the university.“The salaries are delayed every month and employees have to protest to get their monthly salaries. The government is not at all considering the demand of varsity administration to provide immediate financial aid. Moreover, no heed is paid to varsity’s demand of increasing annual government grant, which is presently only 12% of total budget,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/financial-crisis-punjabi-university-seeks-immediate-disbursal-of-rs-90-crore-grant-101618949682456.html

Sources in the department said they have run out of both Covidshield and Covaxin supplies and around 85 private hospitals in the district are not getting the vaccine as of now. Civil surgeon Dr Sukhjeevan Kakkar said private hospitals have been told that a fresh stock will arrive in about three days’ time and until then, they will have to use their reserve stock. “We have informed the government about the development. Until our stock is replenished, we will use our supply only in government-run session sites,” he added. As per sources, the department currently has a total of 15,000 vials (Covishield and Covaxin) in its stock. District immunisation officer Dr Puneet Juneja said a state-level meeting is being convened on Wednesday to review the situation and the status on availability will be clear after that. On Tuesday, Covishield was administered only at four government-run Covid vaccination centres (CVCs) in the urban area. Dr GS Grewal, former president of the Punjab Medical Council, said, “If the government cannot ensure a smooth supply of vaccines, then why did they involve us. Further, ever since we switched to the Ayushman Bharat portal, from that of the National Health Authority, for payments, we have been facing multiple glitches and the supply has been erratic.” Harjeet Kaur, 62, a beneficiary who had visited a private hospital for the second dose of vaccine, said she was asked to return. “I was told to come again in a few days as the vaccine is not available. It has been over a month since I was administered the first dose. I hope the vaccine is available soon,” said Kaur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-health-dept-runs-out-of-vaccine-stock-cuts-supply-to-pvt-hospitals-101618949681463.html

A pickup vehicle (PB-02-BL-9352) was also impounded from the accused identified as Samsher Singh, alias Shera of Chatiwind and Shubam Chopra, alias Mota of Sultanwind area in Amritsar city. The police said the modus operandi of the gang was akin to the one adopted by those behind the 2020 hooch tragedy that claimed the lives of more than 140 people in Tarn Taran, Amritsar and Gurdaspur districts. Officials said they have identified three more gang members as Raju of Sultanwind, and Jugraj Singh and Satbir Singh of Khaparkheri village. Senior superintendent of police (rural) Dhruv Dahiya said the accused were arrested by a team at a naka near Chatiwind. “The accused were smuggling ENA from Haryana’s Karnal and Ambala. We have also identified some dhabas from where the accused used to pilfer the ENA. We will also investigate the role of some distilleries.”“They used to supply ENA to various villages in the district.

21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab going slow on Covid vaccination||The Covid-19 vaccination campaign in Punjab has failed to pick up pace as the state health department is nowhere near meeting its daily target of administering 2 lakh doses. The state barely crossed even the 1-lakh mark a day and that too once, even as it has been nearly a week since chief minister Amarinder Singh set the 2-lakh target. A senior health department official said the targets were given according to the population, but districts like Sangrur, Mansa, Moga and Muktsar failed to meet even half of the mark. A government official, who is part of the state-level vaccination planning, said an inadequate supply of the vaccine was the main factor behind Punjab not meeting the set target. “Hesitancy among people in getting vaccinated is the most in rural areas, especially in the south-west Malwa region,” he added. Dr Navjot Dahiya, president of the Punjab chapter of the Indian Medical Association (IMA), said the supply of vaccine to private hospitals was adequate initially but it has been hampered for the past one week. “The district authorities say there are supply- shortage issues. Initially, there was hesitancy among people in the rural pockets but it is not the case at least in the Doaba belt,” said Dr Dahiya. State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said the department is fully equipped to vaccinate at least 3 lakh people a day but the supply of the vaccine is not sufficient. “As on Tuesday, we were left with a stock for a day only. We have been asking the central government to provide a single batch of at least 10 lakh doses so that we can start our vaccination drive with full strength. But we get only 3-4 lakh doses in a batch as it was the case earlier,” said the minister. “We have to keep doses for the second shot as well so the department has to maintain an adequate stock balance. On the other hand, neighbouring Haryana is getting more vaccine supply than us,” he claimed. Even as only frontline and health workers below 45 can be administered the dose as per the health department guidelines, HT came across instances in Mohali district where several private sector employees aged below 45 were vaccinated at special camps.

To board the flight, passengers, along with their kin, started arriving at the airport on Monday afternoon. There were two chartered flights of SpiceJet, which were to take them to Toronto, Canada. However, they were not allowed to board the flight. Following intervention of Amritsar MP Gurjit Singh Aujla, their issue was resolved as the airline agreed to ferry many passengers on existing tickets. Taneet Kaur, 25, a resident of Kaithal, said, “When we bought the ticket, we were told that the flight to Toronto from Amritsar would be direct. We also got online confirmation of the ticket. When we reached here at 4am today, we were told that there will be a layover in Dubai for which a visa is needed that we did not have. The person who charged money from us for the ticket has cheated us.” Father of another student said, “The ticket was sold claiming that it was a direct flight, but a visa was issued for Dubai. We bought the ticket for ₹1 lakh. We paid about ₹1.25 lakh for the quarantine period in Toronto. We will lose this money if justice is not done to us.” MP Aujla said, “As per our investigation, the agent sold the tickets stating that the flight will from Amritsar to Toronto. When he sold 300-400 tickets, he hired an aircraft of SpiceJet from Amritsar to Ras Al Khaimah airport in Dubai. When the passengers arrived at the airport, they were told that there will be a layover in Dubai. Some of the passengers were intimated about it two days ago, but not all of them knew. Those who were intimated had applied for a Dubai visa, but many of them could not board the flight because of late issuance of the visa. Those passengers who were not aware of such conditions could not board the flight.”The MP said, “Apart from the late arrival of the visa, the agent sent an email to the airline two hours before the departure asking it to not carry 31 passengers as per the order of the embassy. So, it was a fraud with the passengers who were told that it was a direct flight. Most of the passengers didn’t know the difference between a scheduled flight and a chartered flight. So, they became a soft target for the agent.”Aujla said he has met police and airport officials in this regard and action is being taken against the person(s) responsible. The matter has also been brought to the notice of Union civil aviation minister Hardeep Singh Puri, he added. Assistant commissioner of police (airport) Mohan Singh said, “The matter has been resolved as the airport has agreed to let the passengers travel on existing tickets.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chaos-at-amritsar-airport-as-toronto-bound-passengers-not-allowed-to-board-flight-101618949622808.html

Nand Lal, a street hawker from Uttar Pradesh, said he feared that the Punjab government might also clamp a lockdown just like its Delhi counterpart. Sunil Kumar, a fast food seller, said his customers used to visit him after 8pm, but the night curfew shut his business. Ankit Shukla, who worked at a sweets shop, said the second phase of panchayat polls in UP was round the corner and he, along with his family and close friends, was going to Baraich to cast his vote on April 26.About 15 buses with migrant labourers have left for UP’s Bahraich since Tuesday morning. It also come to the fore that private bus operaters have been charging hefty fares from labourers due to the shortage of public transport. However, industrialists termed it a routine process and said that labourers returned to their homes during this period every year. Narinder Singh Saggu, president of Focal Point Industrial Units Association, said industries production would usually drop to 40% every year as the labourers would leave, but a lot of hype has been created this time. “Labourers already know that they are safer in Punjab that in any other district,” he added. Tejinder Singh Bhasin, who runs an auto parts business and is the president of Gadayipur Udyogh Manufacturers’ Association, said labourers were returning to their villages due to reasons such as marriages and other rituals. “Labourers know that if a lockdown is imposed, then their employers would take care of their work and meals at least here in Punjab,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lockdown-fears-panchayat-polls-drive-migrant-workers-back-to-home-from-jalandhar-101618949621641.html

Hundreds of weddings as well as other celebrations were all set to be organised in the coming days across the state with a limit of 50 people for indoor and 100 for outdoor events. Monday’s announcements have now shelved people’s plans while resort and marriage palace owners are flooded with cancellation requests. With a number of weddings scheduled for the coming weekend, there prevail utter chaos and confusion among the families as the guests had already started arriving. “It was only on April 8 that the state government had relaxed the cap on number of guests at weddings from 20 to 50. Earlier on March 18, when the gatherings were restricted to 20 people, many of our clients had cancelled the bookings and shifted the venues to other states. Now, with a limit of only 10 people, nothing can be organised. We are getting cancellation requests, which would result in losses that could run into lakhs for us,” said Vikas Shrivastav, spokesperson, Ludhiana Marriage Palace and Resort Owner Association. Vice-president of Ludhiana Marriage Palace Welfare Association, Inderjeet Khurana, said, “The decision made by the state government is condemnable. The sudden move has left not only the resort owners, but several families in the lurch too.” Other sectors have been hit as well. Over 200 workers are engaged in a single wedding, including florists, caterers, photographers, and decorators among others. In Jalandhar, Manoj Kumar Chodha of the Cabbana Resort and Spa said 25 to 30 events were scheduled to be held in the coming days at his resort. “I have been calling the families to inform that as per government guidelines, we cannot hold the events for the next 10 days and these stand cancelled. April and May were two months when the resorts could have seen some activity, but all we stare at are losses,” he added. A resident of Patiala said a wedding in their family was planned for April 24 and their guests, who had arrived from abroad, had even completed the 14-day quarantine period. “Invitation cards were distributed and several activities were planned for the big day, but now we are left with no option but to postpone the wedding,” said Deepali Batra, whose daughter’s wedding was scheduled for April 24.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wedding-plans-go-awry-with-punjab-government-s-latest-cap-on-guests-101618949620642.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Sangrur, Barnala miss vax target, doctors blame stigma lack of awareness for low turnout||The health departments of Sangrur and Barnala missed their daily target of Covid-19 vaccination drive due to poor response from the people. The vaccination drive is currently covering the population aged above 45 years, along with health workers and frontline workers. Sangrur had a target to inoculate 13,000 people while Barnala aimed to vaccinate 4,500 beneficiaries. As per the data obtained from Sangrur health department, 2,576 people, including health workers, frontline workers and those above 45 years, had got the shots on April 19. In Barnala, 1,808 people were given Covishield and Covaxin jabs. The data showed that a total of 70,288 people have been vaccinated, including 65,179 with first dose and 5,109 with second dose, in Sangrur district. However, 51,671 people got the first dose and 1,712 second dose in the 45-plus group. In Barnala, a total of 33,101 people received shots, 30,657 of whom got their first dose and 2,444 the second. Sources said the fear of vaccine’s side effects and wheat harvest season led to the low response in the vaccination drive. However, health department officials claimed that stigma and lack of awareness became the reasons for their target being missed. “Some countries such as Germany suspended a particular vaccine. There are some reports of fever and body pain after the vaccination. Such news triggered fear among people about vaccines. If people are willing to get the jabs, it is a welcome step. But, nobody can force them,” said Manjit Singh Gharachon, senior vice-president of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan).Swaranjit Singh, an activist who has retired from the health department, said, “It is the duty of the government to educate people about the side effects of the vaccine and its positive aspects. However, people from all walks of life are in dilemma. The government is spending a lot of money on vaccination drives, but it should also invest on health infrastructure. I am also willing to get inoculated.” Sangrur assistant civil surgeon Dr Jagmohan Singh admitted that the drive was not achieving its daily target. He said, “There is a stigma surrounding vaccines in our society. The Indian government is even sending the same vaccines to other countries. The vaccine is safe, and people should come forward to receive it.” Barnala civil surgeon Dr Harinderjit Singh Garg, said “Teams of health department are approaching people and we are also organising camps for vaccination. Lack of awareness is the major cause due to which people are not showing interest. However, the numbers are increasing daily as our teams are educating and motivating people for vaccination.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sangrur-barnala-miss-vax-target-doctors-blame-stigma-lack-of-awareness-for-low-turnout-101618949619375.html
21-04-2021||Other||With no oxygen, 1.5K Thane beds lying unused||At least 1,500 oxygen beds in two of Thane’s civic-run hospitals have gone unused for the past 10 days because the city has not received its regular supply of oxygen, leading to the deterioration of the health of Covid-19 patients as well as a backlog in admission of severe patients. Two of the three Dedicated Covid hospitals (DCH) run by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) – Parking Plaza and Voltas Company hospitals -- have not used the oxygen beds (in the former case, since April 10), as the amount of oxygen supplied to the civic body by the state has reduced drastically. The city receives 34 tonnes of oxygen, from both private vendors and the state. However, this is insufficient to meet the demands of the oxygen beds run by the TMC. Sakharam Gore (43) had to wait for more than 24 hours to get oxygen support at Parking Plaza, where he was admitted on April 17 after experiencing breathing difficulties. Gore was admitted on a regular bed, and as his lung infection worsened, he required medical grade oxygen. The hospital however did not have oxygen beds ready for use and had a limited supply of cylinders. “After trying for two days I got a bed at parking plaza on April 17. By evening I experienced difficulty in breathing. My oxygen had dropped to 85, but as there was a shortage, I got oxygen support only from April 19. The situation was very bad. They had only two cylinders for nine patients. They used the oxygen on rotational basis for few hours till a vendor arrived and provided cylinders,” Gore, a resident of Patlipada who works as supervisor at a private housekeeping company, said. Gore has still not recovered completely and even to use the washroom makes use of a wheelchair so that the oxygen cylinder need not be removed for a longer period. “If I had received the oxygen support earlier, my condition would not have deteriorated so much,” he said. The TMC runs three DCH (the third being Global Covid Hospital), and four Dedicated Covid Health centres (DCHC). While Global Covid has 929 oxygen beds, the four DCHC have 720 oxygen beds. Only 48 of the former, and 53 of the latter were available as of Tuesday evening. Put together these beds require 46 tonnes of oxygen daily. However, currently only 23 tonnes are available daily. “We have three Covid hospitals where regular oxygen supply is required, from among these, the oxygen facility at Parking Plaza has been shut on April 10 and patients were shifted to Global Covid hospital. Moreover the one at Vartak Nagar (Voltas Company hospital) is not operational yet. The city is currently receiving only 23 tonnes of oxygen. Since Global Covid hospital has the capacity for patients requiring oxygen, all such patients are currently in Global Covid hospital,” a senior official from TMC said. “We are in the midst of signing a contract with a private company on Wednesday and an hour after it is signed we shall have oxygen supply in 350 beds in Parking Plaza hospital. This will ensure regular supply of oxygen within the city. As the number of cases has increased, there is added pressure on the administration personnel, so we shall increase their numbers as well. We have increased 150 oxygen beds at Global Covid facility and work is in progress to increase 25 beds within the ICU,” Dr Vipin Sharma, Commissioner, TMC, said. “Three new plants for oxygen are being built; two of these will have a capacity of 175 metric tonnes. We shall also increase the number of oxygen beds to accommodate the 300 cylinders, such that Parking plaza will have [a total increased capacity of] 800 oxygen beds. Moreover, another plant will be set up, the cost of which will be borne by MMRDA. Once the oxygen supply is restored and functions properly, we shall focus on increasing the beds as well,” added Sharma. Two oxygen plants will be operational by April 30 in Parking Plaza and Global Covid hospital. “When the plant is operational, the city will get 50 tonnes of oxygen daily. We can use 47 tonnes for our patients while three tonnes can be provided to private hospitals. As the supply from vendors as well as the state had gone down it affected the oxygen availability in the city. We used the available oxygen for Global Covid, while private hospitals received oxygen supply from FDA. The 1500 oxygen beds remained vacant at Parking plaza and Voltas at Vartak Nagar as there was no supply of oxygen. General beds were available for the patients,” a senior official from TMC said. Since April 1, 30,985 cases and 183 deaths have been reported in Thane. “TMC has made preparations for the second wave but the number of positive patients is increasing,” said mayor Naresh Mhaske.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-no-oxygen-1-5k-thane-beds-lying-unused-101618948900067.html

21-04-2021||Other||IELTS and coaching institutes in Ludhiana stare at losses||The owners of the IELTS and coaching centres in the district are a worried lot as the district magistrate-cum-deputy commissioner Varinder Kumar Sharma on Monday ordered their closure till April 30. They stated that last year too due to the Covid pandemic the coaching centres had been hit hard and there was a dip in enrolment. The institutes were allowed to resume offline classes in October last year when the schools were reopened for Classes 9 to 12. The owners said that to ensure social distancing during the offline classes they had increased the number of batches and teachers last year and had to pay their salaries, GST, electricity bills, and the monthly rent. They added that now again with the closure of the institutes, they will face a financial crisis.There are around 750 IELTS and other coaching institutes in the district and a majority of them are located in Feroze Gandhi market, near the ISBT, Model Town, Sector 32, Khanna, Doraha, Samrala, and Macchiwara. Priyanshu, the owner of Shepherd Institute, Model Town, who offers IELTS and spoken English coaching, said, “We will wait till May 1 as the government has closed the institutions till April 30. If the authorities extend the closure, then we will start with online classes. But the students taking IELTS coaching prefer offline classes. Last year, due to the lockdown imposed by the government, only a few students had turned up for these courses.” Munish Dewan, director, IMS, said, “We have already suspended offline classes and will be starting with the online ones from Thursday. We provide coaching for the Common Admission Test (CAT), Common Law Admission Test (CLAT), and graduate record examination. In 2019, 500 students had got enrolled with us while last year, only 200 students did. Students are not satisfied with the online classes.” Students prefer physical classes For IELTS, the institutes prepare the students in four spheres reading, writing, speaking, and listening. Most of these students are from rural backgrounds and they prefer to attend physical classes where they can get a chance to speak in English with their fellow students, instead of attending an online class. Supriya Kumari, a resident of Model Town, said, “I was attending six-hour coaching classes from the last three months and was preparing for the IELTS exam scheduled to be held next month. But the institute authorities sent a message regarding the suspension of offline class. I have paid a fee of ₹31,000 and have appeared in the mock tests and will not be attending the online classes as the face-to-face interaction is missing in these classes. The government must allow the institutes to continue the physical classes with only 10 to 15 students in one batch.” Another student, Gaganpreet Singh, who is taking JEE Advanced coaching from a centre based in Dugri, said, “Since November, I have been attending offline classes and was able to get my doubts cleared. The closure of the institute again will affect our eyesight and concentration as we’ll have to switch to the online mode.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ielts-and-coaching-institutes-in-ludhiana-stare-at-losses-101618948359214.html

21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Impending oxygen shortage in Punjab sets alarm bells ringing||Rising trajectory of Covid-19 cases in Punjab has started fuelling concerns over the oxygen supply in hospitals across the state. The state government, which has seen a sudden spike in oxygen demand for patients in hospitals in several districts, is scrambling to meet its daily requirement of 75-80 metric tonnes (MTs) of medical-grade oxygen. The demand varied from 15 to 20 MTs a day on an average before the coronavirus pandemic outbreak last year. There are 14 air separator units (ASUs) in the state with an installed production capacity of 80 MTs and an equal number of repackaging or bottling plants with a capacity of 41 MTs which have depend upon the availability of liquid oxygen, particularly from manufacturing plants in Haryana, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh. The supply of liquid oxygen has been irregular and set alarm bells ringing for the state authorities over an impending medical oxygen shortage in the state. RS Sachdeva, managing director of Hi-tech Industries, the largest supplier of medical oxygen to government hospitals, besides industry grade oxygen, in the state, said there is a problem in the supply of liquid oxygen. “There is an alarming increase in coronavirus cases in some states such as Delhi, and our supply has been diverted there. We did not receive any supply from Uttarakhand in the past three days and the plant in Panipat (Haryana) has also reduced our supply. We (his company) got supply of 800 MTs in March, but not received even half of that this month so far,” he said. The state government has pressed into service the industries department to coordinate with suppliers. “As hospitals in the state are facing shortage of medical grade oxygen due to Covid-19, you are requested to coordinate with the health authorities and help the district administration, director-cum-secretary, Sibin C wrote to general managers, district industries centres, on Monday. The future demand for oxygen is likely to increase in view of the surge in new infections in recent weeks. The state’s coronavirus case count has gone up by 48% in the past one month, going from 2,05,418 on March 19 to 3,04,660 on Monday. There has been an increase of a staggering 145% in active cases, which stood at 35,311 on April 19, during this period. If this trend continues or the pandemic situation aggravates further, it could lead to a serious shortage of the crucial resource. Tanu Kashyap, managing director, Punjab Health System Corporation (PHSC) said the Centre has allocated quota of 126 MTs liquid oxygen to Punjab daily, but plans to reduce it to 82 MT from next week. “We have requested them to review the decision and give our full supply. In view of the spike in Covid-19 cases in the state, we are expecting the requirement to increase to 120 MT daily by next week,” she said. Dr KK Talwar, head of the state’s Covid expert task force, said the Covid situation seems to be under control at present. “The only worry is a situation like Delhi where the cases have shot up sharply. The situation was more or less stabilised in Punjab for three weeks but there has been some increase in new infections in past two-three days. The state can hit the peak by the end of this month or first week of May, but these calculations depend on adherence to precautions and protocols,” he said. Oxygen is critical for patients of Covid-19, a respiratory disease that reaches the respiratory tract, mainly the lungs, leading to breathing problems, from mild to critical, as well as reducing oxygen in blood to dangerously low levels.

21-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra SSC exams cancelled, HSC stays postponed||In a relief for more than 1.7 million students in Maharashtra and to ensure equivalence across education boards, the state government on Tuesday cancelled the SSC (Class 10) examinations, owing to the rising Covid-19 infections in the state. Class 12 or HSC exams will remain postponed as per the government’s earlier decision; revised dates will be announced later.The decision was made in the cabinet meeting held on Tuesday. State education minister Varsha Gaikwad released a statement shortly after the decision was announced by health minister Rajesh Tope. “We had earlier announced a postponement of both SSC and HSC exams. However, with rising infections in the state and the country and after national and international boards declared a cancellation of Class 10 exams, we have decided to cancel them. Students will be marked on the basis of internal assessments. Details on the same will be announced soon,” said Varsha Gaikwad. Gaikwad said the education department will also work on possible options for students who are unhappy with their scores derived from internal assessments. On April 15, CBSE board cancelled Class 10 exams and postponed Class 12 exams across the country this year. Class 10 students will be marked based on an objective criterion to be developed by the board. The criteria for marking students are yet to be declared. On April 12, the state government had postponed HSC exams to the end of May and SSC exams to June, following which the state had written to CBSE and ICSE officials, requesting postponement in their board exams. However following CBSE’s decision and a similar decision from ICSE, IGCSE and IB there was growing pressure to cancel exams from students and parents to ensure equivalence across boards, which is key at the time of admissions to colleges. Over 1.7 million students write the SSC exams in the state every year, while around 1.5 million appear for HSC exams. Parents said they are happy with the decision. Anubha Sahai, president of the Indiawide Parents Association said, “The move is in the interest and safety of students. Students are relieved and now can start planning for the next academic year.” Prasad Tulaskar, a city-based parent said, “While we welcome the decision it should have come earlier. Students were under tremendous stress of writing an offline exam under the current circumstances,” he added. Schools are now awaiting guidelines on internal assessments and hope the process of calculating scores is well thought. “Throughout the year, we have not conducted a single exam or assessment. So, we don’t know what scores will be calculated instead of exam scores. The performance of a student over the last 2-3 years can be seen because last year has been tough and many have not been able to do well due to the pandemic,” said a teacher of a school in the eastern suburbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-ssc-exams-cancelled-hsc-stays-postponed-101618947998731.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra set for full lockdown||Maharashtra is set to go under a complete lockdown from Wednesday evening as the strict restrictions imposed last week have not seen “desired results”. State ministers have demanded a 15-day complete lockdown, with chief minister Uddhav Thackeray expected to announce the lockdown on Wednesday. Ministers said guidelines for the lockdown are being chalked out, which are likely to include stricter enforcement of Covid-19 rules, sealing of inter-district borders and more curbs on public transport.Last week, Maharashtra had announced strict restrictions, including imposition of a curfew under Section 144 of the CrPC, allowing only essential services to function and allowing movement of the workforce in essential services. But the restrictions did not help contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state.Even though Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in his address to the nation on Tuesday, said a “lockdown should be the last resort for states”, the Maharashtra government seems to have decided to go ahead with the lockdown. In the past seven days, since the state-imposed curfew and strict restrictions, Maharashtra added 323,199 infections and 2,539 deaths. The state health department has projected that there would be a shortage of beds in nearly all districts by May 2. The shortage of beds coupled with its surging demand and a shortage of oxygen has prompted the state to move towards a complete lockdown.Maharashtra ministers, in a state cabinet meeting on Tuesday, had demanded a strict lockdown to break the chain of transmission. State health minister Rajesh Tope said there was no other alternative, but to impose a lockdown as the ballooning tally of active cases has been putting a severe strain on health infrastructure, including a shortage of oxygen and anti-viral drug Remdesivir.“There is no alternative, but to go for a strict lockdown. We have requested the CM to announce a complete lockdown from today at 8pm. The cabinet has taken a decision about the complete lockdown. CM will make a final announcement,” said Tope.Tope, who was speaking after the cabinet meeting in Mumbai, further added that so far the state hadn’t used the term “lockdown” in its restriction, but now they want to break the chain of transmission through a strict lockdown. “We have not used ‘lockdown’, but now we want to truly break the chain of transmission through a strict lockdown.”Senior government officials said the guidelines are being drafted, but restrictions in timing of shops selling essential items, which was issued on Tuesday, will continue. Besides that, they are also planning to shut district borders to curb the movement between districts. Currently, there is no restriction on interdistrict travel. Similarly, they are also planning to reduce attendance of staffers in government offices.Another possible restriction that is being deliberated, include restriction on public transport. Officials said there were suggestions, regarding shutting down public transport for general public from some ministers, but it may not be feasible as many people step out for medical emergencies and even vaccination and rely on the use of public transport.“Among the restrictions being considered include sealing of district borders. Unless there is any medical emergency, inter-district wouldn’t be permitted. There were demands of shutting public transport by the ministers, but public transport could remain operational, but only for medical emergency, healthcare workers and for vaccination. So far, no final decision has been made,” an official said, requesting anonymity.Tope added that the state will study what restrictions can be put for use of public transport in the state during the lockdown. “The issue of mass transport modes is such that if we shut it then the workforce in the essential services will be inconvenienced. We will study it minutely and will take a decision by tomorrow,” he said. Unlike the period of strict restrictions that commenced last Wednesday, the complete lockdown will see stricter enforcement of rules. “The police were not asked to crack down on people’s movement. Many people flouted by claiming to have stepped out for groceries and medicines. In the lockdown, the enforcement will be much stricter,” the official added.Mumbai guardian minister Aslam Shaikh said despite imposing strict restrictions, the number of cases did not go down. “There is shortage of oxygen and hospital beds, therefore after much deliberation, Maharashtra will go under full lockdown,” said Shaikh. He added, “We went on increasing the curbs on people, from night curfew to weekend curfew to the existing curfew, but people are moving about. The cases are increased, there will be more shortage of oxygen in the coming days.”Elaborating on the kind of restrictions expected on use of public transport, Shaikh said, “Last time when the lockdown was announced [by the Centre], it was done haphazardly. Since then, whatever restrictions have been put by Maharashtra government is done after careful deliberation. [So far] we have not shut the buses or trains, in the coming days, too, it will continue to run so that people are not inconvenienced.”State urban development minister Eknath Shinde said Thackeray is expected to announce the lockdown, which will come into force from Wednesday evening. “The situation is getting worrisome in the state. We requested the chief minister to put in severe lockdown to break the chain of transmission. Chief minister will announce it,” he said.Earlier in the day, the state government issued a new order, restricting the timings of essential shops such as grocery, vegetable and fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries and all type of food shops with others to four hours from 7am to 11am across the state till May 1. However, the government has allowed home delivery from these shops between 7am to 8pm.The decision was prompted as ministers and authorities felt that people were not following the restrictions on movement thoroughly. The order issued by chief secretary Sitaram Kunte said, “All groceries, vegetable shops, fruit vendors, dairies, bakeries, confectionaries, all type of food shops (including chicken, mutton, poultry, fish and eggs), shops related to agricultural implements and farm produce, pet food shops, shops related to materials for impending rainy season for individuals as well as for organisations to be open only between 7am to 11am.” The restriction on timings for the shop was criticised by retailer’s association in Mumbai. Viren Shah, president of the federation of retail trader’s welfare association, said, “This decision will create more chaos and will get crowded during morning hours. It will be difficult to control crowd for local authorities. Now another hurdle is how will the grocery shops provide home delivery after 11am when the shops will be closed? This means that local authorities will have to cooperate with the kirana stores to keep shops close for customer, but allow shops to provide home delivery from the stores.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-set-for-full-lockdown-101618947818734.html

So far, 77 people have lost their lives to the disease this month.For the last eight days, the UT has been recording over 1,000 cases. J&K had recorded an all-time high of 1,698 daily cases on September 12, 2020.Officials said with 647 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of new infections, followed by 501 in Jammu district, 143 in Reasi ( including 124 travellers) , 136 in Baramulla and 119 in Budgam. Kupwara is the only district, which reported cases in single digits. The number of active cases, which has been rising steadily, reached 13,470, officials said. As many as 716 patients were discharged from different hospitals, including 539 from Kashmir and 177 from Jammu.As many as 1,34,697 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 89.65% against 98% in the first fortnight of February.

The peak of the first Covid wave was in September when the UT had witnessed 37, 372 cases and 478 deaths.Lockdown ruled out in KashmirThe divisional administration on Tuesday ruled out the possibility of imposing a lockdown in Kashmir despite a surge in coronavirus cases, saying the situation does not warrant such measures. Amid rising cases, medical experts say there has been no change in the strain or mutation in the virus in the Valley. Kashmir divisional commissioner Pandurang K Pole said, “Keeping in mind the state of our economy, the administration does not think that lockdown is needed in the current situation. Maybe in future, if the situation worsens.” Pole was flanked by director health Mushtaq Ahmad Rather and Sheri Kashmir Institute of Medical Sciences director AG Ahangar among other officials and health experts.Amarnath Yatra to go ahead as planned Observing that 30-40% of Kashmir’s economy is dependent on tourism, hospitality and allied sectors, the divisional commissioner said a tentative road map was being prepared for managing tourist inflow amid a surge in virus cases and also for the upcoming Amaranth Yatra. SKIMS director says shortage of Remdesivir, Div Com refutes claim Ahangar said they had been facing shortage of Remdesivir for the past couple of days, a claim which was refuted by Pole. “The only difficulty that we have been facing for the last two days is the non availability of one of the vital drugs Remdesivir,” Ahangar said. Pole retorted, “On Remdesivir, the situation is definitely not as serious as told by ‘director sahab’. Hardly 10% patients kept in Covid care are given Remdesivir after their ECGs are done. A critical patient needs five doses. The medicine is available in sufficient quantity in Kashmir, including Srinagar,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-2-030-cases-j-k-clocks-highest-ever-daily-surge-101618947760524.html

As per data available with BEST, 1.6 million people travelled on its buses in the city on Monday, a rise from the 1.3 million passengers travelled on April 17.On the first day of restrictions on April 15, 1.4 million people had travelled by BEST buses. “There has been an increase in the number of passengers travelling by BEST buses. We are not allowing standee passengers,” said a BEST official. The Maharashtra government, under the ‘Break The Chain’ initiative, did not suspend the city’s public transport, but implemented restrictions. Autorickshaws in the city are allowed to ferry only two passengers, while taxis are allowed to operate with 50% capacity. The general public has been prohibited travel on local trains. People working in essential care services, travelling for medical purposes and vaccinations across the city are, however, allowed to commute by the local trains. The passengers count on local trains has reduced, as railway authorities restricted the entry and exit points of stations on April 15 and started checking identity cards and documents of passengers at the stations’ entrance.On an average, 1.8 million passengers travel by locals on the Central Railway and 1.1 million take trains on the Western line.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mumbais-best-saw-1-6-million-passengers-on-monday-101618946618675.html
21-04-2021||Other||Bombay HC rejects appeal against use of trademark Covishield||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday refused to interfere with the district court order, allowing Serum Institute of India (SII) to use the name ‘Covishield’ for the vaccine manufactured by it. Cutis Biotech had sought injunction on the name’s use, as it too had a similar name for a drug. But as the district court had refused to grant the injunction, Cutis approached HC. A division bench of HC justice Nitin Jamdar and justice CV Bhadang, however, held that as SII’s vaccine was already well-known and neither company owned the trademark, it was not inclined to grant the prayer of Cutis. The bench, while hearing an appeal filed by Cutis Biotech, was informed by advocates Dr Abhinav Chandrachud and Aditya Soni that the company had applied for the trademark Covishield under the Trademark Act, 1999, last year on April 29. The advocates submitted that on January 4, Cutis had initiated a trademark suit against SII at the Pune commercial court, and hence, till the outcome of the suit was decided, they had filed an interim application seeking an injunction against SII from using the name. However, the district court had refused to grant the injunction as SII had started using manufacturing the vaccines by the Covisheld, following which Cutis approached HC.Senior advocate Dr Birendra Saraf for SII submitted that the company on June 6, 2020, had applied for the registration of trademark ‘Covishield’ under application no 4522244 for vaccine under Class-5. It had also applied for other variants. The company had sought permission to carry out tests for the coronavirus drug from various authorities, and on December 10, 2020, the Union health ministry published the Covid-19 vaccine procedure, which referred to the trademark of SII as ‘Covishield’. After perusing the proceedings of the interim application heard by the district court, the HC bench noted that neither Cutis Biotech nor SII had a registration for the trademark ‘Covishield’. Thus, the grievance of Cutis Biotech would be termed as an allegation of passing off by SII.The district court further noted that as the products of both the companies were different, there was no chance of confusion in the minds of the public. “The court noted the situation brought about by the pandemic and the importance of the vaccine for the general public. The district court, by the impugned order dated 30 January 2021, rejected the interim application,” the HC bench, while dwelling on the implications of the injunction, observed.In light of this, HC observed, “That ‘Covishield’ is a vaccine to counter coronavirus is now widely known. A temporary injunction directing SII to discontinue the use of mark ‘Covishield’ for its vaccine will cause confusion and disruption in the vaccine administration programme of the state. In this case, thus, the grant of an injunction would have large-scale ramifications traversing beyond the parties to the suit.” While dismissing the appeal, the bench noted, “The discretion used by the learned district judge in refusing to grant an injunction is not arbitrary or perverse. Even if the evidence was to be looked at in the first instance, no case is made out for grant of any relief.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-rejects-appeal-against-use-of-trademark-covishield-101618946558556.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai reports 7,192 Covid-19 cases, 34 deaths||Mumbai on Tuesday reported 7,192 Covid-19 cases and 34 deaths, taking the tally to 594,059 and the death toll to 12,446. There are 82,671 Covid-19 cases in the city at present. The overall case fatality rate in the city has now dropped to 2%. On Monday, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) conducted 45,350 tests with a daily positivity rate of 15.8%, down from the daily positivity rate of around 18% to 20% until last week. So far, the BMC has conducted a total of 5,027,882 Covid-19 tests. Meanwhile, the civic body has now decided to free up oxygen and intensive care units (ICU) beds by shifting non-critical patients to ordinary beds in its Covid facilities. Indicating that the situation in Mumbai is stabilising, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday said, “Today we have around 7,000 cases and around 45,000 tests, with a continuous decline in cases in the past five days. There are 87% asymptomatic patients today. As of 2.30pm on Tuesday, we have 3,685 Covid-19 beds vacant.”Chahal added that Mumbai has seen 947 deaths in the last 70 days, since the second wave of the pandemic started, with approximately 2.66 lakh cases during this period.This puts the case fatality rate (CFR) during this period at 0.3%. Quoting a media bulletin from New Delhi’s public health department, Chahal pointed that in contrast, Delhi city reported 240 deaths in a single day on April 19.On April 19, Mumbai reported 7,381 Covid-19 cases, on April 18, it reported 8,468 cases, April 17 it reported 8,811 cases, and on April 16, it reported 8,803 Covid-19 cases. The highest number of cases reported during this second wave of the pandemic was 11,206 cases on April 4.3,622 beds vacant As of Tuesday morning, Mumbai had a total of 21,093 Covid beds in hospitals and jumbo facilities, of which 17,471 are occupied and 3,622 are vacant. Of the 10,511 oxygen beds, 9,845 are occupied, and 666 are vacant; of the 2,798 ICU beds, 2,748 are occupied, and 50 are vacant; of the 1,426 ventilator beds, 1,405 are occupied and 21 are vacant.Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner incharge of BMC’s public health department, on Monday said BMC’s step-down policy is helping the civic body with bed management. He said, “When a critical or serious patient has recovered from Covid-19 infection, such that he does not need round the clock medical assistance and does not need to occupy an ICU bed, a ventilator bed or an oxygen bed previously allotted to him, such patients will be shifted to quarantine facilities, which are equipped with doctors and medical staff. Some patients opt to be home quarantined during such a period if they have that option. This makes the bed available for another needy serious or critical patient.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-reports-7-192-covid-19-cases-34-deaths-101618946498609.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Bhandup mall to be razed or repaired? Audit to tell||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has ordered the administrator of Dreams Mall in Bhandup to carry out a structural audit to determine whether the mall needs to be demolished or only needs repairs. A level four fire was reported at the mall that housed Sunrise Hospital on March 25, killing nine Covid patients. The mall is being managed by Rahul Sahasrabuddhe, who was appointed as the independent administrator by the National Company Law Tribunal (NCLT) to manage the affairs of the mall, after non-payment of taxes by Housing Development Infrastructure Limited (HDIL, which owned Dreams Mall). Vibhas Achrekar, assistant municipal commissioner, S ward that covers Bhandup, said, “We have issued a notice to the administrator to carry out a structural audit of the mall. The audit will decide whether the mall will have to be reconstructed completely or will require major repair works…This exercise is being done considering the top floor of the mall was completely damaged and the Mumbai Fire Brigade (MFB) wanted us to seal the mall. However, we do not have any powers to seal the premises without valid reason. Hence, the structural audit will be conducted.” Shopkeepers want permission to open their undamaged shops. A shopkeeper said, “Last year, there was a lockdown, and this year we had a fire followed by another lockdown. Forget about allowing us to open our shops, but we are not even allowed to go inside the shops and check if our belongings are safe.” The BMC said the fire was major and there is a possibility that the structure might be damaged. Meanwhile, the BMC’s disaster management cell is expected to conclude its report on the cause of the fire by this week. The report will also decide whether there was any negligence by any government authority in giving permissions to the mall and the hospital. On the other hand, the Mumbai Police had booked several people last month after the fire that included directors of HDIL Rakeshkumar Wadhawan, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan, Sarang Wadhawan, Deepak Shirke and directors of Privilege Health Care Services Private Limited (which owns Sunrise Hospital) Amitsingh Trehan, Nikita Amitsingh Trehan and Sweetie Jain, among others, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder. Sahasrabuddhe said, “The mall does not need redevelopment. Repairs are needed before restarting. I have submitted the preliminary comments of the structural auditor. I have written and submitted a letter to BMC to allow me to let people remove their belongings.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaibhandup-mall-to-be-razed-or-repaired-audit-to-tell-101618946438576.html

Additional chief secretary Awanish Kumar Awasthi said, “We are in dire need of oxygen, which we need to bring in from Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha. And putting in the traditional oxygen tankers would take nearly five to six days to complete the entire process. Hence, to expedite the whole process and to bring in Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) as early as possible, we approached the railways, which has come forward to help us and run their Oxygen Express.”Setting the tone for one such life-sustaining endeavour, the city on Tuesday witnessed the movement of the Oxygen Express train that originated from Kandla, Gujarat and will reach Jharkhand via Lucknow. The Oxygen Express passed through Lucknow around 11.45pm. On the return journey from Jharkhand, the train would release half of the consignment in Lucknow and the rest in Varanasi, officials said.The ACS said it was found that transporting LMO by train was two times faster than transporting it through road tankers.“The entire process will take another 48 hours,” he said to HT.It is somewhat similar to an effort in Maharashtra, where the first Oxygen Express left from near Mumbai for Visakhapatnam earlier this week.Officials with the railways said the Oxygen Express would be a boon in transporting LMO, which is a key element in the treatment of certain medical conditions during Covid-19 infection in state.The railways has plans to transport oxygen through Roll On Roll Off (RoRo) services through road tankers with built-in oxygen chambers are placed on flat wagons.“The road tankers placed on the flat wagons are of a specific height and 3330mm was found feasible to transport oxygen through flat wagons without affecting the overhead equipment (OHE) lines,” a railway official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/relief-for-lucknow-kashi-oxygen-express-gets-set-to-bring-air-of-hope-101618946379606.html
21-04-2021||Other||Respond to allegation of mismanagement of second Covid-19 wave, HC asks Centre, state, BMC||The Bombay high court (HC) has directed the Union of India, state government and the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) to respond to public interest litigation (PIL) filed by an advocate which has alleged mismanagement of resources and inability of the state to provide adequate beds, oxygen and Remdesivir drug to Covid-19 affected patients, while private trusts were providing the same easily. The court also observed that rather than canvassing public interest the petition was more politically inclined and asked the advocate to justify the same and posted the hearing of the PIL for Thursday. A division bench of chief justice Dipanakar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the PIL filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi, was informed by advocate Arshil Shah that lack of facilities during the pandemic has resulted in the violation of fundamental rights of the citizens of the state including their right to life and personal liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. Shah submitted that even though the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic was underway the authorities failed to streamline the medical facilities as a result of which people had to run from pillar to post seeking redressal. He further submitted that the number of patients outnumbered beds and there was a shortage of oxygen and Covid-19 drugs. He added that coupled with that there was poor management of disposal of dead bodies as crematoriums were running out of wood and the electric crematoriums were over-heating and melting hence all these issues needed to be addressed urgently. Shah referred to the recent order of the Nagpur bench of the HC, wherein after its directions, the Nagpur region got nearly 10,000 Remdesivir vials in a day, hence sought similar interventions from the court. The PIL has sought to monitor the supply chain of Remdesivir injections from the pharmaceutical companies to its procurements in hospital, to curb black-marketing and profiteering that create a panic situation due to unavailability and overpricing of the medicines. Marjadi has also sought a status report on the availability of Covid-beds, lab testing facilities and procurement of Remdesivir and oxygen. While referring to social media posts of the politicians annexed to the PIL, the bench questioned Shah, “When you file a PIL, why would you include political comments? Are you interested in the benefit of the underprivileged, poor and needy or you want to highlight political issues…We are not influenced by any political comments. You should be careful.” Shah responded that it was added to show the influence of politicians in decision making but would delete the same. After the state government lawyer sought time to take instructions from the official, the bench asked advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni to appear on behalf of the state government and address the issues raised in the petition before it. The court also asked the Centre and BMC lawyers to take ‘complete instructions’ and respond to the PIL during the next hearing on Thursday, April 22.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/respond-to-allegation-of-mismanagement-of-second-covid-19-wave-hc-asks-centre-state-bmc-101618946379025.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: 852 cases filed for hate speech, spreading rumours on social media||A day after Mumbai Police commissioner Hemant Nagrale announced colour codes for vehicles plying within Mumbai, a rumour about police instructing petrol pumps to give fuel to only those who have essential service stickers, spread like fire. After the police helpline and Twitter handles were bombarded with queries, the police officially clarified that no such orders were issued to petrol pumps.Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic last year, the number of fake news, rumours and doctored stories and videos doing rounds on social media has increased. The Maharashtra Police have been continuously battling the menace of misinformation being spread through social media and internet platforms. As a result, a total of 852 offences have been registered during the pandemic.“All these agencies coordinated with each other and pulled down thousands of objectionable content and registered 852 offences in almost one year. Of these, 786 offences were cognisable in nature, while the rest were non-cognisable. Around 455 cases were of hate speeches,” said a senior police officer. In these cases, 308 cases were related to misinformation on WhatsApp, 338 cases with Facebook, 28 cases linked Tiktok, 25 related to Twitter, and 27 linked to Instagram.During the investigation of these cases, 342 accused were arrested and 680 are identified. Around 152 were served notice under section 41 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). Preventive action has been taken as per section 107 of CrPC on 145 accused.The content pulled down by police from social media also includes Covid-related videos from other countries with false messages, manipulated videos and photos of hospitals, crematoriums, videos of doctors, nurses and patients with false narratives, and forged and edited copies of government orders related to Covid.Since Covid outbreak in March 2020, the state cyber police, special branch and cyber police station of Mumbai police are keeping a close watch on the spread of Covid and government orders related to rumours, hate message, communally sensitive content on social media platforms. All the district police in the state have also intensified vigilance on social media to prevent the spread of rumours to maintain law and order in their districts. “There has also been an increase in Covid-related hate speeches, communally sensitive and inciting messages over social media in last one week,” said a senior police officer.Sanjay Shintre, superintendent of police, state cyber police said, “As there was a buzz over Kumbh Mela gathering on social media recently and also ongoing Ramzan month, there is an obvious rise in hate speeches and increase in penetration of communally sensitive information on the internet, but we are keeping an effective check on such contents online and pulling them down before they make it to masses.” A big chunk of misinformation is related to political issues. Even the hate speeches are mostly politics related. Some politicians express their opinions by crossing the limits and this triggers mudslinging. But we keep on the filter the content on social media platforms, Shintre added.Cyber expert Ritesh Bhatia said, “Fake news has been thriving only because people have been believing in them and this is well proved by the fact that users forward such messages even without cross-checking the facts. The drop in fewer citizens getting vaccinated can be attributed to the fake news that has been doing rounds. Police and civic body both have been cautioning people about such misinformation, however, their reach is only limited to those users who are on social media.” “Police and BMC should counter the fake news by right facts on the very same platform where these messages are spreading - WhatsApp being the most popular one. Many people, especially senior citizens, are neither on Twitter nor on Instagram nor Facebook. But they get loads of such fake news on WhatsApp. So, the government needs to first broadcast factual messages on WhatsApp and then other mediums. People are thrilled about forwarding misinformation but when they realise or are corrected, they feel embarrassed to forward the facts,” Bhatia added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra852-cases-filed-for-hate-speech-spreading-rumours-on-social-media-101618946378556.html

The division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the suo motu (on its own) PIL initiated last week, was informed by advocate general Ashutosh Kumbhakoni that as per the vacation bench’s directions, an affidavit on the status of inmates across all prisons in the state was filed. The affidavit stated that as on April 18, there were 35,124 prisoners in 60 jails, while the capacity was only for 24,032. Kumbhakoni further submitted that as on Monday, there were 188 Covid-19 cases among inmates and staff, and proper care was being taken to curb the spread of the infection in the jails. The PIL was prompted following a report in Hindustan Times on April 16, which stated that the number of Covid-19 cases had gone up from 47 to 200 within a month of the second wave striking the state. The vacation bench of justice Nitin Jamdar had observed that it was a serious concern and hence sought a response from the state on the measures it was taking to curb the spread of the virus in jails. Kumbhakoni further stated that due to the increase in Covid-19 cases among inmates, vaccination of those aged above 45 was already on. While conceding that the state prison authorities had relaxed after being able to control the situation last year, steps were being taken to strengthen the precautionary measures as per the high-power committee (HPC) recommendation of May 2020. He added that those eligible for emergency bail, parole or furlough were being granted the same. Senior advocate Mihir Desai, who had represented a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in the PIL, seeking directions to alleviate the condition of inmates in light of the pandemic last year, had submitted that there were many options before the state and prison authorities to address the problem and he wanted to enumerate the same. He added that as the HPC had met on May 2, 2020, the court should ask it to meet again and consider the current situation and modify the guidelines issued by it to decongest jails. The court, however, asked him to go through the state affidavit and give suggestions thereafter. While seeking to know whether accused persons could be given an RT-PCR test and vaccination before they were admitted to the jails, the court also asked if the suggestion by a coordinate bench to transfer inmates from congested jails to open prisons could be considered and what further measures could be taken to resolve the problem of over-crowding posted hearing of the PIL on Thursday.The petition is placed for hearing on Thursday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-asks-state-ngo-to-suggest-measures-to-curb-spread-of-covid-19-in-prisons-101618946318577.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Using weather forecasts, scientists develop model to water on commercial farms||Scientists at the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) and the US-based University of Maryland have, in collaboration with grape farmers from Nashik, developed an irrigation management model that saved between 10% to 30% water on commercial farms. Notably, the experimental solution uses short and medium-range weather forecasts to help farmers plan their irrigation schedules.“The use of operational and medium-range weather forecasts in irrigation management across India has been limited because they typically cover a much larger geographic area. This does not help farmers who own small plots of land. Factors like varying rainfall within an area and heterogeneity of soil, among other minute differences in agro-climactic conditions, also make it hard to effectively use the weather forecast,” said Subimal Ghosh, professor at the department of civil engineering, IIT-B, and corresponding author of the study.To address these lacunae in farm-scale water management, the researchers tied up with grape farmers at Sahyadri commercial farms in Nashik, who have been using sensors to gather soil moisture data going back at least five years. They first developed a water balance model to compute daily evapotranspiration, runoff and leakage for two test plots. This is also called an eco-hydrological model since the purpose of it is to avoid water stress to crops.“Because farmers don’t have high-resolution weather forecasts, it may result in non-judicious use of water. For example, during the monsoon season, the forecast may say that it will rain for the next three days, but a farmer will still water his crops on the off chance that it does not rain at all. So the net effect is that more water than necessary is being used,” said professor Raghu Murtugudde of the University of Maryland, and co-author of the study, published in the Water Resources Research journal of the American Geophysical Union.“Previously, the farmers whom we worked with on this study were using a tank hydrology model, where the rootzone areas of the crops are thought of as a holding tank for water. When the level falls below a certain level, they irrigate more. This has maintained yield very well,” said Ghosh. However, this method does not account for changes in the soil moisture that may occur due to the weather, which is the gap that researchers have attempted to bridge.“We have used a different algorithm to analyse the weather forecast information concerning the empirical soil moisture data, and past rainfall distribution in the area, to develop a set of probable scenarios that may occur during the forecast period. This helps farmers to plan how much water to release and when,” said Ghosh. “We found that using the proposed framework, irrigation water use can be reduced by 10-30% as compared to that resulting from the conventional strategies used by the farmers, without significant loss in crop yields, by almost always maintaining the soil moisture at or above the prescribed threshold,” the authors have noted in their study,The researchers are currently planning to expand the study to other farms in Maharashtra. The challenge in scaling up this intervention, according to the experts, would be in establishing a large network of devices to monitor soil moisture across farms in an area. “You also need to work with the farmers to get them to trust your data. This is why we have co-produced this study with farmers, to demonstrate usability and credibility,” said Murtugudde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaiusing-weather-forecasts-scientists-develop-model-to-water-on-commercial-farms-101618946258610.html
21-04-2021||Delhi||Capital gasps for oxygen amid 28k new Covid-19 infections||Delhi on Tuesday sounded the alarm over exacerbating shortage of oxygen, a crucial tool in the fight against the worsening Covid-19 crisis, as chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said some hospitals were left with only a few hours of life-saving supplies, and appealed to the Centre to urgently boost deliveries to prevent the health care system from being overrun.The national capital, which is under a lockdown to control the alarming transmission of the infectious disease, has reported precariously low levels of oxygen, crucial drugs and critical care beds. On Sunday, Kejriwal said the oxygen shortage in Delhi had turned into an “emergency”.“Serious oxygen crisis persists in Delhi. I again urge the Centre to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi. Some hospitals are left with just a few hours of oxygen,” Kejriwal tweeted shortly after holding a review meeting with deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia, health minister Satyendar Jain and several senior government officials.Medical oxygen is a critical medical intervention against Covid-19, which causes respiratory distress in some cases, and the pandemic has accelerated the global demand for it. The need for oxygen has increased to 1.1 million cylinders in low to middle-income countries alone, according to the World Health Organization.Sisodia said there will be chaos in the city if the stocks are not replenished by Wednesday morning. He posted a note on Twitter mentioning the status of oxygen stocks in various hospitals. According to the note, Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Narayan Hospital, Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital, Burari Hospital, Ambedkar Hospital, Sanjay Gandhi Hospital, BL Kapoor Hospital and Max Hospital in Patparganj were among those that had only “eight to 12 hours of oxygen left”.Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said its oxygen stock was to last till 1am. The hospital has 485 Covid-19 beds, of which 475 are occupied. “6,000 cubic metres of it is left, which at the rate of current consumption will last till 1am. Need urgent replenishment,” its chairman DS Rana said.With Delhi logging more than 100,000 Covid-19 cases over the past four days, the strain on the Capital’s oxygen supply continued to grow, with several hospitals having to discharge Covid-19 patients, restrict new admissions, and cancel routine surgeries.Daily cases of Covid-19 continued to soar as the city recorded its biggest single day spike of 28,395 new infections, pushing the total number of confirmed cases past 900,000. This was the fifth time in the past week that the city has set a new single-day case record. The seven-day average of daily cases in Delhi is now 22,198. This number, which denotes a region’s case curve, was just 9,299 a week ago – a growth of nearly 140% in just one week. If this rate of growth continues for one more week, then Delhi appears set to breach the 50,000 mark for daily cases.Average testing positivity rate – the proportion of tests that return positive for Covid-19, which serves as a good barometer for an expanding outbreak – has touched 24.2%. This means that one out of every four samples tested in the past week has come back positive. At a daily level, the positivity rate is soaring even higher – it has nearly sextupled in just two weeks. On Tuesday, 32.8% samples tested came back positive, against 4.9% of all samples on April 6. In early February, this number had to dropped a low of 0.2%.Underlining the efforts by his government to tackle the crisis, the Delhi CM tweeted: “We are working on a war footing to ensure oxygen supply in Delhi, and are also talking to the central government. An increase in the number of oxygen beds is happening on a large scale.”The chief minister said the government was purchasing medical oxygen from Noida in Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan to meet the shortage. He also directed officials to increase the number of beds with oxygen facilities for Covid-19 patients across hospitals.Deputy CM Sisodia tweeted: “All hospitals are sending SOS calls regarding oxygen supply. Suppliers are being stopped in different states. The Centre has to stay sensitive and active to ensure that there is no jungle raj among states regarding oxygen supply.”“Most hospitals in Delhi have only 8-12 hours of oxygen left. We have been urging the Centre for the past one week that to increase the quote of oxygen supply. If adequate supplies are not given to the hospitals by tomorrow morning, it would be chaos,” he added.In an address to the nation on Tuesday night, Prime Minister Narendra Modi noted that the surge in Covid-19 cases led to sharp increase in the demand for oxygen in different parts of the country. He said the work to increase oxygen production was taking place at several levels. “The Centre, state governments, private sector are trying to make oxygen available to all those who are in need of it. Many steps are being taken in this direction,” he said.Also read: Delhi sees highest ever single-day spike in cases, deaths; tally over 900,000On Sunday, the Delhi chief minister wrote to the Prime Minister, seeking his help in improving the supply of medical oxygen in Delhi. In a separate letter to Union minister of commerce and industries Piyush Goyal, he highlighted that the central government sending oxygen to other states by engaging a company which happens to be a “major supplier” in Delhi was at the root of the problem.Goyal later said: “Demand-side management is as important as supply-side management. Containing Covid-19 spread is the responsibility of state governments and they should fulfil this responsibility.”A statement issued by the Delhi government after Tuesday’s review meeting by the CM said: “Delhi CM Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday raised serious concerns over acute oxygen shortage across various Covid-19 facilities in Delhi. He urged the central government to urgently provide oxygen to Delhi since some hospitals are left with just a few hours of oxygen. CM Arvind Kejriwal convened a review meeting today, wherein he directed the officials to increase oxygen beds across several facilities in Delhi… Deputy CM Manish Sisodia said that there should be no jungle raj between the states on the supply of oxygen, for this, the central government will have to be very sensitive and alert.”A senior home ministry official, who did not wish to be identified, said: “The central government is working on ensuring smoother supply of medical oxygen for Delhi as requested by the Delhi government.”A senior official in the central government who did not wish to be identified said that 241MT of oxygen was supplied to Delhi on Monday and 355.33 MT on Tuesday (till 3pm) by five manufacturers, and the total stock of oxygen in the city’s hospitals was 508 MT.Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain said in a tweet: “Media people are asking about oxygen supplied to Delhi. 240 Mt and 365 Mt oxygen supplied to Delhi on Mon & Tue against requirement of 700 mt per day. Stock position in most of the hospitals is not more than 10 to 12 hours. Every day we require 700 mt oxygen.”The Delhi high court said on Tuesday sufficient oxygen was not being supplied to Covid-19 patients in the national capital and asked the Centre if supply could be diverted from industries.“Industries can wait. Patients cannot. Human lives are at stake,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told the central government, while monitoring the Covid-19 situation in Delhi through a plea on testing.The bench said it heard that doctors at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital were being forced to reduce oxygen being given to Covid-19 patients.One of Delhi’s biggest government hospitals, Safdarjung Hospital, was running low on oxygen. All elective or planned surgeries were cancelled on Monday morning after its oxygen supply ran low. “No elective surgeries to be performed due to deficiency of oxygen supply in the hospital till further orders. This is an urgent request,” a notice from the hospital’s anaesthesia department said.A senior doctor at the hospital said on condition of anonymity: “The demand for oxygen has increased manifold due to the increase in the number of Covid-19 patients who need high flow oxygen. There was a delay in supply and stocks are sufficient only for a few hours more.” The hospital, however, received more oxygen supplies by the evening.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-gasps-for-oxygen-amid-28k-new-covid-19-infections-101618945964888.html

In return, her sister-in-law got married to Seema’s maternal uncle in ‘Atta-Saata’ (exchange of girl for bride).At the age of 15, Seema became mother of a girl and three years later, when she attained the marriageable age (18), she gave birth to her second child.Now, Seema is caught in a peculiar situation. She wants divorce from her husband but her mother is against this because Seema’s husband took along his sister after Seema returned to her parents.Women protection officer Rajni Gupta says Seema’s is one of the hundreds of cases that come to the office of district women and child protection officers every month.“Child marriages are still prevalent. I have stopped around 300 child marriages in Panipat and Karnal since joining in 2008,” she said.Maximum cases of child marriages come from backward communities and economically weaker families. Besides skewed sex ratio and concerns of safety of the girls, ‘Aata-Saata’, where a family gives away a daughter in exchange for a bride, is a major cause of child marriages.As per official figures, around 420 complaints of child marriage were reported in state in 2020, and 32 FIRs were registered under the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006.Under this law, all such persons, who perform, conduct, direct or abet child marriage can be sentenced to rigorous imprisonment up to two years and a fine of up to ₹1 lakh.However, officials monitoring implementation of the Child Marriage Act said that they do not get information about child marriages as people hesitate to report such cases.“In over 75% marriages stopped by timely intervention of officials, the victims themselves inform the police or protection officer about their marriage. In rest of the cases, neighbors inform the police,” officials said.As per the State Crime Records Bureau data, 22 people, including four female, were arrested for violation of the Child Marriage Act in 2019.Preeti Bhardwaj Dalal, officiating chairperson of Haryana Women Commission, says, “There is strict law against child marriages and people are aware of it, but they still flout it.”“We have already discussed the issue and a special campaign will be launched in May to sensitise people about bad effects of child marriages,” she added.FIGHTING THE EVIL SINCE 2008Since her joining in 2008 as protection-cum-prohibition officer of Panipat district, Rajni Gupta helped around 400 minors by stopping their marriages. According to Rajni, she has stopped marriages of 256 minors in Panipat and 95% of them were girls.In 210 cases reported from Panipat, Rajni says she got information before marriage and managed to stop the marriage on the wedding day, but in 46 cases, they came know about the marriage afterwards and later filed a police complaint.“People call us celebration-spoilers as we reach the venue to stop the wedding of minors. Sometimes we even face the anger of parents and relatives of the minors. They pressurise us not to spoil the wedding but this is a violation of the law,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/child-marriages-still-prevalent-in-panipat-karnal-101618946200049.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: HC relief for woman booked on mother’s complaint under Domestic Violence Act||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday quashed the criminal proceedings initiated by a city resident against her daughter under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence (DV) Act, 2005, on the grounds that the allegations made were inherently improbable and were being made by the mother as she was unhappy that the daughter was with her estranged husband, the main accused in the case.The daughter, a 23-year-old had approached HC seeking quashing of the domestic violence case against her as the allegations were arbitrary and she wanted to pursue further education in Australia. A division bench of justice SS Shinde and justice Manish Pitale, while hearing the writ petition filed by the daughter, was informed by advocate Kenny Thakkar that her client was unnecessarily arraigned in the domestic violence case filed by the mother against her father. It was further argued that the mother’s complaint under the DV Act had mostly highlighted the alleged atrocities by the father and there was only one instance of violence against the daughter, which showed that the daughter was being dragged into the acrimony and matrimonial discord between the wife and husband unnecessarily, and out of spite as she was staying with the father. Thakkar further submitted that her client had completed her engineering course and wanted to go to Australia to pursue further education, but due to the pending criminal case she was unable to get a visa and hence the proceedings against the daughter should be quashed and set aside.However, advocate E Moses for the mother submitted that the daughter was seeking quashing on the pretext of wanting to go to Australia to escape prosecution during trial and also place a photograph of the daughter pouring hot water on the mother’s feet as proof of the violence perpetrated by the daughter.After hearing the submissions, justice Pitale in the order observed, “The Petitioner is a young lady, who has just graduated and her future depends upon how she can improve her educational qualifications and develop her personality. It is only in the interest of justice, that this aspect of the matter is also taken into consideration. Surprisingly, her mother is hell-bent upon creating obstructions in her progress.”Justice Pitale further noted that the DV Act was for the protection of a woman against atrocities from her husband or any male member and hence the daughter could not come under the purview of the Act. The bench also noted that as the photograph was not placed before the magistrate the same could not be relied upon. In light of these observations and conclusions, the bench quashed the proceedings against the daughter in the DV case and disposed of the petition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbaihc-relief-for-woman-booked-on-mother-s-complaint-under-domestic-violence-act-101618946198599.html
21-04-2021||Other||Hospitals in Dombivli and Kalyan face oxygen shortage||With more private hospitals turning into Covid hospitals, there is acute shortage of oxygen in these centres in the Kalyan-Dombivli region.The civic centres and hospitals have enough oxygen supply, claimed the Kalyan-Dombivli Municipal Corporation (KDMC).“Although we don’t have excess stock of oxygen cylinders for the civic centres and hospitals, we have need-based supply of oxygen on a day-to-day basis, which is adequate. However, the private hospitals are facing trouble, especially those who have just started treating the Covid patients. They don’t have enough oxygen available,” said Sudhakar Jagtap, deputy commissioner, KDMC.The civic Covid care centres, dedicated Covid health centres and dedicated Covid hospitals require around 20 tons of oxygen. In KDMC, there are around 80 private hospitals that treat Covid patients.“The private hospitals require around 30 tons of oxygen daily. However, they are facing shortage. Those hospitals that are treating Covid patients since last year have their own vendors who supply them oxygen while those that have recently started treating the Covid patients are struggling to get the oxygen cylinders on a regular basis,” said Jagtap.Owner of A and G Private Hospital in Kalyan, Ganesh Pawar, said, “We get the oxygen supply privately and presently we have adequate stock for the existing patients. However, we cannot admit new patients as there is no oxygen for them. Presently, we are treating 40 patients.”Meanwhile, Kalyan and Dombivli have run out of stock of Remdesivir on Monday. “On Tuesday, we have received stock of about 250 injections and they will be adequate for now. We have, however, placed a request to supply the injections on a regular basis so that there is no shortage,” said Dr Ashwini Patil, medical health officer, KDMC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hospitals-in-dombivli-and-kalyan-face-oxygen-shortage-101618946139332.html

21-04-2021||Other||Maharashtra govt and BJP trade fresh barbs over Remdesivir||Faisal MalikMumbai The clash between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi (MVA) and the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) over the supply of Remdesivir to Maharashtra again intensified after state minority affairs minister and chief spokesperson of Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) Nawab Malik on Tuesday alleged that Shirsh Chaudhari, a BJP leader from Jalgaon in north Maharashtra, bought thousands of vials of the drug from Daman-based Bruck Pharma, and sold and distributed it in Jalgaon, Dhule and Nandurbar districts. Malik also released pictures and videos that allegedly showed the distribution of Remdesivir. While BJP leaders claimed that they want to procure 50,000 vials for Maharashtra, Chaudhari bought a stock of 20,000 vials in the first week of April and kept at his Nandurbar hotel, from where the vials are being black-marketed in Nandurbar, Jalgaon and Dhule, Malik told reporters, adding that the BJP leader himself claimed to have distributed 700-800 vials. “We want to know if Chaudhari has obtained any licence from Maharashtra or Diu and Daman FDA,” the minister asked.Maharashtra FDA has now written a letter to Nandurbar collector Rajendra Bharud, asking him to take action against the people concerned. Anil Bhaidas Patil, a legislator from Amalner, Jalgaon, too, has demanded action against those illegally selling Bruck Pharma’s Remdesivir. He had written a letter to state FDA minister Rajendra Shingne in this regard on April 14, Malik said.Shingne also clarified that the drug can be procured only by the state government.“I have been reading news reports in which BJP leaders have been found to have claimed that they were trying to procure Remdesivir for Maharashtra. I would like to clear as FDA minister that no individual, party or organisation has the right to buy or donate the stock of Remdesivir. As of now it can be procured only by the state government,” the FDA minister said in a video message.According to Malik, BJP was trying to create a perception that the MVA government is a failure and could not even make available Remdesivir, an antiviral drug used for Covid-19 treatment, to patients. He alleged that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of Diu and Daman did not allow Bruck Pharma to supply vials manufactured for exports to Maharashtra.“After Maharashtra FDA permitted Bruck Pharma to sell Remdesivir, Diu and Daman FDA told the firm that they cannot supply the stock to Maharashtra. Diu and Daman is a Union Territory. When I raised the issue on Saturday, Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan dialled chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and assured full cooperation, but the situation is yet to be changed,” Malik said.Later, when Mumbai Police called the firm’s director for questioning on the illegal sale of the stock out of the country despite a ban on its export, former chief minister Devendra Fadnavis visited the police station and advocated on his behalf, Malik alleged.“It is clear that some BJP leaders are active to defame MVA government. We want action against those involved in the illegal sale and black marketing of Remdesivir,” the NCP spokesperson said, pointing out that the company’s officials were arrested in Valsad for their alleged involvement in black marketing of the drug. Fadnavis had said BJP was trying to procure the antiviral drug for the people of Maharashtra, when it was targeted over his visit to the police station. “...Even this time, we were trying to ensure that the stock of Remdesivir is procured for the people of Maharashtra. It was not meant for the BJP, but for the patients in the state,” said former CM.Meanwhile, Malik also questioned how BJP are leaders getting stock of the antiviral drug, pointing out to an alleged incident last week where BJP’s Surat office (in Gujarat) was also found distributing Remdesivir vials to the people. He further said that both Chaudhari and the firm are involved in the illegal sale and black marketing of the drug, and thus the offence which attracts action.Congress, too, has demanded that Chaudhari and the firm be booked for their “involvement in black marketing” of Remdesivir. “When the Maharashtra government was not getting adequate supply of these injections, how come Chaudhari got so much stock to sell it illegally and privately? It is clear that BJP leaders and Bruck Pharma were colluded in black marketing of Remdesivir and therefore, immediate action should be taken against them,” said Sachin Sawant, general secretary and spokesperson, state Congress.BJP hit back saying Chaudhari is a distributor of the export firm and was trying to save lives of the people by providing them the drug. Pravin Darekar, leader of Opposition in the legislative Council alleged that MVA government is targeting Chaudhari to hide its own failure. He also alleged that NCP legislator and grandnephew of party chief Sharad Pawar Rohit Pawar as well as NCP Welfare Trust, too, have received the stock of Remdesivir vials.“If someone has done something illegal, then there is no reason to support him. But to my knowledge, Chaudhari is a distributor of the export firm and he procured the stock before the ban was imposed by the central government. He was trying to help people and is being targeted by MVA to hide their own failures. If Chaudhari is guilty then how come Rohit Pawar and NCP Welfare Trust have got Remdesivir vials stock?” Darekar said.Maharashtra FDA has permitted three firms — Bruck, BDR Pharmaceuticals and Nixi Labs to sell Remdesivir in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-govt-and-bjp-trade-fresh-barbs-over-remdesivir-101618946079114.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||Amid surge in Covid-19 cases travellers opt to postpone domestic trips: Experts||Amid the second Covid-19 wave and surge in the number of cases, domestic air travel has once again begun to face a slow down with a significant number of travellers opting to postpone their trips. Travel portals said they have witnessed a drop in bookings for the summer season. However, international bookings continue to remain unaffected for countries that have opened doors to Indians and those who are vaccinated.EaseMyTrip said the entire industry is witnessing a 30-40% booking reduction in April (as compared to March) and around 15-20% of tickets being cancelled or rescheduled, in the wake of the second Covid-19 wave. “Most of these cancellations or reschedules are voluntary, as air transport is functional, unlike the first wave of Covid in 2020,” said Nishant Pitti, co-founder and chief executive officer, EaseMyTrip.According to Yatra.com, the beginning of 2021 witnessed an optimistic rise in demand for travel where domestic destinations started seeing more footfall with travellers planning their leisure trips to make up for missed travel and pent up demand in 2020. However, there has been a slight increase in flight cancellations as consumers are cognisant about rising numbers in Covid-19 cases.“Customers are now looking to book closer to the travel date and are also prioritising health and safety measures while exploring accommodation options at the destinations. Destinations at drivable distances as well as off-beat travel destinations are still a preferred choice among the travel trends which provide necessary respite from the monotony of city life,” said Sabina Chopra, co-founder and chief operating officer, corporate travel and head for industry, Yatra.comTravel companies are, however, allowing passengers to reschedule their travel plans with no extra charges and are also offering services to ensure risk-free travel.SOTC Travel is offering a free doctor on-call 24x7 service in partnership with Apollo Clinics to provide expert guidance and assistance for safe holiday planning. However, free cancellation with exclusive deals such as full holidays at half price and companion holidays free are also being offered.“With many states imposing curbs, we have received a few requests from customers to reschedule their holiday plans. Travellers now look to maximise their experiences while minimising risk,” said Daniel D’souza, president and country head for leisure, SOTC Travel.According to Thomas Cook, having missed out on their vacation time for over a year, most Indians are preferring to defer their travel plans rather than cancel despite the current scenario and restrictions being placed by state authorities“With the increased rollout of the vaccine drive, reopening of borders/travel bubbles with countries like Nepal, Sri Lanka, Seychelles and positive announcements by international destinations welcoming vaccinated tourists, the consumer sentiment is one of cautious optimism,” said Rajeev Kale, president and country head – holidays, MICE, visa for Thomas Cook (India) Ltd.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-travellers-opt-to-postpone-domestic-trips-experts-101618946078574.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC stays strictures against IAS officer Khemka||A division bench of the Punjab and Haryana high court (HC) on Tuesday stayed strictures passed by a single judge bench against IAS officer Ashok Khemka in a case related to appointment of international shooter Vishwajeet Singh as an Haryana Civil Service (HCS) officer.“The HC bench of justice Ajay Tewari and justice Rajesh Bhardwaj passed the order staying portion of a single judge bench judgment as the state government sought more time to file its response,” said Khemka’s lawyer Shreenath K Khemka.The state’s response has been sought by August 3 while giving “interim relief” to Khemka as per the HC website. In January, a HC judge had decried his role for causing delay in appointment of Vishwajeet Singh as an HCS officer. Vishwajeet is son of former IAS officer Jagdeep Singh. His appointment got delayed on complaint of Khemka in December 2019.The appointment has now been made after HC intervention in January in which court made remarks against Khemka.In his plea filed on March 31, Khemka had demanded that strictures passed against him be expunged as he was not associated with the proceedings before court in any manner.“It is submitted with the greatest respect and in all humility that the impugned strictures are not only absolutely unfounded and perverse but have been passed by the learned single judge in manifest violation of the principles of natural justice and are thus ex facie illegal and liable to be expunged,” he had submitted.The single judge bench had recorded in its order that the shooter’s appointment got delayed due to an “ill informed perspective which complainant Dr Ashok Khemka entertained regarding the sport of shooting”.“Even the questions raised by Khemka in his complaint, reflected his utter ignorance about the sports activity and regarding award of medals in shooting,” the court had recorded.“This was the height of the unfounded self-righteousness. This totally takes away the pretence of acting in public interest and shows that Dr Khemka might have used all these tactics to bring the officers under pressure and to bring the junior officials of the department under fear psychosis, which forced them to continue the tirade against the petitioner in one form or the other,” another remark the judge had made on Khemka’s role.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-stays-strictures-against-ias-officer-khemka-101618946019828.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||Safety measures up at institutes housing hostels||A staff member of the Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B), on Sunday succumbed to Covid-19 and became the fifth casualty on the campus. Over the past two weeks, the institute campus in Powai has been recording 60 cases a week on average.On Monday, IIT Roorkee asked students to vacate hostels by Wednesday, given the rising cases on campus. “A supporting letter from the dean of students’ welfare is being provided to the students to facilitate their travel to their homes,” said the institute’s administration. On Sunday, IIT Delhi also advised students to return home amid a spike in Covid-19 cases as the city ran out of space in its quarantine centres. The Kharagpur campus too has put on hold its plan to bring students on campus as residential campuses across the country are turning into hotbeds for the spread of the virus.Restriction of movementIIT-B, which had started allowing students back on campus for research work, has now cancelled all approvals for incoming students.“We had been allowing research scholars, who needed access to labs, to apply for entry to the campus. The applications were approved after considering the need to come to campus. However, given the severity of the situation now, we have cancelled all prior approvals,” said S Sudarshan, deputy director, IIT-B.Restricting movement within campuses as well as out of the campus is the key, said institutes. The contact tracing team at IIT-B was quick to point out that most cases were arising among those coming to the campus from outside such as post-doctoral fellows living outside and staff members commuting from various parts of the city. “We were able to identify that more cases were among those commuting from various places in the city. So, we asked all post-doctoral and staff members, who are day scholars, to work remotely,” said Sudarshan. There are around 3,000 students and 2,000 staff members residing on campus in IIT-B. At the Institute of Chemical Technology in Matunga (ICT), around 300 Masters and PhD students are now on campus, apart from 60 families of faculty members. Currently, there are no active cases among students but there are a dozen cases among faculty members. Students on campus aren’t allowed out of the campus and outsiders aren’t allowed in. However, what has worked better for the institute is rigorous testing, said RR Deshmukh, the institute’s registrar. “We have been holding testing camps for our students over the last four-five months. We bring in doctors to the camp. Everybody on campus is tested. Rapid antigen tests are done and if there are symptoms and if the doctors decide, RT-PCR tests are also done,” said Deshmukh. Institutes amp up their prepwas to install exhaust fans and do away with the use of air-conditioners across the campus. Canteens and mess facilities have been moved outdoors. ICT has housed all its students on campus in single rooms. Here, too, canteen timings are staggered to restrict the number of students coming together. Although the number of cases has stabilised, all institutes have amped up their quarantine facilities. “Those in the quarantine facility are provided food from the canteens through no contact delivery. Staff members deputed for this work have been provided with personal protective equipment,” said Sudarshan. Some students panicDespite these measures in place, panic persists among students. “Over the last two weeks, cases have been on the rise. Resident students are worried and have stopped socialising on campus,” said a research scholar from IIT-B on the condition of anonymity.“When compared to other IITs, Bombay is doing a decent job of containing the virus. So, we don’t feel an urgent need to leave the campus,” said another student.Student representatives had written to the director of IIT-B, Subhasis Chaudhuri, requesting vaccination for students residing on campus. Chaudhuri, in turn, had written to the Ministry of Education (MoE). A note from the MoE to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare requesting vaccine for students of all central government institutes was struck down last month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/safety-measures-up-at-institutes-housing-hostels-101618946020263.html
21-04-2021||Mumbai||‘Maharashtra’s Covid-19 situation may worsen soon’||While the surge in daily cases has burdened the existing health infrastructure, the situation could worsen in the coming days, according to the government’s internal assessment, which states that Maharashtra is likely to have 1,094,996 active cases by May 2, overwhelming the existing health infrastructure. Most of the districts will not be left with any beds – for isolation, oxygen or ICU beds and ventilators. Instead, many would require substantial additional infrastructure, according to the report which was presented before the state cabinet in its meeting held on Tuesday. This is the reason most of cabinet members were in favour of a complete lockdown. A decision is likely to be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray by Wednesday evening, said state health minister Rajesh Tope after the meeting. Meanwhile, the rise in daily Covid-19 cases continued on Tuesday as it recorded 62,097 new cases. It also reported 519 deaths, the highest single-day toll since the outbreak started in March last year. The earlier highest was 186 days ago on September 15, 2020, when the toll touched 515. The toll has jumped to 61,343. The surge has led to a sharp rise in active cases to 683,856 and going by the current transmission rate, the state health department has predicted that by May 2, additional 411,140 cases could be added to the tally, which will be a record 60% growth in 12 days. Currently, the state has 782,953 isolation beds, 72,869 oxygen beds, 24,986 ICU beds, 10,629 ventilators. In terms of district-wise health facilities, Thane, Pune, Raigad, Ahmednagar, Jalna, Beed, Latur, Parbhani, Hingoli, Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia and Chandrapur are districts that will be left with nothing for any new patient by May 2. On the contrary, everyone will require additional isolation beds, oxygen beds, ICU beds and ventilators, according to the projection. In Mumbai, active cases will rise to 146,065 by May 2, from the current 82,671 cases. By then, the city will be left with only 3,837 isolation beds and will require additional 6,433 oxygen beds, 1,477 ICU beds and 121 ventilators, as estimated by the state health department. Ten districts have the highest number of active cases as they comprise 491,076 cases, which comes to 72.58% of the total cases. Pune is at the top in terms of the highest number of active cases at 125,096. Mumbai comes at second position with 82,761 cases, Thane 80,440 cases, Nagpur 78,484 cases and Nashik 44,279. Currently, the average positivity rate of cases in the state is 25.55% and there are 14 districts where the positivity rate is much higher than the average of the state. The highest is in Osmanabad (39.25%), followed by Parbhani, Hingoli, Nagpur and Gadchiroli at 36.78%, 36.70%, 35.02%, 34.30%, respectively. “Going by the circumstances, most of the ministers were of the view that complete lockdown is the need of the hour. They even want local trains to be shut down. However, some of them opined that shutting down will be trouble for employees engaged with essential services thus only trains, vegetables and milk and medical services should be allowed,” said a minister, requesting anonymity. State urban development minister Eknath Shinde called the surge worrisome and grave. “The Covid-19 cases are increasing and this is a grave situation. There is a shortage of oxygen and people are dying,” said Shinde. He said that lockdown was inevitable in the current situation. Dr Harish Chafle, consultant intensivist and chest physician, Global Hospital at Parel, attributed high mortality rate to the severity of the second wave. “We are witnessing a higher number of deaths as this mutant is more severe than the previous one,” said Chafle. Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingne said, “We have allowed for production of oxygen in 50-60 places at Marathwada. In addition, many of the factories have promised us supply.”The state has tested 265,925 citizens in the past 24 hours. There are currently 683,856 active cases in the state, in which Pune leads with 117,521 cases, followed by Mumbai with 82,671 cases. Similarly, of the 61,343 deaths, Mumbai leads with 12,446 deaths, followed by Pune with 8,855.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-covid-19-situation-may-worsen-soon-101618946018635.html

21-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Covid patient attacks nurse, escapes hospital; nabbed||A panicked Covid-19 patient recently attacked a nurse of a private hospital in the Malabar Hill area with the butt of a kitchen knife and escaped from the hospital. After a few hours, the police nabbed the patient roaming on the streets and admitted him to a civic Covid facility.The patient has been booked by the police and would be arrested once he recovers. Rajesh Shivshankar Gupta, 45, a resident of Lower Parel, was admitted to the Malabar Hill-based private hospital on April 13.At the time of admission, Gupta was suffering from cough, fever, breathing issues, headache, motions and hyperacidity. His Covid report was yet to come, but based on his CT scan report, he was admitted to the hospital. “Gupta was rude with the staff and the doctors since day one. He complained of breathlessness and asked on-duty nurse, Dipika Vasave, the complainant in the case, to shift him to the ICU (intensive care unit). The nurse checked his oxygen level which she found to be normal, hence he was not shifted to ICU,” said a police officer. On April 16, Gupta yelled at Vasave over a petty issue and alleged that he is got infected because of them (the hospital) and attacked her with the butt of a kitchen knife, the police said.A doctor and a ward boy helped her and caught hold of Gupta. Gupta, however, overpowered them and escaped from the hospital. The hospital informed the police control room, and after few hours Gupta was caught in the area. “As he didn’t want to be treated at the said private hospital, he was shifted to a Covid care facility at the Worli NSCI. His family has been informed,” said sub-inspector Gopal Shinde of Malabar Hill police station.He has been booked under sections 324 (voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and other relevant sections of the Indian Penal Code. Once he is recovered completely he would face legal action, said Shinde.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-covid-patient-attacks-nurse-escapes-hospital-nabbed-101618945910561.html

21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ambala pvt schools want physical classes to resume||Members of two private schools’ bodies from Ambala met Haryana education minister Kanwar Pal in Chandigarh on Tuesday and demanded that physical classes be allowed to resume with Covid norms in place.Representatives from Integrated Private School Welfare Society (IPSS) and Haryana Progressive Schools Conference (HPSC) also suggested a plan for reopening of schools in the state. Saurabh Kapoor, president of IPSS, said that if the number of Covid cases in an area is low, schools should be allowed to open at full strength. If cases are moderate, 50% students should be allowed to attend classes and if the cases are high, 33% of the total strength should be allowed to attend on optional basis.“This decision should be dynamic and reviewed every week. The government should also constitute a monitoring committee, comprising education and health department officials and private school owners, who should be allowed to decide if schools will reopen,” Kapoor said. Pal told Hindustan Times that the demands will be forwarded to chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar and a decision will be taken soon.Private school owners also protested at various districts in the state last week after the government directed educational institutes to remain closed till April 30. However, Kanwar Pal criticised the protesters and said that conditions don’t allow for the schools to remain open. The Ambala school owners also opposed the decision of the district education officer (DEO) to not take annual charges from students while giving school leaving certificates.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ambala-pvt-schools-want-physical-classes-to-resume-101618945179251.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Containment zones: Chandigarh admn beefs up perimeter control||A day after Hindustan Times reported the extreme laxity in imposition of stipulated restrictions at containment zones across the city, the UT administration on Tuesday took remedial steps.The administration has enforced stricter perimeter control in the containment zones by erecting barricades to restrict movement. Only essential movement will be allowed now. UT personnel were also deputed outside the containment zones to check for any violations.HT, in its report, had highlighted how perimeter control was not being maintained at some micro-containment zones in the city. Also, when the HT correspondent visited the containment zones, no UT personnel were found posted to check for violations.On Tuesday, deputy commissioner Mandip Singh Brar notified 28 more micro-containment zones, taking the total number to around 230 in the city.Amid an unprecedented growth in Covid-19 cases, the Centre has been insisting on creation of localised containment zones, to restrict the spread of infection.According to the central guidelines, the local district, police and municipal authorities are responsible to ensure that the prescribed containment measures are strictly followed. There has to be strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and to maintain supply of essential goods and services.Ensure strict enforcement of Covid norms, curbs: CentreEven the Centre on Tuesday directed the Chandigarh administration to ensure enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour with stricter implementation of movement restrictions. It also asked the administration to create more containment zones. Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla along with health secretary Rajesh Bhushan chaired a high-level meeting to review and discuss the Covid status, its management and response strategy with the UT. The meeting, held through video conference, was also attended by Dr V K Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog, and Dr Balram Bhargava of the ICMR. Among various measures, the Centre directed prohibition of large gatherings and regulated timings for markets along with ramping up of testing and hospital infrastructure. The Union home secretary urged constant vigilance while Dr Paul pointed out the importance of next three weeks for Covid response measures.Chandigarh Police efforts to implement Covid protocol and weekend curfew also came under the scanner. Officials stressed that more should have been done to ensure better compliance of the weekend lockdown restrictions.The Centre has also asked the administration to report regularly on the number of challans being issued against the violators. UT adviser Manoj Parida said that the police department has been instructed to be more diligent to ensure stricter implementation of Covid appropriate behaviour. “From Wednesday, cops will be stricter in regulating people’s movement,” he said, adding that the Centre was happy with Chandigarh’s testing rate and improved vaccination rate. “We have been asked to create more containment zones. We have already created more than 200 such zones in the city since March,” said Parida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/containment-zones-chandigarh-admn-beefs-up-perimeter-control-101618945059513.html

21-04-2021||Delhi||In meeting with L-G Baijal, BJP says migrants need urgent attention||Senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders, in a meeting with Lieutenant Governor (L-G) Anil Baijal on Tuesday, flagged the problem of migrant workers in the Capital, and stressed that there was an urgent need to set up temporary shelters and ration camps to prevent them from leaving in city en masse, as they had when the national lockdown was announced in March last year.The party also accused the Delhi government of “not involving” the Opposition in the fight against Covid-19.Delhi government spokespersons did not respond to requests for comment.In a video conference meeting with the L-G, BJP leaders said the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP)-led Delhi government should allow the three municipal corporations, which are governed by the BJP, to set up dedicated Covid-19 sections in their hospitals as well as open up quarantine centres in community halls and schools.Delhi BJP chief Adesh Gupta said: “The three municipal corporations in Delhi [North, East and South] have significant staff strength and infrastructure, which can be used to ramp up facilities for Covid-19 patients. But the Kejriwal government is not ready to involve the opposition.”He added, “The municipal corporations played a prominent role in helping people during the Covid lockdown last year. But the Delhi government is not involving them this year. The corporations request to allow them to form Covid sections in their hospitals is not being approved. They are also not being allowed to set up quarantine centres.”Also read: Delhi govt steps up efforts to boost jabsGupta said, “Past experience tells us that if these migrant workers leave the city, it will take months to reorganise the economy. It is important that ration and temporary camps be provided for them.”The meeting with the L-G on Tuesday was attended by BJP members of Parliament Ramesh Bidhuri (South Delhi), Meenakshi Lekhi (New Delhi), Parvesh Verma (West Delhi), Gautam Gambhir (East Delhi) and Manoj Tiwari (North East Delhi), as well BJP MLAs Ramvir Singh Bidhuri and Vijender Gupta.Referring to the present Covid-19 situation in the city, BJP MP Ramvir Singh Bidhuri said, “We have demanded that the government ensure medical counselling for patients in home isolation and a centralised facility to provide them medicines at home.”The L-G’s office did not respond to requests for comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-meeting-with-l-g-bjp-says-migrant-workers-need-urgent-attention-101618944940517.html
21-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt offers financial aid, free shelter and food to prevent exodus||On a day when Prime Minister Narendra Modi addressed the nation in the wake of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, and said states should see lockdown as a “last resort” and must do everything to ensure the well-being of migrants, the Delhi government said it will once again start providing a financial assistance of ₹5,000 to 171, 861 workers registered with the Delhi Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Board (DBOCWW).In view of the week-long lockdown imposed to curb the spiralling spread of Covid-19 in the national capital, the government also said it will also provide free shelter, food and medicines at 205 night shelters across the city.Based on ground reports and media visuals of thousands of migrant workers congregating at the Delhi-UP border and around the Anand Vihar interstate bus terminal throughout Monday, hours after the Delhi government announced the week-long curfew, lieutenant-governor Anil Baijal called for an “emergency meeting” with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal at 11am on Tuesday. Chief secretary Vijay Dev was also present at the meeting where these decisions for the welfare of migrant workers were finalised.A senior government official clarified that the DBOCWW does not have only construction workers registered with it. “The Board has a variety of other daily wagers, including electricians, plumbers, carpenters and so on. Most of them are migrant workers, and, as on date, we have 171,861 workers registered with DBOCWW and the registration will be open throughout the lockdown so that more workers can avail of the government’s financial assistance. The amount of ₹5,000 will be directly sent to the bank accounts of all registered workers as a means of sustenance during this ongoing lockdown,” said a senior official of the labour department, asking not to be named.Also read: New B.1.618 variants now among most sequencedDuring the nationwide lockdown last year, the Delhi government had provided ₹5,000 to each registered worker twice (amounting to a total of ₹10,000 per worker). At least 47,247 workers availed of the benefit back then.Baijal on Tuesday also appealed to all migrant workers to stay put and not leave the capital. He assured them that the government has made adequate arrangements to sustain them through the week comfortably.“I appeal to all migrant workers to not leave Delhi in panic. I assure you that the government will take care of all your needs during this surge in Covid-19 cases. All necessary arrangements are being made for you. You run Delhi with your tireless hard work and this city is yours,” Baijal tweeted in Hindi.Modi also made a similar appeal on Tuesday evening in his nationwide address. “We assure migrants that they will soon be vaccinated in the city where they are residing and their livelihood will also not be affected,” he said in the televised address.After the meeting with the L-G and the CM, chief secretary Dev issued two orders on behalf of the Delhi disaster management authority (DDMA) on Tuesday evening.In the first order, the DDMA constituted a committees comprising six members with principal secretary (home) BS Bhalla as chairperson, and tasked it with ensuring basic amenities such as food, water, sanitation, shelters and medicines for daily wagers and migrant labourers, including those at construction sites. It also tied up with midday meal contractors for preparing enough meals for thousands of workers and their families who are likely to avail of the welfare measures in the coming days.In the second order, the DDMA appointed Bhalla as the “state nodal officer for Delhi” for coordinating and supervising all matters pertaining to welfare and movement of migrant workers. To ensure proper coordination with the Delhi Police for the same, Rajesh Khurana, special commissioner of police (central range) has been appointed the “nodal officer of Delhi Police’’.The DDMA also asked all district magistrates and DCPs to enquire after migrants worker welfare in their districts. They have been also directed to continuously make announcements to calm the fears of migrant workers.“At least 205 night shelters are being opened for migrant workers and their families.

21-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt steps up efforts to boost jabs||District administrations have stepped up efforts to mobilise people, especially in lower-income groups, for Covid-19 vaccinations and ensure that there is no significant drop in inoculation numbers due to the six-day-long curfew.While there was a slight drop in the number of walk-ins at vaccination centres in some districts on Tuesday, the first day of the week-long curfew, officials said the drop was negligible.District officials said the government’s decision to do away with e-passes for vaccination, which was mandatory for travel, even to the vaccination centre, during the earlier weekend curfew, has helped in mobilising people — especially from the lower income group — to get vaccinated.As per the Delhi Disaster Management Authority’s (DDMA) order, “persons who are going for Covid-19 testing or vaccination, can do so on production of valid identity card.”“There are nearly 80,000-100,000 people getting vaccinated daily. It is not possible to issue so many e-passes. As most vaccination centres are located near residential areas, people can just walk down to the centres,” said a senior revenue department official, asking not to be named.Also read: Spike renders tracing near-impossibleOn the first day of the curfew, administrations provided vehicles to take residents to vaccination centres and teams of ASHA (accredited social health activists), ANMs (auxillary nurse midwives) and civil defence volunteers were deployed to get people to the centres.A senior New Delhi district official said, “There is no major change in vaccination coverage due to the curfew. We are providing vehicles to bring beneficiaries to the vaccination centre and field staff (ASHA, ANM) are working in their areas to get people to the centres.”A senior north-west district official said, “Close to 50% of the people coming to the centre are walk-ins. Today, there is a slight drop in the number of walk-ins. But that could be due to the festival period (last day of Navratras and the ongoing Ramzan fasting).”In the Central district, the administration is running registrations camps near densely populated lower income group areas where people can register before being taken to vaccination centres.In the private sector, too, hospitals such as BLK hospital, Sir Ganga Ram Hospital and Max Healthcare said there was no major impact on vaccination due to the curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/districts-mobilising-people-for-vaccination-curfew-fails-to-affect-numbers-101618944939239.html

The government has also suspended online and semi-online activities for students up to Class 9 till the last day of summer break on June 9.This leaves guest teaches with no work, and there is little chance of them getting any during the summer break.In a circular, issued on Monday, DoE said, “All the heads of schools are hereby directed to discontinue the services of all the guest teachers engaged in their school w.e.f. 20.04.2021...all the guest teachers shall be paid up to April 19, 2021, and in summer vacations only if they are called for the duties.”Shoeb Rana, secretary of All India Guest Teachers’ Association, said around 20,000 guest teachers engaged in 1,030 Delhi government schools are paid on a daily basis. “In normal circumstances, Delhi government schools organised summer camps for students where the majority of the guest teachers were deployed. However, since last year, there have been no summer camps due to Covid-19. The guest teachers survived without any income for over three months last year. The situation is the same this year,” he said. “The government should have planned something for us as well, taking a cue from last year. Where do we go now?”Also read | Centre’s vaccine policy hollow: Mamata to PMHT reported last May that several guest teachers resorted to alternative livelihoods, including selling vegetables, repairing bicycles, and working in fields, after schools remained closed amid the pandemic.Wazir Singh, 34, an English teacher, who sold vegetables last year to make ends meet for around four months, said, “My school used to call me for Mission Buniyaad classes and entrepreneurship classes during the 201 summer break. Things have completely changed. There is a lockdown in the city, otherwise I would have found some home tuitions. What will I do for the next 2-3 months?”A senior official of the Delhi government’s education department said the government has authorised schools to call guest teachers as per requirement during the summer break. “Every year, the guest teachers are paid on a need basis during summer break. They may be called for admission and examination related work. But the government cannot guarantee it. Under the prevailing situation it is difficult to accommodate so many teachers,” the official said.Several principals said they will not need guest teachers during the summer break this year due to Covid curbs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-delhi-govt-schools-close-for-summer-holidays-guest-teachers-left-without-work-101618944938551.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Questions raised as Panjab University forms inspection panels ahead of senate polls||With Panjab University senate polls set to begin from April 26, many candidates who are contesting the election have raised concerns as the varsity has constituted various inspection committees ahead of the polls.Many former members of PU senate and syndicate have said that the constitution of such committees is against the decision taken by the syndicate last year. However, PU authorities say that they have followed the rules and regulations and past practice of the university.The said committees are meant for conducting physical inspection of colleges for the grant of affiliation every year. However, the syndicate in its meeting in May last year had resolved that since physical inspections were not possible during the pandemic, information from the colleges would be sought online. A few members have also refused to be part of these committees saying that these were constituted in violation of the syndicate’s decision.Former syndicate member HS Dua, who has refused to be part of the inspections, said, “The physical inspections were not conducted last year as decided by the syndicate, then why now when there is no syndicate? This is a political move rather than an academic one.”Over 100 candidates are in the fray from eight constituencies for the election of 47 members to the 91-member PU senate. Some poll candidates are claiming that the constitution of these committees at this time is an agenda to influence the upcoming senate elections.Move in violation of PU Act: Ex-senatorTerming it a violation of PU Act, former senator Ashok Goyal said, “As per sections 27 and 28 of the PU Act, it is only syndicate which is empowered to consider any application submitted for affiliation or extension of affiliation and there is no provision of delegation to the vice-chancellor for ordering any inspection which is to be considered by the syndicate and then senate.”Section 28 of the PU Act states that for the extension of affiliation procedure prescribed in Section 27 may be followed. Sub-section 2 of Section 27 states that on receipt of a letter of application, the syndicate shall direct a local inquiry to be made by a competent person authorised by the syndicate on this behalf, to make such further inquiry as may appear to them to be necessary; and report to the senate on the question whether the application should be granted or refused.Former president of Panjab University Teachers Association (PUTA) Akshaya Kumar, who is also contesting the senate polls, said, “This is a misuse of office for electoral purposes.”However, college development council dean Sanjay Kaushik said, “We have followed the rules and regulations of the university and the past practice as well. We have the highest regard for the university calendar, syndicate and senate.”Contrary to this, former syndicate and senate member, Navdeep Goyal, who also refused to be part of the inspections said, “A decision taken by the syndicate remains in effect till it is not reversed by the syndicate itself. Only the syndicate has the power to change its decision.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/questions-raised-as-panjab-university-forms-inspection-panels-ahead-of-senate-polls-101618944769359.html

The deceased was identified as Chand Quraishi. Police said that the team had visited Quraishi’s flat in search of his brother-in-law, Imran, who is wanted in a case of vehicle theft and firing at a police party. Police said that Quraishi was also involved in 14 criminal cases. Rajesh Kumar Singh, deputy commissioner of police, Greater Noida, said that Imran had escaped during an encounter on April 7 this year. According to police, Imran and his accomplice Bandi had been spotted in a car on April 7 and asked to stop by a police team. Then the duo opened fire at the police team and sped up, but the team chased down the suspects and forced them to stop, police officials said. Police arrested Bandi while Imran managed to escape. The DCP said that the police team received information that Imran sometimes visits his in-laws’ place in Sector Omicron. “A police team on Monday conducted a search at Imran’s in-laws’ third floor rented accommodation, but found him missing. During the raid, his brothers-in-law Chand Quraishi and Lukman were in the flat. Quraishi got scared and he locked himself in the washroom and tried to climb down through a window. The window could not bear his weight and it broke and he fell to the ground,” the DCP said. Quraishi was admitted to a private hospital in Greater Noida where he died, police said. However, Quraishi’s younger brother Lukman alleged that police caught him and his brother and thrashed them. “We were beaten up badly as we failed to tell Imran’s whereabouts to police. The police team then pushed my brother from the third floor,” he alleged. However, the police officials have denied the allegations.

21-04-2021||Delhi||AAP says MCDs not collecting waste from homes of patients in isolation||The Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) on Tuesday alleged that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led municipal corporations of Delhi (MCDs) were failing in the collection and disposal of medical waste from the residences of home-isolated Covid-19 patients.The BJP dismissed the allegations as “baseless” and accused the AAP of engaging in “blame game” during a crisis.“The BJP is failing in Covid-19 management in every aspect. The BJP-led MCDs are failing to ensure that waste is collected and disposed of from residences of home isolated Covid-19 patients. More than 37,000 people are in home isolation in Delhi. There is a massive risk of the disease spreading if the waste is not taken care of at the earliest. Only the BJP will be responsible if things go south,” said Durgesh Pathak, AAP leader in charge of municipal affairs.Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) guidelines for the management of Covid-19 biomedical waste says refuse from patients’ houses must be collected daily, in colour-coded and sealed bags, to prevent any spread of infection. Household biomedical waste has to be put in yellow bags. And, in every locality, it has to be done separately. In Delhi, the MCDs are in charge of the waste collection and disposal.Delhi BJP spokesperson Praveen Shankar Kapoor said, “These are baseless allegations. The AAP is engaging in a blame game to hide their own failure in Covid-19 management. All three MCDs have been properly collecting and disposing of waste from the residences of home isolated patients since the beginning of the pandemic, and as per guidelines. The MCDs have also started a helpline for waste collection, the number of which is shared with patients in home isolation.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aap-accuses-mcds-of-not-disposing-of-biomedical-waste-properly-not-true-says-bjp-101618944760101.html

He also suggested that spare technical health staff be deputed from PGIMER to GMCH-32 and GMSH-16, where staff shortage is being faced. He directed for better coordination among all three medical institutions for optimal utilisation of staff,” the official release by the administration stated.Admn seeks increase in bed capacity The UT administration has also written to the central government seeking directions for PGIMER to increase the bed capacity to 500 against the current 283 beds.“For increasing the capacity of ventilator beds to at least 100 by sparing it from other areas to PGIMER, we have written to the central government. There are presently 50 ventilator beds and similarly, around 40 ventilator beds have been arranged at GMCH-32. PGIMER has the capacity to increase the number of beds for Covid patients, besides the general oxygenated beds,” a senior UT official requesting anonymity said.The administrator has also appealed to the retired doctors, medical staff and members of the Indian Medical Association to come forward and coordinate with the health authorities in various capacities. Badnore directed the principal health secretary to engage such persons on contractual basis, if necessary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-covid-patient-rush-pgimer-told-to-ramp-up-infra-101618944759619.html
21-04-2021||Delhi||Migrants continue to trickle out of Capital on 1st day of lockdown||The exodus of migrants from the Capital to their home towns in Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand and Jharkhand via buses from the Anand Vihar bus terminal, and across the border from Uttar Pradesh’s Kaushambi terminus, continued on Tuesday, the first day of the lockdown in Delhi.The crowd at the two stations, however, was much less than on Monday, when nearly tens of thousands left the Capital in buses, officials said.The scenes on Monday were reminiscent of the migrant exodus last March, after the nationwide lockdown was declared. The foot-overbridges connecting Kaushambi and Anand Vihar ISBTs, and the railway station and the Metro station, were packed through Monday and in the early hours of Tuesday.Covid-19 protocols fell by the wayside as people stood in close proximity, and many did not wear masks properly.Officials attributed the drop in Tuesday’s numbers at the transit hubs to the enforcement of the curfew in Delhi and “confidence-building” measures they have undertaken to ensure migrants do not leave.Also read| Delhi to get 2.7k more Covid-19 beds: SisodiaThese, officials said, included the announcement by the Delhi government on Tuesday that shelters will be opened for migrant workers, and they will be given free meals and medical aid.The state government is also going to start providing financial aid of ₹5,000 to at least 170,000 workers registered with the Delhi workers welfare board.Puneet Sethi, state manager of ISBT Anand Vihar, said more than 25,000 people caught buses out of the city on Monday itself. There was a sharp decline in passengers since Tuesday morning and not more than 200 passengers were seen at any given time at the bus terminal.“The crowd on Monday was mostly migrants who panicked after the curfew announcement. We arranged 400 extra buses to manage the situation. A majority of passengers had left by early Tuesday,” Sethi said.Officials at the Kaushambi terminal said more than 60,000 passengers left in over 1,200 buses on Monday. The numbers came down to fewer than 10,000 passengers by Tuesday evening.“The gatherings swelled on Monday. Nearly 90% of them left by 3.30am on Tuesday. The situation is normal now,” said Narendra Kumar, assistant regional manager, Kaushambi terminal.To manage the crowd and to ensure they followed Covid protocol, nearly 400 police and civil defence volunteers were deployed in and around the bus terminals, said additional deputy commissioner of police (east) Sanjay Sehrawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/crowds-thinner-at-isbts-but-many-still-make-a-beeline-for-buses-out-of-city-101618944758463.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Uniform speed limits announced for Chandigarh roads||After the traffic police’s recommendation to make speed limits uniform across Chandigarh roads, the transport department issued a notification on Tuesday, making the new limits official.As the number of overspeeding challans increased exponentially, many motorists pointed out that it was hard to make sense of the UT’s original speed notification which was put in place in 2013. The speed limit of the roads leading to Mohali was also different to the others in the city which caused some confusion. Many people were also not familiar with the V1, V2 terminology used in it.As per the notification, the roads have been divided into three broad categories: dual carriageway (roads with dividers, which were earlier termed V1 and V2), single carriageway (roads without dividers; earlier V3 and V4) and sector roads (previously V5 and V6).The class of motor vehicles have been divided based on the number of seats in the vehicle. For instance, light motor vehicles have been denoted as motor vehicles used for carriage of passengers comprising not more than eight seats in addition to the driver’s seat to make it clearer.The project was taken up by UT senior superintendent of police (SSP, traffic) Manisha Choudhary. Speaking about this she said, “The public had a demand to simplify speed limits and to make them easy to understand and follow. We had recommended this based on the feedback received and we hope that the public will be now able to follow the speed limit better. It will also be easier for us to ensure better awareness and enforcement.”The traffic police have also requested the UT engineering department to install new speed limit sign boards in place of old ones.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/uniform-speed-limits-announced-for-chandigarh-roads-101618944642519.html
21-04-2021||Other||Cong slams govt for asking guv to call Covid meet||Bengaluru The all-party meeting called by Karnataka governor Vajubhai Vala on the Covid-19 situation began on a contentious note on Tuesday, with Congress leader Siddaramaiah saying the head of the state, not of the government, calling the meet goes against the Constitution. “The first thing I want to say about this meeting is that the governor calling it is against the Constitution,” Siddaramaiah said at the beginning of the all-party meeting. He said the governor has no right or role in administration. “The governor cannot take decisions based on this meeting. It is for the council of ministers to take decisions regarding Covid-19,” Siddaramaiah said. The Congress has maintained that the governor calling a meeting indicated that the elected state government had failed. “What does it mean when the governor calls an all-party meeting? Is there no elected government in the state? Is this the government’s inability or part of the agenda for #BSYmuktaBJP campaign? Does the government have no face to face the opposition? Or no ability to face the situation? Such a masked government cannot save people’s lives,” the state unit of the Congress said in a Twitter post on Tuesday. Chief minister BS Yediyurappa, who is undergoing treatment for Covid-19 at a private hospital in Bengaluru, is also accused of not heeding to the advice of experts, who had indicated that the second wave is likely to be worse than the first one last year. The Technical Advisory Committee (TAC), which comprises noted medical practitioners, has said their advice for imposing strict restrictions and other proposals were not considered by the government. Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s home, law and parliamentary affairs minister, dismissed the criticism by the Congress. “The Prime Minister has spoken to all governors and asked them to hold talks with the state governments and opposition parties to ensure coordination to put up a united fight against Covid-19 in such extraordinary circumstances. Governors of all other states are also holding meetings,” Bommai said. He said that the governor of Rajasthan had also held a meeting with the chief minister of that state. “There is a Congress government in Rajasthan. If the governor holds a meeting there, does it mean that there is governor’s rule in Rajasthan,” Bommai said. He said governors have also held meetings in other states like Maharashtra, where the Congress is in power through an alliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cong-slams-govt-for-asking-guv-to-call-covid-meet-101618944638442.html
21-04-2021||Noida||Noida AOA cancels self-imposed lockdown after opposition from residents||NOIDA: In what could have been a glimpse of last year’s lockdown for the residents of Mahagun Moderne in Sector 78, its apartment owners associations (AOA) had on Monday announced a self-imposed lockdown in the housing complex. However, it was called off on Monday after strong opposition from a group of residents.The ”lockdown” was supposed to be from April 21 to April 26, during which domestic helps, car washers, and other handymen would not be allowed inside the residential complex. Non-essential guests were also banned from entering the premises. Only delivery of essential services was to be allowed. According to the AOA, Mahagun Moderne — which has over 2,500 flats — currently has 180 plus active Covid-19 cases.“Since April 1, Covid-19 cases here increased from just four to 180, on April 20. On Tuesday, a woman resident succumbed to her infection. In such a situation, as the AOA, we had to take strict measures to control the spread of the virus. There are hundreds of domestic helps, handymen, and car washers who frequent many houses in a day..., and also use common lifts and parks. Some residents also call non-essential guests, adding to the spread of the virus... The movement of people, who have to go to work, is allowed,” said Sandeep Chauhan, president, Mahagun Moderne AOA.As per Chauhan, the AOA had informed the administration about the decision, and had also carried out a polling by the residents. However, the opposition in the housing complex increased by Tuesday evening, following which the AOA decided to call off the decision. The residential complex has 35 towers, 96 lifts, 2,633 flats, and accommodates nearly 10,000 people.While some welcomed the decision, others opposed it. “It is an autocratic decision, and the residents are not bound by any rules to follow it. If the state government is not imposing a lockdown, how can the AOA do it?” asked Urvashi Chandiramani, a resident of Mahagun Moderne.“As a result of the absence of complete administrative guidelines, restrictions can be imposed in residential complexes, with a consensus of the residents. However, achieving consensus in large housing complexes is in itself a big challenge for the AOAs. Such decisions sometimes are needed to strike a balance between health and convenience of the residents,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Association (NOFAA).Suhas LY, district magistrate, Gautam Budh Nagar, did not comment on this.On Monday, the Gautam Buddh Nagar administration had asked its respective AOAs to appoint a “Corona vigilance officer” who would keep a track and report about Covid-19 cases in the district. “Every RWA and housing complex will appoint a Corona vigilance officer for each building/ tower. The vigilance officers will report about the positive cases, with lab reports, and any violation made by Covid-positive patients to presidents/ secretaries of RWAs and residential complexes,” according to the SOP.Meanwhile, SG Homes apartment in Ghaziabad Sector 3, Vasundhara, is also contemplating a similar decision. “There are some residents, who are not disclosing that they are Covid-positive and continue to call their domestic helps. These domestic helps then go to other flats and spread the virus. We have proposed a decision to bar all domestic helps to control this. However, the decision has not been executed yet,” said Alok Kumar, president, SG Homes AOA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-aoa-cancels-self-imposed-lockdown-after-opposition-from-residents-101618944579104.html
21-04-2021||Chandigarh||Weekend curfew to continue in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh administration has imposed a one-time lockdown in the city on Wednesday and also decided to continue with the weekend curfew. Meanwhile, the night curfew timings have been extended by two hours. It will now begin at 8pm, instead of 10pm, and stay in force till 5am. The decisions were taken during the Covid-19 review meeting on Tuesday, at a time when Chandigarh has recorded 600+ cases for third consecutive day. The Wednesday lockdown decision came a day after Punjab agreed and Haryana refused to the Chandigarh administration’s proposal of imposing pan-tricity lockdown on Ram Navami. While Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday announced a one-day lockdown in Mohali for Wednesday, Haryana home minister Anil Vij had stated that the state government will not take any such step. “After a detailed discussion, we decided it was time to impose a lockdown as cases have been rising sharply. Even Union home secretary in a meeting on Tuesday asked for stricter imposition of restrictions,” said UT adviser Manoj Parida. Restrictions and exemptionsOn Wednesday, all non-essential movement has been prohibited, as was done during the curfew imposed last weekend.The lockdown will start from 10pm on Tuesday and stay in force till 5am on Thursday. All essential commodity shops and restaurants will be allowed to remain open. However, only home delivery will be allowed. These include shops and vendors dealing with food, groceries, fruits and vegetable, dairy, meat, animal fodder, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment.For the home delivery staff, their identity card will suffice for movement. As seen during the weekend curfew, even domestic helps are expected to face no issue in going for work.All private offices will remain closed, and only industries manufacturing essential products, such as masks, sanitisers and medicines, can operate. All marriage functions for which the permission has been taken from the subdivisional magistrate are allowed, subject to the cap of 50 people. The marriage organisers or other people seeking movement pass may contact on 0172-2700076 and 0172-2700341 or apply online on www.admser.chd.nic/dpc. All passes related to the Punjab and Haryana high court and district court will be issued by the registrar general of the court. All vaccination centres, testing centres, dispensaries and medical facilities will remain open and people going there will be allowed to move. All interstate travellers will also be allowed to move, though there will be screening at the airport, railway station and bus stands.Those tasked with law and order, Covid-19 duties and emergency and municipal services besides accredited media persons are also exempted on production of identity card.Weekend curbs from 8pm on FridayMeanwhile, the weekend lockdown will be enforced from 8pm on Friday to 5am on Monday, with the same of set of restrictions and exemptions. The administration will also be taking up a proposal for a weeklong lockdown during the Covid-19 review meeting on Friday. UT administrator VP Singh Badnore directed the police to be extremely strict in enforcing the lockdown and night curfew. If necessary, the vehicles should be seized and heavy fine should be imposed on those indulging in non-essential travel or violating the Covid-19 safety protocol, he said. Last weekend, 23 people were arrested for curfew violation and 182 were fined for not adhering to Covid guidelines amid high compliance.Badnore directed the municipal commissioner to ensure that the protocol is strictly followed at all markets, including apni mandis, and all public places are regularly sanitised. He also appealed to public representatives, resident welfare associations and market associations to persuade all eligible residents to get vaccinated.Meanwhile, Chandigarh Beopar Mandal has denounced the Wednesday lockdown as a step taken in hurry and without taking into confidence the stakeholders, predominantly the traders. Charanjiv Singh, president, Beopar Mandal, said: “We will hold a meeting on Thursday to decide ways of protest and stop further lockdowns.” HS Lucky, Congress chief spokesperson, said, “The Chandigarh administration’s decision to impose lockdown on Ram Navami is completely wrong. This is not a solution to the pandemic, but affects the livelihood of all people.”Chandigarh temples closed for devotees today
21-04-2021||Other||Weekend curfew, extended night curbs as cases surge in K’taka||BengaluruAfter weeks of deliberations and discussions, the Karnataka government on Tuesday announced extended hours of restrictions during the night and a weekend curfew across the state to mitigate the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 surge in the state and its capital Bengaluru.“The guidelines shall continue to remain in force from 9 pm of 21st April 2021 upto 6am of 4th May 2021,” the guidelines issued by the state government on Tuesday said. The guidelines will be applicable to all parts of the state.The document, named ‘Guidelines to contain COVID l9 transmission in the state’ does not mention lockdown, even though most of the provisions indicate closure of most commercial establishments including cinema halls, malls, restaurants and other activities. Take away services have been allowed to function.The decision comes after days of indecisiveness by the BS Yediyurappa-led government that has been trying to find a middle ground between announcing a lockdown and keeping economic activities functioning in the cash-starved state.“This is not a full lockdown and is kind of a middle ground,” P Ravi Kumar, Karnataka’s chief secretary said on Tuesday night.The guidelines were issued barely an hour after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s address, in which he said that lockdown must be the last resort by states, leaving the decision to go in for a lockdown or not with the concerned state governments.The Karnataka government has said that movement of people will remain strictly prohibited during the weekend curfew, except for essential activities.On weekends, grocery shops and other produce selling stores will remain open from 6 am to 10 am.“All industries/companies which require operations at night shall be permitted to operate. Movement of employees of such organisations shall be allowed on producing valid ID card/authorisation issued by their respective organisation/institution,” according to the order.The government said that movement of vehicles for essential supplies will not be prohibited and food and other delivery will be allowed. People will be allowed to move in public and public transport to railway stations, bus stations and airports by producing valid tickets.The restrictions come almost a month after the surge across the state and its capital, Bengaluru, which remains firmly in the tightening grip of the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, which continues to wreak havoc on the southern state and other parts of the country.Karnataka and Benglauru reported their highest ever single-day spike on Tuesday as they reported 21,794 and 13,782 infections respectively, taking the combined active cases to 159,158.The state also reported 149 fatalities, including 92 in Bengaluru, indicating the severity of the spread and its impact.R Ashok, Karnataka’s revenue minister, on Tuesday directed district officials in the state to allot land on the outskirts of cities for cremation of bodies citing overload at crematoriums.The guidelines further state that schools, colleges, educational institutions will remain closed. Cinema halls, shopping malls, gymnasiums, yoga centres and sports complexes have been listed under the prohibited activities.The order also states that all religious places will remain closed even though people working in these establishments can continue their work.“The situation in the state has aggravated. Therefore, some extraordinary measures are necessary,” Basavaraj Bommai, Karnataka’s home, law and parliamentary affairs minister, said hours before the guidelines were issued.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/weekend-curfew-extended-night-curbs-as-cases-surge-in-ktaka-101618944458373.html
21-04-2021||Noida||Economic crisis to hit Noida as migrant labourers leave city amid lockdown||NOIDA: Realtors, factory owners, and other businessmen stare at the worst economic crisis as factory labourers and construction workers started leaving for their respective hometowns following the announcement of a week-long lockdown in Delhi, and weekend lockdown in Uttar Pradesh.According to the Micro, Small, Medium Enterprises (MSME), Gautam Budh Nagar, at least 20% of its workers have left for their hometowns last week, affecting the work. Even more are planning to leave the city to keep themselves safe from Covid-19 infection. Similarly, the Confederation of Real Estate Developers Associations of India (CREDAI) and the National Real Estate Development Council (NAREDCO) said that their businesses are shut once again amid the abrupt rise in the coronavirus cases in Noida and Greater Noida.“The surge in Covid-19 cases in Delhi, Noida, and other big cities has left the businesses gasping already, as the workers are leaving for their hometowns. Thirty out of 60 workers stopped reporting to work after Delhi chief minister announced the lockdown. Six others refused to come to work as they wanted to stay safe at their hometowns in Uttar Pradesh. The worst is going to happen soon as the remaining workers have also planned to leave the city... This time, unlike last year, workers are planning to leave the city via buses and other vehicles as they fear the wave will continue for a longer period of time this year” said Surendra Nahta, president, MSME, Gautam Budh Nagar chapter.The district has at least 600 ongoing realty projects, and the builders stare at the “worst crisis” as they have hardly seen sales for a month, as Covid-19 cases started increasing.“It took us almost a year to revive the real estate sector... since March 2020. We had started to witness normalcy in the market, but now, we stare at a bigger economic crisis once again, with Covid-19 cases increasing rapidly because of the poor health infrastructure. With most of our staff handling sales are Covid-positive, and the cases are on the rise in all the big cities, we have been seeing zero sales for the past one month. We fear that this time the impact on the business sector will be the worst,” said Prashant Kumar Tiwari, president, western Uttar Pradesh wing, CREDAI.Though the developers did not close their sales offices yet, around 50% of staff has not been reporting to work. “We can’t run the business without our staff, construction workers, and customers. Since all the three sections are struggling with Covid-19 infection, the ramification on the business is beyond imagination. The real estate sector now stares at the worst crisis ahead if the situation prevails,” said RK Arora, president, NAREDCO.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/economic-crisis-to-hit-noida-as-migrant-labourers-leave-city-amid-lockdown-101618944459005.html

The victim’s family said that the man had tested negative for Covid-19, but his CT scan reports indicated a severe infection in his lungs, with almost Covid-like symptoms.The victim, identified as Surjan Singh, was a native of Pauri Garhwal in Uttarakhand, and had retired as a lab assistant of the Delhi education department. His son, Yashvir Singh, said that he tried to admit his father to two government hospitals in Delhi, before successfully admitting him at a private hospital in East Delhi, where the doctors performed his CT scan.“I went to two government hospitals in Delhi on April 18, but they did not admit him due to the unavailability of beds. My father had tested Covid-negative. The CT scan reports indicated that he had an infection in his lungs, and the doctors at the East Delhi hospital asked me to admit my father to a Covid facility... He also suffered from blood pressure complications and diabetes,” said Singh, adding that he took his father to hospitals in Ghaziabad, Kaushambi, and Vaishali on Monday, but couldn’t admit his father to a hospital.“One of the hospitals was helpful enough to provide him oxygen support for some time as the oxygen level in his body was constantly decreasing. We both were on a bike, and I had been monitoring his oxygen level every hour... The Vaishali hospital told us that no beds were available there, but I could see ambulances arriving at the premises with patients. While driving, I felt that my father suffered two shocks when we were at the internal main road in Vaishali, and I stopped the bike... My father died on the road,” he said.”With the help of some passersby, we took him under a tree. Then I called up my family members, and also a private ambulance. The local councillor of Vaishali, too, came for help. Finally, we reached Delhi with his body in the evening,” he added. Yashvir had lost his job at a pharma company in Sahibabad in 2020, and opened a photocopy shop in East Delhi, which is now closed amid the week-long lockdown in Delhi.Meanwhile, Manoj Goel, councillor from Vaishali, said that the family was running helplessly, and found no beds, and the patient died in unfortunate circumstances. “His father’s body was lying on the road, and people looked at it and passed by. Finally, an ambulance arrived, and the body was taken to Delhi,” Goel said.Dr Ashish Agarwal, president, Indian Medical Association (IMA), Ghaziabad chapter, termed the incident as “unfortunate”, and said that the lack of bed availability is a major issue across Delhi-NCR. “Most of the hospitals are overburdened, and the lack of bed availability is a major issue. There are instances where asymptomatic patients get beds. Beds are also booked beforehand, through sources. And, when needy patients arrive, they struggle to get beds for treatment,” Agarwal said.Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO), said that there’s a shortage of ICU beds in hospitals. “The family, on some account, could not reach our control room or our health department. Otherwise, we could have arranged for a bed for the patient,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/no-bed-62-year-old-man-dies-on-road-in-vaishali-101618944338473.html
21-04-2021||Noida||UPSRTC sends 110 buses carrying migrants from Noida||Noida: As the Delhi government announced a six-day lockdown on Monday, a number of migrant workers gathered at the Noida Depot to go to their home towns in different parts of UP. Officials of the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) said they arranged 110 buses on Monday to send migrant workers to their home towns. R K Tripathi, assistant regional manager, UPSRTC Noida, said that a number of people had gathered at the Noida depot to go to different parts of the state on Monday. “We sent thousands of people in 110 buses,” he said. Some migrant workers were looking for public transport on Tuesday as well. 22-year-old Suraj Kumar was seen at the bus depot waiting for his bus for Kanpur on Tuesday afternoon near the City Centre. “I had come to Noida at my maternal uncle’s place on a vacation last month. The situation was better when I came here. Now, there is a sense of fear due to Covid,” Kumar said. Shyam Lal Gola, president of All India Luxury Bus Union, said that around 2,500 private buses were dispatched to different cities and states on Monday. “A number of migrant workers had gathered at the depot at Anand Vihar, Kashmiri Gate, Mori Gate, etc on Monday and Tuesday. These people had apprehensions that the lockdown will extend and they will be trapped again,” Gola said. Gola said that the bus operators are also facing problems in operation. “The police and transport department officials stop the buses at different places for checking and claim there is no social distancing and issue challans. The luxury buses consume a lot of fuel and it is viable to offer this service only when all seats are full. But they want us to ply with half capacity. If we double the ticket charges, the people will not be able to pay. We request the government to facilitate people reaching home hassle-free,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/upsrtc-sends-110-buses-carrying-migrants-from-noida-101618944219200.html

On Tuesday, the district recorded 640 fresh cases with the overall tally at 31,597. Also, with 3,765 active cases, GB Nagar ranked eighth among Uttar Pradesh districts having the maximum number of infections.The district administration and development authority have been taking measures to curb the spread of the coronavirus, said the officials. Narendra Bhooshan, nodal officer and Greater Noida authority CEO, said that the administration is adding beds in the hospitals, and making arrangements for oxygen colliders. “We have an integrated helpline number: 18004192211, which guides people about home isolation, availability of beds in hospitals, ambulance facilities, Covid-19 tests, police related enquiries, etc. The number of cases has increased in Gautam Budh Nagar, and other districts in Uttar Pradesh.

They should call the helpline number, which will guide them about the treatment and medical care systematically,” Bhooshan said.He also said that 150 beds were added in the Government Institute of Medical Sciences (GIMS), and 320 beds in Sharda Hospital. Now, there are 400 beds in GIMS, and 720 in Sharda Hospital. Bhooshan said that people must maintain social distance and wear masks, which are two strong tools to break the Covid-19 chain.Meanwhile, the residents are troubled over the rise in Covid-19 cases with their housing complexes. We, here at Prateek Wisteria in Sector 77, are organising a five-day ‘mahamrityunjaya jaap’ as four persons died due to Covid-19 in the past two days, and several others are infected, said the residents.Nitesh Ranjan, general secretary, Apartment Owners Association (AOA), Prateek Wisteria, said that there are about 7,000 people in our housing complex. “The coronavirus wave has badly affected our society. There are 167 people suffering from Covid-19, and 100 of them are in home quarantine. Four residents succumbed to their infection on Saturday and Sunday,” he said, adding that one of the patients died in Delhi’s Safdarjung Hospital, an elderly woman in home isolation, and two others in a Gurugram hospital and a Noida hospital.He said that the association has decided to organise ’mahamrityunjaya jaap’ at the society’s amphitheatre for half an hour from Tuesday. “The prayers are played digitally through the loudspeakers.

However, the number of passengers heading to their hometowns was less on Tuesday. Officials of the UP State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) said that on Monday they despatched 1,187 buses with full occupancy while they despatched 797 another buses till evening on Tuesday. The officials estimated that they ferried about 60,000 passengers on Monday.The migrants have started to arrive at ISBT, Kaushambi, in large numbers after the six-day curfew was announced on Monday by the Delhi government. On Tuesday, they continued coming in groups throughout the day. “I work at a bakery in Paschim Vihar in Delhi and its owner asked us to leave as the shop was closed down due to restrictions. Remembering the ordeal we faced last year during the lockdown, we are heading home in Uttarakhand,” said Bhawani Dutt, a native of Champawat in Uttarakhand. Like him, Mithun Kumar Sah, who works at a computer shop in Delhi’s Gandhi Nagar, was also going to his hometown in Begusarai district of Bihar. “I could not leave Delhi on Monday as I was arranging for money from my employer. Now, I am going to Bihar. The lockdown is announced for six days, but people are not assured that it will not get extended,” he added. Last year when the large-scale migration of workers started in March, the UPSRTC had to close down the ISBT at Kaushambi and shifted operations to Lal Kuan due to overcrowding. This time, the workers said that bus operation was regular, and buses were available. The officials of UPSRTC said that the occupancy in their 52-seater buses was over 100% on Monday and it was about 85-90% on Tuesday. “The crowd was less in comparison to Monday and we despatched a total of 701 buses from Kaushambi, 67 from Anand Vihar and 29 from Kashmere Gate on Tuesday. On Monday, 974 were despatched from Kaushambi, 181 from Anand Vihar and 32 from Kashmere Gate. We still have about 250-300 buses to cater to them. The priority is to ferry them safely to their destinations,” said AK Singh, regional manager of UPSRTC.Not only from Delhi, but migrants also left Ghaziabad for their hometowns in UP. “We engage in work of plastering of ceiling and earn ₹600 per day. Ever since the weekend curfew was announced in UP, our work also stopped. Last year I had to borrow money by pledging a part of my land at home. My colleagues left yesterday and now four of us leaving today due to uncertainty over the lockdown,” said Mohit Kumar, a native of Basti district in UP who stays with his colleagues at a rented room in Vijay Nagar, Ghaziabad.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/migration-continues-from-isbt-in-kaushambi-101618944159080.html
21-04-2021||Noida||Noida: District hospital runs out of testing kits||Noida: The district hospital at Sector 30 on Tuesday ran out of Covid-19 testing kits and the sample collection was stopped at 10 am while usually it goes on till around 1pm. Several people at the hospital said that they had been coming to the government facility for the past three days only to get an RT-PCR or a rapid antigen test done. A visit by an HT team to the district hospital found that sees a huge footfall of the Covid-19 symptomatic patients found the ground situation quite grim. The patients, many symptomatic and with children, said that they were also asked to get a photocopy of a local address proof if their Aadhaar cards did not carry a local address. “This is the third time that we have come to the hospital just to get the testing done. Day before yesterday, they told us to come on Monday, yesterday they told us that we will have to bring a local address proof since Aadhaar card had an address of Nainital. Today, we brought a photocopy of cooking gas connection but the guard asked us to come tomorrow. We are helpless,” said Diksha Negi, a 35-year old woman, accompanied by her two children, who visited the hospital for third day from her home in Sector 26. Vineeta Kundru, who lives in Gaur City, had come to the hospital with her ailing mother-in-law and faced the same issue. “We had been told to bring a local address proof. We came around 10.30 am but were informed that the testing had been stopped. My mother-in-law is having difficulty in breathing,” said Kundru. “I had the soft copy of my house rent agreement in my cellphone. But by the time we came back with its photocopy, the testing was stopped. A health worker here said that they have run out of kits. It feels like they are simply trying to suppress the sampling. I would go to a private hospital now,” said Kartik Sharma, a Noida-based engineer. Meanwhile, a health officer, on the condition of anonymity, said that they are unable to take samples for Covid tests as the hospital has run out of testing kits. “The truth is that we have run out of the testing kits. We have to face the patients and sometimes angry crowds,” said a health officer at the Covid testing centre of the hospital. Dr Renu Agarwal, chief medical superintendent of the hospital, could not be reached despite several calls and text messages. Meanwhile, GB Nagar chief medical officer Dr Deepak Ohri denied that there is any dearth of testing kits. “There are enough kits and there is no shortage at all. We are also not asking for any local address proof from any patients approaching a government facility to get their Covid tests done,” said Ohri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/noida-district-hospital-runs-out-of-testing-kits-101618944038392.html
21-04-2021||Noida||Weekend lockdown in Ghaziabad, Noida||Ghaziabad and Noida will observe a weekend lockdown, from 8pm on Friday till 7am on Monday, starting this week, till further orders, state officials said on Tuesday.“During this period, there will be sanitisation and cleaning in different areas. Industrial units and essential supplies will continue and those travelling for examinations and for government work will be allowed upon the production of ID cards,” said Navneet Sehgal, UP’s additional chief secretary (information).On April 16, the state government issued directions for a shutdown from 8pm on Saturday to 7am on Monday.Suhas LY, district magistrate of Gautam Budh Nagar, said, “We will implement the directions and night curfew will also be in place as directed,” he said.Ghaziabad DM Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to calls seeking comment. Shailendra Kumar Singh, additional district magistrate (city), said, “The closure will help control spread of infection and will also help us bolster our resources in the mean time. We are ensuring that supply of oxygen and other facilities to patients on time.”Experts welcomed the move. “This will help curb the spread of the infection. However, enforcement is equally important. Poor enforcement on the ground will mean the impact of the weekend closure will be lost, and the spread of infection will continue. It was a must for places like Ghaziabad and Gautam Budh Nagar, where cases are on the rise,” said Dr Ashish Agarwal, president of the Indian Medical Association (Ghaziabad).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/weekend-curfew-in-noida-and-ghaziabad-101618943978350.html
21-04-2021||Noida||Amid surge in Covid-19 cases, GB Nagar gasps for oxygen, Remdesivir||NOIDA: Amid an alarming surge in the Covid-19 cases, the hospitals in Gautam Budh Nagar district are facing an acute shortage of oxygen cylinders. While the present requirement of oxygen in the district is 60 metric tonnes (MT) a day, the supply is less than 10 MT, officials said. Besides, the district is also facing a shortage of Remdesivir injections, which is used to treat Covid patients with moderate symptoms, the officials said. GB Nagar district magistrate Suhas LY admitted that as the demand of oxygen has gone up in the recent past, the hospitals are facing a severe crisis. “We are leaving no stone unturned to meet the rising demand of oxygen cylinders in our Covid-dedicated facilities. Though the factory of company -- Inox Air Products Limited -- that supplies oxygen to entire Delhi-NCR and western Uttar Pradesh is located in GB Nagar itself, it is unable to cater to the demand of oxygen in the district,” he said. “The state government has already ordered the factory to ensure uninterrupted oxygen supply to GB Nagar and other districts on top priority. The manufacturer has been asked to allow two working shifts in the unit, so that around 1,200 cylinders daily could be filled up, instead of present 700 cylinders in a single shift,” the DM said.Dr Shweta (who uses single name), in-charge of oxygen and medicines availability cell in the integrated Covid-19 control room in Sector 59, also said that the district has around 7 MT oxygen left against the present need of 60 MT.On Tuesday, GB Nagar recorded eight deaths due to Covid-19, which is the highest number of fatalities in a single day, according to the state’s daily health bulletin. With 640 new cases detected on Tuesday, the district now has 3,765 active cases.Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri said that with the present stock of oxygen and Remdesivir injections, it will be really hard to deal with the rising number of positive cases. “On Tuesday, as per the official records, there was not even a single dose of Remdesivir in our stock. Also, around 20% of positive patients require help with breathing. The demand for oxygen has gone up at least five times after the second wave. We have informed the drug department about this paucity,” he said.When contacted, Vaibhav Babbar, the district drug inspector, said that the scarcity of oxygen is mainly due to widening gap between supply and demand. “The demand for oxygen has risen exponentially. We have asked the oxygen manufacturer to stop the supply of industrial oxygen to the factories in the district. The overall production capacity of this factory is 34 tonnes per day, of which around 30 tonnes per day is being produced at present. The manufacturer has been told to make supply of medical oxygen to the hospitals in the state. We are also arranging supply of oxygen from Modinagar,” he said.Babbar further said that Remdesivir injections are also being supplied to the hospitals. “But the supply is very low. We are trying to procure more injections,” he said.Doctors at different Covid-dedicated hospitals said that the paucity of oxygen is badly affecting the treatment of patients. A doctor of Sharda hospital, preferring anonymity, said that the average daily demand of oxygen, which was 10,800 cubic metres from January to March 2021, has gone up to 19,000 cubic metres in April. If the situation persists, it will really be tough time for us,” he said. When contacted, the head of medical supply at Inox Air Products Limited, Akash Kumar, refused to divulge the details of oxygen supply to GB Nagar district. “We are very much busy in ensuring critical supply of oxygen to our clients,” he said.Meanwhile, distress calls from Covid patients looking for Remdesivir and Oxygen continue across GB Nagar. On Sunday, a sector 52 resident admitted to a private hospital in Greater Noida succumbed to the infection after his family could not find a dose of Remdesivir.“We had been posting on social media and calling up everyone we knew to get the patient Remdesivir which was prescribed by the doctors. However, there was no stock available anywhere. By evening, he passed away,” said Sachin Goyal, a relative of the patient and a resident of Sector 76.Residents are pulling all strings to arrange oxygen as well. Ashish Kapoor, a resident of Sector 30, was looking for an oxygen concentrator for his mother on Monday. “My mother is under home isolation, but on Sunday evening, her oxygen levels started dropping to about 85. After looking for it in Noida all Sunday, I ultimately had to go to Gurgaon to get the cylinder on Monday which was arranged by some contacts,” he said.Doctors say that there are no substitutes to Oxygen or Remdesivir for a Covid patient. “Remdesivir is only meant for moderate to severe hospitalised patients. On the other hand, if the patient has not been on oxygen ever in life (pre-Covid) and if they need oxygen for Covid management, they need to be admitted in hospital in appropriate level of care,” said Dr Mrinal Sircar, director (pulmonology & critical care), Fortis Hospital, Noida.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/amid-surge-in-covid-19-cases-gb-nagar-gasps-for-oxygen-remdesivir-101618943979086.html

On Tuesday the vaccination drive in Pune took a hit as the city did not have any Covishield doses. Only Covaxin doses, reserved for second doses, and those Covishield doses already with hospitals, were administered on Tuesday. A fresh stock of 35,000 doses of Covishield arrived on Tuesday evening. As of Monday night, the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) had no Covishield stock and fresh stock arrived only late on Tuesday and has been distributed to centres for Wednesday’s vaccination drive. At its Narayan peth vaccine store the PMC had only 9,000 doses of Covaxin on Monday, all reserved for second doses. On Tuesday noon, Dr Vaishali Jadhav, assistant health officer at PMC’s health department said, “We had no stock of Covishield available as of Tuesday afternoon, but there are about 8,000-9,000 doses of Covishield in the pipeline, which is already distributed at various centres. All will be used for first and second doses on Wednesday. Also, there are about 9,000-10,000 doses of Covaxin, all of which are currently reserved for second doses.”On an average, 49,642 people have got the vaccine in Pune in the past six days. Dr Devkar Suryakant, PMC’s officer in charge of the vaccination, said, “We got 35,000 doses of Covishield which will be enough for two days for both government and private hospitals. On Saturday and Sunday, we opened only 50% of the centres to give a day’s leave to the staff who have been working without a single day’s leave. We were expecting the stock to come last night (Monday) itself, but got it on Tuesday and it has already been distributed to the centres. Vaccination will carry on smoothly on Wednesday.” On Tuesday, many centres saw beneficiaries returning due to the restricted number of vaccines available. Aditya Gaikwad, a resident of Dhankawadi, said, “Many citizens were eager to get the vaccine, but due to restricted numbers, they had to return without getting the jab. Today, 125 people are to get the second dose of Covaxin at the Dhankawadi centre, of which 25 people came through registration and the others have tokens.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/35k-covishield-doses-arrive-in-city-but-shortages-affect-vaccination-drive-101618933537845.html

21-04-2021||Pune||Pune heros: Covid warriors back in the saddle ensuring service to those most in need||Many Covid warriors lost their lives during the first wave in 2020. Now, a harsher second wave has stuck in 2021, and Covid warriors are once again standing up bravely, and in numbers, to help the needy. People in Khadki still recall the work of Munir Ramdurg, a vice-president of the Ammunition Factory workers’ union, who died of Covid-19 in September 2020. He actively helped Covid patients find beds in hospitals and also helped cremate those who passed away. Same was the case with a 42-year-old traffic policeman from the Samarth Police Station, Rasta peth, who was known for his jolly nature and died in hospital in May 2020. He was on duty, before he tested positive for Covid. His name is being withheld to protect his family.Now, HT has come across people from different fields who, once again, are sparing the time, energy, effort and money, to ensure society survives the second Covid-19 wave.Food for thought When Aakanksha Sadekar saw a tweet of a person not getting food for dinner, as online food delivery is only allowed till 8pm. Sadekar decided to provide a free tiffin service for those in need.The initiative, which began on April 7 has seen Sadekar deliver 1,000 tiffins in Pune. Her tweet on April 5 reads: “If you are in and around Pune and a healthcare worker, doctor or a medical student living alone, happy to cook extra food and drop it off so that you can go about saving lives and not have to survive on crass thing like Maggie”. “My whole aim behind the initiative was to help people and one does not need to be a celebrity to do a good work. Any common person can do it and I hope more people come serve the society,” said Sadekar, a resident of Deccan Gymkhana. “I am connecting more people so If I am not able to reach the concerned person then other people can deliver the food,” said Sadekar. Free rickshaw ride for Covid patients If you are a resident of Kothrud, Bavdhan, Warje, or Karvenagar and don’t have transport to go to a hospital, call Jahangir Pathan on 888883298/8888343766.He will drop you at the hospital in his autorickshaw without charging a fare.The resident of Shastri nagar, Kothrud, has taken 41 Covid patients to hospital in this second wave. However, after he took a senior lady to Hinjewadi from Uttam nagar, doctors advised him home quarantine for eight days. “My reports came negative and the doctor told me to get home isolated because I came in direct contact with the lady. The lady is also doing good right now,” said Pathan, who is now getting support from corporators Shraddha Prabhune and Alpana Warpe, who provided him with PPE kits. “I have seen people running from such patients. Even their relatives do not come forward. I am doing it to serve the humanity as many people are struggling to get transport. My society people are very co-operative, as they don’t have any problem with my work,” added Pathan. Delivery of oxygen concentrators Sabir Shaikh is providing a free service delivering oxygen concentrators to people who are not getting beds in hospitals. The oxygen concentrator runs on electricity and is used to increase oxygen levels. he level of oxygen should not be below 85. “If the oxygen level is below 85 then the person needs hospitalisation. The machine is coming handy as many people are not getting beds. We provide machines for three days, so it gives support to the patient before s/he gets a bed in the hospital,” said Shaikh, who has brought 10 such machines and provided service to 50 people. “With people not getting beds, 135 more people are waiting for the machine,” said Shaikh. Free cab service for vaccination Senior citizens in Pune and Mumbai don’t have to bother about their transportation as Mahindra Logistics has started a free cab service to vaccination centres. Any citizen from Katraj, Kothrud, Bhosari, Pimple Saudgar or Kharadi needs to book the cab three hours in advance. Once the cab is booked the rest is taken care of by the company. “Last year we gave free rides to non-Covid patients who wanted to go for dialysis and pregnant women. We want people to remain stress-free during the crisis situation and we are trying to help all who are calling us,” said Dnyaneshwar Shirsht, control tower executive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/covid-warriors-back-in-the-saddle-ensuring-service-to-those-most-in-need-101618928977778.html
21-04-2021||Other||Chennai reintroduces Covid control measures||Volunteers carrying thermal scanners and noting temperature as part of door-to-door surveillance, young men on motorbikes running errands for Covid-19 patients under home isolation are back in Chennai as part of efforts to tackle the second Covid-19 wave.Greater Chennai Corporation (GCC) is re-implementing these measures that worked in containing the pandemic spread during the first wave last year as hospitals are running out of beds in the city, which has the highest caseload in Tamil Nadu. Last year, the measures were also implemented in other hotspots districts such as Madurai and Trichy.Workers have been roped in for door-to-door enumeration and for Home Quarantine and Isolation Monitoring System (HQIMS). They worked for a fee of ₹500 daily from June to January. “As cases were low, GCC stopped our work but contacted us again in April with a surge in cases,” said L Sivalingadurai, a volunteer.Also Read | 19 Odisha women rescued from TN garment factorySivalingadurai’s three friends have re-joined HQIMS, and he is thinking about following suit.Over 12,000 volunteers visit households every day across the city to check for symptoms like fever, cough, loss of smell, etc. If they find symptomatic individuals, they are referred to fever clinics, where doctors ascertain if they have an influenza-like illness and collect samples. If they test positive, they are sent to screening centres. Twelve such screening centres were opened last week, where medical teams decide whether to keep patients under home quarantine, shift them to Covid care centres or to hospitals depending on their symptoms.Since patients and their immediate family members under home quarantine cannot step out, FOCUS (Friend of Covid Person Under Surveillance) volunteers help them by buying groceries, medicines, and other essentials. “Besides helping them, this ensures that they also remain in quarantine,” said GCC’s deputy commissioner (health) Alby John. “We are repeating measures taken last year and the vaccination [drive] is [also] a shot in the arm for us as Chennai has vaccinated over 54% of the population above 45.”The civic body also restarted tele-counselling facilities with 100 lines last week for patients under home quarantine.Micro-containment of streets has also been reintroduced as 408 streets have six or more cases. “We have slightly changed the containment strategy wherein we are barricading a street if there are more than three cases..,” said John.Chennai has no shortage of hospital beds, but they are fast filling up. At GCC-run Covid care centres for people with mild symptoms, there were 11,645 beds available. Only 1,487 of them were occupied. In Covid-19 hospitals, 3,002 out of 4,368 beds were occupied, according to government data.Prabhdeep Kaur, deputy director, the National Institute of Epidemiology (Chennai), said the second wave is much more rapid as compared to the first in terms of the number of cases and the pace at which they are increasing. “[It] can overwhelm the health system and put pressure on healthcare workers. We need to add more beds and manpower and the public has to take this very seriously and go out for only essential work.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/chennai-reintroduces-covid-control-measures-101618922318162.html

The passengers said they were afraid of returning by foot, so they decided to return on the overcrowded bus.”Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced the six-day lockdown until April 26 citing a surge in Covid-19 infections. The Covid-19 cases have risen by close to 600% in the last two weeks and inundated hospitals and triggered a shortage in critical medical supplies in Delhi. He requested migrant workers to stay put as this was a small lockdown and promised to take care of them as part of efforts to avoid their mass exodus like during the nationwide lockdown last year.Also Read | Bikers killed after crashing into electric pole in PuneMigrant workers began pouring into interstate bus terminals and private bus depots around Anand Vihar and Ghazipur in Delhi and Kaushambi in Ghaziabad after Kejriwal made the announcement.Scores of migrant workers died in road accidents during the lockdown last year as tens of thousands of them walked and cycled home from big cities after losing their jobs until special buses and trains were arranged for them.Sanghi said the driver of the bus was allegedly intoxicated when the vehicle met with the accident at Jaurasi Ghati.“Police have registered a case and were making arrangement to send the passengers to their homes,” he added.The three passengers, who died in the accident, were identified as Mukesh Dhimar, 26, Matadin Ahirwar, 33, and Jitendra Ahirwar, 22.

21-04-2021||Delhi||2020 rerun? Migrant exodus begins, again||Soon after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day curfew in Delhi beginning 10pm on Monday, migrants began pouring into interstate bus terminals and private bus depots around Anand Vihar and Ghazipur in Delhi and Kaushambi in Ghaziabad, in scenes reminiscent of the mass exodus of people from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, who gathered in thousands at Anand Vihar after the Union government announced a lockdown in March 2020.However, there was no extra crowding at railway stations, and other interstate bus terminals such as Kashmere Gate, from where buses towards Punjab, Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh ply. Anand Vihar is the interstate bus terminal for most destinations in UP.While announcing the restrictions on Monday to arrest an unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases and fatalities that has overwhelmed health facilities in the Capital, Kejriwal said the decision to impose a lockdown was not an easy one for the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government as it hurts the poor and daily wage workers the most.“I appeal to people not to leave Delhi during the lockdown. We will take care of you. I am there to ensure it,” he said.Also read| Covid-19: What you need to know todayWithin hours of the announcement, however, crowds swelled at Anand Vihar, and across the road at Kaushambi. Crowds were also seen on the main road towards Ghazipur, from where several private buses head to UP and Bihar. There were snarls on both carriageways between Anand Vihar and the Ghazipur roundabout.“Our factories will shut due to this new lockdown. As Covid-19 cases are increasing rapidly in Delhi, and there is uncertainty about the number of days this curfew will continue for, it’s better for us to return to our family, rather than suffer here. I had returned to Delhi in September after last year’s lockdown,” said Mohammad Rashid from Lucknow, who works in a jeans-stitching factory in Seelampur.The foot-overbridge connecting Kaushambi and Anand Vihar bus terminal, railway and Metro stations, remained packed beyond capacity. Another foot-overbridge, near East Delhi Mall, was also packed.“There are nearly 8,000 migrants around Anand Vihar bus terminal who are waiting for buses to their home towns. The number is increasing. Our maximum deployment is in these areas to maintain law and order and facilitate migrants in every way possible. We are in touch with the transport department officials to arrange extra buses for these migrants,” said additional deputy commissioner of police (east) Sanjay Sehrawat.While a majority of the passengers reached the terminals in auto-rickshaws, men carrying luggage on their heads and shoulders, and women holding their babies in one arm and bags in the other, were seen walking on the pavements towards the bus terminals.The crowd was bigger at Kaushambi than at Anand Vihar. “We are witnessing an increase in passengers at our bus terminals for the last two-three days. The numbers started increasing from Monday morning. Some of them were migrants who were returning because of their experience last year,” said Punit Sethi, state manager of ISBT, Anand Vihar.Ajit Mishra, an agent working for multiple bus services between Delhi and Bihar, said the announcement was followed by a surge in demand for tickets.“There is a 20%-30% increase in demands already. Unlike earlier, when we would receive requests for one or two tickets at once, I am now getting requests for booking 10-15 seats at one go,” said Mishra.Sachidanand Sinha, a professor with the Centre for the Study of Regional Development at Jawaharlal Nehru’s School of Social Sciences, said the migrants were leaving again because of their “bitter experience” in 2020.“First, they were scared of the rising Covid-19 cases, and now because of the lockdown... It’s a grim situation because the migrants who are returning are potential carriers of Covid-19. They will infect others, and in this way, Delhi’s test positivity ratio of one positive case out of three samples may be witnessed across India,” said Sinha.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/lockdown-fears-trigger-mass-exodus-as-migrants-pour-into-anand-vihar-isbt-101618858352426.html
21-04-2021||World||Australia cancels belt and road deals; China warns of further damage to ties||Australia on Wednesday cancelled two deals struck by its state of Victoria with China on Beijing's flagship Belt and Road Initiative, prompting the Chinese embassy in Canberra to warn that already tense bilateral ties were bound to worsen.Under a new process in Australia, Foreign Minister Marise Payne has the power to review deals reached with other nations by the country's states and universities.Payne said she had decided to cancel four deals, including two that Victoria agreed with China, in 2018 and 2019, on cooperation with the Belt and Road Initiative, Chinese President Xi Jinping's signature trade and infrastructure scheme."I consider these four arrangements to be inconsistent with Australia's foreign policy or adverse to our foreign relations," she said in a statement.China's embassy in Australia voiced its "strong displeasure and resolute opposition" to the cancellations late on Wednesday."This is another unreasonable and provocative move taken by the Australian side against China," the embassy said in a statement. "It further shows that the Australian government has no sincerity in improving China-Australia relations."Bilateral ties were strained in 2018 when Australia became the first country to publicly ban Chinese tech giant Huawei from its 5G network. Relations worsened last year when Canberra called for an independent probe into the origins of the coronavirus outbreak.Australia's latest move "is bound to bring further damage to bilateral relations, and will only end up hurting itself," the Chinese embassy said.Australia's federal parliament granted the veto power over foreign deals by states in December amid the deepening diplomatic spat with China, which has imposed a series of trade sanctions on Australian exports ranging from wine to coal.Liberal Prime Minister Scott Morrison and his predecessor Malcolm Turnbull had declined to agree to a country-level MOU with China on the Belt and Road Initiative.But Victoria's Labor state premier Dan Andrews signed agreements with China's National Development and Reform Commission to promote the initiative in 2018 and 2019.Some countries fear the lending the Belt and Road scheme entails could lead to unsustainable debt levels in developing nations, including the Pacific islands region.Morrison's government has denied that its new veto power is aimed at China, Australia's largest trading partner and biggest source of overseas universities students before the pandemic led the country to close its borders.Payne said states, local governments and publicly funded universities had notified her of more than 1,000 foreign deals overall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-cancels-belt-and-road-deals-china-warns-of-further-damage-to-ties-101619018866588.html
21-04-2021||World||Thailand aims to boost vaccines by 50%; aims to reopen for tourists||Thailand aims to boost its vaccine order by more than 50% to 100 million doses this year in a bid to reach herd immunity, as surging local infections threaten to derail plans to reopen borders to tourism and reboot the economy.The government plans to buy 35 million more doses from two or three manufacturers with a target to administer them all by the end of 2021, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-Ocha said a day after chairing a meeting on the country’s new inoculation plan. The National Vaccine Institute is in talks with Pfizer Inc. for as many as 10 million doses, he said Tuesday.Thailand’s scaling up of vaccination efforts comes as Moody’s Investors Service cautioned that a new wave of Covid-19 cases threatens to further derail an economy that relies on tourism for about a fifth of gross domestic product. Infections have surged more than 60% so far this month, prompting at least two GDP downgrades, while fewer than 1% of Thais have received at least one of two vaccine doses.Read: Thailand’s Restrictions to Constrain Economic Recovery: Moody’s“The rollout has been too slow,” Kanit Sangsubhan, secretary general of the Eastern Economic Corridor Office, who attended Tuesday’s meeting with the prime minister, said in an interview.Thailand has so far relied on Sinovac Biotech Ltd.’s shots for its priority sector workers and people at least 60 years. It’s also ordered 61 million doses of AstraZeneca Plc jabs to be locally manufactured by Siam Bioscience Ltd. that will be delivered from June.Faster RolloutWith a resurgence, the focus should be to administer vaccines as fast as possible in order to reopen for tourists and foreign investors, said Kanit, who’s also a member of Bank of Thailand’s Monetary Policy Committee. “If we can’t contain the outbreak situation and can’t reach herd immunity, no one will come here.”Thailand has announced plans to reopen Phuket from July by waiving quarantine for vaccinated foreign tourists heading there. It’s using the resort island as a testing ground before expanding similar easing measures to other destinations such as Koh Samui.Phuket is on track to inoculate 70% of its adult population before July and the current outbreak is unlikely to delay the planned reopening, Bhummikitti Ruktaengam, president of the Phuket Tourist Association, said on Wednesday. The island will vaccinate 47% of its population by the end of May, similar to the current level in the Maldives, he said.Thailand’s central bank has said its 3% growth forecast for this year faces downward risks if its target of 3 million tourists isn’t reached. The nation’s tourism industry generated more than $60 billion in revenue from about 40 million foreign visitors in 2019.“The outbreak situation and vaccine rollout are two separate issues, and as long as we can reach the herd-immunity target, we can reopen,” said Bhummikitti, whose association represents about 300 members including luxury resort and five-star hotel operators in Phuket. “This is an unstoppable plan.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-aims-to-boost-vaccines-by-50-aims-to-reopen-for-tourists-101618997389524.html
21-04-2021||World||Japan PM Yoshihide Suga’s visit, 2+2 meet called off due to Covid-19 crisis||Japan Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga has cancelled a planned visit to India and the Philippines later this month because of the Covid-19 situation, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. A 2+2 meeting of the defence and foreign ministers of India and Japan, which was to be held in Tokyo later this week, has also been called off, the people said on condition of anonymity. Though both countries were keen on the visit going ahead, a decision was made to call off the trip following consultations on Tuesday because of the Covid-19 situation on both sides, the people said. India recorded more than 295,000 new infections on Wednesday – the biggest daily increase reported in any country – while Japan is grappling with a resurgence of infections. Neither India nor Japan had formally announced the visit, but Suga had been expected to travel to New Delhi in late April or early May to boost bilateral cooperation, especially in the Indo-Pacific, in the face of China’s growing aggression and assertiveness across the region. The visit would have set the stage for the first in-person meeting between Suga and Modi, who had developed a close relationship with former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Suga was expected to discuss cooperation in a wide range of areas, ranging from maritime security to development of resilient supply chains and joint projects in third countries, during the visit. India and Japan have also been working closely within the framework of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad, and Suga and his India counterpart Narendra Modi participated in the first leaders’ summit of the grouping last month. Japan is set to provide financing to ramp up the production of Covid-19 vaccines in India for distribution to developing countries in the Indo-Pacific. Japan, along with the US, has taken the lead in enhancing cooperation through the Quad, which also includes Australia, to ensure a rules-based order and freedom of navigation in the South and East China Sea. Japan has also backed India’s call for the restoration of the status quo on the Line of Actual Control amid the dragging military standoff with China. The cancellation of Suga’s visit follows British Prime Minister Boris Johnson calling off a trip to New Delhi on April 25. Modi has also cancelled a planned visit to Portugal next month for the India-European Union Summit. Johnson and Modi will hold a virtual meeting on April 26 and the India-EU Summit too will be held in a virtual format. There are no plans as of now for a virtual meeting between the Indian and Japanese premiers.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-pm-yoshihide-suga-s-visit-2-2-meet-called-off-due-to-covid-19-crisis-101619026544887.html
21-04-2021||World||White House aims to make it easier for people to get vaccinated against Covid-19||The White House is trying to overcome diminishing demand for Covid-19 shots by making it easier for Americans to get vaccinated even as the United States is set to meet President Joe Biden's goal of administering 200 million coronavirus doses in his first 100 days in office.With more than 50% of adults at least partially vaccinated and roughly 28 million vaccine doses being delivered each week, demand has eclipsed supply as the constraining factor to vaccinations in much of the country.Over the last week, the pace of inoculation in the US has slowed slightly. That is partly a reflection of disruptions from the “pause” in administration of the Johnson & Johnson shot for a safety review, but also of softening interest for vaccines in many places even as eligibility has been opened to all those older than 16.As the vaccination program progresses, the administration believes it will only get more difficult to sustain the current pace of about 3 million shots per day. Roughly 130 million Americans have yet to receive one dose.In a White House speech on Wednesday, Biden will discuss efforts to expand vaccine distribution and access in his first three months in office, and outline his administration's latest plans to motivate more Americans to get shots.Surveys have shown that vaccine hesitancy has declined since the rollout of the shots, but administration officials believe they have to make getting vaccinated easier and more appealing, particularly for younger Americans who are less at risk from the virus and do not feel the same urgency to get a shot. That means providing incentives and encouragement to get vaccinated, as well as reducing the friction surrounding the vaccination process.Biden is announcing the launch of a new tax credit for small businesses to provide paid leave for those getting vaccinated or potentially needing to take time off to recover from side effects. Paid for through the $1.9 trillion virus relief package passed last month, the tax change would provide a credit of up to $511 per day, per employee for businesses with fewer than 500 workers to ensure that those workers or businesses don't suffer a penalty by getting vaccinated.The White House is calling on larger employers, which have more resources, to provide the same benefits to their employees, and to institute vaccine education and encouragement campaigns so that their workers get shots.According to the White House, just 43% of working adults have received at least one shot.Through its partnership with more than 40,000 retail pharmacies, the White House says more than 90% of Americans now live within 5 miles of a vaccination site, and the administration is encouraging state and local efforts to bring vaccines directly to people, whether through initiatives reaching the homebound or clinics at large employment sites.Many states have also begun to open up vaccination sites to walk-in appointments, reducing reliance on often-cumbersome reservation systems.Maximizing the number of Americans vaccinated in the coming months is critical for the White House, which is aiming to restore a semblance of normalcy around the July Fourth holiday and even more so by the beginning of the next school year.Biden was not expected to set new public targets for vaccinations, and administration officials have been careful to avoid predicting when the country will have vaccinated enough people to reach herd immunity — when enough people become immune to a disease to make its spread unlikely. The US is on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult by the end of May and for every American by July, but administering the shots will be another matter.In recent weeks the White House has launched a massive outreach campaign to Americans to get vaccinated, relying on funding from the relief bill to launch ads and fund direct community engagement to under-vaccinated constituencies.Biden set his goal of 200 million shots last month after meeting his 100 million-in-100 days goal just over a month ago. At the time the US was well on pace to meet the higher target, and the pace of vaccinations has only accelerated, to about 3 million shots per day.The 100 million-dose goal was first announced on Dec. 8, days before the US had even one authorized vaccine for Covid-19, let alone the three that have now received emergency authorization. Still, it was generally seen within reach, if optimistic.By the time Biden was inaugurated on Jan. 20, the US had already administered 20 million shots at a rate of about 1 million per day, bringing complaints at the time that Biden’s goal was not ambitious enough. Biden quickly revised it upward to 150 million doses in his first 100 days.It was a deliberate effort by Biden to set clear — and achievable — metrics for success as part of a strategy of underpromising, then overdelivering. Aides believe that exceeding his goals breeds trust in government after the Trump administration’s sometimes fanciful rhetoric on the virus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/white-house-aims-to-make-it-easier-for-people-to-get-vaccinated-against-covid19-101619021320982.html
21-04-2021||World||US adds about 100 countries to its 'Do Not Travel' advisory list||The U.S. State Department has added about 100 countries this week to its "Level Four: Do Not Travel" advisory list, putting the United Kingdom, Canada, France, Mexico, Germany and others on the list, citing a "very high level of Covid-19."On Monday, the State Department said it would boost the number of countries receiving its highest advisory rating to about 80% of countries worldwide.Before Tuesday, the State Department listed 34 out of about 200 countries as "Do Not Travel." The State Department now lists about 131 countries at Level Four. The State Department declined to say when it would complete the updates.The State Department said Monday the move does not imply a reassessment of current health situations in some countries, but rather "reflects an adjustment in the State Department's Travel Advisory system to rely more on (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's) existing epidemiological assessments."Other countries in the "Do Not Travel" list include Finland, Egypt, Belgium, Turkey, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, Spain. Some countries like China and Japan remain at Level 3: Reconsider Travel."Most Americans already had been prevented from traveling to much of Europe because of Covid-19 restrictions. Washington has barred nearly all non-U.S. citizens who have recently been in most of Europe, China, Brazil, Iran and South Africa.On Tuesday, the United States extended by another 30 days restrictions barring non-essential travel at its Canadian and Mexican borders.Asked for comment on the travel advisory changes, Airlines for America, a trade group representing major U.S. carriers, said it continues "to urge the federal government to transparently establish the criteria – including clear metrics, benchmarks, and a timeline – for reopening international markets."Earlier this month, CDC said fully vaccinated people can safely travel within the United States at "low risk" but Director Rochelle Walensky discouraged Americans from doing so because of high coronavirus cases nationwide.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-adds-about-100-countries-to-its-do-not-travel-advisory-list-101619020611187.html
21-04-2021||World||Bangladesh seeks speedy delivery of vaccines from India amid domestic demand||The Bangladesh government has requested its Indian counterpart to expedite the delivery of about 500,000 doses of Covid-19 vaccines to ensure that the rollout of the immunisation programme in the neighbouring country isn’t affected, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday. The matter was raised by the Bangladesh high commission in New Delhi and authorities in Dhaka over the past few days against the backdrop of concerns among Bangladeshi authorities about the delay in supply of doses that were contracted from Serum Institute of India (SII), the people cited above said on condition of anonymity. There was no official response from Indian officials on the matter. The Indian side said recently that exports of Covid-19 vaccines will be rolled out in a phased manner and delivery schedules will be calibrated in sync with domestic requirements. However, concerns have grown in several countries that have signed commercial agreements with SII as India’s domestic vaccine needs have increased significantly following a massive spike in infections and the government’s plans to open up the vaccination drive to everyone above the age of 18 from May 1. The people said the Bangladeshi side was solely dependent on vaccine supplies from India after it opted not to procure Chinese-made doses despite offers from Beijing. Any prolonged delay in the delivery of doses by SII could hit the rollout of the vaccination drive in Bangladesh, the people said. Bangladeshi authorities are also looking at the possibility of acquiring the Sputnik V vaccine developed by Russia, the people added. India has so far supplied 3.3 million doses of Covishield as grants to Bangladesh, while the country received another seven million doses as commercial supplies. The supplies began in January and the last delivery – 100,000 doses provided as a grant – was made on April 2. Bangladesh signed a commercial contract with SII last year to buy 30 million doses, and under the terms of the deal, the country should receive five million doses a month between January and June. The Nepal government too is awaiting the delivery of a million doses of Covishield contracted from SII. Nepal foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali had raised the delay in delivery of the doses during a phone conversation with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on April 9. People familiar with developments in Kathmandu said there had been no word from the Indian side regarding the delivery of the shots.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-seeks-speedy-delivery-of-vaccines-from-india-amid-domestic-demand-101619021924134.html

He is serving a 2-1/2-year sentence on old embezzlement charges that he says were trumped up.Navalny returned to Russia in January after treatment in Germany for what German authorities say was poisoning in Russia with a banned nerve agent. The Kremlin denies any blame.The U.N. experts voiced alarm at his deteriorating health, saying: "We believe Mr. Navalny’s life is in serious danger.""We are deeply troubled that Mr. Navalny is being kept in conditions that could amount to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment in a facility that reportedly does not meet international standards," they added.They said that Navalny's current imprisonment and past attacks on him, including with Novichok, are "all part of a deliberate pattern of retaliation against him for his criticism of the Russian government and a gross violation of his human rights".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/his-life-at-risk-un-experts-urge-russia-to-allow-navalny-to-be-treated-abroad-101619020751845.html
21-04-2021||World||Republicans introduce bill to rename Ohio park after former US President Donald Trump||A GOP-backed bill introduced Monday would change the name of an Ohio state park to honor former President Donald Trump.The bill primarily sponsored by freshman state Rep. Mike Loychik to rename Mosquito Lake State Park to Donald J. Trump State Park is the latest attempt by Ohio Republicans to honor the former president.“This legislation is meant to honor the commitment and dedication that our 45th President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, bestowed upon the great people of Trumbull County,” Loychik wrote in an initial statement.He added, “This enthusiasm for our former president was also historic throughout the state of Ohio last November as he pushed for initiatives and policies that was very well-received with my constituency and the state."While Trump lost the 2020 presidential election, he won Ohio with more votes than any candidate in state history.The state park proposal is just the latest indication of Trump’s influence in politics over the GOP party in Ohio — whether in the measured approaches of it over establishment Republicans like Gov. Mike DeWine, who is expected to run for reelection next year, or in the many right-wing candidates vying for the party’s nomination for Sen. Rob Portman’s seat.In Trumbull County, where the Mosquito Lake State Park is located, Trump won nearly 55% of the vote in November.The state park is located in Cortland, Ohio, with more than 7,000 acres, and one of the largest lakes in the state. Loychik had initially announced his plans for the bill in mid-March, resulting in a wave of criticism from Democratic colleagues.“Ohioans’ are struggling with an addiction crisis, economic disruption, and a pandemic that the other guy said would disappear just like magic,” Democratic Rep. Rich Brown tweeted on March 12. “Instead of addressing these pressing issues, Ohio House Republicans are spending their time flattering the Insurrectionist in Chief.”The state would need $300,000 allocated to change the signs in the park, according to the bill language.A message seeking comment was left Tuesday with Loychik.Also in response to the bill, the state Department of Natural Resources defended the name of the park.“The name has withstood the test of time. Mosquito Creek Lake was formed by damming Mosquito Creek back in 1944,” the statement read. “Since then, Mosquito Lake State Park has become one of Ohio’s best state parks, best fishing lakes, and has one of Ohio’s most important wildlife refuges.”The first proposal introduced by Republican legislators in honor of Trump sought to declare his birthday, June 14, as Donald J. Trump Day in Ohio.While it is not uncommon for states to turn the birthdays of former presidents into paid holidays or days of significance, that designation is usually bestowed after death. More than 40 states, including Ohio, recognize Ronald Reagan Day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/republicans-introduce-bill-to-rename-ohio-park-after-former-us-president-donald-trump-101619020367896.html
21-04-2021||World||Biden pick Lisa Monaco wins Senate confirmation for no. 2 at DOJ||The Senate confirmed Lisa Monaco as deputy attorney general, the first action toward filling out Merrick Garland’s new leadership team for the Justice Department as it races to confront threats from domestic terrorism to potentially crippling cyber attacks.Monaco, who was confirmed Tuesday with strong bipartisan support on a vote of 98-2 brings a wealth of experience to the position, which oversees all of the department’s operations and its workforce of about 113,000, including 93 U.S. attorneys, as No. 2 to Attorney General Garland.Monaco, 53, spent 15 years in the Justice Department during the Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama administrations. In 2011 she became the first woman to lead the department’s national security division. In 2013, President Barack Obama selected her to serve as White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser.“Simply put, Lisa Monaco may be the most qualified individual ever nominated to serve as deputy attorney general,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, said during her confirmation hearing on March 9.Gupta ChallengedAlthough Monaco had a relatively easy confirmation process, other officials nominated by President Joe Biden to top department positions have encountered fierce opposition from Republicans.Most Republicans have said they are opposed to the nominations of Vanita Gupta to be associate attorney general -- the No. 3 leadership position -- and Kristin Clarke to head the civil rights division on grounds that they’re too liberal.Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer had to take the rare step of filing a discharge petition in order to bring Gupta’s nomination to the floor. A vote hasn’t yet been held on confirming her nomination.Monaco said during her confirmation hearing that her first priority once confirmed will be getting up to speed on the investigation into the Jan. 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol by extremist supporters of former President Donald Trump.“It will be my focus to immediately get briefed on that investigation, but more broadly to understand, what is it that brought us to this point where we could have such an attack that I personally never thought I would see in my lifetime?” Monaco said. “What is it that is mobilizing people to violence and can we deploy all of the tools and resources of the Department of Justice to make sure it never happens again?”The Justice Department and Federal Bureau of Investigation have warned about a heightened threat of attack from domestic violent extremists, and white supremacists in particular.“The Department of Justice is pouring its resources into stopping domestic violent extremists before they can attack, prosecuting those who do, and battling the spread of the kind of hate that leads to tragedies like the one we mark here today,” Garland said Monday at an event marking the 26th anniversary of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing.Monaco also will help coordinate the department’s investigations and responses to hacking attacks. The nation’s spy chiefs warned last week that the prospect of “destructive and disruptive” hacking attacks is increasing as countries deploy more aggressive cyber operations, including those that could temporarily disable critical computers in the U.S.While the deputy attorney general has traditionally been a relatively obscure position publicly, its importance was demonstrated during the Trump administration. Trump’s first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, recused himself from being involved in the FBI’s investigation into whether Trump or any of his associates conspired with Russia to interfere in the 2016 election.The recusal catapulted then-Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to national prominence -- and controversy -- as he took charge of overseeing the investigation. Rosenstein in turn appointed Special Counsel Robert Muellerto run the inquiry, which cast a shadow over Trump’s tenure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-pick-lisa-monaco-wins-senate-confirmation-for-no-2-at-doj-101619016007482.html
21-04-2021||World||Bad offshore weather delays SpaceX crew launch until Friday||SpaceX on Wednesday bumped its next astronaut launch by a day because of dangerously high waves and wind offshore.Liftoff is now scheduled an hour before sunrise Friday from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center, when better weather is expected.The SpaceX Dragon capsule has the ability to abort the launch all the way to orbit in case of an emergency. That’s why good weather is needed not only at the Florida launch site, but all the way up the East Coast and across the North Atlantic to Ireland.“Although the weather is probably going to look great here at the launch site, we're worried about those downrange winds and wave heights in case of an abort,” said Kennedy's director, Robert Cabana, a former astronaut.The four astronauts from the U.S., Japan and France will spend six months at the International Space Station.This will be SpaceX's third launch of astronauts for NASA in less than a year. NASA turned to private companies once the shuttle program ended to haul not only supplies to the space station, but also people. SpaceX began delivering cargo in 2012 and flew its first crew up last May.For the first time, astronauts will be flying in a recycled capsule atop a recycled Falcon rocket. The capsule, dubbed Endeavour after the retired space shuttle, was used for SpaceX's first crew flight. The rocket was used for the company's second crew flight last November.The four astronauts on that second Spacex flight will return to Earth next Wednesday, assuming Friday's launch occurs. Splashdown will occur in the Gulf of Mexico off the Tallahassee, Florida, coast.During an outdoor news conference near Kennedy's countdown clock, NASA's acting administrator, Steve Jurczyk, stressed the space station's importance in the agency's effort to return astronauts to the moon. The 260-mile-high (420-kilometer-high) station is also key for Earth observations, he noted.In Washington, the Senate held a confirmation hearing Wednesday for former U.S. senator Bill Nelson, nominated by President Joe Biden to serve as NASA's next administrator. While a Florida congressman, Nelson flew on space shuttle Columbia in January 1986, just a couple weeks before the Challenger launch disaster."There's a lot of excitement going on at NASA right now and you all have seen it,” Nelson told the Senate panel, citing Monday's debut flight of a small helicopter on Mars and the return of astronaut launches to Florida.Former space shuttle commander Pamela Melroy would serve as Nelson’s deputy.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bad-offshore-weather-delays-spacex-crew-launch-until-friday-101619017960356.html
21-04-2021||World||US Covid-19 vaccine plant for J&J to stay on hold after FDA Inspection||Production at an Emergent BioSolutions Inc. facility in Baltimore that’s expected to help make Johnson & Johnson’s coronavirus vaccine will remain on hold, U.S. regulators said, after an inspection turned up multiple problems.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said in a report posted on its website Wednesday that Emergent failed to thoroughly investigate unexplained discrepancies, including the cross-contamination of a vaccine substance batch with ingredients from another shot.Emergent’s facility lacked sufficient oversight and failed to document and thoroughly investigate discrepancies, the FDA report said. Additionally, conditions at the plant were unsanitary, the agency said.Output at the facility has been on hold amid the inspection, which began last week and concluded on Tuesday.Use of the J&J vaccine has been paused in the U.S. since last week as regulators probe reports that a small number of people suffered serious blood-clotting side effects after receiving the shot. The FDA said the Emergent report was unrelated to a safety review that the agency and the Centers and Disease Control and Prevention are conducting. An advisory panel is meeting Friday to weigh whether use of the vaccine should resume.The FDA said in a statement that already-manufactured vaccines will undergo additional testing and evaluation to ensure their quality before they are distributed. The agency said that no vaccine manufactured at the plant has been distributed for use in the U.S.In response to the findings, J&J said in a statement that it planned to set up a global supply network to produce its shots, and that it would ensure that the concerns raised by the FDA about the Emergent plant are addressed.Emergent spokesman Matt Hartwig said the FDA findings will give the manufacturer direction on steps needed to improve operations and strengthen the J&J vaccine supply chain.“While we are never satisfied to see shortcomings in our manufacturing facilities or process, they are correctable and we will take swift action to remedy them,” he said.Last month, Emergent staff conflated materials for the J&J vaccine with another from U.K. drugmaker AstraZeneca Plc that was also being made on the premises. The error led the site to discard 15 million doses worth of an ingredient used in the J&J vaccine. J&J said on April 3 it would boost oversight of the facility and bring in new leadership.“There is no assurance that other batches have not been subject to cross contamination,” the FDA inspectors wrote in their report.Shares of Emergent were down 0.4% at 11 a.m. in New York, while J&J shares declined 0.2%.Improper HandlingFDA inspectors found that containers where drug substance was stored weren’t handled properly to prevent cross contamination, including instances caught on security cameras where employees dragged unsealed bags of special medical waste from manufacturing areas to the warehouse.Cameras caught employees who removed outer protective garments and put them in open garbage containers in the warehouse where raw materials sat awaiting manufacturing, according to the FDA report.Inspectors also flagged improper gowning procedures when employees who had been in a processing area for one bulk drug substance entered rooms where other substances were being made.The FDA began an inspection at the Baltimore facility on April 12. Four days later, regulators requested that Emergent stop making new materials and quarantine existing materials until the inspection and any remediation are concluded.Inspectors observed peeling paint, paint flecks on the floor and walls, and brown residue on the wall.FDA inspectors determined the facility is too small to handle the waste being generated by its vaccine output. Security-camera footage showed Emergent’s warehouse overcrowded with materials awaiting manufacture and quality sampling.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-covid-19-vaccine-plant-for-j-j-to-stay-on-hold-after-fda-inspection-101619017970166.html

Opposition parties have accused the government of cronyism.The government denies the charge and a spokesman for Johnson said the prime minister had not broken any rules as he had informed officials about the exchange promptly."I make absolutely no apology at all ... for shifting heaven and earth and doing everything I possibly could ... to secure ventilators for the people of this country and to save lives," Johnson told parliament after being asked by the opposition Labour Party about the texts.The exchange of texts between Dyson and Johnson happened when the inventor tasked his engineers with making a ventilator to ease predicted shortages during the COVID-19 pandemic.Dyson had asked the finance ministry for no change in tax status for his staff coming to Britain to work on the emergency project.He also contacted Johnson directly, who replied: "I will fix it", the BBC reported on Wednesday.Dyson's company, which in 2019 announced it was moving its headquarters from Britain to Singapore, developed a ventilator in 30 days.However, in the end the machines were not needed in Britain, which had sufficient supplies.Dyson said in May his company, known for its vacuum cleaners and fans, spent around 20 million pounds ($28 million) on the project and it would not be accepting any public money.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-apology-boris-johnson-on-tax-assurance-to-secure-ventilators-for-covid-19-patients-101619013933691.html
21-04-2021||World||Search for missing Indonesian submarine finds oil spill||Indonesian rescuers searching for a submarine that went missing with 53 people on board found an oil spill on Wednesday near its dive location, authorities said.The 44-year-old submarine, KRI Nanggala-402, was conducting a torpedo drill in waters north of the island of Bali but failed to relay the results as expected, a navy spokesman said.An aerial search found an oil spill near the submarine's dive location and two navy vessels with sonar capability have been deployed to assist the hunt, Indonesia's Defense Ministry said.A ministry statement said requests for assistance had been sent and Australia, Singapore and India had responded.CNN Indonesia reported that Indonesian navy official Julius Widjojono said he suspected the submarine had descended to a depth of 600-700 metres."We are still searching in the waters of Bali, 60 miles (96 km) from Bali, (for) 53 people," military chief Hadi Tjahjanto told Reuters in a text message. He said contact with the vessel was lost at 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday.Representatives of the defence departments of Australia and Singapore did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The military chief will hold a media briefing to share further information about the search on Thursday from Bali, a spokesman said.Military analyst Soleman Ponto said it is too early to determine the fate of the submarine conclusively."We don't know yet whether the communication equipments were broken or the submarine has sunken. We have to wait for at least three days," he said.The 1,395-tonne KRI Nanggala-402 was built in Germany in 1977, according to the defense ministry, and joined Indonesian fleet in 1981. It underwent a two-year refit in South Korea that was completed in 2012.Indonesia in the past operated a fleet of 12 submarines purchased from the Soviet Union to patrol the waters of its sprawling archipelago.But now it has a fleet of only five including two German-built Type 209 submarines and three newer South Korean vessels.Indonesia has been seeking to modernise its defence capabilities but some of its equipment still in service is old and there have been deadly accidents in recent years.In 2016, an Indonesian air force transport plane crashed into a mountain, killing all 13 people board, during a training exercise in the remote region of Papua.In 2015, an Indonesian military transport plane crashed into a northern residential area two minutes after takeoff, killing more than 100 people.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/search-for-missing-indonesian-submarine-finds-oil-spill-101619014043788.html
21-04-2021||World||Police fire tear gas in protest against German Covid-19 measures||Police fired tear gas as thousands of people demonstrated in Berlin on Wednesday against a proposed amendment to give Angela Merkel's government power to impose tougher anti-coronavirus measures.With Germany buckling under a third wave of the virus, the amendment allowing for nationwide curbs like school closures and night-time curfews aims to end a political tug-of-war between the federal government and the 16 regional states over virus restrictions.Around 8,000 protesters gathered ahead of a vote on the law in the Bundestag lower house of parliament on Wednesday, with more than 2,000 police officers deployed to the scene.Protesters were carrying placards with slogans such as "Merkel & Co = high treason" and chanting "Wir sind das Volk" ("We are the people") -- a common refrain in the run-up to the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.Police started breaking up the demonstrations in the afternoon as protesters were not wearing masks or observing social distancing, a police spokeswoman said.Seven people were arrested, added police.Dubbed the "emergency brake", the law prescribes tough measures including sweeping shutdowns and overnight curfews in regions with incidence rates of more than 100 new infections per 100,000 people over the last seven days.It would also force schools to revert to virtual teaching in states where the incidence rate exceeds 165.Only one state had an incidence rate below 100 on Wednesday, while seven topped 165 -- including the two most populous of Bavaria and North Rhine-Westphalia.Fierce oppositionThe curfews would apply from 10:00 pm to 5:00 am in areas with high infection rates, with exceptions for lone walkers and joggers before midnight.The proposals have come under fierce opposition, particularly the plans for curfews in a country still scarred by memories of Nazi and communist dictatorships that spied on citizens and stole their freedoms.In a heated debate over the amendment, Christine Aschenberg-Dugnus of the pro-business FDP said the curfews were "not an appropriate measure" and the party would take legal action against them.If passed by the parliament, the law will go to a second vote in the upper house, or Bundesrat, on Thursday before being signed off by President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.Virus restrictions in Germany have so far been decided in consultations between Merkel and the leaders of the 16 states, with the regions ultimately responsible for implementing them.But in many cases, regional leaders have failed to put in place shutdown measures which they agreed with Merkel, with many choosing broad interpretations of the rules.Merkel warned in a rare TV interview in March that she would not stand by and watch infection rates continue to rise, threatening the regional leaders with a change in the law if they did not play ball.'Cry for help'Defending the plan for tougher rules in parliament on Friday, Merkel pointed out that other countries have imposed far more restrictive measures."The third wave of the pandemic has our country firmly in its grip," she said. "The intensive care doctors are sending out one cry for help after another. Who are we if we ignore these emergency calls?"Some German states, including Brandenburg, Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Baden-Wuerttemberg, have already sharpened their rules in anticipation of the new law.But critics say it does not go far enough, with doctors and scientists calling for a quick, hard lockdown to bring infections under control while the country's vaccination effort picks up pace."A standardisation of the rules is welcome, but they are not far-reaching enough," Thorsten Lehr, a professor of clinical pharmacy at Saarland University, told Der Spiegel.Social Democrat MP and epidemiologist Karl Lauterbach told Die Welt newspaper the watered down curfews would "extend the duration of the lockdown and, unfortunately, lead to unnecessary deaths".The Robert Koch Institute (RKI) health agency reported 24,884 new cases in the past 24 hours on Wednesday and 331 deaths, with a national incidence rate of 160.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/police-fire-tear-gas-in-protest-against-german-covid-19-measures-101619011279684.html
21-04-2021||World||Pakistan probes shooting of former prominent journalist critical of military||Pakistani police on Wednesday opened an investigation into the shooting and wounding of a former prominent journalist and head of the state media regulator, who has been a vocal critic of the military and its alleged meddling in politics.Absar Alam, who is in his 50s, was shot at by an unknown person in a park close to his home in Islamabad on Tuesday, police said in a statement.He headed the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA) for two years under former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who had fallen out with the military before he was sacked by a court on corruption charges, which he denies.Alam was shot in the ribs and was in hospital but out of danger, police said."I have not lost my spirit, and I will not lose my spirit," Alam said in a video message he recorded in a car on his way to hospital after the attack.Prime Minister Imran Khan's relations with the press and broadcasters have become increasingly strained since he took office after an election in 2018.Opponents say Khan secured office with the help of a crackdown on the media by the military, which has a history of involvement in Pakistani politics, including staging coups to oust civilian governments.The military denies meddling in politics or involvement in the shooting."We vehemently deny this. The military has nothing to do with this," the military's Inter Services Public Relations (ISPR) wing told Reuters.Activists say the crackdown on the media since 2018 has left 3,000 journalists and other media workers jobless.Alam alleged in a tweet over the weekend that the current chief of the military's ISI spy wing called him when he was PEMRA chief to reinstate live coverage by a local TV channel of an Islamist group. The Tehrik-e-Labaik Pakistan (TLP) had choked Islamabad in 2017 protests against cartoons published in France depicting the Prophet Mohammad.The TLP called an end to violent nationwide anti-France protests on Tuesday after the government called a parliamentary vote on whether to expel the French ambassador over the same issue.Amnesty International and the Community to Protect Journalists (CPJ) called on authorities to investigate the shooting and find those responsible.The shooting "highlights the dangerous climate that all members of the press face in Pakistan if they dare to criticize the country's powerful military", said Steven Butler, CPJ's Asia programme coordinator.Reporters Without Borders ranked Pakistan among the five deadliest countries for journalists in 2020, when four journalists were killed.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-probes-shooting-of-former-prominent-journalist-critical-of-military-101619010931220.html
21-04-2021||World||Bank of England sees potential risks from cloud data providers||The Bank of England might strengthen its controls on cloud data providers and other technology firms to counter possible risks to the stability of the financial system from the rise of fintech, Deputy Governor Dave Ramsden said.The Bank of England (BoE) has expressed concerns before about the reliance by financial firms, especially fintech startups, on third-party technology companies for key parts of their operations, and Ramsden said this scrutiny would intensify."We plan to analyse further whether we need even stronger tools to manage the risk that critical third parties, including potentially cloud and other major tech providers, may pose to the Bank's ... objectives," Ramsden told the Innovate Finance conference on Wednesday.Regulators globally have been tightening scrutiny of outsourced functions as they worry that core services financial firms provide to customers are vulnerable to outages at third parties.Britain's government is keen to promote fintech as an area of growth and hopes that nimbler regulation will enable it to steal a march over the European Union, where British financial firms now have reduced access due to Brexit.The BoE has said it will not water down regulatory standards, but does see scope for more streamlined regulation of smaller banks and in some areas of insurance.On Monday, finance minister Rishi Sunak asked the BoE to work with the finance ministry on whether the central bank should set up a digital version of sterling to compete with cryptocurrencies, which he dubbed 'Britcoin'.The government is also consulting over proposals to relax stock market listing rules due to a concern that Britain is less attractive than the United States as a listing venue, especially for tech companies whose founders want to keep an sizeable role.Ramsden said the BoE had taken a step to make life easier for smaller financial companies on Monday by giving firms more direct ways to access its high-value payments system, which is dominated by major banks and processing companies.Other steps included work standardising the identification of businesses involved in financial transactions, and looking at whether artificial intelligence could ease the burden of regulatory compliance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bank-of-england-sees-potential-risks-from-cloud-data-providers-101618997347736.html

Some members of the royal family are expected to be with her on Wednesday. Her birthday falls within the two-week royal mourning period for Philip that is being observed until Friday.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was one of many people who sent best wishes to the monarch.“I have always had the highest admiration for Her Majesty and her service to this country and the Commonwealth," Johnson said on Twitter. “I am proud to serve as her prime minister.”Philip, also known as the Duke of Edinburgh, died on April 9 at age 99. Family and friends gathered for his funeral at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor on Saturday to say their final farewells.His death came a few months before his 100th birthday, which was due to be the focus of royal celebrations this year, while the queen’s 95th was always set to be a more low-key event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/prince-philip-death-queen-elizabeth-expresses-thanks-for-support-and-kindness-101619005028618.html
21-04-2021||World||Syria loses voting rights at global chemical watchdog for poison gas use in civil war||Syria on Wednesday was stripped of its voting rights by member states at the global chemical weapons watchdog after its forces were found to have repeatedly used poison gas during the civil war.A majority of nations voting at the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) supported a decision to immediately revoke Syria's privileges at the agency.The proposal was initiated by 46 out of 193 member countries on the OPCW's governing Conference of States Parties, including Britain, France and the United States. It passed by 87 votes in favour to 15 against, meeting the required two-thirds majority of votes. There were 34 abstentions out of 136 countries taking part.Iran, Russia and Syria were among those to vote against.Although largely symbolic, the move sends a political signal to Syria that breaches of the 1997 Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits all use of chemicals on the battlefield, will not be accepted.It gave "a clear no against continued use and possession of chemical weapons," the representative of the Netherlands at the OPCW Tweeted.Repeated investigations by the United Nations and the OPCW's special Investigation and Identification Team (IIT) concluded that Syrian government forces used the nerve agent sarin and chlorine barrel bombs in attacks between 2015 and 2018 that investigators said killed or injured thousands.Syria and its military ally Russia have repeatedly denied using chemical weapons during the war, which has turned the once-technical agency into a flashpoint between rival political forces and deadlocked the U.N.

21-04-2021||World||Putin warns West of harsh response if it crosses Russia's 'red lines'||President Vladimir Putin warned the West on Wednesday not to cross Russia's "red lines", saying Moscow would respond swiftly and harshly to any provocations in a way that would force those behind them to regret their actions.Putin made his comments at a time when relations with the United States and Europe are under acute strain over Ukraine and the health of jailed opposition leader Alexei Navalny."We want good relations...and really don't want to burn bridges," Putin said in his annual state of the nation address to both houses of parliament."But if someone mistakes our good intentions for indifference or weakness and intends to burn down or even blow up these bridges, they should know that Russia's response will be asymmetrical, swift and harsh."Russia would determine where its red line lay in each specific case, he said.His comments came at the climax of a 78-minute speech dominated by Russia's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting economic hardship.Recent weeks have seen an intensification of confrontation between Russia and Western countries which say Moscow is massing tens of thousands of troops near Ukraine.ROLLING PROTESTSLast week, Washington tightened sanctions on Russia over accusations of computer hacking and election interference, and the Czech Republic accused Moscow of a role in explosions at an arms depot in 2014. Both expelled Russian diplomats. Russia denied wrongdoing and responded with tit-for-tat expulsions.Putin made no mention of Navalny, the jailed opposition politician three weeks into a hunger strike, whose supporters, even as Putin spoke, were beginning a series of rolling protests across the country.Two of Navalny's closest allies were arrested on Wednesday, their lawyers said. Lyubov Sobol, one of the faces of Navalny's popular YouTube channel, and Kira Yarmysh, his spokeswoman, were both detained in Moscow."As usual, they think that if they isolate the 'leaders', there won't be any protest," said Leonid Volkov, a close Navalny associate. "Of course that's wrong."Another Navalny aide, Ruslan Shaveddinov, tweeted: "Right now across the whole of Russia they are detaining potential protesters. This is repression. This cannot be accepted. We need to fight this darkness."Navalny, Russia's leading opposition politician, is gravely ill in prison following his decision to launch a hunger strike in protest against what he calls inadequate medical treatment for leg and back pain. His team have urged people across the vast country to take to the streets on Wednesday.The government has said the planned gatherings are illegal. Previous pro-Navalny rallies have been dispersed by force, with thousands of arrests.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-to-respond-harshly-quickly-to-foreign-provocations-says-putin-101619003209223.html

He said that contact with the vessel was lost at 4:30 a.m. on Wednesday.Representatives of the defence departments of Australia and Singapore did not immediately respond to requests for comment.The 1,395-tonne KRI Nanggala-402 was built in Germany in 1978, according to the Indonesian cabinet secretariat's website, and underwent a two-year refit in South Korea that was completed in 2012.Indonesia in the past operated a fleet of 12 submarines purchased from the Soviet Union to patrol the waters of its sprawling archipelago.But now it has a fleet of only five including two German-built Type 209 submarines and three newer South Korean vessels.Indonesia has been seeking to upgrade its defence capabilities but some of its equipment still in service is old and there have been deadly accidents involving in particular ageing military transport planes in recent years.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-submarine-with-53-crew-aboard-missing-seeks-australia-singapore-help-101619002012009.html
21-04-2021||World||Xi, Modi among 40 leaders at Biden-led climate summit starting on Thursday||China’s President Xi Jinping will attend a US-led climate summit on Thursday, boosting hopes of cooperation between the world’s two largest greenhouse gas emitters even as they bicker over a host of diplomatic, trade and human rights issues.Xi is among 40 world leaders, including Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Russian President Vladimir Putin, invited by US President Joe Biden to attend the two-day virtual event.Xi’s confirmation comes days after John Kerry, US special envoy on climate change, held talks with his Chinese counterpart, Xie Zhenhua, in Shanghai. Xi, at the invitation of the US, will attend the summit via video and will deliver an “important” speech, said Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, Wang Wenbin, on Wednesday.It will be the first appearance of Xi and Biden in the same event after the latter became US president in January. The announcement of Xi’s attendance was made a day after he made veiled references to the US-led West in a speech delivered virtually at an economic forum, rejecting what he called hegemonic powers in global governance and saying there should be no “bossing” and “meddling” in other countries.Xi’s critical tone was a continuation from Alaska last month where a high-level meeting of diplomats from the two countries – the first such meeting since Biden took over -- was marked with rancour and retorts.But the two countries have discovered a patch of common ground on tackling the climate crisis.Last week in Shanghai, Kerry and Xie agreed on concrete actions “in the 2020s” to reduce emissions.The talks also marked a resumption of dialogue on climate halted during the Donald Trump administration, who had withdrawn the US from the Paris Agreement. Later, Biden put America back into the accord.“Moving forward, China and the US are firmly committed to working together and with other parties to strengthen implementation of the Paris Agreement,” a joint statement issued after the Xie-Kerry talks had said.“The Leaders’ Summit on Climate will underscore the urgency – and the economic benefits – of stronger climate action. It will be a key milestone on the road to the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP26) this November in Glasgow,” a statement from the White House had said earlier.On Wednesday, Wang said, “China expects that this summit will provide a platform for global cooperation to address climate change challenges, promote the full and effective implementation of the Paris Agreement, and provide a useful platform for exchanges and cooperation to jointly promote global climate and environmental governance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-modi-among-40-leaders-at-biden-led-climate-summit-starting-on-thursday-101619002003141.html
21-04-2021||World||Thailand will get 35 million more Covid-19 vaccine doses: PM amid criticism of slow rollout||Thailand is trying to secure 35 million more doses of Covid-19 vaccines from two or three companies this year on top of existing orders of around 65 million doses, Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Wednesday.The government push comes amid growing public frustration about the slow vaccine rollout, with only 604,947 people inoculated so far, less than 1% of its population.Of the new shots sought, the private sector will help source 10 to 15 million doses, Prayuth said in a Facebook post."I have ordered that we distribute and administer all the vaccines that we can find by December," he added.Prayuth did not name the brands, nor specify whether the 35 million included the five to 10 million doses of Pfizer and BioNTech's vaccine that he announced were being sought on Tuesday.After early success in containing Covid-19, Thailand is fighting a new wave that includes the highly transmissible B.1.1.7 variant.The new outbreak has accounted for more than a third of Thailand's 46,643 cases, of which 110 were fatalities. It reported 1,458 new infections and two deaths on Wednesday.Its mass vaccination plan has been centred on 61 million doses of locally-made AstraZeneca vaccine, the first batches scheduled for June.For initial inoculations, Thailand has received 2 million doses of Sinovac Biotech's vaccine and has ordered a further 1.5 million doses, with 500,000 to arrive on Saturday and the rest next month. It has also imported 117,000 doses of AstraZeneca's vaccine.The private sector, which had been for months seeking permission to import vaccines, welcomed its inclusion."This is the race. We have to be fast and have volume, but we haven't had any other vaccines," Chalerm Harnphanich, president of the Private Hospital Association, told Reuters.Health experts also questioned the government's decision not to use the COVAX international vaccine-sharing facility, which has provided vaccines to 100 countries including the Philippines, Vietnam and South Korea."We missed an opportunity by not joining COVAX," said Thiravat Hemachudha, head of the Thai Red Cross Emerging Infectious Diseases Centre.The government has argued joining COVAX risked higher costs and uncertain delivery times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/thailand-will-get-35-mn-more-vaccine-doses-pm-amid-criticism-of-slow-rollout-101619000955425.html
21-04-2021||World||'No sympathy' for Chauvin, say those who had run-ins before Floyd||For some of those who encountered Derek Chauvin's policing or witnessed his use of force as an officer there is no sympathy for the man convicted of killing George Floyd.Chauvin was the subject of at least 17 complaints during his career, according to police records, but only one led to discipline. Prosecutors sought permission to introduce eight prior use-of-force incidents, but the judge would only allow two. In the end the jury heard none.Eric Nelson, Chauvin's lawyer, has defended his client's use of force as appropriate in potentially dangerous situations."I don't have no sympathy for him. I think he got what he deserved," Julian Hernandez, 38, a carpenter now working in Pennsylvania, told Reuters.Hernandez said he never heard anything from the Minneapolis police after submitting a complaint about Chauvin, who he said "choked him out" during an encounter in a Minneapolis night club in 2015. A spokesman for the Minneapolis Police Department declined to comment.According to Chauvin's police report, Hernandez failed to follow orders and resisted arrest when Chauvin, who was working as an off-duty security guard, tried to escort him out of a night club. Chauvin's report said this prompted him to apply "pressure toward his Lingual Artery" to subdue Hernandez.Hernandez said Chauvin picked him out of the crowd for no reason and quickly escalated to violence. He said Chauvin should have been removed from the police force.As Monroe Skinaway, 75, took in news of Chauvin's conviction, he flashed back to the night he witnessed Chauvin pin another man to the pavement with the same detached look as when he knelt on Floyd's neck.It was March 2019, 15 months before Floyd's death would spark global protests against racism and police brutality.But Skinaway still remembers what he deemed the indifference on Chauvin's face that night as he pressed Sir Rilee Peet's head into a puddle deep enough that he, like Floyd, struggled to breathe.A jury on Tuesday found Chauvin, a 19-year veteran of the Minneapolis police force, guilty of all three charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter, an outcome welcomed by activists as progress in holding law enforcement accountable for its treatment of Black Americans. Chauvin is white and Floyd was Black."We people of color very seldom get a good verdict," said Skinaway, who is Native American. "I'm kind of amazed."'I CAN'T BREATHE, MAN'Skinaway says he did not know Chauvin at the time he and another officer arrested Sir Rilee Peet, a young Native American man with a history of mental illness. But Skinaway later recognized him as the officer charged in Floyd's death.Skinaway says he was speaking with the officers about the recovery of a stolen car when Peet approached and did not comply with requests to back away. A police report about the incident states that a struggle ensued and Chauvin maced Peet, applied a neck restraint and pinned him to the ground so he could be handcuffed.The incident was one of the six prior use-of-force incidents that Judge Peter Cahill blocked prosecutors from presenting at trial, ruling they would be prejudicial.In court filings, prosecutors said Chauvin restrained Peet in a manner that was beyond what was necessary or reasonable - an assertion also made by Skinaway in interviews with Reuters.Skinaway says Chauvin grabbed Peet by the back of his hair and pressed his face into a rain puddle. That began a cycle where Peet would gasp for air and say "I can't breathe, man" before Chauvin would force his head down again.Skinaway said he saw similarities between Chauvin's treatment of Peet and Floyd."He basically did the same thing to that Native kid," Skinaway said. "I think the incident would have gone longer possibly if the ambulance didn't show up."Peet, who was arrested for disorderly conduct and obstruction of the legal process, could not be reached for comment. Earlier this year Peet told the Marshall Project he did not recall the incident. It was not clear what happened to the charges against him.Jimmy Bostic, who ended up in the hospital after a scuffle with Chauvin and other officers in April 2016, said he was "ecstatic" when he heard the verdict, seeing it as a sign that police officers, too, could be held accountable.According to a police report, Bostic was refusing to leave a store and threatening to spit on its owner. As the situation escalated, Chauvin wrote in the report that he "closed distance with" Bostic and "secured his neck/head area with my hands."Bostic, who is currently in prison on an unrelated burglary conviction, said he struggled to breathe after the encounter and was taken to the hospital due to an asthma attack."George Floyd could have very well been Jimmy Bostic Jr," the 23-year-old said in an interview after the verdict. "I'm just happy that there was an example set today."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/no-sympathy-for-chauvin-say-those-who-had-run-ins-before-floyd-101619000573990.html
21-04-2021||World||With enough supplies, Israel looks to re-route AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine delivery||Israel no longer wants AstraZeneca's Covid-19 vaccine and is exploring with the company whether a big shipment in the pipeline could be sent elsewhere, Israel's pandemic coordinator said on Wednesday."We are trying to find the best solution. After all, we don't want (the vaccines) to get here and have to throw them into the trash," the official, Nachman Ash, told Army Radio, saying Israel's needs were being met by other suppliers.In his remarks, Ash made no reference to AstraZeneca’s vaccine having been associated with very rare blood clots in Europe. Many countries there resumed administering it after the European Union's drug watchdog said benefits outweighed risks.Israel cast a wide net last year when trying to secure vaccine doses at the height of the pandemic and pre-ordered from a number of companies.It largely settled on the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine, launching one of the world's swiftest rollouts. Covid-19 infections in Israel have dropped dramatically and the economy has reopened.Israel is also buying the Covid-19 vaccines from Moderna, which uses a similar messenger RNA (mRNA) technology.Ash said that with supplies secure through 2022, Israel no longer required the 10 million doses it agreed to purchase from AstraZeneca."They can certainly be used in other places in the world. At the moment, we are trying to find, along with the company, the best way to do this," he said."We believe it would be best if they (the vaccines) did not come to Israel and we agree with the company on some sort of way to divert them elsewhere."Officials at AstraZeneca had no immediate comment.Around 81% of Israeli citizens or residents over 16 - the age group eligible for the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine in Israel - have received both doses.Some 167,000 of the 5.2 million Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and Islamist Hamas-run Gaza have had at least one dose of vaccine, with supplies coming in from Israel, Russia, the United Arab Emirates, the global COVAX vaccine-sharing programme and China.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/with-enough-supplies-israel-looks-to-re-route-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-delivery-101619000316613.html
21-04-2021||World||Russia detains top aides of jailed Kremlin critic Nalanvy ahead of protests||Two close associates of Alexei Navalny were detained Wednesday ahead of protests planned to support the imprisoned Russian opposition leader, who has been on a hunger strike since March 31.Navalny's team called Sunday for nationwide protests after reports about the politician's health deteriorating in prison. Russian authorities have stressed that the demonstrations were not authorized and warned against participating in them.Vladimir Voronin, a lawyer for top Navalny ally Lyubov Sobol , said on Twitter that people “in uniform” removed Sobol from a taxi near a Moscow metro station on Wednesday morning and took her to a police precinct.Police also detained Navalny spokeswoman Kira Yarmysh, who is currently under house arrest on charges related to January protests in support of the politician. Yarmysh was detained near the entrance of her apartment building when she went out during the one hour she is allowed to leave, her lawyer, Veronika Polyakova, said on Twitter.Navalny was arrested in January upon his return from Germany, where he had spent five months recovering from a nerve agent poisoning he blames on the Kremlin. Russian officials have rejected the accusation. His arrest for an alleged violation of a suspended sentence from a 2014 embezzlement conviction triggered protests that represented the biggest show of defiance in Russia in recent years.Soon after, a court ordered Navalny to serve 2 1/2 years in prison for the embezzlement conviction, which the European Court of Human Rights deemed to be “arbitrary and manifestly unreasonable.”Navalny began the hunger strike to protest prison officials' refusal to let his doctors visit when he began experiencing severe back pain and a loss of feeling in his legs. The penitentiary service has said Navalny was getting all the medical help he needs.Navalny’s physician, Dr. Yaroslav Ashikhmin, said Saturday that test results he received from Navalny’s family showed sharply elevated levels of potassium, which can bring on cardiac arrest, and heightened creatinine levels that indicate impaired kidneys.“Our patient could die at any moment,” he said in a Facebook post.On Sunday, the politician was transferred to a hospital in another prison and given a glucose drip. Prison officials rebuffed attempts by his doctors to visit him there.In response to the news about Navalny’s health, his team called for more nationwide protests on Wednesday, the same day that Russian President Vladimir Putin is scheduled to deliver his annual state of the nation address.According to a website dedicated to the protests, demonstrations were being planned in 165 Russian cities as of Wednesday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-detains-top-aides-of-jailed-kremlin-critic-nalanvy-ahead-of-protests-101618995083029.html
21-04-2021||World||Europe clinches deal on wide-ranging climate law to speed emissions cuts||The European Union clinched a deal in the early hours of Wednesday on a landmark climate change law that puts new, tougher greenhouse gas emissions targets at the heart of all EU policymaking.The deal arrives just in time for a summit of world leaders hosted by the US government on Thursday and Friday, where the EU and other global powers will promote their pledges to protect the planet.The European climate law will guide the bloc's regulations in the coming decades. It includes a target to reduce net emissions at least 55% by the end of the decade from 1990 levels - lower than the 60% goal sought by the European Parliament - to steer it towards reaching zero net emissions by 2050.If adopted globally, the net zero by 2050 pathway would limit global temperature increases to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.After months of wrangling and a full night of negotiations from Tuesday, negotiators representing the European Parliament and the 27 EU governments finished the law. The deal still needs formal approval from parliament and national governments."This is a landmark moment for the EU," the bloc's climate policy chief Frans Timmermans said in a statement. "Today's agreement also reinforces our global position as a leader in tackling the climate crisis."A handful of countries, including Britain and New Zealand, have enshrined net zero emissions goals into law, but the 27-country EU is the biggest emitter to do so.The target to cut EU-wide net emissions at least 55% by 2030, from 1990 levels, replaces a previous goal of a cut of at least 40%. By 2019, EU emissions were already 24% lower than in 1990.EU lawmakers had wanted to go further to 60% by 2030. Green campaigners said the cut should be 65%."I'm satisfied today," said Swedish Social Democrat Jytte Guteland, the European Parliament's lead negotiator. "The most important thing was to make sure that science would be more integrated in the EU law."Green EU lawmaker Michael Bloss said Brussels had sacrificed ambition to rush through a deal in time for the US summit.The 2030 target sets the stage for a major package of EU regulations due in June to cut emissions, including proposals to revamp the EU carbon market, tougher CO2 standards for cars, and a border tariff to impose CO2 costs on imports of polluting goods.Negotiators agreed to limit the amount of emissions removals that can be counted towards the 2030 target, to 225 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent.That aims to ensure the goal is met by cutting emissions from polluting sectors, rather than relying on removing CO2 from the atmosphere through carbon-absorbing forests.The law requires Brussels to create an independent body of scientific experts to advise on climate policies, plus a greenhouse gas budget laying out the total emissions the EU can produce from 2030-2050, without thwarting its climate goals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-clinches-deal-on-wide-ranging-climate-law-to-speed-emissions-cuts-101618998128787.html
21-04-2021||World||Covid-19: China says it has vaccinated 200 million citizens||Around 200 million Chinese, or 14.29% of the population, have been vaccinated for COVID-19 so far, with an emphasis on front-line workers, university students and people living in border areas, a health official said Wednesday.China is ramping up vaccination efforts after a slow start, prompted in part by the virtual elimination of domestic transmission. Just two local cases were reported on Wednesday, both in the city of Ruili, which borders on Myanmar.Center of Disease Control official Cui Gang told a news conference that key areas and members of the population were being prioritized for vaccines. China has approved five domestically produced vaccines and exported millions of doses, although some scientists believe they provide less protection that those by Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca.The Chinese vaccines have an efficacy range of 50.7% to 79.3%, based on company data, lower than their foreign peers but still effective.China is now giving millions of shots a day and a top government doctor, Zhong Nanshan, has announced a goal of vaccinating 560 million of the country’s 1.4 billion people by mid-June.China locked down the city of Wuhan for more than two months starting in January 2020 after the coronavirus was first detected in late 2019. Wuhan became known as the epicenter of the pandemic, although Beijing has suggested the virus might have been circulating earlier and possibly brought to China from abroad.Since then, China has controlled the virus through stringent border controls and quick lockdowns whenever new outbreaks crop up. Mask wearing indoors remains almost universal and health tracing applications must be shown at most shops, offices and public buildings.While China was the first major economy to throw off the effects of the virus, the restrictions are seen as limiting its further growth, particularly as Beijing readies to welcome tens of thousands of visitors as host of the Winter Olympics in February 2022.Along with the sheer scale of the vaccination effort, authorities need to convince a population that largely no longer feels threatened by infection.“At present, vaccination efforts in key areas and key population groups are progressing smoothly overall," Cui told reporters at Wednesday's briefing. Already, 80% of workers in the health sector have received the jab, Cui said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-china-says-it-has-vaccinated-200-million-citizens-101618998428690.html

He said the quick development of three coronavirus vaccines underlined Russia's technological and industrial potential.The Russian leader has urged authorities to quicken the pace of the country's vaccination program, which has been slow compared to the West.He promised new measures to encourage births and to increase average life expectancy, acknowledged that the pandemic has exacerbated demographic trends in Russia.Putin proposed new incentives to help the economy overcome the blow from the pandemic and new social payments to the population.Allies of imprisoned opposition leader Alexei Navalny called for nationwide protests across Russia on Wednesday to support him. Navalny started a prison hunger strike three weeks ago to protest what he says is inadequate medical treatment for his back pains and officials' refusal to allow a visit by his doctor. His deteriorating condition has caused international outrage.Navalny's imprisonment and his health condition have fueled tensions with the West, already strained over Moscow's interference with elections, hacking attacks and, most recently, a massive Russian military buildup near the border with Ukraine.The Kremlin has rejected Western concerns about the troop concentration, saying it's free to deploy the military wherever it's deemed necessary on the Russian territory.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-lauds-russia-s-vaccine-work-predict-herd-immunity-by-autumn-101618997821964.html
21-04-2021||World||Mourning Queen Elizabeth marks low-key 95th birthday||Britain’s Queen Elizabeth II is marking a low-key 95th birthday on Wednesday, days after husband Prince Philip’s funeral on Saturday.While the national mourning period in memory of the Duke of Edinburgh officially concluded on Sunday, the monarch remains in mourning until Friday and there is unlikely to be any of the usual birthday markers such as the release of an official photograph by Buckingham Palace.The Queen is expected to spend the day privately at Windsor Castle, where she will be joined by some close members of the royal family.“I would like to send my warm wishes to Her Majesty The Queen on her 95th birthday,” UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said in a Twitter statement.“I have always had the highest admiration for Her Majesty and her service to this country and the Commonwealth. I am proud to serve as her Prime Minister,” he said.Prince Philip, the longest-serving consort to a British monarch, died on April 9, just under two months away from his 100th birthday, which was due to be the focus of royal celebrations this year – with the Queen's 95th already set to be a lower key affair.The coronavirus pandemic situation meant that the annual Trooping the Colour ceremony to celebrate the Queen’s official birthday in early June had also been called off by Buckingham Palace back in March.Thousands of well-wishers usually fill central London to watch the Queen and members of the royal family for the event, which stems from the traditional preparations for battle, when colours (or flags) were carried ("trooped") down the rank to be seen and recognised by the soldiers.The full ceremony traditionally takes place at Horse Guards Parade in London and involves more than 1,400 soldiers and 200 horses. The event attracts thousands of spectators – largely friends and family of the soldiers taking part in the military spectacle.The royal family gathers on the Buckingham Palace balcony to acknowledge the crowds in The Mall leading up to the palace. However, the event has now been cancelled for the second year running and the palace said that options for a smaller parade in the quadrangle at Windsor Castle are being considered instead, like last year.The Queen's close family are thought to be with her at Windsor along with around 20 staff, dubbed “HMS Bubble” alluding to the lockdown. The monarch has spent the bulk of the lockdown since last year at her Berkshire castle, along with Prince Philip – who passed away peacefully in his apartment.The Queen became the world's oldest monarch in 2015 and will be marking the platinum jubilee of her 70-year reign in June 2022.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mourning-queen-elizabeth-marks-low-key-95th-birthday-101618997887593.html
21-04-2021||World||US-backed Afghan peace talks in Turkey postponed after Taliban no-show||An upcoming international peace conference that was meant to move Afghanistan's warring sides to a power-sharing deal and ensure an orderly U.S. exit from the country has been postponed, its sponsors announced Wednesday, citing a lack of prospects for meaningful progress. The decision came several days after Taliban insurgents, who are key to peace efforts, dismissed the U.S.-promoted conference in Istanbul as a political spectacle serving American interests.No new date was given for the conference, which was to have started Saturday under the sponsorship of the United Nations, Turkey and Qatar. Turkey's foreign minister said the conference was delayed until after the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan which ends in mid-May.The delay underscored the difficulties the Biden administration and NATO are facing in orchestrating an orderly exit from conflict-scarred Afghanistan. Both have said they would begin withdrawing their remaining troops — a total of close to 13,000 — from the country on May 1 and complete the pullout by Sept. 11, no matter what.Just hours before the announcement of the postponement, a suicide bomber attacked a convoy of Afghan security personnel, wounding seven people in the capital of Kabul. The interior ministry said civilians and security personnel were among the wounded.The attack was the first in weeks in the capital, even as targeted killings have escalated and Afghanistan’s security personnel have come under relentless attacks by Taliban insurgents. Recent months have also seen an increase in government bombing raids on suspected Taliban positions and increased raids by Afghan special forces.Residents fear the attack could be a harbinger of what’s to come as foreign troops prepare to begin their final withdrawal from Afghanistan. No one took immediate responsibility for the attack.Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said the conference was postponed because of “lack of clarity” by the participants, without elaborating.The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said in a statement Wednesday that the conference will be held at “a later date when conditions for making meaningful progress would be more favourable.”Until now, the Taliban have refused to sign on to the conference even as Pakistan, where their leadership council resides, has been pressing the hardline Islamic militia to attend.The Taliban have accused Washington of breaching an agreement signed last year under which the U.S. was to have withdrawn the last of its troops by May 1.But President Joe Biden, who inherited that deal with the Taliban from his predecessor, last week said the remaining estimated 2,500 troops would begin leaving on May 1. All American and NATO soldiers would be gone by Sept. 11, the 20th anniversary of the terrorist assault on the U.S. that launched the U.S.-led invasion to hunt down al Qaida's leader Osama bin Laden.On Sunday, the Taliban issued an English-language statement on their Al Emara site, indicating they were not ready to attend the conference. They claimed that a powerful propaganda campaign had been launched, hyping expectations that a peace deal would be reached at the end of the planned 10-day meeting.The statement said this was an attempt “to push the Taliban, willingly or unwillingly, to a rushed decision which was needed by America.” It alleged that the aim of the conference was to “complete a for-show road map before the withdrawal of foreign forces.”In Kabul, Afghan government-allied negotiators had anticipated a delay as none had received an invitation to the conference and several were without visas to Turkey.In Washington, the U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price would not confirm the postponement but said the U.S. would continue diplomatic efforts to reach a peace deal.“When it comes to the talks in Istanbul, this gets to the point that, from the very earliest days of the Biden administration, we have recognized ... that there is no military solution to the conflict in Afghanistan, and only through a political settlement and a comprehensive ceasefire will we be able to support a resolution that brings a security, stability, and prosperity to the people of Afghanistan," Price said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usbacked-afghan-peace-talks-in-turkey-postponed-after-taliban-noshow-101618997684946.html
21-04-2021||World||12 US states urge Biden to back phasing out gas-powered vehicle sales by 2035||The governors of a dozen U.S. states including California, New York, Massachusetts and North Carolina called on President Joe Biden on Wednesday to back ending sales of new gasoline-powered vehicles by 2035, a dramatic shift away from fossil fuels.Biden's $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan calls for $174 billion in spending and tax credits to boost electric vehicles (EVs) and charging networks but does not call for phasing out gasoline-powered passenger vehicles.In a letter that was seen by Reuters, the governors, which also include those of Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Washington State and Rhode Island, urged Biden to set standards "to ensure that all new passenger cars and light-duty trucks sold are zero-emission no later than 2035 with significant milestones along the way to monitor progress."They argued that "by establishing a clear regulatory path to ensuring that all vehicles sold in the United States are zero-emission, we can finally clear the air and create high-road jobs."The governors also want Biden to set standards and adopt incentives aimed at ensuring 100% zero-emission sales of medium-duty and heavy-duty vehicles by 2045.The White House did not immediately comment on the governors' letter.States and some lawmakers hope that Biden's endorsement of a phase-out date will speed the transition to EVs by users and automakers. EVs currently make up just 2% of U.S. vehicle sales.A number of U.S. lawmakers have urged Biden follow California's lead, which in September said it planned to end sales of new gas-powered passenger vehicles by 2035. Biden's campaign said last fall he did not support California's phase-out plan.In March, a group of 71 House Democrats urged Biden to set tough emissions rules to ensure 60% of new passenger cars and trucks sold are zero-emission by 2030, while 10 U.S. senators urged Biden "to set a date by which new sales of fossil fuel vehicles will end entirely."General Motors said in January it was setting a goal to end all gasoline passenger car and truck sales by 2035. Volvo, a unit of Zhejiang Geely Holding, said its entire car line-up will be fully electric by 2030 and Ford’s European lineup will also be fully electric by 2030.In their letter, the governors said they want Biden to boost fuel economy standards rolled back under President Donald Trump and provide states "substantial funding for investment in charging and fueling infrastructure." They also urged removal of or raising the EV tax credit limits per manufacturer.But not everyone has backed a phase-out plan.Rory Gamble, the president of the United Auto Workers union, has expressed caution about the shift to EVs, noting it takes fewer workers to build EVs than gas-powered vehicles and said "workers will disproportionately suffer if we do not get it right."He said last month the government must ensure the transition to EVs "is stable, reliable and creates quality union wage jobs and flexible to market demand not relying on a one-size fits all solution."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/12-us-states-urge-biden-to-back-phasing-out-gas-powered-vehicle-sales-by-2035-101618996186975.html

21-04-2021||World||Some parts of China battle tight supply of Covid-19 vaccines: State media||Residents of some parts of China that are grappling with tight supplies of coronavirus vaccines have not received their second doses in time, but the crunch will ease by June as production is being stepped up, a health official told state media.The pace of China's massive inoculation campaign has slowed, to a daily average of about 3.3 million doses in the seven days until Monday, down from the corresponding figure of 4.2 million in the week until April 12, Reuters calculations showed."At present, domestic vaccine supply is relatively tight, but from May, especially after June, the situation will ease significantly," Zheng Zhongwei, the director of a team coordinating vaccine development projects, told the Global Times in an interview.Zheng did not say how severe the crunch was or which areas experienced tightness. The Global Times, published by the official newspaper of the ruling Communist Party, did not say how long people in those areas had to wait for the second shot.By Wednesday, China had given more than 200 million doses of vaccines, ranking only behind the United States, and it aims to inoculate 40% of its population by summer.Big cities such as Beijing and Shanghai have widened vaccination efforts to include foreigners, with the pace in some cities outstripping the national average, as China prioritises supplies to key provinces.The capital city of Beijing, for example, has inoculated more than half of its population of 21.5 million.This month Zheng said China was likely to have produced 3 billion doses of the vaccines by year-end, allowing it to meet the demand in the second half of 2021.China's national guidelines allow intervals of up to eight weeks between the two doses of vaccines developed by domestic firms Sinopharm and Sinovac Biotech.Local authorities should make sure the second dose can be administered within eight weeks, said Mi Feng, a spokesman of the National Health Commission."Avoid the situation where there's no dose following the first one," he told a news conference on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/some-parts-of-china-battle-tight-supply-of-covid-19-vaccines-state-media-101618994687379.html

But family members have identified her as Makiyah Bryant, aged 16.The police chief said the video, which he said shows the slain teenager trying to stab both females, was released to the public within hours of the incident in the interest of "transparency."The officer who opened fire was not identified but appears from the video to be white. The chief said he "would be taken off the street" pending an investigation.Around the time the video was made public, live television news coverage showed a growing crowd of protesters on city streets after dark, confronting a small line of police officers on bicycles.The demonstration appeared from media coverage to be peaceful, with protesters repeatedly chanting the girl's name.The Columbus Dispatch reported that demonstrators had gathered near the scene of the shooting earlier in the day.Woods said the Ohio Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) had opened an inquiry into the case. The city's public safety director, Ned Pettus, Jr., appealed for calm while the investigation proceeds and facts are uncovered in what he called "a devastating" loss of life."Fast, quick answers cannot come at the cost of accurate answers," Pettus told a late news conference with the police chief and mayor. "BCI will conduct a fully independent investigation, which will be made public. If an officer has violated policy or the law, if they have, they will be held accountable."Mayor Andrew Ginther said it appeared from an initial review of the footage that the officer who opened fire "took action to protect another young girl in our community.""But another young girl will still not be coming home tonight," he said. "I ask everyone to pray for peace. Tonight, we pray for this family, we pray for this city, and we pray for our neighbors."A woman identified in the Columbia Dispatch account as the slain girl's aunt, Hazel Bryant, told the newspaper the teenager lived in a foster home and became involved in an altercation with someone at the residence.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/black-teenage-girl-seen-brandishing-knife-in-ohio-shot-dead-by-us-police-101618994484933.html
21-04-2021||World||Canadian PM Justin Trudeau keen to take AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine||Justin Trudeau said he would prefer taking AstraZeneca’s Covid-19 vaccine after Ontario province, where the capital city of Ottawa is located, threw open its vaccination drive against the disease, making the Canadian prime minister eligible for the jab.Ontario’s administration announced on Tuesday that those aged 40 to 54 can register for vaccination. The 49-year-old Trudeau falls in that category.Trudeau insisted on getting the AZ vaccine “to convey the message to all Canadians that they should be vaccinated with the first one that is offered to them as quickly as possible”, according to a translation of a comment in French cited by CBC News.Trudeau’s remarks came even as a third case of rare blood clots following an AZ shot was reported in Canada.It occurred in the province of New Brunswick, where a person received the SII-manufactured Covishield vaccine in mid-March. The unnamed individual, in the 30s, has now recovered, according to authorities. During the course of a briefing on Tuesday, Jennifer Russel, the province’s chief medical health officer, said such cases “are extremely rare”, adding that they “do happen” and they are “treatable”.Canada has lately been seeing a degree of vaccine hesitancy over reports of rare blood clots following the use of the AZ jab. Two cases were reported earlier, in Quebec and Alberta - both linked to the version manufactured by the Serum Institute of India (SII) under the Covishield brand name. However, Canadian health officials have consistently stressed on the safety of the vaccination drive. Health Canada tweeted recently, “Based on all the evidence available internationally to-date, Health Canada continues to consider that the benefits of the #AstraZeneca and Covishield vaccines to protect against Covid-19 outweigh the potential risks.”Vaccine supplies continue to be haphazard in Canada, which received 13,371,462 doses in total till April 19, including 2,316,020 AZ shots of which 500,000 were Covishield.Canada reported 7,270 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking its total number of infections to 1,139,049, which includes 23,714 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-justin-trudeau-keen-to-take-astrazeneca-s-covid-19-vaccine-101618991682789.html
21-04-2021||World||China’s tech firms not adopting renewable energy goals fast enough: Greenpeace||China’s tech firms are not adopting clean energy “fast enough” to mark their commitment towards carbon neutrality, though more Chinese internet companies have begun to procure renewable energy and are disclosing greenhouse gas emissions data, environmental group Greenpeace said in a report on Wednesday.The report says China’s data centre industry is a significant and growing source of CO2 emissions – energy consumption from the sector is on track to increase 66% between 2019 and 2023; while in 2018, data centres in China were powered 73% by coal.By 2023, electricity consumption from the industry is projected to rival that of Australia.But the situation is changing, the Greenpeace report says.In a new ranking published on Wednesday, internet giant Tencent took the top spot among cloud providers in Greenpeace East Asia’s latest clean energy scorecard for China’s tech sector, leapfrogging e-commerce behemoth Alibaba, which fell to fourth place.Chinese President Xi Jinping has pledged to bring the country’s climate-warming emissions to a peak before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, committing the country to an accelerated transition to renewable energy.As of April 2021, 13 of China’s 22 biggest tech companies have begun to actively procure renewable energy, compared to just eight companies in 2019. However, only two major Chinese tech companies have recorded renewable energy usage rates that are higher than 3% - Chindata (51%) and Baidu (9%).“To date, only one major Chinese tech company, data centre operator Chindata Group, has pledged to achieve carbon neutrality by 2030. Last year, Chindata signed contracts to develop 1.3GW of wind and solar projects in Shanxi and Hebei provinces, making the company one of the top three renewable energy buyers worldwide in 2020,” the report says.“At the same time, GDS fell from being the second-ranked data centre operator to sixth due to a lack of carbon neutrality commitments and poor transparency,” the report said.Ye Ruiqi, Greenpeace East Asia’s climate and energy campaigner, said, “China’s internet sector is powered primarily by coal, and the industry’s energy consumption continues to rise. Over the past year, more Chinese companies have begun to procure renewable energy and to disclose greenhouse gas emissions data.”“However, the pace of clean energy adoption is not nearly fast enough, especially when we consider that China’s biggest tech company, Alibaba, and its biggest independent data centre operator, GDS, have yet to issue renewable energy or carbon neutrality commitments,” Ye added.The report spells out what needs to be done.China’s internet companies should set targets for 100% renewable energy use and achieve carbon neutrality by 2030, it says.“Carbon offsets are not a substitute for the reduction of fossil fuel emissions. Companies must scale up procurement of wind and solar energy, and actively disclose energy use data and greenhouse gas emissions data,” the report says.Ye said, “Tech giants such as Alibaba and GDS have an opportunity to drive China’s shift to a low-carbon economy, but currently they are falling behind their competitors. Ultimately, we need all of China’s major tech firms to achieve 100% renewable energy use and carbon neutrality across the value chain by 2030 - this would lend strong momentum to China’s national climate commitments.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-tech-firms-not-adopting-renewable-energy-goals-fast-enough-greenpeace-101618990122507.html

The UK has not prohibited direct flights from India.Canada has taken no decision yet, but the matter is being look at, as Trudeau said on Tuesday. “I’ve asked our officials to look very carefully at what for example the UK has done in suspending flights from India, what more can and should be done to ensure we are not getting cases in from overseas,” he told reporters. Flights are currently operating between India and Canada almost on a daily basis under an air bubble arrangement between the two countries. They are operated by Air Canada and Air India and connect New Delhi to the Canadian cities of Toronto and Vancouver.Canada has already instituted additional measures since January, including the requirement of a negative RT-PCR test before boarding a flight and a test on arrival in Canada, with passengers having to remain at a designated hotel at their cost, till the results arrive. According to data from the Public Health Agency of Canada, Covid-19 cases have been reported on 28 flights from India this month.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-canada-closely-looking-at-uk-move-to-place-india-on-red-list-101618988682769.html
21-04-2021||World||Floyd’s killing: Jury holds Chauvin guilty, Biden calls it ‘giant step forward’||After a high-profile trial followed closely in America and around the world, a jury has held former US police officer Derek Chauvin guilty of all three charges over the controversial death of George Floyd in Minneapolis last year - including unintentionally killing the Black man - which had sparked a global wave of anti-racism protests. Soon after the verdict was delivered in Minneapolis, US President Joe Biden called it a “giant step forward” in the fight against systemic racism, and said Floyd’s killing was a “a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the (racism)”, which he said was “a stain on our nation’s soul”. Vice-President Kamala Harris said, “Today, we feel a sigh of relief. Still, it cannot take away the pain. A measure of justice isn’t the same as equal justice. This verdict brings us a step closer. And, the fact is, we still have work to do.”Floyd’s death under Chauvin’s knee outside a Minneapolis grocery store on May 25, 2020 had triggered countrywide protests and outrage that had turned violent in the initial days with the National Guard being deployed to various parts of the US. The unrest — which swelled under the anti-racism slogan “Black Lives Matter” — quickly spread beyond the shores of the US and led to the toppling of a statue of a slave-trader in Bristol, UK; sparked the targeting of a 150-year-old statute of King Leopold II in Brussels, Belgium for brutalities in Congo; and triggered demonstrations in Australia against the subjugation of its indigenous people.The wave of anti-racism protests touched India as well. Mahatma Gandhi’s statute was vandalised by protesters outside the Indian embassy in Washington, DC, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi had to bring it up in a phone call with then US president Donald Trump.In Minneapolis, a 12-member jury of six white people and six people of colour held Chauvin guilty of unintentional second-degree murder, which is punishable with up to 40 years in prison; third-degree murder, which is unintentional murder caused by the use of an eminently dangerous act, punishable with up to 25 years in jail; and secondary manslaughter, which is culpable negligence creating an unreasonable risk. Sentencing is expected in about two months’ time, with Chauvin possibly staring at a lengthy jail term, according to legal experts.The former police officer looked on with a frown, the lower half of his face covered by a mask, as judge Peter Cahill read out the verdict in a Minneapolis courtroom. After that, Chauvin was taken away in handcuffs in a rare case of a US police officer held guilty for a killing. There have been only seven cases since 2005 in which police officers were found guilty of murder for on-duty shooting. Around 1,000 fatal shootings by cops are reported every year, according to a widely cited study by Bowling Green State University.Floyd’s family was relieved at the verdict. “They’re all saying the same thing: ‘We won’t be able to breathe until you’re able to breathe.’ Today, we are able to breathe again,” Philonise Floyd, one of his brothers, said in Minneapolis after the verdict. “Justice for George means freedom for all.” Terrence Floyd, another brother, said, “I’m going to miss him, but now I know he’s in history. What a day to be a Floyd, man.”The verdict came after three weeks of a trial aired live into Americans homes. The prosecution built its case around a video shot by a bystander — 17-year-old Darnella Frazier — that shows Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck for 9 minutes, 29 seconds. “Use your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw,” prosecutor Steve Schleicher said in his closing arguments.Defence attorney Eric Nelson tried to divert the jury’s attention from the video towards Floyd’s underlying health conditions and drug use. “The state has really focused on the 9 minutes and 29 seconds, 9 minutes and 29 seconds, 9 minutes and 29 seconds. It’s not the proper analysis because the 9 minutes and 29 seconds ignores the previous 15 minutes and 59 seconds, completely disregards,” he said in his concluding arguments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/floyds-killing-jury-holds-chauvin-guilty-biden-calls-it-giant-step-forward-101618986882437.html
21-04-2021||World||Joe Biden’s wartime law use blocks India’s vaccine ramp-up||Indian officials are in touch with their counterparts in the US to resolve a hold-up in supplies of raw materials needed by Covid-19 vaccine makers that has been caused by Washington’s decision to prioritise local buyers under a war-time law invoked earlier this year by President Joe Biden to boost vaccine production.Supplies of nearly 30 such items have been affected by this wartime law, known as the Defense Priorities and Allocations System Programme (DPAS) under the Defense Production Act (DPA).Vaccine maker Serum Institute of India (SII) is understood to be in dire need of raw materials as it ramps up its production of Covid-19 vaccines amid an alarming surge in infections across the country.These raw materials include reagents, tubing materials, nano-filters, plastic bagging material and equipment that are understood to be needed for ramping up vaccine production.The Indian side has raised the issue with the US as part of the growing bilateral cooperation on healthcare. External affairs minister S Jaishankar discussed it with US secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday, and the Indian Ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu, has brought it up in his conversations with US officials. The Americans have promised to “give the matter due consideration” and work with India to “find appropriate solutions”, according to people familiar with the developments.The raw materials are not subject to any explicit export ban, it has been argued. But American sellers of these items are obligated to meet contractual requirement from US buyers before anyone else, which include Indian buyers, who have been being told to expect delayed delivery, according to the people familiar with these discussions.Biden invoked the DPA in February to boost vaccine production, especially to aid Pfizer-BioNTech’s effort. The supply crunch for Indian vaccine makers was first noticed in March, according to the people cited above. SII’s CEO and owner Adar Poonawalla went public with his plight in an appeal to Biden last week. Now that the US has administered at least one dose of vaccine to half of its population and built up a sizable stockpile of millions of doses, its need for these raw materials may be tapering off, which would allow American suppliers to resume full and timely delivery of shipment ordered by outside buyers, such as vaccine makers from India, it was said.The issue of raw material supply crunch has, however, been confused in some quarters for India and South Africa’s appeal to the World Trade Organization (WTO) last October for a temporary waiver of intellectual property rights (IPR) related to Covid-19 vaccines and treatments, “until widespread vaccination is in place globally, and the majority of the world’s population has developed immunity”. The US and Europe, home to leading Covid-19 vaccines makers, have blocked that move, which has been backed by 80 WTO members.Asked about the bottleneck in raw material supplies, Jen Psaki, the White House press secretary, spoke on Monday about the WTO discussions. “We are, of course, working with WTO members on a global response to Covid. That includes a number of components, whether it’s $4billion committed to COVAX, or discussions about how we can aid and assist countries that need help the most,” she said.Psaki also referred to US trade representatives Katherine Tai’s speech at a WTO-hosted discussion on Covid-19 vaccine and the need for their equitable distribution around the world. While sympathetic to the cause, Tai did not concede any ground on the question of the waiver of Covid-19 vaccine-related IPR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-s-wartime-law-use-blocks-india-s-vaccine-rampup-101618984303659.html
21-04-2021||World||Xi Jinping to participate in Biden's climate summit||Chinese leader Xi Jinping will participate in a climate summit organized by US President Joe Biden, a sign that climate issues are one area the two countries can cooperate on amid frosty ties.Xi accepted Biden’s invitation and will attend via video link on Thursday, China’s Foreign Ministry said in a statement Wednesday.Washington and Beijing are at odds over a range of issues, from allegations of forced labor in Xinjiang and China’s tightening political grip over Hong Kong to US efforts to curb China’s role in supply chains. Xi used a speech Tuesday to the Boao Forum on Asia to challenge Washington’s global leadership, saying the world needed “justice, not hegemony.”Still, the two nations have shown they’re eager to work together to tackle climate change. A joint statement released after US climate envoy John Kerry visited Shanghai last week said Washington and Beijing would support implementation of the Paris Agreement and promote a successful United Nations climate change conference in Glasgow this year.“China maintains an open attitude when it comes to climate cooperation and welcomes dialogue,” said Zhang Monan, senior fellow at the US-Europe Institute at the China Center for International Economic Exchanges, a think tank in Beijing.“However, if countries continue to pressure China or adopt confrontational and non-cooperative tactics, then China will address this with corresponding actions,” she said.Xi met German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron last week for a virtual climate conference. The European leaders welcomed his renewed commitment for China to achieve CO2 neutrality by 2060, a spokeswoman for Merkel said, and the three also discussed the coronavirus pandemic and global vaccine supplies.Washington dropped out of the Paris climate accord under the Trump administration, and China has been critical of the move. During Kerry’s visit, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian said the US is to blame for delaying the agreement’s progress.The US is preparing to host 40 world leaders at the summit on Thursday and Friday. The virtual conference will bring together 17 countries responsible for 80% of global emissions and gross domestic product, the White House said.Biden will pledge to cut US greenhouse-gas emissions by at least half by the end of the decade, the Washington Post reported, citing two people briefed on the plan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/xi-jinping-to-participate-in-biden-s-climate-summit-101618981683032.html
21-04-2021||World||Singapore to reduce entry of Indians as new virus variants emerge||Singapore is reviewing its border measures for recovered travelers following the emergence of new variants of concern as coronavirus cases tick up around the world.The city-state will also closely monitor for re-infection of people who have previously recovered from Covid-19, the Health Ministry said in a statement published Tuesday. The announcement came after a recent case, where an individual likely contracted the virus again during a visit to India and was infectious when he returned to Singapore, the ministry said.The Southeast Asian country, which has largely managed to contain the pandemic, is stepping up its safeguards amid new waves of virus infections in Europe and Asia. New measures include reducing border entry approvals and extending isolation measures for travelers from India amid an escalation of Covid-19 cases in that country.Fewer entry approvals from India will be granted for non-Singapore citizens or permanent residents with immediate effect, the ministry said in another press release also published Tuesday. Starting at the end of April 22, all travelers who have recently been to India will be subjected to an extra seven days of home isolation following their 14-day quarantine at a government-designated facility.India now has the world’s fastest-growing Covid-19 caseload, adding 259,170 new infections and 1,761 deaths on Tuesday, leaving it behind only the U.S. in terms of total numbers.Hong KongAt the same time, the city-state eased measures for travelers from Hong Kong, and lifted entry restrictions for travelers from the U.K. and South Africa. The government is also making it easier for people who have been fully vaccinated to travel to high-risk regions.Travelers from Hong Kong, where vaccinations are rising and cases are dropping, will have to stay in home isolation for seven days upon arriving in Singapore starting at the end of Thursday. Previously they had to spend 14 days in a government-chosen hotel.Singaporean long-term pass holders and short-term visitors will now be able to enter from the U.K. and South Africa. Previously only citizens or permanent residents were allowed in. All will have to spend 14 days in a government-selected hotel and an additional seven days in home isolation.Fully vaccinated people will be able to make “essential official” trips to higher-risk regions subject to multiple tests at their destination and seven days of self-isolation when they return to Singapore, while non-vaccinated people will have to abide by prevailing border measures.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-to-reduce-entry-of-indians-as-new-virus-variants-emerge-101618975589594.html
21-04-2021||World||US says ‘deeply focused’ on expanding global Covid-19 vaccination, manufacturing||The United States is deeply focused on expanding global vaccination, manufacturing, and delivery -- all of which will be critical to ending the Covid-19 pandemic, the State Department has said.“President (Joe) Biden, Secretary (of State Tony) Blinken, they are deeply focused on the issue of expanding global vaccination, manufacturing, and delivery – all of which will be critical to ending the pandemic,” State Department spokesperson Ned Price told reporters during his daily news conference.Responding to a question, he said, Blinken has consistently made the point that as long as the virus is out of control and uncontained anywhere around the world -- whether in the US or elsewhere -- it continues to pose a threat to American people.“First and foremost, our priority is ensuring the distribution of a safe and effective vaccine to millions of Americans, to all Americans who are able to take advantage of it. But we also know that we need to continue to demonstrate that leadership when it comes to countries beyond our borders, and that’s precisely what we’ve done,” he said.The United States, he said, has re-engaged the WHO; it has committed USD 2 billion to COVAX, and another USD 2 billion over time; it has spoken to its partners Canada and Mexico.“We have spoken to the arrangement we have with the Quad and the increased production capacity that that will bring about,” Price said.“It is not only in our interest to ensure that the American people are vaccinated, the other point I would make is that the rest of the world also has an interest in seeing to it that the American people are vaccinated and that the virus is brought under control here,” he said.The US, he said, has suffered tremendously.“We have more deaths than any other country around the world, more than 5,50,000 at this point, tens of millions of cases. So again, as long as the virus is uncontrolled anywhere, it is a threat to people everywhere. That is true in the United States; that is true in countries around the world, and it’s precisely why we’re taking this approach,” Price said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-says-deeply-focused-on-expanding-global-covid-19-vaccination-manufacturing-101618973851485.html

Reacting to the development, George Floyd's brother Philonise, speaking at a news conference with several family members after the verdict, said, "We are able to breathe again" but added that the fight for justice was not over. "We have to protest because it seems like this is a never-ending cycle," he was quoted as saying by news agency Reuters.A 12-member jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty of all three charges of second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter after considering three weeks of testimony from 45 witnesses, including bystanders, police officials and medical experts. Deliberations began on Monday and lasted just over 10 hours.BackgroundIn a confrontation captured on video last year, Derek Chauvin, a white veteran of the police force, was seen pushing his knee into the neck of George Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man in handcuffs, for more than nine minutes on May 25, 2020. Chauvin and three fellow officers were attempting to arrest Floyd, accused of using a fake $20 bill to buy cigarettes at a grocery store.Floyd's death prompted protests against racism and police brutality in many US cities, including Minneapolis, and other countries last summer, even as the world grappled with the coronavirus pandemic. The intersection of race and law enforcement has long been contentious in the United States, underscored by a series of deadly incidents involving white police officers and Black people in recent years.SentencingChauvin could now face up to 40 years in prison. Under Minnesota sentencing guidelines, Chauvin faces 12-1/2 years in prison for his murder conviction as a first-time criminal offender. Prosecutors could seek a longer sentence of up to 40 years if Hennepin County District Judge Peter Cahill determines that there were "aggravating factors." Cahill said Chauvin's sentencing was likely eight weeks away.While the US criminal justice system and juries have long given leeway and some legal protection to police officers who use violence to subdue civilians, the Minneapolis jurors found that Chauvin had crossed the line and used excessive force.The Minneapolis police department fired Chauvin and the three other officers the day after Floyd's murder. The three others are due to face trial later this year on aiding-and-abetting charges.The jurors remained still and quiet as the verdict was read. Chauvin, wearing a grey suit with a blue tie as well as a light-blue face mask, nodded and stood quickly when the judge ruled that his bail was revoked. He was taken out of the courtroom in handcuffs and placed in the custody of the Hennepin County sheriff.ReactionsThe conviction triggered a wave of relief and reflection not only across the United States but in countries around the world."It was a murder in the full light of day and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see the systemic racism," US president Joe Biden said in televised remarks. "This can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America." Biden and vice president Kamala Harris watched the verdict being read out along with staff in the White House's private dining room, the White House said. Biden, Harris and first lady Jill Biden all spoke with Philonise Floyd.The Police Officers Federation of Minneapolis said in a statement published in the Minneapolis Star Tribune that "there are no winners in this case, and we respect the jury's decision," adding: "We need to stop the divisive comments, and we all need to do better to create a Minneapolis we all love."Outside the courthouse, a crowd of several hundred people erupted in cheers when the verdict was announced - a scene that unfolded in cities across the country. Car horns honked, demonstrators blocked traffic and chanted: "George Floyd" and "All three counts." At George Floyd Square in Minneapolis, the intersection where Floyd was killed and which was later named in his honour, people screamed, applauded and some threw dollar bills in the air in celebration.While celebrating the verdict, protesters called for justice in the case of Daunte Wright, a Black man who was fatally shot by a police officer after a routine traffic stop on April 11, just a few miles from where Derek Chauvin stood trial. Kimberly Potter, who has turned in her badge, has been charged with manslaughter in that case.(Inputs from Reuters)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-are-able-to-breathe-again-george-floyd-s-family-hails-chauvin-verdict-101618972296098.html
21-04-2021||World||South Korean and Australian economy exhibit resilience to Covid-19 global crises||South Korea and Australia are proving the odd couple of the global economy, managing to mitigate the impact of the Covid crisis due to deep links with China’s growth and key advantages unique to themselves.The duo’s connections aren’t obvious given Korea is a manufacturing powerhouse with skilled labor as key strength and Australia extracts vast resource wealth from a continent it has to itself.The common denominator is their exposure to China, which is the endpoint for more than 25% of Korea’s exports and an extraordinary 43% of Australia’s shipments.Yet the reliance doesn’t explain all, as China is the biggest market to most in Asia, including Japan, and many have performed poorly during the pandemic.Another common feature is the duo’s relative success in controlling the pandemic. The coronavirus has all but been eliminated Down Under, while Korea has managed to keep total infections so far to around 115,000 -- a fraction of what’s seen in similar-sized countries elsewhere.“They’re an odd couple,” said Saul Eslake, an independent economist. “They’re in the same timezone, but that’s about it. Korea is an importer of commodities and an exporter of increasingly sophisticated manufactured goods. ”Eslake noted the countries have one of the three Ps that typically drive growth -- population, participation and productivity -- Australia the first and Korea the third.Their currency values tend to rise in a risk-on atmosphere, though it’s the Korean won that’s more aligned with the Chinese yuan, said Park Chong-hoon, an economist at Standard Chartered Bank in Seoul.The two nations, the only developed economies to dodge the 2009 global recession and whose contractions last year were shallower than most, do have a close economic relationship. Korea is Australia’s fourth-largest trading partner and they’ve had a free-trade agreement operating since 2014.An Ernst & Young report released last month found few countries managed to achieve positive economic and health outcomes during the Covid-19 pandemic. It placed Australia and Korea in an elite quad that also included Denmark and New Zealand.Their huge exposure to China also comes with risks, with both having run afoul of Beijing. Korea faced a tourism boycott after it deployed the U.S. anti-missile system in 2017. Australia faced a range of trade actions against goods including coal, wine and barley after calling a year ago for independent investigators to be allowed into Wuhan to probe the origins of the coronavirus.Peter Drysdale, head of the East Asian Bureau of Economic Research at the Australian National University, notes both Australia and Korea opted for major fiscal responses to the global financial crisis and Covid. He says how they manage China going forward is key.The most important point is “what strategies each country has for linking to the growth momentum in China that appears clearly set to continue,” said Drysdale, one of the architects of APEC. “What will things look like down that track and will the position of each country be as they try to capture long term growth potential.”For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/south-korean-and-australian-economy-exhibit-resilience-to-covid-19-global-crises-101618971902640.html

The 12 jurors on Tuesday found Chauvin guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death in May 2020, CNN reported.Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill said, "eight weeks from now we will have sentencing." The former police officer was charged with killing Floyd by kneeling on his neck for more than nine minutes, which was captured on video footage in May 2020 and triggered nationwide demonstrations for racial justice.Issuing a statement on Twitter, Obama said, "For almost a year, George Floyd's death under the knee of a police officer has reverberated around the world inspiring murals and marches, sparking conversations in living rooms and new legislation. But a more basic question has always remained: would justice be done?Here's the entire statement from former US president Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle:"In this case, at least, we have our answer. But if we're being honest with ourselves, we know that true justice is about much more than a single verdict in a single trial.""True justice requires that we come to terms with the fact that Black Americans are treated differently, every day. While today's verdict may have been a necessary step on the road to progress, it was far from a sufficient one. We cannot rest," he added.Today, a jury did the right thing. But true justice requires much more. Michelle and I send our prayers to the Floyd family, and we stand with all those who are committed to guaranteeing every American the full measure of justice that George and so many others have been denied. pic.twitter.com/mihZQHqACVObama further said: "We will need to follow through with the concrete reforms that will reduce and ultimately eliminate racial bias in our criminal justice system. We will need to redouble efforts to expand economic opportunity for those communities that have been too long marginalised.""And as we continue the fight, we can draw strength from the millions of people especially young people who have marched and protested and spoken up over the last year, shining a light on inequity and calling for change. Justice is closer today not simply because of this verdict, but because of their work," his statement added.Offering prayers to the Floyd family, the former US President said, "Michelle and I send our prayers to the Floyd family, and we stand with all those who are committed to guaranteeing every American the full measure of justice that George and so many others have been denied."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/we-cannot-rest-barack-obama-says-verdict-in-derek-chauvin-trial-is-necessary-but-not-sufficient-101618970900715.html
21-04-2021||World||All countries should phase out coal by 2040, says United Nations chief||The United Nations is pushing for a global coalition committed to net zero emissions by 2050 which will cover all countries, cities, regions and businesses, Antonio Guterres, United Nations Secretary General said on Monday. He also called on Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to phase out coal by 2030, and 2040 elsewhere.Ahead of the April 22-23 Virtual Leaders’ Summit on Climate convened by the United States of America where 40 world leaders are likely to speak, including PM Narendra Modi, Guterres said he expects the most important countries, in relation to climate change, will be able to commit to net zero emissions of greenhouse gases by the middle of the century and to commit to a drastic reduction of emissions for the next decade by reviewing their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).During a press interaction on Monday evening to launch the World Meteorological Organisation’s State of Global Climate 2020 report, Guterres said it’s a risk to have developing countries like India and China still investing in coal power plants that will be soon stranded assets.When asked how a target of net zero emissions by 2050 for all countries reconciles with the principle of CBDR (common but differentiated responsibilities), Guterres said it’s possible through a large effort of solidarity of developed countries with developing countries in finance and technology. CBDR, is a principle under the Paris Agreement requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them.Also read | In a swipe at West, Xi warns against ‘bossing, meddling’Union environment minister Prakash Javadekar said last week that India will not raise its climate ambition at the behest of or under pressure from developed countries. India is already acting responsibly by implementing its ambitious NDC while under CBDR developed countries have a greater responsibility to cut emissions, he said.“In climate debate historic responsibility is a very important aspect. We cannot just forget, and we will not allow anybody to forget it. The historical emissions responsibility today is China 28%, USA 40%; Europe 10% and India is only 3%. We are not responsible for the climate change that is happening, but India is a responsible nation. It will do the right thing to deal with climate change. Principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR, a principle under the Paris Agreement requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them.) is important. Yes, as we are facing a grave common threat, we all will have to act but those who have polluted will have to act more,” Javadekar said.“We need to have an agreement based on three different dimensions: First, very ambitious targets on mitigation, namely, to get to net zero in the middle of the century. Second, a very strong support for adaptation, namely, in the developing countries. And third, a large effort of solidarity of developed countries with developing countries in finance and technology to allow developing countries to take profit of what is today the reality of technology in the economy,” Guterres said, adding that “Today, it is cheaper to produce electricity with renewables than in fossil fuels, and it’s a risk to have developing countries still investing in coal power plants that will be soon stranded assets. We have more and more situations in the world -- I believe it’s already the case in countries like India and China -- in which it is cheaper to create a new solar power plant than just to keep running several of the coal power plants that exist.”“So, the economy is on our side; the technology is on our side, but we need the solidarity of developed countries with the developing world to allow, through the principle of CBDR and taking profit of the national capabilities, to allow exactly for this compromise to be possible. I believe it is possible. It requires commitment,” Guterres said.According to a statement by the White House, a key goal of both the Leaders’ Summit and COP26 at Glasgow this November will be to catalyse efforts that keep that 1.5-degree goal within reach. The Summit will also highlight examples of how enhanced climate ambition will create good paying jobs, advance innovative technologies, and help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts. By the time of the Summit, the United States will announce an ambitious 2030 emissions target as its new NDC under the Paris Agreement, the statement had said.The global average temperature was about 1.2°C above pre-industrial levels despite the cooling effect of La Nina in 2020, the WMO confirmed on Monday in its State of the Global Climate 2020 report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had warned that a 1.5°C warming will mark a menacing milestone in the warming of the planet. Last year was one of the three warmest years on record; the six years since 2015 have been the warmest on record and 2011-2020 was the warmest decade on record. The decrease in the annual growth rate of CO2 concentration due to the Covid-19 lockdown will be practically indistinguishable.Globally averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have already exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm), 148% of pre-industrial levels, and if the CO2 concentration follows the same pattern as in previous years, it could reach or exceed 414 ppm in 2021, according to the report.“International agreements on climate change aim to keep global warming within the safe range of 1.5°C to 2°C, but few people realise that the world’s average temperature is already more than a degree warmer than it was 200 years ago. Parts of the world like the Himalayas are warming even faster. This is a serious concern for India, because climate change could have a compounding effect on existing scarcities, stresses and extreme events. For example, in 2020, even as we were fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, we also had to face Cyclone Amphan, which intensified rapidly in a warmer ocean. It is crucial that all countries invest in adaptation to climate impacts, especially to protect those who are most vulnerable to extreme events. At the same time, we need to accelerate policies and technologies to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate programme, World Resources Institute responding to the WMO report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/all-countries-should-phase-out-coal-by-2040-says-united-nations-chief-101618971295303.html

His statement came amid rising China-US tensions over wide-ranging issues, including Beijing’s role in Xinjiang, Taiwan and Hong Kong.“Bossing others around or meddling in others’ internal affairs would not get one any support,” Xi said, addressing the annual Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) over video link. In state-to-state relations, the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutual trust must be put front and centre, Xi said.Xi criticised efforts by some countries - without naming any - to “build barriers” and “decouple”, which he said would harm others and benefit no one. “Big countries should behave in a manner befitting to their status and with a greater sense of responsibility,” Xi added.“The Covid-19 pandemic has made it all the more clear to people around the world that we must reject the Cold War and zero-sum mentality and oppose a new Cold War and ideological confrontation in whatever forms,” he said.Also read: ‘J&J jab, clots linked’Notwithstanding a patch of common ground on the fight against the climate crisis, US President Joe Biden has been working on uniting allies such as the UK, the EU and Japan on countering China.Last month, Biden held the first summit of the Quad, comprising the US, India, Australia and Japan.Marking the 20th anniversary of the BFA, referred to as Asia’s answer to the World Economic Forum in Davos, this year’s annual conference is themed “A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation”.The Chinese president also said that his country has no plans to enter an arms race.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-swipe-at-west-xi-warns-against-bossing-meddling-101618971029755.html

21-04-2021||World||Russia positions more troops at Ukraine’s border||Russia will soon have more than 120,000 troops on Ukraine’s border, Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba said on Tuesday, calling for new Western economic sanctions on Moscow.Kyiv, Washington and Nato have been alarmed by the large build-up of Russian troops near Ukraine and in Crimea, the peninsula that Moscow annexed from Ukraine in 2014.Western officials say the concentration of forces is now larger than during that annexation.“Russian troops continue to arrive in close proximity to our borders in the northeast, in the east and in the south. In about a week, they are expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops,” Kuleba told an online news conference.“This does not mean they will stop building up their forces at that number,” Kuleba said, warning of what he said was Moscow’s unpredictability although he said Ukraine did not want conflict with Russia.The European Union’s top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Monday that Russia had concentrated more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine’s border and in Crimea.Kuleba also called for Moscow to re-commit to a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has supported separatist forces in a conflict that began in 2014.Russia has said the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from Nato. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.Kuleba attended a video conference with EU foreign ministers and said he openly “called on colleagues to start considering a new round of sectoral sanctions against Russia”.He said he did not feel EU ministers were ready for such a move but he told them that individual sanctions on Russian officials were insufficient.Britain foreign minister Dominic Raab said on Tuesday the country has significant concerns over the buildup of Russian forces and wants to de-escalate the situation,German Chancellor Angela Merkel too expressed concern. The situation is “extremely tense and very worrying as a result of the concentration of forces on the Russian side of the Ukrainian border,” Merkel said at an event on Tuesday. The US Pentagon said on Monday that the buildup exceeds the one that preceded Russia’s 2014 military intervention.Tensions between Kyiv and Moscow have spiraled in recent weeks after Russia began military drills and ceasefire violations jumped in the conflict that began when Vladimir Putin seized Crimea from Ukraine seven years ago. Russia wants more autonomy for the breakaway Donbas region, where Russian-speakers dominate. That could derail Ukrainian plans to join the EU and Nato-- goals that are backed by the majority of its 42 million population.The Kremlin accuses its neighbour of planning an offensive to regain control of Donbas -- a claim Ukraine denies. The fear is a resumption of large-scale fighting that mostly ended after a 2015 peace accord.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-positions-more-troops-at-ukraine-s-border-101618970021530.html
21-04-2021||World||Joe Biden calls ex-Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin verdict 'giant step' toward justice in US||President Joe Biden on Tuesday called the guilty verdict in the trial of a former Minneapolis police officer charged with the murder of George Floyd "a giant step" toward justice in the United States.Derek Chauvin, a white officer, was convicted after kneeling for more than nine minutes on the neck of Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, during an arrest last May. Video of the incident set off worldwide protests against police brutality and racial injustice.The 12-member jury found Chauvin, 45, guilty of all three charges - second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter - after considering three weeks of testimony from 45 witnesses."It was a murder in the full light of day, and it ripped the blinders off for the whole world to see," Biden said in nationally televised remarks. "Systemic racism is a stain on the nation's soul."The Democratic president said the protests seen in the United States after Floyd's killing were something the nation had not witnessed since the civil rights movement and had unified people of different races."Nothing can ever bring their brother and father back," he said of the Floyd family, "but this can be a giant step forward in the march toward justice in America."Biden also praised the "brave young woman" who recorded Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, and cited the police officers who testified for the prosecution in the case "instead of closing ranks.""For so many," Biden said, "it feels like it took all of that for the judicial system to deliver basic accountability."Vice President Kamala Harris also delivered remarks, urging the U.S. Senate to pass the "George Floyd Justice in Policing Act," which was approved by the U.S. House of Representatives and aims to stop aggressive law enforcement tactics that have targeted African Americans and other minorities."A measure of justice isn't the same as equal justice. This verdict brings us a step closer," said Harris, the first Black person, first Asian American and first woman to be vice president.Earlier in the day, Biden said he was praying for the "right verdict," a comment that sparked criticism. He said he would not have made such a comment if the jury was not sequestered.Biden and Harris watched the verdict with staff in the president's dining room. Afterward, Biden spoke with Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and then Biden, Harris and first lady Jill Biden spoke with Floyd's younger brother Philonise Floyd from the Oval Office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/joe-biden-calls-ex-minneapolis-cop-derek-chauvin-verdict-giant-step-toward-justice-in-us-101618966946467.html
21-04-2021||World||Ex-cop Derek Chauvin guilty of murder and manslaughter in George Floyd case||Former Minneapolis Officer Derek Chauvin was convicted Tuesday of murder and manslaughter for pinning George Floyd to the pavement with his knee on the Black man’s neck in a case that touched off worldwide protests, violence and a furious reexamination of racism and policing in the U.S.Chauvin, 45, could be sent to prison for decades.People elated by the verdict flooded the surrounding streets downtown upon hearing the news. Cars blared their horns, and people ran through traffic, waving banners.Floyd family members gathered at a Minneapolis conference room could be heard cheering from the next room as each verdict was read.The jury of six white people and six Black or multiracial ones came back with its verdict after about 10 hours of deliberations over two days. Chauvin was found guilty on all charges: second-degree unintentional murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter.His face was obscured by a Covid-19 mask, and little reaction could be seen beyond his eyes darting around the courtroom.His bail was immediately revoked and he was led away with his hands cuffed behind his back. Sentencing will be in two months.As the judge asked jurors if they reached a verdict, a hush fell on the crowd 300 strong in a park adjacent to the courthouse, with people listening to the proceedings on their cellphones. When the final guilty verdict was announced, the crowd roared, many people hugging, some shedding tears.At the intersection where Floyd was pinned down, a crowd chanted, “One down, three to go!” — a reference to the three other fired Minneapolis police officers facing trial in August on charges of aiding and abetting murder in Floyd's death.Janay Henry, who lives nearby, said she felt grateful and relieved.“I feel grounded. I can feel my feet on the concrete," she said, adding that she was looking forward to the “next case with joy and optimism and strength.”An ecstatic Whitney Lewis leaned halfway out a car window in a growing traffic jam of revelers waving a Black Lives Matter flag. “Justice was served,” the 32-year-old from Minneapolis said. “It means George Floyd can now rest.”The verdict was read in a courthouse ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire and patrolled by National Guard troops, in a city on edge against another round of unrest — not just because of the Chauvin case but because of the deadly police shooting of a young Black man, Daunte Wright, in a Minneapolis suburb April 11.The jurors identities were kept secret and will not be released until the judge decides it is safe to do so.Floyd, 46, died May 25 after being arrested on suspicion of passing a counterfeit $20 bill for a pack of cigarettes at a corner market. He panicked, pleaded that he was claustrophobic and struggled with police when they tried to put him in a squad car. They put him on the ground instead.The centerpiece of the case was the excruciating bystander video of Floyd gasping repeatedly, “I can’t breathe” and onlookers yelling at Chauvin to stop as the officer pressed his knee on or close to Floyd’s neck for what authorities say was 9 1/2 minutes. Floyd slowly went silent and limp.Prosecutors played the footage at the earliest opportunity, during opening statements, with Jerry Blackwell telling the jury: “Believe your eyes.” And it was shown over and over, analyzed one frame at a time by witnesses on both sides.In the wake of Floyd’s death, demonstrations and scattered violence broke out in Minneapolis, around the country and beyond. The furor also led to the removal of Confederate statues and other offensive symbols such as Aunt Jemima.In the months that followed, numerous states and cities restricted the use of force by police, revamped disciplinary systems or subjected police departments to closer oversight.The “Blue Wall of Silence” that often protects police accused of wrongdoing crumbled after Floyd’s death: The Minneapolis police chief quickly called it “murder” and fired all four officers, and the city reached a staggering $27 million settlement with Floyd’s family as jury selection was underway.Police-procedure experts and law enforcement veterans inside and outside the Minneapolis department, including the chief, testified for the prosecution that Chauvin used excessive force and went against his training.Medical experts for the prosecution said Floyd died of asphyxia, or lack of oxygen, because his breathing was constricted by the way he was held down on his stomach, his hands cuffed behind him, a knee on his neck and his face jammed against the ground.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson called a police use-of-force expert and a forensic pathologist to help make the case that Chauvin acted reasonably against a struggling suspect and that Floyd died because of an underlying heart condition and his illegal drug use.Floyd had high blood pressure, an enlarged heart and narrowed arteries, and fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in his system.Under the law, police have certain leeway to use force and are judged according to whether their actions were “reasonable” under the circumstances.The defense also tried to make the case that Chauvin and the other officers were hindered in their duties by what they perceived as a growing, hostile crowd.Chauvin did not testify, and all that the jury or the public ever heard by way of an explanation from him came from a police body-camera video after an ambulance had taken the 6-foot-4, 223-pound Floyd away. Chauvin told a bystander: “We gotta control this guy ’cause he’s a sizable guy ... and it looks like he’s probably on something.”The prosecution’s case also included tearful testimony from onlookers who said the police kept them back when they protested what was happening. Eighteen-year-old Darnella Frazier, who shot the crucial video, said Chauvin just gave the bystanders a “cold” and “heartless” stare.She and others said they felt a sense of helplessness and lingering guilt from witnessing Floyd’s slow-motion death.“It’s been nights I stayed up, apologizing and apologizing to George Floyd for not doing more, and not physically interacting and not saving his life,” Frazier testified, while the 19-year-old cashier at the neighborhood market, Christopher Martin, lamented that “this could have been avoided” if only he had rejected the suspect $20 bill.To make Floyd more than a crime statistic in the eyes of the jury, the prosecution called to the stand his girlfriend, who told the story of how they met and how they struggled with addiction to opioids, and his younger brother Philonise.

The accord includes the option of a snapback of U.N. sanctions if Iran breaches the deal, requiring Tehran to suspend all nuclear enrichment-related activities, including research development.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-sees-vienna-talks-moving-forward-warns-against-excessive-demands-101618940148109.html
21-04-2021||World||Nepal’s former royals test Covid-19 positive after participating in Kumbh Mela||Nepal’s former royals, King Gyanendra Shah and Queen Komal Shah, have tested positive for Covid-19 days after their return home from India following their participation in the Haridwar Mahakumbh Mela in Uttarakhand.Samples provided by the couple for RT-PCR tests were confirmed positive, The Himalayan Times reported, citing Nepal’s health ministry. Authorities have begun tracing others who have been in contact with the couple.The former king, 73, and the former queen, 70, had taken a holy bath at Har Ki Pauri in Haridwar during Mahakumbh. Hundreds of people had gathered at the airport in Kathmandu to welcome the couple on their return.Gyanendra, who stepped down in 2008 after a popular revolt against him, travelled to Haridwar on April 11 and interacted with Acharya Mahamandaleshwar Kailashananda Giri Maharaj of the Niranjani Akhara and many other sadhus. Nepal’s former royal family is held in high esteem by religious leaders in many parts of north India. Gyanendra was also felicitated at a public event.The former king was criticised for not adhering to Covid-19 protocols such as social distancing and wearing a mask during the event. He also led the procession of the Niranjani Akhara on April 12.Thousands of people who attended the Kumbh Mela have tested positive for coronavirus disease. Gyanendra was crowned the king of Nepal in 2001 after his elder brother Birendra Bir Bikram Shah Dev and his family were killed in a massacre at the royal palace. However, he became unpopular when he seized direct control of the country in 2005 on the grounds that political parties failed to tackle the Maoist insurgency.After the centuries-old monarchy was abolished, Gyanendra has largely maintained a low-profile.As Covid-19 infections spiked across the country, the Indian government last week appealed to religious leaders to observe the remainder of the Kumbh Mela only in a symbolic fashion.On Monday, India recorded nearly 274,000 new coronavirus infections and the total number of confirmed cases was more than 15 million.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nepals-former-royals-test-covid-19-positive-after-participating-in-kumbh-mela-101618943679054.html
21-04-2021||India||Hospitals face oxygen shortage, Centre increases states' quota||As India saw another record high of 2,95,041 new Covid cases and 2,023 deaths, the oxygen crisis precipitated by the second wave appeared to intensify with complaints of shortage from several states, including Maharashtra where tragedy struck when 24 patients on ventilator support suffocated to death due to leakage in an oxygen storage tank.The Centre announced on Wednesday evening that it was increasing the quota of oxygen in eight states, including Delhi, in view of the sudden spike in demand due to an exponential rise in the number of Covid patients admitted in hospitals.On the vaccination front, Madhya Pradesh, Bihar and Chhattisgarh were the latest to announce free jabs for all aged above 18 years, after Uttar Pradesh and Assam made a similar decision, and officials presented data to assert that the vaccines reduce the risk of infection and prevent death and severe infection.At a press conference, NITI Aayog member (Health) Dr V K Paul appealed to the states, hospitals and nursing homes to ensure rational use of oxygen as it was "life-saving" drug for the coronavirus infected patients.Noting that 7,500 MT of oxygen was being produced in the country per day and 6,600 MT is being allocated to states for medical purposes, the Centre said the Union government and state governments need to work together and respond promptly to the challenges posed by the pandemic.The central government announced that the quota of Maharashtra has been increased from 1,646 to 1,661 MT, from 445 to 543 MT in Madhya Pradesh, from 156 to 162 MT in Haryana, from 751 MT to 753 MT in UP and from 126 MT to 136 MT in Punjab.The allocation has been raised from 360 MT to 440 MT in Andhra Pradesh, from 83 MT to 103 MT in Uttarakhand and from 378 MT to 480 MT in Delhi.The Centre's response came as Delhi, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan and Maharashtra indulged in a blame game and squabbled over oxygen supply and distribution while demanding an increase in their quota.On Wednesday, several hospitals in the national capital like Sir Ganga Ram City Hospital, St Stephen's Hospital and Holy Family Hospital in Okhla said they only had oxygen for two to five hours. Other hospitals too had been facing a depleting stock for the last few days.Later in the evening, Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, who had claimed a "serious oxygen crisis", said that Delhi's oxygen quota has been increased and thanked the Centre.Deputy Chief Minister Sisodia accused the Haryana government of blocking medical oxygen supply to Delhi, but the Haryana government vehemently refuted the allegations.Haryana health minister Anil Vij said given the increased demand for oxygen due to a surge in coronavirus cases, his state can spare the supply for others only after meeting its demand.He alleged that a tanker carrying medical oxygen for COVID patients in hospitals, which was going from Panipat to Faridabad, was ''looted'' by the Delhi government and said all oxygen tankers will now move with a police escort.In Maharashtra, which has the highest number of cases, 24 patients on ventilator support at the Dr Zakir Husain Hospital in Nashik suffocated to death when their oxygen supply stopped suddenly because of a malfunction in the main storage.The government will probe if the tragedy was due to negligence, Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope said.Nashik was the worst-hit city in the country in terms of cases per million residents, according to the Union health ministry's data compiled between March 16 and April 15 from major cities.Tope had on Tuesday said the state was "managing with 1,550 metric tonnes of oxygen" per day at present and is going to buy oxygen generators, besides using thermal power plants for oxygen production.In Latur, relatives of Covid-19 patients took to the streets on after a private hospital claimed a shortage of oxygen.Last week, at least six Covid-19 patients died in the ICU of a government hospital in Madhya Pradesh's Shahdol allegedly due to low pressure in the medical oxygen supply.Expressing concern over the situation, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said, "India is among the largest producing countries in the field of oxygen, medicine and vaccine production. Yet deaths are occurring due to lack of oxygen and medicines in the country, which is unfortunate."Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh wrote to Union Health Minister Harsh Vardhan, seeking a daily allocation of at least 120 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen for the state.The Tamil Nadu government said it would take up with the Centre, diversion of about 45 metric tonnes of medical oxygen from a city plant to Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, even as it asserted that the state had adequate stocks of oxygen.Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath directed the officials to install GPS devices on oxygen tankers and provide adequate security to oxygen plants.The country was struggling to sustain the medical oxygen supply lines as the active cases crossed the 21-lakh mark with the 2,95,041 fresh infections in a span of 24 hours, pushing India's total tally of Covid-19 cases to 1,56,16,130.The death toll increased to 1,82,553 as daily fatalities crossed 2,000 for the first time, according to the Union Health Ministry data updated on Wednesday morning.Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh, Delhi, and Rajasthan are among 10 states that account for over 76 per cent of the new cases registered in the country.Assuring that the government was working with speed and sensitivity to meet the increasing demand of oxygen, Prime Minister Narendra Modi had in his address to the nation on Tuesday night called upon all stakeholders, including the pharmaceutical industry, to deal collectively with the immediate challenge of the shortage of oxygen cylinders.The railways said on Wednesday it will run its second Oxygen Express to Uttar Pradesh after a request was received from the state government.The railways also said that it had received a similar request from Madhya Pradesh.The Maharashtra government too had written to the railways to explore whether liquid medical oxygen tankers could be moved by the rail network.In Delhi, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said, "We are producing 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen per day of which 6,600 metric tonnes is being allocated to the states for medical purposes.""Presently, we have issued instructions that, leaving a few industries, the supply of industries will be restricted so that more and more oxygen can be made available for medical use," he said.Bhushan said that a 24x7 control room has been set up where the state governments can tell the problems they are facing if their truck is stuck or the movement is getting hindered."When you deal with such a huge challenge, such a big pandemic and multiple stakeholders, then at times there is panic and confusion and the onus and responsibility is on the Union government and state governments to work together and respond promptly so these challenges are addressed," Bhushan said.The officials said they are also evaluating applications from suppliers abroad for import of oxygen.The Centre has floated a tender for import of 50,000 MT of medical oxygen and a pre-bidding meeting was held yesterday, according to official sources.Also on Wednesday, the Delhi High Court directed the Centre to supply oxygen to hospitals for Covid-19 patients by whatever means required, saying if necessary, the entire production of oxygen from industries including steel and petroleum should be diverted for medical usage.Addressing a press conference, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said 0.04 per cent of 17,37,178 individuals, who received the second dose of Covaxin, were positive for Covid-19, while 0.03 per cent of 1,57,32,754 people, who took the second dose of Covishield, contracted the infection.Bhargava who presented the data said vaccines reduce the risk of infection and prevent death and severe infection.The Centre has opened up Covid-19 vaccination to all citizens over 18 years of age from May 1.Meanwhile, the Goa government announced a 10-day-long night curfew in the state effective from Wednesday and imposed curbs on restaurants, cinema halls and casinos in the wake of rising Covid-19 cases.Several other states have already imposed lockdown-like restrictions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hospitals-face-oxygen-shortage-centre-increases-states-quota-101619028627243.html
21-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Govt releases data showing severity, virulence in second wave similar to first||Amid a staggering surge in Covid-19 cases across the country, the Centre on Wednesday sought to quell the panic by presenting a slew of statistics to show the severity and virulence in the ongoing second wave of the contagion are about the same as the first one.The government, however, cautioned that there is no clear sign of any downtrend in the Covid graph yet.Also, 21,000 people have tested positive for Covid-19 after taking the first dose of either Covishield or Covaxin vaccines, while nearly 5,700 contracted the infection after taking both the doses, government data revealed.At a press conference on Wednesday, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said the Covid-19 positivity rate in 146 districts was more than 15 per cent, while it was between five and 15 per cent in 274 districts."We are in the midst of the second wave of the pandemic and we are still seeing an upsurge. We cannot comment when the numbers will come down," ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said.Presenting data from both the waves of the pandemic, he said 8.07 per cent of cases reported in the first wave were between the age group of 10-20 years, while in this time it is 8.50 per cent."In the age group 20-30 years, 20.41 per cent cases were reported in the first wave, while in the second it was 19.35 per cent."The data was released amid a growing panic that the second wave is somehow more powerful and could cause greater havoc. India is already grappling with a shortage of oxygen and other medical supplies as its health infrastructure is stretched to the limits due to spiralling Covid-19 cases.Asked how did the second wave catch the country unawares, Bhushan said, "Today is not the time to go into why did we miss or did we miss or did we prepare. It is time to jointly face the pandemic. Once we emerge from it successfully, then probably... we would be able to deliberate on this.""All the energies of the Centre and states are focused in a collaborative manner to tackle this, save lives and to ensure our health system is strengthened," he stressed.The health secretary referred to the data to show that 67.5 per cent of those affected in the first wave were aged 30 and above, it was 69.18 per cent this time.In the age group 30-40 years, 21.05 per cent Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave and 21.15 per cent in the. For the age group 40-50 years, the percentage of cases in the first wave was 17.16 per cent and in the second it is 17.50 per cent.During the first wave, in the age group 50-60 years, 14.80 per cent cases were reported in the second wave it was 15.07 per cent. Between 60 and 70 years, 9.01 per cent cases were reported in the last wave and 9.99 per cent now.Age-wise comparison of fatalities in 2020 and 2021 showed that 0.27 per cent of deaths reported in the first wave were below 10 years, while in the second it was 0.34 per cent. Between 10 and 20 years, 0.53 per cent deaths were reported in the first wave and 0.31 per cent in the second, the data showed.In the age group of 40-50 years, 11.98 per cent of deaths were reported in the first wave, while 10.82 per cent of fatalities were registered in the second.  About those getting infected even after inoculation, Bhargava said it included 0.04 per cent of the 17,37,178 people who received both doses of Covaxin and 0.03 per cent of 1,57,32,754 who took the second dose of Covishield.Vaccines reduce the risk and severity of infection, and prevent death, he said, adding if one gets infected even after immunisation then it is called breakthrough infection.So far, 1.1 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered out of which 93 lakh received the first dose. Among them, 4,208 people got infected. About 17,37,178 people received the second dose of which only 695 tested positive for Covid-19, the ICM DG said.About Covishield, 11.6 crore doses have been administered of which 10 crore received the first dose and 17,145 contracted the infection, he said, adding 1,57,32,754 people took the second dose and of that 5,014 got infected."Two to four per 10,000 breakthrough infections have occurred, a very small number. They were mainly healthcare workers prone to occupational hazards. This is a very small number and not at all worrisome."Also, the highly transmissible second wave also contributes minuscule to the percentage so this could have been even zero per cent," the ICMR DG said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul noted that there is a risk of infection even after vaccination. "So, we stress on people following Covid-appropriate behaviour even after taking the jabs."  Amid reports of oxygen shortage in the country, the Centre said of the total 7500 metric tonnes of oxygen being produced in India daily, as on date 6,600 metric tonne is being allocated to states for medical use and efforts are being made to increase supplies in the coming days.Paul appealed to the states, hospitals and nursing homes to ensure rational use of oxygen.The health secretary said, "We have issued instructions that keeping aside a few industries, the supply to industries will be restricted so that more oxygen can be made available for medical use."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-govt-releases-data-showing-severity-virulence-in-second-wave-similar-to-first-101619024647051.html
21-04-2021||India||Maharashtra government announces strict curbs in state after surge in Covid-19 cases||The Maharashtra government on Wednesday night announced stringent restrictions in the state due to a huge surge in the cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The state government has also issued Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for the curbs.The restrictions will come into effect from 8pm on Thursday and will be in place till 7am on May 1, according to state government's order."The state government is satisfied that the state of Maharashtra is threatened with the spread of Covid-19 virus, and therefore it is imperative to take certain emergency measures to prevent and contain the spread of virus," the Maharashtra government order said.🚨New strict restrictions under #BreakTheChain🚨To be implemented from 22nd April 2021, 8pm onwards pic.twitter.com/ifyrcQCbnHThe state government's SOPs say that no travel will be allowed by public or private transport unless it is for essential services, medical reasons or vaccination.The number of guests at weddings have been capped at 25 and the function must not go on beyond two hours, according to the government order. The families who are found flouting the order, will be fined ₹50,000 and the "misused" location shall be closed till promulgation of Covid-19 as a disaster remains in force.The government and private offices have been asked to allow only15 per cent staff. The SOPs also say that only those private offices which provide essential services or are in exempted categories can function.This comes on a day when Maharashtra recorded 568 deaths due to Covid-19 - its highest ever since the beginning of the pandemic - and 67,468 fresh cases. This pushed the statewide tally to 40,27,827 and death toll to 61,911, according to the bulletin of Maharashtra government's health department.The highest statewide daily count so far - 68,631 - was reported on April 18.Out of the 568 fatalities, 303 occurred in the last 48 hours, the health department said.The ministers in Maharashtra confirmed earlier on Wednesday that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray will announce a stringent lockdown. On Tuesday, the issue of a stricter lockdown was discussed in a cabinet meeting where the majority was in favour of a long lockdown in the state, instead of present restrictions which they said have not been able to contain the spread of Covid-19 in the state.“There is no alternative, but to go for a strict lockdown," Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said after Tuesday's meeting.Maharashtra has already been under restrictions such as night curfew and district lockdowns due to rising number of Covid-19 cases, which have shown a sharp surge since February. Last week, Section 144, which bars the gathering of more than four people, was also imposed.There have been concerns in Maharashtra over the deteriorating Covid-19 situation. The state health department has projected that there would be a shortage of beds in nearly all districts by May 2.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-surge-maharashtra-government-announces-complete-lockdown-in-state-101619023118489.html

21-04-2021||India||In a first, 303 kg Colombian cocaine worth ₹2000 crore seized by DRI||In the largest ever seizure of cocaine in India, the Directorate of Revenue and Intelligence (DRI) has recovered 303 kgs of pure cocaine from a container in Tuticorin, which officials suspected was produced in Colombia and smuggled to India by one of the cartels there. The value of the seized high-purity cocaine is estimated to be ₹2,000 crore in the international market, with the potential to provide over 3 lakh individual street deals of cocaine per gram. The cocaine, officials cited above said, was concealed in a consignment imported in a container declared to be containing wooden logs. It was wrapped in multiple layers of packing material having been compressed as bricks. The container originated from Panama, transited through the ports of Antwerp and Colombo, before reaching India but an officer said that 302 bricks or blocks of cocaine, which is of pure quality, weighing 303 kgs have markings from Colombia. Multiple agencies are trying to identify the cartel behind smuggling such large quantity of cocaine to India and those involved here in buying such a huge consignment. Drug enforcement experts said this kind of modus operandi for smuggling cocaine in India has never been witnessed earlier. “Two similar consignments having cocaine bricks/blocks were unearthed abroad in last couple of years – one by UK authorities in July last year and another by Australian Federal Police in 2019. But never have we come across such a huge consignment of cocaine in India,” said an officer who didn’t want to be named. According to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), the highest amount of cocaine seized by all agencies combined was 34 kg in 2019. The powerful addictive stimulant drug is made from the leaves of coca plant native to South America and its primary markets are North America and Europe. There is no cultivation of coca plant in India and smaller amounts smuggled here are for urban centres like Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru and are brought by suspects from West African drug syndicates. “Very few instances of smaller quantities of smuggling of cocaine from Argentina and Brazil have come to our notice in the past but such a huge consignment of Colombian cocaine is a shocker,” said a second officer who didn’t want to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-a-first-303-kg-colombian-cocaine-worth-rs-2000-crore-seized-by-dri-101619017904681.html

21-04-2021||India||Four farmers trampled to death by elephant in western Odisha||Four farmers in western Odisha districts of Bargarh and Balangir were trampled to death by one wild elephant in two separate incidents on Wednesday morning, said forest officials.In Balangir district, farmer Biranchi Sahu (55) was attacked by an elephant at Darlipali under Loisingha Forest range when he was collecting mangoes.Another tusker that had strayed from a herd had killed three farmers in Gaisilet Range of Bargarh district a few hours ago. Farmers Mala Seth (54) and Biranchi Kumbhar (56) of Umrad village and Siba Seth (60) of Nathpali village were out of their home to relieve themselves when attacked by the elephant, claimed a forest official. Tension gripped the area following the incident.Forest department officials said the same tusker, part of a herd, had trampled a farmer in Bargarh district five days ago.Wild elephants in Odisha have killed 633 people in the last seven years between April 1, 2014 and March 31, 2021. The state has already reported 12 human deaths this month alone.In October last year, the state forest and wildlife department formed a taskforce and asked it to prepare a master plan to reduce man-animal conflict over the next three years. The idea was to have a long-term plan instead of a knee-jerk reaction every time such a conflict occurs and to prioritise the resources adequately. The taskforce was supposed to give its suggestion within six weeks of its formation. However, the forest secretary did not respond to the queries whether the task force had submitted its recommendations.Wildlife activists said deforestation, large-scale mining and quarrying, industrialisation, destructions of elephant corridors and irrigation canals have led to the increasing number of encounters with humans.“Odisha’s forest department has done little to stem the rise in conflict. They are clueless... All mitigation plans provided by experts over the last two decades remain largely on paper,” alleged Biswajit Mohanty, a wildlife expert.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/four-farmers-trampled-to-death-by-elephant-in-western-odisha-101619015023977.html
21-04-2021||India||Goa Congress chief claims MLAs used forged document to win disqualification case||Goa Congress chief Girish Chodankar filed a police complaint on Wednesday alleging 10 ex-party MLAs gave fake documents to the assembly speaker to save themselves against disqualification and to prove that the group had lawfully merged with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2019. Chodankar’s claim comes a day after the speaker dismissed the disqualification petition he filed against the MLAs.In his complaint, Chodankar said that the MLAs produced what was purported to be a resolution of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee agreeing to merge with the BJP, which he said was completely fabricated, as no such resolution was taken.“[They] have conspired together and created a false document claiming it to be a resolution of Goa Pradesh Congress Committee... held on 10.07.2019... wherein a resolution was passed to merge the party in Goa Legislative Assembly into Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The aforesaid document is created illegally using counterfeit letterhead and counterfeit seal of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee,” Chodankar said in his complaint.10 of the Congress’ 15 MLAs joined the BJP in September 2019. The Congress alleged that their switch amounted to defection under the 10th schedule of the Constitution and sought their disqualification from the assembly. The MLAs on their part claimed 2/3rd of the Congress legislature party had lawfully merged with the BJP. As per the anti-defection law, two-thirds of the strength of a legislative party is allowed to merge with another, without inviting disqualification. The speaker Rajesh Patnekar dismissed the disqualification plea filed by Chodankar on Tuesday. He also dismissed another disqualification plea filed by Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party (MGP) against two of the three party MLAs who joined the BJP nearly six months earlier on March 27, 2019.Chodankar’s complaint attempts to challenge the MLAs claim that they duly merged with the BJP. “Firstly, no such meeting of the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee was called for and/or took place on 10.07.2019 and therefore the question of passing of any resolution as claimed in the said documents does not even arise,” the complaint says. It adds that no record of such a meeting was found in the register books maintained by the Goa Pradesh Congress Committee Committee. “As per the minutes book, there is record of meeting of office bearers of Pradesh Congress committee held on 29.05.2019 and 24.07.2019 and there is no other meeting in between the said meetings and certainly not of any meeting on 10.07.2019,” Chodankar said.Chodankar has requested for registering a case of forgery, cheating, using a forged document as genuine, of giving false evidence and of possessing and using a counterfeit seal against the ten MLAs.Responding to the allegation of forgery, Isidore Fernandes, who was one among the ten MLAs to switch to the BJP, accused the Congress of “forum hunting” to save face after the party’s case was dismissed by the speaker yesterday.“The Speaker has dismissed the case. They are now filing complaints, cases and petitions in various fora. The law will take its own course,” Fernandes said.Speaker Rajesh Patnekar said he couldn’t comment on the authenticity of the documents before him. “I cannot comment on whether it (the many documents in his file) is genuine or not. It is for the police to decide. The law will take its course,” Patnekar told HT.Legal expert advocate Cleofato Almeida Coutinho said the Congress complaint may not hold much value at this stage.“I’m pretty sure that there must not have been a resolution of the GPCC. But if the document submitted before the speaker is only signed by the former Congress MLAs, the question of forgery may not arise,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-congress-chief-claims-mlas-used-forged-document-to-win-disqualification-case-101619014603923.html

They have asked for commercial & unloading point details. Reply for the same is being given today itself. Thereafter, planning of movement shall be done. The second Oxygen Special carrying around 7-8 empty tankers to Bokaro and back will start tonight from Lucknow. Many more are planned in the coming days,” a railway ministry spokesperson said.The Indian Railways will deploy first-of-a-kind ‘Oxygen Express’ trains over the next few days to transport Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) and Oxygen cylinders in bulk along key corridors amid high demand from states grappling with the second wave of the Covid 19 infection.With several states reporting a shortage of oxygen, the government on Friday directed them to ensure uninterrupted movement of medical oxygen carrying vehicles along their borders and said they must not impose any curbs on production and supply of the essential public health commodity anywhere.The first Oxygen Express with seven tankers loaded on a Roll on Roll off train left Kalamboli Goods Yard in Navi Mumbai on Monday for Vizag where it will be loaded with liquid medical oxygen for Maharashtra. The train is scheduled to reach Vizag on Wednesday night before taking off for Mumbai, officials said.A meeting was held between Railway Board officials and state transport commissioners and representatives of the industry on April 17 on issues related to the transportation of liquid medical oxygen.The railway ministry on Friday approved the transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers under its Roll on-Roll off model as a special case following a request from the Maharashtra government.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-a-request-from-up-govt-second-oxygen-express-to-run-to-lucknow-101619014303951.html

The move will come as a shot in the arm for Delhi where several top hospitals have reported depleting oxygen reserves."Central govt has increased Delhi’s quota of oxygen. We r very grateful to centre for this," Kejriwal said in a tweet.Central govt has increased Delhi’s quota of oxygen. We r very grateful to centre for this.Sisodia earlier said at a press conference that many people from neighbouring states are coming to Delhi for Covid-19 treatment and demanded that the Centre should increase the national capital's quota from the present 370 metric tonne (MT) to 700 MT.Also Watch: ‘Delhi govt looted our oxygen tanker’, says Haryana ministerHe also talked about the oxygen crisis being faced by many city hospitals. The Delhi deputy chief minister called for Centre's intervention to sort out issues of oxygen supply between different states, saying "only Centre decides the oxygen quota".India's top private hospital in the national capital Sir Ganga Ram had earlier announced oxygen shortage with 58 patients awaiting treatment and 35 waiting outside the hospital for admission.The crisis is compounded by similar reports emerging from other parts of the national capital where hospitals are racing against time with their oxygen quota.Sisodia said that the Delhi government has talked to the Centre to get the oxygen tanker which was stuck at a plant in Faridabad.Later in the day, news agency ANI reported that Sir Ganga Ram hospital received 45 cylinders at 6pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-grateful-says-kejriwal-as-govt-increases-delhi-s-oxygen-quota-amid-shortage-101619012804001.html
21-04-2021||India||'Very small number': Govt on those testing Covid +ve after taking vaccine dose||More than 21,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 after taking the first dose of either Covishield or Covaxin, while over 5,500 contracted the infection after taking the second dose, the Centre said on Wednesday.Addressing a press conference, ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said 0.04 per cent of 17,37,178 individuals, who received the second dose of Covaxin, were positive for Covid-19, while 0.03 per cent of 1,57,32,754 people, who took the second dose of Covishield, contracted the infection.Bhargava who presented the data said vaccines reduce the risk of infection and prevent death and severe infection."After vaccination if one gets infection then it is known as breakthrough infection," he said.So far, 1.1 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered. Out of which 93 lakh received the first dose and out of that 4,208 (0.04 per cent) people got the infection which is four per 10,000 individuals. About 17,37,178 people received the second dose of which only 695 (0.04 per cent) tested positive for Covid-19, Bhargava said.Of Covishield, 11.6 crore doses have been given. Ten crore received the first dose and 17,145 i.e. 2 per 10,000 people contracted the infection. About 1,57,32,754 individuals took the second dose of covishield and of that 5,014 (0.03 per cent) got infected. Two to four per 10,000 breakthrough infections have occurred, a very small number. This was mainly healthcare workers prone to more occupational hazards, he said.According to the data, 5,709 people contracted the infection after the second dose of either of the two vaccines."This is a very small number and not at all worrisome. Secondly, the highly transmissable second wave also contribute miniscule to the percentage so this could have been even zero per cent," he said.NITI Aayog Member (Health) V K Paul noted that there is a risk even after taking vaccination so "we stress people to follow Covid appropriate behaviour even after taking the vaccination".Amid oxygen shortage in the country, Union Health Secretary Rajesh Bhushan said that 7,500 metric tonnes of oxygen is being produced in the country per day and 6,600 metric tonnes is being supplied to the states for medical use."Presently, we have issued instructions that, leaving a few industries, the supply of industries will be restricted so that more and more oxygen can be made available for medical use. We have allocated 6600 MT out of 7500 MT to states," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/very-small-number-govt-on-those-testing-covid-ve-after-taking-vaccine-dose-101619012335544.html

Thanks France esp FASF (French Air and Space Force) & French Industry for timely delivery & pilot training on schedule despite Covid-19,” the Indian embassy in France said on Twitter. Bhadauria reached France on a five-day official visit on Monday. The fighters landed at an Indian airbase late on Wednesday night.India ordered 36 warplanes from France (equivalent of two squadrons) in September 2016 for ₹59,000 crore under a government-to-government deal. The arrival of four jets will enable the completion of the first squadron of these fighters in Ambala and set the stage for raising the second squadron at Hasimara in West Bengal. All the 36 planes are likely to join the IAF’s fighter fleet by the year-end.Bhadauria, who visited the Rafale conversion training centre in France on Wednesday, said, “The Centre has provided world-class training and it is because of the level and quality of training that we were able to operationalise the aircraft quickly. It is to the credit of the French industry that despite the Covid-19 restrictions, they were able to meet the training requirements in time, and deliver all the aircraft so far more or less in time.” He said some planes had been delivered ahead of time.“This has really contributed to the overall combat potential of the IAF. I would like to thank the French government, French air force and the industry,” he said.The IAF has operated the fighter jets in the Ladakh theatre where the military is on high alert amid a border standoff with China and where both sides are negotiating disengagement of troops at friction points along the contested Line of Actual Control (LAC).India’s Rafale jets are equipped with modern weapons such as the Meteor beyond visual range air-to-air missiles, Mica multi-mission air-to-air missiles, Scalp deep-strike cruise missiles and the Hammer smart weapon.India-specific enhancements on the jets include cold engine start capability to operate from high-altitude bases such as Leh, radar warning receivers, flight data recorders with storage for 10 hours of data, infrared search and track systems, jammers and towed decoys to ward off incoming missiles.The twin-engine jet is capable of carrying out a variety of missions - ground and sea attack, air defence and air superiority, reconnaissance and nuclear strike deterrence. It can carry more than nine tonnes of weapons on as many as 14 hard points.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-chief-flags-off-4-rafale-fighter-jets-from-france-s-merignac-bordeaux-airbase-101619010703907.html
21-04-2021||India||IIT Kharagpur launches COVIRAP diagnostic technology||IIT Kharagpur has successfully commercialised its flagship healthcare product COVIRAP the novel diagnostic technology to zero on infectious diseases including Covid-19, the institute said Wednesday.The product, developed by lead researchers Professor Suman Chakraborty, Dr Arindam Mondal and their research group, has been licensed for commercialisation to the Rapid Diagnostic Group of Companies, India and Bramerton Holdings LLC, USA.A virtual press meet was organised on Wednesday by the institute in which the researchers were present along with institute director to make the announcement."The above move has taken place at a critical juncture when the recent spurt in Covid-19 infection, commonly known as the second wave, has been threatening to spread more rapidly than ever before," IIT Kharagpur Director Prof V K Tewari said."Moreover, the commercialisation of COVIRAP will initiate complete indigenisation and availability of a large range of affordable healthcare products in the Indian market as well as deep trenches of a large global market that is literally starving for the need of such technology," Tewari said.Bramerton Holdings has signed a record deal for securing global rights for commercially disseminating the COVIRAP technology developed at IIT Kharagpur in various geographical locations outside the territory of the Indian subcontinent, an institute spokesperson informed.Rapid Diagnostic has also initiated adapting the COVIRAP technology platform for Covid-19 and tuberculosis, in collaboration with IIT Kharagpur, the spokesperson said.The research team has now developed a more advanced version of COVIRAP using a step-wise isothermal nucleic acid testing technology for the rapid diagnostics of pathogenic infections including SARS-CoV-2 in individuals, Chakraborty said.The Covid-19 diagnostic test can be conducted directly from human swab samples in the portable device developed by the team, without requiring any separate facility for RNA extraction.The results can be made available within 45 minutes of obtaining the patient sample, he said.The kit has also been also supplemented with a free smartphone app to facilitate unambiguous results interpretation and automated dissemination to the patients.For use of the test, the nasal, as well as oral swab samples, are diluted in a solution and tested in the portable device by mixing with reagents that are supplied in a pre- mixed form, Chakraborty said, adding the test runs automatically in the device without intermediate manual intervention."We have conducted field trials for running the tests with the help of unskilled personnel outside controlled laboratory ambience, with no compromise in quality of the test outcome. The entire sample-to-result procedure may be conducted in the portable device, virtually anywhere and with minimal training thus making the process of testing more effective for community-level screening and early detection of any emerging infection outbreak."This may act as a key to arrest community level spreading of the infection," Chakraborty hoped.COVIRAP promises its reach to the grassroots level in catering to the needs of the last person of the society, he added.The researchers claimed COVIRAP test overcomes several potential bottlenecks faced by similar other tests in the past, for instance, poor performance outside highly controlled laboratory and lack of simple, affordable, yet generic and universal instrument that may be used for home-based testing and community healthcare for a wide variety of infectious and non-infectious diseases.Recognising the impact of the COVIRAP technology in meeting the long-standing demands of high-quality community- level testing, IIT Kharagpur has further initiated the procedure of deploying this product for on-campus use to detect possible novel coronavirus infection, the institute spokesperson said.Patents centred around this innovation have been filed in the India, USA, several other countries, in the name of IIT Kharagpur.The foreign filing license has been granted recently.Commercialisation and use in the USA and Europe under the Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) process are currently underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iit-kharagpur-launches-covirap-diagnostic-technology-101619009375246.html

21-04-2021||India||Oxygen reallocation to impact small business in some sectors: Crisil Ratings||Reallocating oxygen for medical purposes to take care of the rising Covid cases will have an adverse impact on small businesses in some sectors, domestic rating agency Crisil said on Wednesday.It said the "hiccup" seems temporary for now, and it is unlikely to impact the credit quality of the affected businesses.The impact will be greater for companies in Maharashtra, New Delhi, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, where medical oxygen demand has increased multiple times due to high Covid-19 caseloads, the agency added.The central government has barred industrial use of oxygen except in nine designated sectors from Thursday onwards to divert the available stocks for life-saving medicinal use.Demand for medical oxygen is estimated to have rocketed five-fold in the second week of April versus pre-pandemic levels as Covid-19 infections took off, Crisil Ratings said."The disruption in the supply of oxygen for industrial use would temporarily impact the revenues of small and mid-sized companies into metal fabrication, automotive components, shipbreaking, paper, and engineering," its director Gautam Shahi said.These sectors typically do not have captive oxygen plants and source their requirement through merchant suppliers for operations such as welding, cutting, cleaning and chemical processes, he added.Setting up an air-separation plant or importing oxygen is not a viable option because it requires significant lead time and involves relatively prohibitive costs, the agency said.Oxygen is consumed by industry in two ways – on-site and merchant sales. On-site is through captive plants for process-driven industries (including the nine sectors exempted by the government), which account for 75-80 per cent of oxygen manufactured in India, the rating agency said.The balance 20-25 per cent is supplied through merchant sales (called liquid oxygen) through cryogenic tanks and cylinders, it said, adding the healthcare sector consumes only 10 per cent of merchant sales.Its associate director Sushant Sarode said the disruption in oxygen supplies for industrial use will last for six to eight weeks as of now."Affected sectors can partly manage their oxygen requirements with the inventory. Therefore, we expect only a limited decline in revenue for them," Sarode added.However, a prolonged and intense second wave that curtails oxygen supply to industries for a longer period than expected will exacerbate the downside risk in affected sectors, the agency said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/oxygen-reallocation-to-impact-small-business-in-some-sectors-crisil-ratings-101618998772797.html

But there will be a shortage of hospitals if we panic and become anxious about the pathway we have to follow."Dr Trehan also appreciated the pharmaceuticals industry and their contribution in dealing with the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic."Only after a certain set of tests and symptoms, Remdesivir is to be used... It is not a ram-baan, it is only required in some cases," Trehan added.On the shortage of oxygen in the country, Dr Trehan said, "If you don't need oxygen, don't use it.

The pandemic has accelerated the global demand for it. The need for oxygen has increased to 1.1 million cylinders in low to middle-income countries alone, according to the World Health Organisation.The officials said the diversion of oxygen from Tamil Nadu has affected the state’s plans to ensure a specified supply of oxygen as Covid-19 cases have been on a rise.

Deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia held a press conference on the issue where he talked about how severe the crisis is and how the government is coordinating with the Centre to ensure availability of oxygen.Delhi's health infrastructure faces a severe hit as top hospitals continue to report depleting oxygen supply.India's top private hospital in the national capital, Sir Ganga Ram is the latest in the queue to announce oxygen shortage with 58 patients awaiting treatment and 35 waiting outside the hospital for admission, reported news agency ANI.The crisis is compounded by similar reports emerging from other parts of the national capital where hospitals are racing against time with their oxygen quota.St Stephen's Hospital in the Tis Hazari area is under acute shortage of oxygen with supply left for only two hours, an official from the hospital told ANI."There are around 300 Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital. There is a limit of only two hours of oxygen supply. We are struggling and seek immediate help. Oxygen supplier Linde India has stopped our supply," a hospital official told ANI on Wednesday.Shortly after, deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia confirmed that the oxygen supply stopped from a plant in Faridabad by a Haryana government official was restored. "Today, the central government intervened and after that, the oxygen meant for Delhi was released from a plant in Faridabad. Yesterday too, the oxygen meant for Delhi was not released from Modinagar plant. We ultimately had to call a very senior minister in the Centre late at the night and get it released," Sisodia said at a press conference.Haryana’s health minister Anil Vij, who also holds the portfolio of state’s home affairs, reiterated that his state has a sufficient supply of oxygen and it is willing to send it to Delhi but only after meeting their own demand. “We are being forced to give our oxygen to Delhi,” he alleged.On Tuesday, hospitals in Delhi said they had enough oxygen left for another eight to 24 hours, while some private institutions had enough to cater for only four or five hours.Television channels showed images of people with empty oxygen cylinders crowding refilling facilities as they scrambled to save stricken relatives in hospital."We were completely blocked out of supplies yesterday, but by the end of the day we received some and it is helping us today," said Charu Sachdeva, an official at the state-run Rajiv Gandhi Cancer Institute and Research Centre.Delhi, a city of 20 million people, recorded 28,395 new cases and 277 deaths on Tuesday, its highest tally since the pandemic began. Every third person tested for coronavirus proved positive.About 80 of 142 hospitals in Delhi had no beds left for virus patients, government figures showed.On Wednesday, India witnessed a jump of 295,041 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 2,023 deaths in the last 24 hours, both figures are the highest ever since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the latest data released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/only-5-hours-of-oxygen-left-at-delhi-s-ganga-ram-hospital-as-covid-19-crisis-grows-101619004402004.html

Maken sought a monthly cash transfer of ₹6,000 into the accounts of the poor, adequate food supply to the urban poor during the lockdown and dignified arrangements for the migrant workers returning to their home states.There was no immediate response from the Bharatiya Janata Party.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/congress-attacks-govt-for-failing-to-anticipate-second-covid-wave-101619003683661.html
21-04-2021||India||In second wave, India has twice the number of 2020's active Covid-19 cases: Govt||India's second wave of coronavirus is more virulent than the first wave as the country is witnessing twice the number of maximum active Covid-19 cases seen last year, officials said on Wednesday. "There are 21,57,000 active cases in India currently i.e. twice the number of maximum active 19 Covid-19 cases last year," Union health secretary Rajesh Bhushan said in a press conference. The government, Bhushan said, plans to increase supplies of medical oxygen in the coming days even as a nationwide surge in coronavirus cases soaks up supplies. The government was also evaluating applications from suppliers overseas for oxygen imports, Bhushan said, adding that state leaders in the country should plan its use.On Wednesday, India witnessed a jump of 295,041 cases of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) and 2,023 deaths in the last 24 hours, both figures are the highest ever since the beginning of the pandemic, according to the latest data released by the Union ministry of health and family welfare.Comparing both waves, the health ministry officials said that the severity, virulence and demography of the victims in the ongoing second wave of Covid-19 are about the same as the first wave.A total of 146 districts reported Covid-19 positivity rate of more than 15%, while 274 districts reported case positivity between 5 and 15%, Bhushan said.According to the figures shared by Bhushan, 4.03 per cent Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave in those below 10 years, while 2.97 per cent cases were registered in the second wave."In the age group 10-20 years, 8.07% Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 8.50% cases were registered in the second wave. In the age group 20-30 years, 20.41% cases were reported in the first wave, while 19.35% cases were registered in the second wave," he said.Bhushan further shared data which showed that in those aged 30 and above, 67.5% Covid-19 cases were reported in the first wave, while 69.18% Covid-19 cases registered in second wave.The officials explained the breakthrough infection, where a person tests positive for Covid-19 after taking the vaccine doses, and said that it is not worrisome. More than 21,000 people tested positive for Covid-19 after taking the first dose of either Covishield or Covaxin, while over 5,500 contracted the infection after taking the second dose, the officials said.ICMR Director General Balram Bhargava said 0.04% of 17,37,178 individuals, who received the second dose of Covaxin, were positive for Covid-19, while 0.03% of 1,57,32,754 people, who took the second dose of Covishield, contracted the infection."After vaccination, if one gets infection then it is known as breakthrough infection," he said. According to the data, 5,709 people contracted the infection after the second dose of either of the two vaccines."This is a very small number and not at all worrisome. Secondly, the highly transmissible second wave also contributes minuscule to the percentage so this could have been even zero percent," he said.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-second-wave-india-has-twice-the-number-of-2020-s-active-covid-19-cases-govt-101619002150831.html

The patient found a bed and was soon showing signs of recovery."Finally, it was help online that worked as people responded with information," Shiv said.India is reporting more than 250,000 new Covid-19 cases a day in its worst phase of the pandemic. Hospitals are turning away patients and supplies of oxygen and medication are running short.In response, people are bypassing the conventional lines of communication and turning to Twitter to crowdsource help for oxygen cylinders, hospital beds and other requirements.People in need and those with information or resources share telephone numbers of volunteers, vendors who have oxygen cylinders or drugs, and details of which medical facility can take patients using hashtags like #COVIDSOS.Some users have offered to help with home-cooked meals for Covid patients quarantining at home and to meet a host of other needs like arranging to feed pets."Twitter is having to do what the government helpline numbers should be doing," wrote Twitter user Karanbir Singh."We are on our own folks."Twitter is not as widely used in India as Facebook or WhatsApp but it is proving a more valuable tool to get pleas for help out in the coronavirus crisis, largely because of its "re-tweet" function that can quickly amplify a message through users' networks of contacts.A Google spreadsheet drawn up by a volunteer group that collates information on hospital beds, oxygen supplies, blood plasma and ambulance helplines in various states is being rapidly shared on Twitter and runs into dozens of pages.Bengaluru-based software developer Umang Galaiya, 25, has created a website that allows users to select the name of the city and the requirement - be it oxygen or the antiviral drug remdesivir - and then directs them to results on Twitter using its advance search feature.His website has received more than 110,000 hits."Every other tweet on my feed has been about Covid," Galaiya said."I'm glad people are finding this helpful."But for some, help comes too late.On Monday, journalist Sweta Dash posted a plea for help on Twitter to find bed with a ventilator for a pregnant woman in New Delhi. Her message spread quickly through more than 100 retweets and a Delhi government official soon suggested a hospital.But a few hours later, Dash posted another message."The patient passed away".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/twitter-becomes-platform-of-hope-amid-the-despair-of-india-s-covid-19-crisis-101618999539917.html

He added the journey normally costs ₹1,500. “Thousands of migrant workers are at bus terminals and railway junctions, and they all want to return home at the earliest.”Migrant workers began pouring into interstate bus terminals and private bus depots as Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced a six-day lockdown until April 26 citing a surge in Covid-19 infections. The Covid-19 cases have risen by close to 600% in the last two weeks and inundated hospitals and triggered a shortage in critical medical supplies in Delhi.Kejriwal requested migrant workers to stay put as this was a small lockdown and promised to take care of them as part of efforts to avoid their mass exodus like during the nationwide lockdown last year.Prem Lal Rishi, 35, a daily wager migrant worker from Bihar, said he is stuck in Delhi along with his 12 colleagues. “The bus fare has increased to ₹3,000,” he said over the phone. “We are left here jobless, and the situation is more frightening than the last year.”Another migrant worker, Munna Kumar, from Purnia said they can neither eat nor sleep. “We are living here under constant fear and just want to return home,” Kumar said over the phone.Scores of migrant workers died in road accidents during the lockdown last year as tens of thousands of them walked and cycled home from big cities after losing their jobs until special buses and trains were arranged for them.At least three people in their 20s were killed and five injured after an overcrowded bus returning from Delhi with over 100 migrant labourers and students overturned in Madhya Pradesh’s Gwalior on Tuesday.Also Read | Delhi govt offers financial aid, free shelter and food to prevent exodusKulanand Mishra, 55, who returned home in Purnia district on Sunday, said he left Mumbai, where he works at a hotel, along with his wife and two children by a train in panic. “At Katihar junction, we had to undergo a rapid antigen test and luckily were tested negative,” he said. “We saw people falling prey to the pandemic and no help was coming from anywhere.”About 2.5 million migrant workers returned to Bihar when the national lockdown was imposed to check the Covid-19 spread in March last year, according to government data.Officials said migrant workers have again started returning also from places such as Bengaluru by trains and buses increasing the risk of transmission of the virus. Tests are mostly being conducted of those coming on trains. But hundreds coming by buses go unchecked, a district officer in Katihar said, requesting anonymityBihar on Tuesday reported 10, 455 cases and 98 deaths. The active cases in the state have gone up to 57,000 and the recovery rate has decreased to 82.99%. Minister Vijay Kumar Chaudhary said the state government is now better equipped and prepared for the challenge of providing jobs to the migrant workers returning home. “All the DMs [district magistrates] have been directed to provide jobs to migrants as per their skills under various government schemes... The preparedness at the district level of giving jobs is much more robust and systematic than last year,” he said. He added chief minister Nitish Kumar has urged people working in other states to return and assured them jobs would be provided.Chaudhary said the government learnt from last year’s lockdown when there was a huge inflow of migrants. “We have a database of skills of migrants who returned last year and skill mapping was done. This is being put to use for providing jobs.”The state government last year drew flak for its failure in making proper arrangements of transportation of migrant workers and for failing check migration over the last few decades.Social activist Vijay Kumar Shreevasatava said last year the return of migrant led to a huge spike in Covid-19 cases particularly in Seemanchal. “The situation this time is more frightening and the government must act as migrant workers have started returning en masse.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bihar-steps-up-surveillance-as-migrant-workers-begin-returning-101618998763623.html

21-04-2021||India||Goa healthcare under severe stress amid record Covid-19 numbers||Goa’s healthcare infrastructure was under severe stress amid a record rise in Covid-19 cases on Tuesday when infections crossed one thousand mark for the first time and 26 deaths were recorded-- the highest since the pandemic outbreak. Official data showed the positivity rate on Tuesday touched 32% -- meaning one among every three persons tested, was found positive.As it made a grim record with 1,160 infections on Tuesday, the state also witnessed a shortage of oxygen beds in government-run hospitals and a three-day backlog in releasing RT-PCR test results. Under severe stress, the government roped in the private sector to provide at least another 250 beds within a week and ordered cancellation of all non-Covid elective surgeries for a month, barely a day after the chief minister assured residents that there was no “shortage of medical facilities and expertise”.“In most cases it has been observed that the deaths occurred due to late admissions to the hospitals. Therefore, I humbly request everyone to take symptoms seriously, and if observed, to immediately rush to the nearest hospital. There is no shortage of medical facilities and expertise. Delaying medical care will only decrease chances of recovery,” Goa chief minister Pramod Sawant said on Monday when 17 deaths were reported in the preceding 24 hours-- the highest daily count, before it was overtaken on Tuesday with 26 deaths. A reality check shows that while non-oxygen beds were available in Covid-care centres, oxygen beds in government-run establishments had run out. The Goa Medical College, which set aside 185 non-ICU (intensive care unit) beds for Covid care, was dealing with a patient load of 242. At the ICU, only five of the 20 beds were available as of Monday night.“[I] Couldn’t arrange a bed with oxygen for someone tonight in Goa. The patient has passed away, his wife is wailing. Young couple. In tomorrow’s health bulletin, he will be a statistic,” Shruti Chaturvedi, who has been volunteering to help patients in Goa find beds, tweeted on Tuesday.The situation on Tuesday made the CM accept that the situation was “worrisome”.“Today (Tuesday) we had 26 unfortunate deaths caused by #COVID19. The rise in cases is worrisome. A High Level meeting will be held along with the State Disaster Management Authority tomorrow (Wednesday) at the Ministerial Block, Porvorim to discuss the further plan of action to contain COVID,” Sawant said. Some new measures were expected after the meeting on Wednesday, said officials.In the interim, the private hospitals have been requested for additional beds since official records showed that several patients at the overstretched premier Goa Medical College and Hospital were left lying on stretchers.State health minister Vishwajit Rane said Goa’s private hospitals agreed to help when approached on Tuesday.“The representatives (of private hospitals) have voluntarily decided to increase their bed capacity... by reserving 250 additional beds in their respective facilities. My sincere gratitude to them for this gesture,” Rane said on Tuesday.Speaking to HT, a leading doctor at Goa’s Manipal Hospital said, over the next week, around 300 additional beds will be made available by private hospitals.“If there is coordination between hospitals then the capacity can be increased even further... some small hospitals can dedicate themselves entirely to Covid management and others can deal with others like cancer and heart patients,” said the doctor. He added that managing two categories of patients requires separate staffing, which adds avoidable stress to the system. “The government can coordinate this and have a single point of contact for those requiring hospitalisation,” he said. Rane said a nodal officer will be appointed to ensure seamless coordination.Rane also instructed the heads of departments in the state health facilities to cancel all planned non-emergency, non-Covid surgeries till 15th May, allowing only scheduled chemotherapy and dialysis.CM Sawant’s handling of the Covid-19 resurgence has been criticised, specially his persistent refusal to screen tourists. Sawant claims screening will affect tourist arrivals-- bad news for a state dependent on tourism for economic survival. His government has also not heeded to demands to postpone or cancel school examinations for class 9th and 10th.“It’s high time people impose a self-lockdown, this government just wants to fill up its pockets claiming the economy will collapse if they imposed a lockdown. Economy can never be above life,” Manthan Laad, a resident of the state, said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-healthcare-under-severe-stress-amid-record-covid-19-numbers-101618997863619.html

From now, I've ordered police protection for all tankers,” the minister was quoted as saying by news agency ANI. He adding that if state governments engage in this kind of activity, the health infrastructure will suffer.Anil Vij, who also holds the portfolio of state’s home affairs, reiterated that Haryana has a sufficient supply of oxygen and it is willing to send it to Delhi but only after meeting the state’s own demand. “We are being forced to give our oxygen to Delhi,” he alleged. There has been no reaction so far to Vij's allegations from the Delhi government of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP).The allegations come against the backdrop of a shortage of oxygen reported from several states. Delhi government on Tuesday evening stated the city was facing an emergency situation and that their supply of oxygen for Covid-19 patients will last only for a few hours. However, several oxygen cylinders were supplied to hospitals in Delhi.Since Tuesday, Delhi's Ganga Ram hospital has received 4500 cubic metres of oxygen and Lok Nayak Jai Prakash (LNJP) Hospital has received 10 tons of oxygen, news agency ANI reported. "This supply is sufficient for the current situation," LNJP hospital officials were quoted as saying.Haryana’s Anil Vij also spoke about the status of Remdesivir in the state and said there are two depots of the antiviral drug that is used in Covid-19 treatment. “I have deployed drug dept officials there. The movement of every vial will be recorded. Chemists have been informed to check the Aadhaar card before giving Remdesivir injections. We have already arrested four people,” he told news agency ANI.As the availability of oxygen has become crucial during the second wave of the coronavirus pandemic, the central government has sped up efforts to meet the increasing demand, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in his address to the nation on Tuesday. “Centre, state governments and private sector are trying that every needy person gets oxygen. Efforts to increase oxygen production and supply are on at various levels. Measures like installing new oxygen plants, providing one lakh new cylinders, diverting oxygen from the industrial use, Oxygen Rail are being undertaken,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/-haryana-oxygen-tanker-looted-by-delhi-government-alleges-minister-anil-vij-101618995594010.html

21-04-2021||India||HC verdict likely on Thursday on WhatsApp, Facebook pleas against CCI order||The Delhi High Court is likely to pronounce verdict on Thursday on pleas by social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp challenging competition regulator CCI's order directing a probe into the latter's new privacy policy.Justice Navin Chawla had on April 13 reserved judgement on the two separate petitions by Facebook and WhatsApp.While reserving its decision, the court had observed that the order of the Competition Commission of India (CCI) does not reflect an investigation into abuse of dominant position and rather appears to be concerned with privacy issues of consumers.The observation came in response to CCI's stand that it was not examining the alleged violation of individuals' privacy which was being looked into by the Supreme Court.CCI had argued before the court that the new privacy policy of WhatsApp would lead to excessive data collection and "stalking" of consumers for targeted advertising to bring in more users and is therefore an alleged abuse of dominant position."There is no question of jurisdictional error," it had contended and added that WhatsApp and Facebook's pleas challenging its decision were "incompetent and misconceived".  WhatsApp and Facebook have challenged the CCI's March 24 order directing a probe into the new privacy policy.CCI had also told the court that only after the investigation can it be determined whether the data collection by WhatsApp and sharing it with Facebook would amount to an anti-competitive practice or abuse of dominant position.CCI had also contended that the data collected, which would include an individual's location, the kind of device used, their internet service provider and whom they are conversing with, would lead to creation of a customer profile and preference which would be monetised by way of targeted advertising and all this amounts to "stalking".The two social media platforms, on the other hand, had contended that when the top court and the Delhi High Court were looking into the privacy policy, then CCI ought not to have "jumped the gun" and intervened in the issue.They had also said that CCI's decision was an abuse of the commission's suo motu jurisdiction.They claimed that the CCI in the instant case has "drifted far away" from the competition aspect and was looking into the privacy issue which was already being looked into by the apex court and the Delhi High Court.The two social media platforms had also told the court that private conversations continued to be protected by end to end encryption and WhatsApp cannot read what people message each other.They had also contended that the most of the data generated belonged to WhatsApp as the only data provided by customers was their phone number which is required to register on the messaging platform.In January, the CCI on its own decided to look into WhatsApp's new privacy policy on the basis of news reports regarding the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-verdict-likely-on-thursday-on-whatsapp-facebook-pleas-against-cci-order-101618991792375.html

While one dose of this two-dose vaccine will cost ₹600 for private facilities, it will cost ₹400 for the state governments."For the next two months, we will address the limited capacity by scaling up the vaccine production. Going ahead, 50 per cent of our capacities will be served to the government of India's vaccination programme, and the remaining 50% of the capacity will be for the state governments and private hospitals," the world's largest vaccine maker, by the number of doses produced, said.This comes after the Centre decided to decentralise vaccine purchase and procurement while allowing everyone above the age of 18 years to get inoculated against the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease.Watch: Serum Institute announces Covishield prices for state govts & private hospitalsOn Covaxin open market price, Bharat Biotech says 'never took money from govt'Announcing its decision, the government said vaccine makers — as of now Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotch — will be given the freedom to sell 50 per cent of their monthly doses in the open market, which state governments and private hospitals can buy. Without mentioning any upper ceiling of the price, the Centre said manufacturers will have to make an advance declaration of the price before May 1. "Based on this price, state governments, private hospitals, industrial establishments etc., would be able to procure vaccine doses from the manufacturers. Private Hospitals would have to procure their supplies of Covid-19 vaccine exclusively from the 50% supply earmarked for other than Govt of India channel. Private vaccination providers shall transparently declare their self-set vaccination price. The eligibility through this channel would be opened up to all adults, i.e. everyone above the age of 18," the Centre said.Covishield for corporatesAs of now, it will be challenging for SII to supply vaccine doses independently to corporate entities, CEO Adar Poonawalla said. "We would urge all corporate and private individuals to access the vaccines through the state-facilitated machinery and private health systems," Poonawalla said, adding that after four to five months when the initial surge of the demand is met, vaccines will be made available in retail and free trade.Is ₹600 costlier than private markets in other countries?Serum Institute of India has said that even at the open market, it is offering Covuishield at a comparatively affordable rate than other vaccines in the world. For example, it said American vaccines cost over ₹1,500 per dose at the private market, while the per-dose price of Russian vaccines is more than ₹750. The price of Chinese vaccines is also around ₹750 in private markets, Serum Institute said.What changes from May 1 in Covid-19 vaccination drive? FAQs answeredHere's how much you will have to pay for SII's Covishield from May 1The price will depend on where you are getting inoculated. As the Centre has notified, vaccination will continue as before in government of India vaccination centre, free of cost, to eligible population, which includes healthcare workers, frontline workers and all above the age of 45 yearsState government hospitals: ₹400 plus hospital charge, if anyPrivate hospitals:  ₹600 plus hospital charge, if any.Uttar Pradesh and Assam have announced free vaccination for people above the age of 18 years.Covishield versus CovaxinIn the first phase of vaccination which catered to healthcare and frontline workers, both the vaccines were free. In the second phase, as the drive was expanded to include senior citizens and people above 45 years of age, in a gradual manner, private hospitals were allowed to charge ₹250 per dose of either of the vaccines. In the third phase, which will begin from May 1, vaccination at the government of India centres will remain free, while private hospitals and state government hospitals will charge, according to their procurement price. So at private facilities, the price per dose may exceed ₹600 if the hospitals levy charge for administering the vaccines.Bharat Biotech has not yet announced its open market, per-dose price, but its chairman Dr Krishna Ella reportedly said he would like to get the maximum price to cover all costs, including the ₹350 crore that the company spent on clinical trials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-will-cost-rs-600-per-dose-at-private-hospitals-rs-400-at-govt-101618989125065.html

Union health minister Dr Harsh Vardhan dismissed the complaints and said those were efforts to cover up the inefficiency of the state governments. In a reply to former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's letter to PM Modi on vaccination, Vardhan slammed Congress members and accused them of fuelling "vaccine hesitancy".Slamming the Gandhi family for its politicisation of the vaccination, BJP leader Sambit Patra on Wednesday said, the nation is watching how the Gandhis are criticising an issue that should not be politicised. "When things shouldn't be politicised, Congress, especially Gandhi family is doing politics. Priyanka Gandhi gave an interview and Rahul Gandhi tweeted. The nation is watching how they're criticising and it will reply. Gandhi family's arrogance is being reflected," the BJP leader said.The Gandhis are not the first to criticise the government's open vaccine policy, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Tuesday questioned the Centre's decision to make vaccine available in open market at a time when states are complaining of shortage. "Yesterday the PM said the medicine (vaccine) will be available in open market. Where is the open market, where is the availability? You have already shipped out the majority of stock to foreign destinations," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/for-a-few-industrialists-rahul-gandhi-compares-vaccine-policy-with-note-ban-101618988744580.html

The commission could not find any evidence to the contrary, he added. One of the members of the enquiry commission said that the enquiry report was submitted to Uttar Pradesh’s home department and the Supreme Court on Monday after distilling the facts of the case for around eight-nine months since the enquiry commission was set-up. He refused to get into the details of the findings.A UP home department official confirmed that the commission found no evidence against the state police. He added that the commission noted in the report that no one from the public, media or Dubey’s family came forward to present any proof against the police or to challenge their claim. He said the commission probed the matter nearly for around nine months before submitting its report.The Uttar Pradesh police had claimed that it shot down notorious gangster Vikas Dubey in a genuine encounter after he tried to escape from police custody during the transit following his arrest in Madhya Pradesh’s Ujjain. Dubey and his gang members had earlier killed eight policemen including deputy superintendent of police (DSP) Devendra Mishra in Kanpur’s Bikru village on the intervening night of July 2 and 3, 2020.The incident led to an uproar over the law and order situation in the state and allegations that Dubey was under political patronage and his arrest could spill the beans on the alleged deep nexus between criminals, politicians and the police.UP police formed several teams to catch Dubey, who was finally arrested outside the famous Mahakal temple in Ujjain on July 10 last year. He was gunned down while being brought back to Kanpur by UP police. The police claimed that Dubey tried to escape from police custody after snatching a pistol from one of the police personnel, when a SUV carrying him met an accident and flipped on the outskirts of Kanpur. Dubey’s five associates were also killed by UP police in encounters between July 3 and 10, 2020.It led to widespread allegations that the encounters were staged, following which, the three-member enquiry commission, comprising justice BS Chauhan, retired Allahabad high court judge SK Agarwal and retired UP director general of police (DGP) KL Gupta, was formed in the last week of July 2020.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vikas-dubey-encounter-judicial-commission-gives-clean-chit-to-up-police-101618986222242.html

21-04-2021||India||On Covaxin open market price, Bharat Biotech says 'never took money from govt'||As the Centre has now 'liberalised vaccine pricing so that vaccine manufacturers can sell 50 per cent of their v in the open market— keeping the other 50 per cent for Centre — the pricing remains a contentious issue. Dr Krishna Ella, chairman and managing director of Bharat Biotech which made Covaxin has said he would like to get the maximum price to cover all costs, including the ₹350 crore that the company spent on clinical trials, Mint reported.Speaking at the 6th National Leadership of All India Management Association, Dr Ella said Bharat Biotech had not asked the government for any money for the clinical trials or any advance money for increasing the capacity of vaccine manufacturing. To meet the demand of phase 3 of the vaccine drive, which will begin from May 1, Bharat Biotech is setting a target of producing 30 million doses, which will soon be accelerated to 70 to 75 million doses per month.The Centre has approved a payment of about ₹4,500 crore as advance to Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech — the two vaccine makers of the country, for ramping up their supplies. Out of this ₹4,500 crore, Serum will get ₹3,000 crore and Bharat Biotech will get ₹1,500 crore.Though Serum Institute CEO Adar Poonawalla and Bharat Biotech MD Dr Krishna Ella have not anything explicitly on the pricing, reports suggest that the price of Covaxin and Covishield in the open market can be around ₹1,000 per dose, while in government facilities, vaccines will remain free. Both the companies supplied vaccines at a subsidies rate of around ₹200, which was later negotiated to ₹150, to the Centre for the first and second phase of vaccinations in which healthcare workers, frontline workers, people above the age of 45 years were inoculated. For people above 45 years, the government allowed private facilities to charge a maximum of ₹250 for each dose of the vaccine, which includes ₹150 for the vaccine and ₹100 as the service charge.For the open market, the Centre has not fixed any upper limit. What it has said is that the makers will have to announce a transparent price before May 1, while it will set aside the other 50 per cent for the Centre. Serum Institute will supply 200 million doses and Bharat Biotech will supply another 90 million doses to the government by July at the pre-agreed rate.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-covaxin-open-market-price-bharat-biotech-says-never-took-money-from-govt-101618982372146.html

The rise in daily Covid-19 cases continued on Tuesday as well with 62,097 new cases. The state also reported 519 deaths, the highest single-day toll since the outbreak started in March last year. The earlier highest toll was 186 on September 15, 2020, when the toll touched 515. The overall toll in the state stands at 61,343 now.The surge has led to a sharp rise in active cases to 683,856 and going by the current transmission rate, the state health department has predicted that by May 2, additional 411,140 cases could be added to the tally, which will be a record 60% growth in 12 days.Also Read | Covid vaccine for adults: Maharashtra to import; free jabs in Assam, UPThe deteriorating situation will burden the already strained health infrastructure in the state. While most of the districts will not be left with any beds – for isolation, oxygen or ICU beds and ventilators, many of them would require substantial additional infrastructure, according to the report which was presented before the state Cabinet in its Tuesday meeting. This is the reason most of Cabinet members were in favour of a complete lockdown. A decision is likely to be taken by chief minister Uddhav Thackeray by Wednesday evening, said state health minister Rajesh Tope after the meeting.Currently, the state has 782,953 isolation beds, 72,869 oxygen beds, 24,986 ICU beds, 10,629 ventilators. In terms of district-wise health facilities, Thane, Pune, Raigad, Ahmednagar, Jalna, Beed, Latur, Parbhani, Hingoli, Nagpur, Wardha, Bhandara, Gondia and Chandrapur will have no facility for any new patient by May 2. On the contrary, everyone will require additional isolation beds, oxygen beds, ICU beds and ventilators, according to the projection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/with-519-deaths-maharashtra-records-highest-single-day-covid-toll-101618975061758.html

A total of 2,020 new deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Tuesday, the highest ever, pushing the total number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 182,591, according to HT’s dashboard.India’s daily death count has exceeded 2,000 once before on July 16 last year, when there were 2,006 deaths lodged, but that number was inflated due to Delhi and Maharashtra adding around 1,500 deaths that had previously gone unreported.Tuesday was the fifth day in a row that the single-day fatalities in the country have broken all previous records. The seven-day average of daily deaths now stands at 1,490, and has surpassed the peak seen during the first wave of the outbreak – on average, 1,169 people died for the week ending September 16.The average positivity rate – the proportion of tests that return positive for Covid-19 – has now soared to 16% in the past week, the highest ever recorded in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-deaths-cross-2k-for-the-first-time-new-cases-near-300000-101618973588521.html

But in this phase vaccine manufacturers will be allowed to provide 50 per cent of their production to the open market after declaring a fair price.Uttar Pradesh and Assam have already announced that vaccination in these states will be free of cost — irrespective of whether it's a private facility or a government facility."Corona will be decimated, India will win," Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, who is under Covid-19 treatment at present, tweeted on Tuesday, announcing the Cabinet's decision to make vaccination free in the state.प्यारे प्रदेशवासियों, आज मंत्रिपरिषद की बैठक में यह निर्णय लिया गया है कि उत्तर प्रदेश में 18 वर्ष से अधिक आयु के सभी प्रदेशवासियों का कोरोना टीकाकरण @UPGovt द्वारा निःशुल्क कराया जाएगा।कोरोना हारेगा, भारत जीतेगा...Assam health minister Himanta Biswa Sarma announced that the state will utilise the funds collected in Assam Arogya Nidhi and will provide vaccines free to everyone above the age of 18 years.

The state is planning to bid for Sputnik V, Pfizer and Moderna if they are available.In the first phase of vaccination, which began on January 16, the Centre provided free vaccines to healthcare workers and frontline workers. In the second phase of vaccination, senior citizens and people with co-morbidities above the age of 45 years were made eligible for vaccination that remained free at government facilities and was charged ₹250 per dose at private facilities. The phase from April 1 was extended to everyone above the age of 45. Till then, vaccine procurement was being done centrally. But as states are accelerating the pace of vaccination to keep up with the rapid spread of the infection, the Centre's supply to the states is depleting fast and vaccine centres are facing temporary closure.(With agency inputs)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccine-for-all-above-18-what-up-assam-maharashtra-plan-for-phase-3-from-may-1-101618972601313.html

Expert answers||As India reels under the second wave of Covid-19 infections, many people who have tested positive for the coronavirus disease are isolating themselves at home.

On Tuesday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of those who died due to the virus and said, “The challenge is huge, we have to overcome it collectively with determination, courage and preparation.”While the government has decided to widen its immunisation programme and vaccinate all citizens above 18 years of age, it shared the suggestions of Dr CS Pramesh, director Tata Memorial Hospital, on what medicines to take if someone has tested Covid-19 positive.Here’s a look at Dr CS Pramesh’s adviceWhat medicines definitely help in Covid-19?Unfortunately, very few. What definitely works is proning and oxygen (when saturation is low), and steroids (Dexamethasone) for moderate to severe diseaseWhat medicines should you take if you have Covid-19?*If your oxygen saturation is fine and you have no symptoms other than fever, all you need is Paracetamol*There is some data that inhaling Budesonide helps you recover faster, but no hard endpoints like reduced mortality*There is no evidence to suggest that anything helps - including Favipiravir/Ivermectin. Don't waste your time desperately trying to procure themWhat about Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma?*Remdesivir doesn't work in all patients, probably a small subgroup of those requiring oxygen, but not sick enough that they require ventilation. And even here, it doesn't reduce mortality, probably helps early recoveryWhat medicines should you take if you have #COVID19? How much do Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and Convalescent Plasma help? Take a look at the key information around #COVIDVaccines by @cspramesh you MUST know! #IndiaFightsCorona pic.twitter.com/RU2xJ6VfaY*Tocilizumab also helps only in very specic subgroups - those requiring rapidly increasing levels of oxygen or rapidly deteriorating respiratory parameters,*There is even less evidence to support the use of Convalescent Plasma for Covid-19. Almost all studies done so far have shown that it is of no benefit*Please allow your physician to decide when Remdesivir/Tocilizumab is required. There are very limited situations when they are beneficial and please don't pressurise the physicians to prescribe it - much of the shortage today is because of unnecessary prescriptions||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/what-medicines-should-you-take-if-you-have-covid-19-expert-answers-101618972562236.html

She will be handed over to the Delhi Police when they arrive here. More facts about the girl are being gathered,” said Chhavi Singh, Inspector at the local women police station.According to the girl’s brother, she is around 15-year-old, police said.Meanwhile, the Bajrang Dal activists claimed that the girl was introduced to the 24-year-old man, a resident of Bareilly’s Fatehganj area, almost a year ago. Today, the man, along with his parents, was trying for a court marriage using forged papers, they alleged, adding that they got information about it on Monday night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ruckus-outside-bareilly-court-over-love-jihad-101618971621654.html

21-04-2021||India||Maharashtra lockdown? Uddhav Thackeray likely to announce decision today||Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray is likely to announce whether the state needs to be placed under a strict lockdown — in his address scheduled after 8pm on Wednesday, Maharashtra ministers have confirmed. On Tuesday, the issue of a stricter lockdown was discussed in the Cabinet where the majority was in favour of a long lockdown in the state, extending for a week or two, instead of night curfew or the imposition of Section 144."Tomorrow after 8 pm, the Chief Minister will announce the decision on lockdown in the state. We have requested the CM to announce a complete lockdown in the state from tomorrow at 8 pm. This was the request of all ministers to the chief minister. Now it is his decision," Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said.Maharashtra urban development minister Eknath Shinde said there is no way out other than a complete lockdown as the health infrastructure of the state is under severe strain. "We have demanded complete lockdown in today's cabinet meeting. The cases are increasing. There is a scarcity of oxygen. There is no way out other than a complete lockdown," Shinde said.Food and civil supplied minister Chhagan Bhujbal said, "We have made all the efforts to minimise the Covid-19 figures. He will announce the decision (to impose lockdown) tomorrow after finalising a detailed Standard Operating Procedure."Covid-19 situation in MaharashtraOn Tuesday, Maharashtra reported 62,907 fresh Covid-19 cases and 519 deaths. Out of 519 deaths, over 200 were from last week and before, but was added to the toll on Tuesday, the health department clarified. The number of active cases in the state stands at 6,83,856.Why stricter lockdown?Since February, the state is seeing a sharp spike in the number of fresh cases. Restrictions in the forms of district lockdown, local lockdown, night curfew, were put in place since the last week of February. In April, the state has been brought under Section 144, which bars the gathering of more than four people. All shops except those dealing with essential items have also been closed. But an official lockdown has not been announced in the state. The need for an official lockdown is being felt as people are still flouting the existing restrictions.The state cabinet has also cancelled class 10 exams.Lockdown last resort?Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Tuesday said lockdown should be the last resort to combat the present situation and more focus should be given to creating micro-containment zones.Since February, Maharashtra has been averting a complete lockdown but, as Cabinet ministers have emphasised, stricter restrictions seem to be the need of the hour in the state.What will a stricter lockdown be like?In the set of curbs that have been announced in March and April, public transport has not been curtailed. This time if the state goes for a full lockdown, public transport services, including that of Mumbai locals, may strictly be brought down. The government has already revised the timing of essential shops and allowed them to function between 7am and 11pm.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-lockdown-uddhav-thackeray-likely-to-announce-decision-today-101618969523556.html
21-04-2021||India||US 'very closely' tracking course of Covid-19 outbreak in India||United States is "very closely" tracking the course of the Covid-19 outbreak in India, US State Department spokesperson Ned Price has said.The statement from Price comes after US Secretary of State Antony Blinken spoke to external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Monday and discussed US-India cooperation on climate change, Covid-19, and other global challenges and pledged to remain in close contact on these and other issues of mutual concern."There are protocols in place, requiring testing for international travel. What is true is that we are tracking the course of the COVID outbreak in India very closely as I mentioned before, Secretary Blinken and Foreign Minister Jaishankar did discuss it yesterday," Price said in a statement on Tuesday."We are committed to doing what we can both at the present. And going forward, to see to it that this virus is brought under control and I spoke again of our engagement with the who are funding to COVAX, the Quad arrangement that of course implicates. What we're seeing in India," he added.Price further said that Secretary Blinken consistently makes the point that as long as the virus is out of control and is uncontained anywhere around the world, it continues to present a risk to the American people.On the Covid-19 vaccine, Price said, "Our priority is ensuring the distribution of a safe and effective vaccine to millions of Americans to all Americans who are able to take advantage of it. But we also know that we need to continue to demonstrate that leadership.""When it comes to countries beyond our borders and that's precisely what we've done, as I mentioned before, we've re-engaged. The who we've committed USD 2 billion to Kovacs another USD 2 billion over time, we've spoken to our partnership with Canada and Mexico," he added.Price further stated that it is not only in US' interest to ensure that the American people are vaccinated, the "only other point I would make is that the rest of the world also has an interest in seeing to it that the American people are vaccinated and that the virus is brought under control"."US has more deaths than any other country around the world. More than 550,000 at this point 10s of millions of cases. So, again, as long as the virus is uncontrolled anywhere, it is a threat to people everywhere. That is true in the United States. That is true in countries around the world. And it's precisely why we are taking this, this approach," he said.US' Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has already advised its citizens to avoid travelling to India amid a massive surge in Covid-19 cases in the country.In a statement, the CDC on Monday said: "Because of the current situation in India even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants and should avoid all travel to India. If you must travel to India, get fully vaccinated before travel. All travellers should wear a mask, stay 6 feet from others, avoid crowds, and wash their hands."The Covid-19 situation in India has been deteriorating amid the second wave of coronavirus infections. For the past four days, the country has been reporting in excess of two lakh coronavirus infections and over 1,000 related deaths on a daily basis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-very-closely-tracking-course-of-covid-19-outbreak-in-india-101618966441770.html

She was reacting to Union minister V Muraleedharan's 'Covidiot' remark."I do not know he made the allegations on what basis. Kerala CM has not violated any Covid-19 protocol. People holding positions should not make such remarks," Shailaja said.Upon his discharge, Muraleedharan had slammed Vijayan by calling him 'Covidiot'. "Covidiot, you know what it means. There is no other word that can be used for a chief minister who continuously violates Covid-19 protocols. As per doctors of Calicut Medical College, the Kerala CM tested positive on April 4 and on April 6 he voted without following the protocols," the minister said.The health minister further said as per the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) and the Centre's guidelines, asymptomatic patients can be discharged after three to four days and can be treated at home. "But in Kerala, we are following a 10-day discharge policy to make sure everyone is safe," Shailaja added.She further said the Kerala chief minister was asymptomatic and was shifted to the hospital to carry out tests. "He was shifted to carry out tests, before which he was in home quarantine. During the process of the test, he turned Covid negative and is now in home quarantine. Where is any Covid-19 protocol violation in all this?" she asked.Vijayan was on Wednesday discharged from Kozhikode Medical College after treatment. He was admitted to medical college on April 8 after being diagnosed with coronavirus disease (Covid-19). After seven days, he got tested negative and was subsequently discharged.Opposition parties, Congress and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have sought action against him for allegedly flouting Covid-19 protocols.On Wednesday, Kerala reported 8778 new Covid-19 infection cases, 2,642 recoveries and 26 deaths.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-health-minister-denies-allegations-cm-vijayan-flouted-covid-19-norms-101618486210685.html

Kumbh is held periodically at four different locations in India -- Nashik, Haridwar, Prayagraj, and Ujjain.

21-04-2021||India||Second wave may derail economic gains: Analysts||The raging second wave of Covid-19 infections in India is threatening to derail the gradual recovery the economy has achieved in the last one year, the trajectory of the Nomura India Business Resumption Index (NIBRI) indicates.It took almost a year for NIBRI to reach close to 100, which captures the pre-pandemic levels of activity. It reached 99.3 in the week ending February 21. In the eight weeks since then -- latest data is available for the week ending April 18 -- it has fallen continuously and come down to 83.8.NIBRI was lower than 83.8 in the week ending October 25, 2020. It was 83.3 that week. The disruptive effect of the second wave can be understood from these numbers. It took seventeen weeks for NIBRI to reach from 83.3 to 99.3. But it has just taken eight weeks for it to undo those gains.Experts believe that the worst is yet to come as more states resort to restrictions to prevent the surge in infections from overwhelming medical infrastructure. “While lockdown stringency has not increased since last week, this may be temporary, as states could impose stricter restrictions in response to the burdening of hospital infrastructure,” said a note by Nomura economists Sonal Varma and Aurodeep Nandi. “This suggests the economic impact of the second wave could intensify in coming weeks, particularly through the mobility route, with the downside risk of spreading to the wider economy, even as power demand and labour participation rate so far remain largely unaffected,” the note added.While the note believes that “business resumption index (NIBRI)... probably has yet to bottom”, it sees the economic impact as “short-term (one-three months) and less severe (than in Q2 2020), due to a more pandemic-adept economy”.“Overall, we expect a loss of sequential momentum in Q2 2021, but once the second wave passes (we assume July-September), it should result in a release of pent-up demand in the subsequent quarters. In addition, the economy should benefit from faster vaccinations after June, the lagged impact of easy financial conditions, front-loaded fiscal activism and strong global growth. We expect GDP growth at 11.5% y-o-y in 2021, up from - 6.9% in 2020, with downside risk,” Varma and Nandi said.Also read: Maharashtra warns of strict lockdown as curbs roll out elsewhereOther experts believe the pace of vaccinations will be critical to minimising the damage to the economy. A research note by Pranjul Bhandari at HSBC Securities and Capital Markets India Private Limited said that “the growth cost of these (Maharashtra and Delhi) lockdowns could be 1% of the country’s GVA in the June quarter and could rise further, if they are extended or replicated by other states”. The key to economic recovery would be the pace of vaccinations, Bhandari argued.“A scenario analysis suggests that, if India manages to gradually ramp up vaccine supply and the vaccination rate rises from 3m doses/day now to about 5m doses/day by August, it could cover about 50% of the population (two doses/person) by the end-2021,” her note said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/second-wave-may-derail-economic-gainsanalysts-101618957694367.html

Now when the number of cases in the second wave of Covid is spiralling like anything, the Centre has chosen to tactically indulge in empty rhetoric and shy away from its responsibility for making available vaccines to the people of the country,” Banerjee wrote.She pointed out that the announcement made on Monday did not address major issues like ensuring quality, efficacy and stable flow of supply of required number of doses by the manufacturers. “It is apprehended that the announced policy might lead to unscrupulous mechanisms in the market, including pricing of vaccines as it appears to be based on market prices which may put the common people under huge financial burden,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centres-vaccine-policy-hollow-mamata-to-pm-101618953799911.html

It said that chief justices of the high courts could initiate the process of the appointment of ad hoc judges only after they have already made recommendations of permanent judge for more than 20% of the regular vacancies. The court allowed the high courts to seek recourse to the extraordinary provision under Article 224A of the Constitution after noting that the backlog of cases have crossed the figure of 5.7 million, while the consistent ratio of vacancies across the high courts was almost 40%. The ad hoc judges should be usually assigned cases pending for more than five years, and will not be permitted to perform any other legal work, the top court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/apex-court-clears-decks-for-five-ad-hoc-judges-in-high-courts-101618950976198.html
21-04-2021||India||ICSE cancels Class 10 examinations||The Council for Indian School Certificate Examination (CISCE) late on Monday withdrew its previous decision to postpone Class 10 exams and announced it was cancelling the tests to ensure the safety of students at a time when the Covid-19 outbreak in the country is “worsening”. Class 12 tests will, however, be held at a later date.The board said earlier it will defer both Class 10 (ICSE) and Class 12 (ISC) exams, initially scheduled from the first month of May. It gave Class 10 students the option to either write the exams later, or get evaluated on the basis of an alternative criteria.“Given the present worsening situation of Covid-19 pandemic in the country, the CISCE has decided to cancel the ICSE (Class 10) 2021 examination... The safety and well-being of our students is our topmost priority and of paramount interest,” CISCE chief executive and secretary Gerry Arathoon said in a statement on Tuesday.With Monday’s decision, Class 10 students no longer have the option to appear for the exams. They will, instead, be evaluated on a “fair and unbiased” criteria for evaluation. “The criteria on which basis the results will be declared for the ICSE (Class 10) students and the date of result declaration will be announced by CICSE later,” Arathoon added.The board’s announcement also comes days after the central government directed the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) to cancel the Class 10 board exams and postpone the Class 12 tests.The Class 12 (ISC) tests still stand postponed, as per the notification issued by the board on April 16, and a decision on the new dates will be taken in June. In 2020, over 200,000 students appeared for the ICSE Class 10 exams and over 88,000 students for Class 12 exams across the country.This is also the second year in a row that students will not appear for the Class 10 exams. The CISCE exams were cancelled in 2020 shortly after the pandemic took hold in India. Students were then evaluated on the basis of internal assessment. Students of both classes 10 and 12 were assessed based on the best three percentage marks obtained in subjects for which board exams had already been conducted and the marks of their internal assessment as well as their projects were taken into account.Parents said that they were relieved. “With the rising infections, it is best not to have exams altogether. The previous circular would have led to confusion and two students from the same class would be evaluated on different marking criteria,” said the parent of an ICSE-affiliated school in Goregaon near Mumbai.Kavita Sanghvi, principal of Chatrabhuj Narsee Memorial School, in Mumbai’s Vile Parle said, “Students are happy and parents are concerned about the internal marking, report cards and the desire to know how the board plans to work out the logistics.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/icse-cancels-class-10-examinations-101618945838692.html
21-04-2021||India||Use lockdowns only as last resort: PM to states||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday asked state governments to consider lockdowns as the last resort in the fight against coronavirus, urging people to adhere to Covid-19 protocols and maintain discipline to help the government save both lives and livelihoods.Modi’s televised address to the nation came at a time when most states have imposed night curfews and restrictions on assembly and movement of people. Several big states, such as Maharashtra, have shut down commercial establishments and curbed attendance in office and some, like the national capital, have imposed lockdowns to arrest the second wave of infections.But the Prime Minister asked the states to focus on micro-containment zones instead. “We have to save the country from lockdown. States should consider using lockdown as the last resort…if we all follow Covid-19 norms, there will be no need for a lockdown,” he said.In his 20-minute speech, Modi empathised with the pain of those who lost loved ones to the virus, sought the help of children to publicise Covid-19 norms, asked states to look after migrant workers and hailed the country’s scientists and health care professionals. He also said the government was committed to increasing the country’s hospital beds and oxygen supply. The country posted 294,284 new cases on Tuesday, taking the total number of infections to 15.6 million. A total of 2,020 deaths were reported due to Covid-19 on Tuesday, the highest ever, pushing the total number of people who have lost their lives to the disease to 182,591, according to HT’s dashboard.The Opposition blamed Modi for not taking specific steps to arrest the second wave of infections. “Shri Narendra Modi’s address to the nation was again today nothing but empty talk,” said Congress general secretary Ajay Maken.Also read | UP to administer Covid-19 vaccines to beneficiaries free of cost: CM AdityanathA day after opening up the vaccine drive to all adults, the PM spoke at length about the research and development of indigenous vaccines and pointed out that the world’s largest Covid-19 vaccination drive started with two made-in-India vaccines. “Today, the cheapest vaccines are available in India,” he said.Modi also touched upon the exodus of migrant workers from major cities to the countryside – a sample of which was seen in Delhi this week after the government announced a weeklong lockdown – and urged state governments to take migrant workers into confidence. “States should ask migrants to stay put. This will help gain their trust that they will get the vaccine and not be forced to stop their work,” he said.For the first time, the Prime Minister also turned to children—who played a major role in making Swachh Bharat a success—and sought their help in curbing transmission of Covid-19 disease. “I want to say one thing specifically to my child friends. They played an important role in Swachh Bharat. Now you should create such an atmosphere at home that people do not leave the house unnecessarily without work or any reason. Your determination can bring big results,” the PM said.He also asked young people to make small committees in residential societies, apartments and neighbourhoods to help bring Covid-19 discipline. “If we do this then governments will not need to impose curfew or lockdown,” he said.The PM narrated how India improved its health and medical infrastructure to combat the pandemic last year. Acknowledging that demand for oxygen was very high in some areas, Modi said, the Centre, states and the private sector are all working to ensure enhance oxygen supply. “As soon as Covid cases increased, our pharma sector also increased production of drugs. Our drug production is higher than what it was available in January-February. Now production will increase even more. We are taking help from everyone to increase production. We are lucky that we have such a big pharma sector,” Modi said.In recent days, several states have flagged a critical shortage of medicines, oxygen and hospital beds as a spike in Covid cases has overwhelmed the medical infrastructure. Modi said that oxygen plants in states, diversion of industrial oxygen supply, 100,000 cylinders and oxygen trains were being used to augment supply.The PM tried to address public concerns over shortage and said efforts are on to quickly increase hospital beds. He said people shouldn’t give in to fear or misinformation and emphasised that India can defeat the Covid storm. He appealed to people to help the needy. “As a member of the family, I share your pain. The challenge is great but with preparation, commitment and courage, we can overcome this,” he said.The Congress criticized the speech. “The Prime Minister addressed the nation in the middle of a full-blown catastrophe….however, he chose to relinquish all his responsibilities and put the onus of saving India on NGOs, youth and bal mitras. He put the onus of doing whatever little possible on state governments,” said Maken.“Sub text of @PMOIndia‘s speech. Guys you are on your kind of on your own . If you are able to finally make it to the other side we will definitely meet again in some Utsav or Mahatsov. Until then all the best. May God be with you,” tweeted senior leader Manish Tewari.“PM Modi’s address reads as an admission that Covid wave 1 centralised response, including national lockdown, didn’t work. Wave 2 response is now a state problem further decentralised to mohala committees. What a difference a year makes,” said National Conference leader Omar Abdullah.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/use-lockdowns-only-as-last-resort-pm-to-states-101618945213238.html
21-04-2021||India||Kerala HC dismissesex-minister Jaleel’s plea against verdict of Lokayukta||Thiruvananthapuram: The Kerala High Court on Tuesday rejected a writ petition filed by former state higher education minister KT Jaleel questioning the verdict of Lokayukta that found him guilty of nepotism and misuse of official position. Following the verdict, Jaleel had to resign from the Pinarayi Vijayan cabinet last week. Later, he moved the high court saying he was not heard properly, and natural justice was denied to him. But a division bench comprising Justices P B Suresh Kumar and K Babu refused to intervene and dismissed his writ. Jaleel, who is considered close to the chief minister Vijayan, landed in trouble in 2018 after he appointed his second cousin KT Adeeb as the general manager of the Kerala State Minorities Development Finance Corporation Limited flouting all norms. Adeeb was forced to resign after a big uproar. Later, VK Mohammad Shafi, a supporter of the Muslim League, field a compliant with the Lokayukta, which found that the minister had violated all rules to appoint his relative and he was not fit to continue as a minister. After his exit, Jaleel on April 13 filed a writ petition in the HC to set aside the Lokayukta verdict on the ground that procedures were not complied with in the case. The advocate general also said the verdict was not as per rules and can be challenged. Even though the appointment was made on the direction of the minister, relaxation on eligibility condition was approved by the chief minister, according to details of the leaked files, seen by HT. But the high court refused to entertain his contention, observing that it lacked any merit and upheld findings of the anti-corruption body. The court found that the Lokayukta was acting within the scope of its powers while arriving at the conclusion. “We are of the view that the petitioner has not made out any ground for the inference in the final opinion formulated by the Lokayukta under Article 226 of the constitution,” the court observed while rejecting his plea. With the high court rejecting his writ, opposition parties stepped up pressure for the resignation of the CM. “The CM was a party to the whole crime. Relative’s qualification relaxations and appointment were approved by CM Pinarayi Vijayan. If he has some decency and propriety left in him, then CM should quit,” opposition leader Ramesh Chennithala said in Thiruvananthapuram on Tuesday. However, the ruling Communist Party of India (Marxist) kept away from the latest verdict, saying Jaleel moved the court in his individual capacity. “Jaleel has already resigned from the ministry. As an individual he has every right to question the verdict against him,” said party acting secretary A Vijayaraghavan. Earlier, Jaleel was questioned by officials of customs and Enforcement Directorate on several occasions in connection with the gold and dollar smuggling cases. His phone number was found in the call list of Swapna Suresh, the main accused in the gold smuggling case. Jaleel later admitted that he called Suresh as an employee of the consulate in connection with Ramadan kits offered by the UAE consulate last year.But his clarification invited more trouble, with experts saying he was not supposed to accept any fund or freebies without the consent of the ministry of external affairs. They added that it was a clear violation of Foreign Contribution Regulation Act (FCRA). During the investigation in the gold smuggling case, customs officials found that a heavy consignment came on March 4, 2020, in 31 bags, weighing more than 4,000 kg, which were taken to Malappuram. The minister later admitted that he took those packets to his constituency, claiming they carried religious books.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-hc-dismissesex-minister-jaleel-s-plea-against-verdict-of-lokayukta-101618945180316.html
21-04-2021||India||Congress: modified vaccine policy ‘regressive, inequitable’||A day after the Centre modified the vaccination policy, the Congress on Tuesday alleged it will overburden the states, encourage profiteering, and worsen inequality as people below 45 years will only get Covid-19 doses through private sales. The party also said the modified policy might lead to unhealthy price bidding in the absence of a price ceiling for vaccine doses.In a press conference, senior Congress leaders P Chidambaram, Jairam Ramesh and Ajay Maken said the details of the modified vaccine policy show it was “regressive and inequitable” as states with limited resources will be at a “considerable disadvantage” to fund the vaccines for those under 45.“States that are already weighed down by shrinking GST revenues, lower tax devolution, reduced grants-in-aid and increased borrowing would have to bear this additional burden. Meanwhile, nobody knows where the thousands of crores of rupees collected under PM-CARES are being deployed,” Chidambaram said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cong-modified-vaccine-policy-regressive-inequitable-101618945060834.html
21-04-2021||India||‘We’re doomed’: Delhi high court slams central govt on supplies||In a slew of directions to the Centre on Tuesday amid the raging Covid-19 pandemic, the Delhi high court on Tuesday directed immediate implementation of an order to stop oxygen for industrial use to meet the demand by hospitals, ramping up of medicine supplies and vaccinating more people.A bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said that economic interests cannot override human lives and in wake of the hospitals running low on oxygen. The bench directed the Centre to “forthwith” implement its order, which was to come into force from April 22, to prohibit the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except for those that fall in the exempted category.The court asked the Centre as to why government was waiting till April 22 to implement the order “when the needy are dying due to the shortage of oxygen”.“Economic interest cannot over right the supplies. Otherwise we are heading for a much bigger disaster. The exempted ones can consider on cutting down their supply, maybe shut down a part. A large population is not infected and we have to save it. We may lose a crore people in the country if we don’t act in time,” the high court said.“The need for oxygen is now. Any delay in this regard will lead to loss of precious lives. We direct the Centre to implement this decision forthwith and make oxygen available to needy hospitals which are running out of their supply,” the bench said in its order.Also read | For migrants: ₹5,000 aid to 171,861 registered workers, free food and medicines at 205 sheltersThe court observed that even if some industries have to cut production, they can do so, for saving lives. “Shortage is now. You have to do it (ban) now. Look into taking some oxygen from steel and petroleum industries. They have big pockets and big lobbies, but tell them if they have to cut production, then they can cut production. Lives have to be saved,” the bench said during the 3-hour-long hearing on a plea by advocate Rakesh Malhotra, who sought ramping up of tests in the city.The court asked the Centre to meet the representatives of the steel and petrochemical industries and issue an appropriate order to divert a portion of their oxygen for medical needs for a period to tide over the prevailing pandemic.The petition, which was disposed of already, was revived by the HC on Monday, noting that the virus has raised its “ugly head” once again and that the “healthcare infrastructure is at the stage of imminent collapse”.Ramp up medicine suppliesTaking note of the shortage of various life saving drugs amid the raging pandemic, the court on Tuesday asked the Centre to speak to the drug manufacturing companies and ask them to ramp up their production on “war footing”. It asked the centre to dynamically review the supply of Remdesivir injection and other medicines required.“Centre should dynamically review the needs for the supply of the reserve. This is essential to maximise the life saving drug. … Centre is directed to interact with the license holders and forthwith ramp up the production capacities,” the bench said, adding that action can be taken against the violators under the Drug Control Act.“Ramp up production on war footing….Encourage to grant voluntary licenses. If such efforts do not fructify, the government should not hesitate to invoke the jurisdiction power since the lives of the people which are being lost at a fast rate in the country take priority over everything else. Even as such powers are used, the manufacturers can be compensated by paying fair license fee,” the court said.Representing the Delhi government, senior advocate Rahul Mehra said that the hospitals in the capital were facing major shortage of oxygen. Mehra said that despite the court’s direction on Monday to M/s Inox, a private oxygen supplier, for giving 140 metric tonnes of oxygen to Delhi as agreed, not even a bit of it has been given to the city.The petitioner, Rakesh Malhotra, told the court that Gangaram Hospital, which is a dedicated Covid hospital is reportedly having acute shortage with supplies left for just a few hours.Nipun Vinayak, joint secretary, ministry of health and family welfare, told the court that according to a formula devised by the experts 378 metric tonne oxygen is being given to the Delhi. Mehra said that a law and order situation will be created in Uttar Pradesh if the oxygen is diverted to the national capital.The court, while taking note of this, issued a notice to M/S Inox and directed its MD to appear before the court on the next date of hearing. It also issued notice to the Uttar Pradesh government and posted the matter for hearing on April 22. Inox is the main supplier of oxygen to Delhi.Stop wastage, vaccinate moreDuring the hearing, the court also expressed serious concerns about wastage of Covid-19 vaccines, and stressed on the need to vaccinate more and more people. It asked the Centre and the Delhi government to see if it is possible for it to devise ways and means to select volunteers below the age of 45, who could be called to take the vaccine from the doses that are left after opening a vial.The court noted that a vial of vaccines have 10 doses and with the current scenario, vaccines are being wasted and not being utilised. Quoting a news report, it said that 44 lakh doses had to be thrown in the dustbin out of the 10 crore allocated to the states.“If we wait for 10 days, the problem may persist. We are losing valuable and young lives. The pandemic does not discriminate. Whosoever needs vaccines, give them. Everyone needs vaccination.”“In our view, wastage of a single vaccine is a criminal waste. The governments would look into the situation for full utilisation of the vaccine. Both governments to see whether it is possible for the governments devise ways and means for selecting volunteers below the age of 45 who could be called to take the vaccine in which the doses are left so they are fully utilised. This facility is available in the US,” Justice Sanghi said.Simplify testingThe bench also said that immediate action needs to be taken by the Centre to ramp up testing by simplifying the process. It said the current practice of mandatory filling a form despite the Aadhaar card of the individual being provided, is a waste of time and should be done away with.It also said that the officers should be sensitised and there should be urgency in completing work and giving clearances for setting up of new lab equipment.“We are informed that the equipment for setting RT-PCR test labs are imported...It is essential that all such medical equipment and other things should be cleared at top priority to the government.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/divert-all-oxygen-to-hospitals-immediately-hc-tells-centre-101618945060181.html
21-04-2021||India||SC stays court order on lockdown in 5 UP districts||The Supreme Court on Tuesday stayed the Allahabad high court order on virtually imposing a lockdown in the five worst Covid-19 hit districts of the state for at least two to three weeks.A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, ordered an interim stay after the state government moved an appeal against the high court order passed a day ago.The development came on a day chief minister Yogi Adityanath imposed a weekend curfew from 8pm on Friday to 7am on Monday in districts with at least 500 active cases. The curfew will not apply to essential services.“Please leave home only if urgently necessary,” he tweeted. The state reported 29,574 cases and 162 deaths on Tuesday.In the apex court, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the UP government, complained that the judicial direction regarding complete lockdown in Lucknow, Prayagraj, Kanpur Nagar, Varanasi and Gorakhpur was not warranted as the state was mindful of the situations and was already taking all possible steps to contain the spread of Covid-19.“Several steps are taken in that direction and we can satisfy the conscience of this court. Some of them, we are already doing and we don’t object to some other. But it may not be the right approach to order lockdown in five cities because there are several other factors that also need to be considered,” argued the S-G.Accepting Mehta’s submission, the bench, also comprising justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian, ordered an interim stay on the high court order, recording Mehta’s statement that the state has issued several directions to contain the spread of the virus and was taking adequate precautions.At the same time, the SC directed that the “state government shall immediately report to the high court about the steps it has taken and proposes to take in the immediate future within a period of one week in view of the current pandemic.”The court, however, decided to keep the matter pending before it and appointed senior advocate PS Narasimha as the amicus curiae (friend of the court) to assist it in the case after two weeks.Also read| Congress: modified vaccine policy ‘regressive, inequitable’On Monday, the Allahabad HC directed the UP government to strictly enforce closure of all establishments (government or private) in Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar and Gorakhpur till April 26The order was passed by a bench of justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar. It noted the recent Covid-19 surge in these cities has ‘virtually incapacitated’ Uttar Pradesh’s entire medical infrastructure.Late on Monday, the state government said there would be no statewide lockdown or any fresh restrictions in the five cities. The state government also rushed to appeal against this order before the SC. Advocate Rajat Nair drafted the appeal overnight and the S-G secured an urgent hearing from the CJI on Tuesday.The state government, in its appeal, said that although the intention behind the HC order was laudable and salutary, the HC has failed to appreciate that it encroached upon the executive domain and has passed a mandamus, which was incapable of being executed at the present stage, and if executed, would result into panic, fear and law and order situation in UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-stays-court-order-on-lockdown-in-5-up-dists-101618944998495.html

21-04-2021||India||Countries restrict travel from India as cases spike||The US, the UK, Singapore and New Zealand are among the countries that have imposed fresh restrictions on travellers from India or issued advisories against travelling to India following a massive spike in coronavirus disease cases that could spur similar actions by more nations.On Monday, India recorded nearly 274,000 new infections and the total number of confirmed cases was more than 15 million. Countries around the world have watched warily as the number of cases has grown, especially in the past two weeks, and high-profile visits and summits have been called off.The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), late on Monday, advised Americans to avoid all travel to India even if they are vaccinated. CDC placed India among “level 4” countries, or those with “very high” levels of Covid-19 cases.“Because of the current situation in India even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants and should avoid all travel to India,” CDC said.Also read| ‘We’re doomed’: Delhi high court slams central govt on suppliesSingapore’s health ministry announced on Tuesday that Covid-19 border measures will be tightened for travellers from India, who will have to stay at home for an additional seven days after the mandatory 14-day stay at dedicated facilities. The new rule will come into force from Thursday.New Zealand, which has worked assiduously to keep infection rates low, was the first country to act as cases increased in India. On April 8, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced New Zealand was temporarily suspending the entry of travellers from India, including its own citizens, for two weeks.The move followed New Zealand recording 23 new positive cases at its borders, including 17 from India.Hours after the cancellation of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India on Monday, India became the 40th country to be included in Britain’s travel “red list”. Most travellers, except British and Irish passport-holders, coming from or transiting through India won’t be allowed to enter the UK from April 23.Many experts believe the UK had held off on including India in the red list because Johnson planned to go ahead with his visit on April 25. Britain’s decision also followed the detection of more than 100 cases of the Indian “double mutant” variant of the coronavirus.Pakistan on Monday put a ban on travellers from India for two weeks, citing the spread of the new coronavirus variant. The National Command and Operation Centre placed India in the “list of Category C countries” and said there would “be a ban on inbound passengers coming from India via air and land routes”.Hong Kong suspended flights from India, Pakistan and the Philippines from Tuesday for two weeks after a mutant Covid-19 variant was detected in the financial hub for the first time. The three countries were classified as “extremely high risk” after multiple cases of travellers carrying the strain into Hong Kong in the past fortnight.Authorities in Hong Kong said on Tuesday that 53 passengers on a flight from New Delhi to the city tested positive for Covid-19.Flights from India continue to be Canada’s top source of international passengers testing positive for Covid-19, Toronto Sun reported on Tuesday. Data from Health Canada showed nearly all of the twice-daily flights between Delhi and Toronto carried passengers infected with the Coronavirus. Thirty of the 106 flights carrying infected passengers into Canada since March 4 originated from Delhi, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/countries-restrict-travel-from-india-as-cases-spike-101618944879129.html

The total length of the project is 58.19 km with a total completion cost of the project pegged at around ₹14,888 crore.“The Govt has approved Bangalore Metro Rail Project Phase 2A from Central Silk Board Junction to K.R. Puram and Phase 2B from K.R. Puram to Airport via Hebbal Junction of total length 58 km. The total completion cost of the project is ₹14,788 Crore,” the office of Piyush Goyal, the minister of railways, said in a Twitter post on Tuesday.The proposal to fund the lines was made in the Union budget this year.“Implementation of the project will provide the much-needed additional public transport infrastructure to Bangalore (Bengaluru),” a statement by the Union cabinet said.“The Metro Project in itself is an innovation over the conventional system of urban transport. The project involves integration with other urban transport system in an efficient and effective manner which is possible only by adopting innovative methods of designing, technology and institutional management,” the statement added. The approval of the two lines will breathe life into a project that aims to reduce the commute time for people traveling to the airport from the southern and eastern parts of the city.The metro line between CSB and KR Puram is around 18 km and is expected to be completed by April 2025 and the line between KR Puram to the airport, which is around 38 km, is scheduled to be operational by September 2025, according to the Bengaluru Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL).With over 9.4 million vehicles in around 800 sq km, Bengaluru was adjudged to have the world’s worst traffic congestion in a 2019 survey by TomTom, a Netherlands-based global provider of navigation, traffic and map products. According to the ninth edition of TomTom’s Annual Traffic Index, Bengaluru beat 415 other cities across 57 countries to gain the infamous tag in 2019.Successive state governments in Karnataka have continued to feed the metro as a possible solution for the growing congestion in the city, especially during peak hours.However, the delays in completing Metro projects have added to the challenges of the city’s infrastructure and its plans to get more people to use public transport to bring down congestion and rising pollution levels.“The project will streamline the urban transportation system in Bengaluru, which is stressed due to intensive developments, increase in the number of private vehicles and heavy construction in the city putting stress on travel infrastructure and industrial activities and to provide the people a safe, secure, reliable and comfortable public transport,” the Union cabinet note said.The city administration is putting together plans to encourage more non-motorised transport (NMT) and other options to get more people on the public transport system and ditch their dependence on private vehicles.“Union Cabinet approves two crucial Metro Rail routes in Phase 2A & 2B - from Silk Board to K.R. Puram & K.R. Puram to Intl Airport, of total length 58 km. This will boost public transport infra in Bengaluru. Thank you Hon’ble PM @narendramodi Ji,” said a tweet from the official handle of the chief minister.The Covid-19 pandemic has forced more people to switch and depend on private vehicles to commute within the city for fear of contracting the infection in public transport like buses and the Metro.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-clears-14-888-cr-b-luru-metro-project-101618944698390.html
21-04-2021||India||Day after 5 held, efforts to trace 900 patients who took fake remdesivir on||Bengaluru: Mysuru police have started a survey to identify at least 900 patients who were injected with fake remdesivir, said an officer aware of the development. The process began after the police arrested five people, including a nurse at a private hospital in Vidyanagar in Bengaluru, for selling fake remdesivir. A person identified as Girish was arrested by police on Monday following a raid. “We have been receiving information about the sale of Remdesivir in the market and our officers were tracking the lead. One of the leads led to Girish and we arrested him after sending decoy to purchase the vials,” said Mysuru police commissioner Dr Chandragupta. During the investigation, police had a doubt about the quality of the vial. “When we checked for the source of his supply, he was not able to give a proper answer. When we continued to question him on his supply, he claimed that he was selling fake medicine,” the commissioner added. Many vials labelled as remdesivir, but actually filled with paracetamol in liquid form and saline solution, have been seized during the raid, said police. According to the national treatment protocol, remdesivir is one of the investigational drugs approved for use in treating hospitalised Covid-19 patients. The drug has been in huge demand ever since pharmacists ran out of stock and the state government began supplying it directly to hospitals. According to police, Girish has been selling fake remdesivir since last year. He would collect used bottles of the medicine and fill it with cheap antibiotics or just saline solution, police said, adding that he has sold at least 900 to 1,000 vials to customers in Mysuru, Bengaluru and other places. Police have arrested four more people. A couple who was supplying the empty bottles to Girish and two medical representatives who were helping Girish sell the fake medicines. Their identities were withheld since the investigation is still underway. The Mysuru police commissioner admitted that police have a big task to identify those who have taken the medicine. “We are already on it. We are collecting information from the accused and we will be tracking down the patients who have taken medicines. Since he has been doing this for nearly a year now and was selling the fake medicine at MRP, there were a lot of customers,” the commissioner added. Reports of shortage of remdesivir injections increased in Karnataka as the number of Covid-19 cases continued to surge. According to medical practitioners, the anti-viral injection, which costs between ₹1,000 and ₹5,500 depending on the brand, was being sold for ₹30,000 to ₹40,000 in the black market. On Thursday, Karnataka home minister Basavaraj Bommai warned of action against those spreading rumors about the shortage. Bengaluru police on Sunday arrested at least three persons for allegedly hoarding and black marketing remdesivir. The CCB (central crime branch) conducted a drive across Bengaluru and arrested the three accused who were having illegal stock of the injection and were selling them at ₹10,500 each, which is much higher than the MRP. A total of 11 vials of injections were seized during the raid.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/day-after-5-held-efforts-to-trace-900-patients-who-took-fake-remdesivir-on-101618944639036.html
21-04-2021||India||Migrants head home amid lockdown fear||Bengaluru: Amid a steep rise in number of Covid-19 cases in Bengaluru, migrant workers are heading back home fearing an impending lockdown in the state even as railway authorities say there have been “no extra demand for trains”. Karnataka recorded 21,794 new infections and 149 fatalities on Tuesday.Jitendra Thakur, a barber from Samastipur Bihar, staying in a shared room in the Bengaluru’s Babusapalya, said his employer has been trying to convince him that there will not be a lockdown in Karnataka but he doesn’t want to take a chance. “Everyone I speak with says there will not be a lockdown, but that’s what they said last time also. There was no warning before they stopped the trains,” he said sitting on the plastic chair, which was to be handed over to his friend. Thakur was among the many migrant workers who left Bengaluru during the exodus in May 2020. He returned to Bengaluru in October after he got a call from his employer. “I was lucky that I got a Shramik train last time, but if that happens again, I’m not sure if I’ll be lucky again,” he added. The availability of transportation is the difference between last year and this said Chandrabhushan Sahani, a carpenter with an online platform and who had hitchhiked to Bihar from Bengaluru during the 2020 lockdown. He said that he had no choice but to return to Bengaluru. “There were not enough jobs back home, so we returned. Now, trains are still running. That is a good sign. We can go anytime we need. But we are unsure if they will shut it down. There is a lot of talk about a lockdown,” he said. A senior office-bearer of the Karnataka Hotels and Restaurants Association, who didn’t want to be named, said that hotel owners have been going the extra mile to convince their employees to stay back. “The news that coming in, may it be the lockdown in Mumbai or speculations over the lockdown in Bengaluru, getting them worked up. We hope there is a firm stand from the government soon. If the employees start to leave, it is going to hurt the business,” the person added. Gayathri Vasudevan, CEO and co-founder of LabourNet, a Bengaluru-based social enterprise working in the unorganised sector said that those who left Bengaluru during the last lockdown are still returning. “Labourers who returned during the last lockdown are returning to Bengaluru. This has been going on for several months. Yes, there are some who are returning to their home state as well, but it is not in a large number like what is happening in New Delhi or Mumbai” she said. She, however, added that the fear of the lockdown could adversely affect this process. “A sense of fear of a lockdown among workers, this could lead to many those who left during Holi and other festivals not returning,” Vasudevan said. The Bengaluru division of the South Western Railway (SWR) said there was no extra demand for the trains until last week, and this week, they added four additional trains due to high demand. A senior SWR official on condition of anonymity said that while two of the trains will be operating to West Bengal, the other two will run till Assam and Bihar. “Naturally, these trains have been added because there is a demand for them. However, I can’t tell if there is an exodus happening from Bengaluru. As far as the department concerned, we have added extra trains due to the demand,” he said. However, over last week, Ashok Kumar Verma, Divisional Railway Manager, Bengaluru Division clarified that there was no rush at the railway station and added that the department is running enough trains to cater to the demand. Last Wednesday, he said, “As per the request from the Karnataka government, we had operated 20 extra trains in the view of Ugadi, festival holidays and strike by State Road Transport Corporation employees. We are ready to run more trains if required. There is no extra demand for trains apart from this.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/migrants-head-home-amid-lockdown-fear-101618944578409.html
21-04-2021||India||India stays at 142nd position in World Press Freedom index||India remained at the 142nd position among 180 countries in the World Press Freedom index published on Tuesday, with the report saying that the country was among nations where reporting on the Covid-19 pandemic was blocked or seriously impeded.The report, published by the non-profit press freedom organisation Reporters without borders (RSF), classified India among the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists.India was ranked in the “bad” category, along with Brazil, Mexico and Russia. In south Asia, Nepal was placed 106, Sri Lanka 127, Myanmar 140, Pakistan 145 and Bangladesh at the 152nd spot. China was ranked 177, and the US 44.“With four journalists killed in connection with their work in 2020, India is one of the world’s most dangerous countries for journalists trying to do their job properly. They are exposed to every kind of attack, including police violence against reporters, ambushes by political activists, and reprisals instigated by criminal groups or corrupt local officials,” said the report.Norway topped the index for the fifth year in a row.The report labelled 132 countries as “very bad”, “bad” or “problematic”. It stated that the pandemic was used as means to deny journalists this access and promote government sponsored propaganda regarding the Covid-19 outbreak. “Data shows that journalists are finding it increasingly hard to investigate and report sensitive stories, especially in Asia, the Middle East and Europe,” the report stated.India drew flak for “extremely violent social media hate campaigns” against journalists who “dare to criticise” the government. “The coordinated hate campaigns waged on social networks against journalists who dare to speak or write about subjects that annoy Hindutva followers are terrifying and include calls for the journalists concerned to be murdered. The campaigns are particularly violent when the targets are women,” said the report.The report on the Asia-Pacific region said journalists who criticised the government were branded as “anti-state,” “anti-national” or even “pro-terrorist” by supporters of the ruling BJP”.HT reached out to the ministry of information and broadcasting for a response but did not receive one immediately.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-stays-at-142nd-position-in-world-press-freedom-index-101618944218527.html

21-04-2021||India||Election Commission says no proposal to merge last two Bengal election phases||The Election Commission of India (ECI) on Wednesday said that it had received no proposal to merge the last two phases of the ongoing assembly election in West Bengal.ECI officials also refuted a report, published in HT on Wednesday, that observers in the state had told the poll watchdog that clubbing the two phases was possible if more security forces were granted.The HT report, citing senior election officials, had said that poll observers -- Ajay Nayak and Vivek Dube -- wrote a letter to ECI late last week, saying that the seventh and eighth phases of the Bengal elections, scheduled on April 26 and 29, could be merged if extra security forces are provided.The report cited a senior election official who said he had reviewed the letter. HT did not independently see the letter.According to the official, the observers told ECI that the last two phases could be merged due to the surge in infections but such a step would need 500 additional companies of security forces. Each company has about 80 personnel."ECI has neither received a letter from observers, nor is ECI mulling over any proposal to club the phases," said an ECI spokesperson.The sixth round of the eight-phase polls, comprising 43 seats, is on April 22.Another EC official said that merging phases was problematic at this stage on several counts. “Extra forces is just one part of it -- they are posted across the country, and sending them to Bengal needs advance notice and that would be ideally three to four months earlier,” said the second official on condition of anonymity. He also added that any changes would violate the candidates’ right under the Representation of the People’s Act 1951.The debate over the final phases of the high-stakes election comes amid a spike in infections in Bengal. The state logged 9819 cases -- its highest -- and 46 cases on Tuesday, according to the HT dashboard.The last two phases of elections comprise 71 seats in central and south Bengal, and parts of the state capital Kolkata.To control rising cases, the commission has extended the silent period for campaigning from 48 to 72 hours, banned public meetings and road shows between 7 pm and 10 am and threatened penal provisions against any political party or candidate found violating Covid-19 protocol at public events.The Bharatiya Janata Party, Trinamool Congress and Congress-Left alliance have all scaled back their campaign and public events. The BJP will limit its rallies to 500 people and focus on digital outreach and chief minister Mamata Banerjee will not campaign in Kolkata, save one symbolic event on April 26. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi has cancelled all his rallies in the state and the Left has scrapped all big rallies.Banerjee has repeatedly asked for merging the last few phases of polls, citing rising Covid-19 cases. TMC MP Derek O'Brien said the party reiterated their demand in a letter to ECI on Tuesday.On Monday, Union home minister Amit Shah said that each candidate had to be given a certain number of days to campaign and it was the constitutional duty of the commission to ensure that an appropriate amount of time is provided. “Constitutionally, the EC has no other option but to conduct elections. Mamata ji makes comments without reading the Constitution,” Shah had said.(The story has been changed from its previous version after a more elaborate response from the Election Commission of India)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-elections-can-club-two-phases-if-forces-boosted-ec-told-101618943798396.html
21-04-2021||India||New B.1.618 variants now among most sequenced||A previously unknown Sars-Cov-2 variant has now started to emerge in samples analysed in India by scientists to check for mutations, according to experts and new analyses that show one of these changes is the same one found in the Brazilian and South African variants of the coronavirus.This particular change is known as E484K, and it has been strongly linked with the virus becoming more resistant to antibodies created by vaccines or a past infection. It has been found in a variant now labelled as B.1.618, which has been reported in West Bengal, from where some of the highest numbers of sequencing has been carried out.Also read| Boost testing, hospital infrastructure for next 3 weeks: Centre to UTsDetails about its spread come days after genome sequencing data indicated a large presence of another known variant first found in India, the B.1.617, often referred to as the “double mutant”.Both these variants are now considered variants of interests (VOIs), and scientists are studying whether it can make the coronavirus more transmissible, more lethal, or more resistant – clues that are crucial to determine whether the intensity of India’s current wave of infections is because of these.Data submitted from India to the global repository GISAID shows the B.1.618, at 12%, is the third most common variant sequenced in the last 60 days. The B.1.617, at 28%, is the most common among sequences, followed by B.1.1.7 (the UK variant), the India Mutation Report by Scripps Research showed, citing the GISAID data.“The particular variant had appeared some time ago in West Bengal, however we did not study the mutations and its clinical significance in detail as the so-called double mutant variant (B.1.617) out-competed it. The B1.618 variant has plateaued at about 25% of the total mutations reported from Bengal; B1.617 has become predominant. Across the country, there are some districts in states such as Maharashtra where the prevalence of the variant in as many as 80% samples,” said Dr Saumitra Das, director, National Institute of Biomedical Genomics, which is one of the 10 laboratories in India’s consortium on Sars-CoV-2 genome sequencing (INSACOG).“What the impact of this variant or B1.617 would be on the vaccine efficacy etc. is all a matter of predictions. It is thought to evade the immune response because it contains the E484K mutation. We will be able to tell the clinical significance of these mutations only when we test it in animal system,” he said.The institute is currently in the process of collecting and growing in laboratory samples of the mutated variants of the virus to establish whether they actually aid the virus in escaping the immune response from vaccines and previous natural infection.A variant can contain multiple mutations, which are not unusual – particularly for RNA viruses such as Sars-Cov-2 – but since late last year, some of them have made the virus “fitter” – particularly the UK variant, which spreads much more readily than its ancestor – and the South African variant, which appears to cause more repeat infections and make vaccines less effective.According to the analysis at outbreak.info, 129 of the 130 B.1.618 sequences in India were in samples from West Bengal. India accounts for 62.5% of the B.1.618 variants reported in the world. The variant was first found in a sample outside of India on April 22, 2020.Experts tracking India’s genomic surveillance said that while specific tests are required to determine the implications of the virus, India needs to sequence and share details of more samples.“India has 8,455 publicly available genomes and around 14 million cases so far. That is 0.06% of cases sequenced. Ideally, we’d want that number to be between 2%-5%, which is in line with successful genomic surveillance programs in other countries,” said G Karthik, researcher at Scripps Research Institute, which has put together the mutations tracker at outbreak.info.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/new-b-1-618-variant-now-among-most-sequenced-101618943738393.html
21-04-2021||India||SC lays down timeline for HC judicial appointments||The Supreme Court on Tuesday prescribed a judicially mandated timeline for the Union government to make appointment of judges in the high courts, underscoring that “promptness in this process [is] to facilitate the larger cause of dispensation of timely justice”.The court, for the first time, indicated an outer time limit within which the Centre is expected to process the names for appointments of the high court judges, besides notifying appointments once the names are reiterated by its collegium. While the existing Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) that guides judicial appointments has not suggested any period within which the Centre is supposed to forward the recommendations to the Supreme Court collegium, a bench, headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, set down 18 weeks to complete this process.“The High Courts are in a crisis situation,” said the bench, which also included justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Surya Kant, as it regretted that the high courts have a shortage of around 40% judges, requiring a “collaborative” exercise involving the judiciary and the government.Breaking down the total time period of 18 weeks, the bench held that after high courts send their recommendations to the Union law ministry, the Intelligence Bureau (IB) should not take more than eight weeks to give its inputs to the ministry regarding the proposed names.Also read: CBI may take few more days over probe against Anil DeshmukhAfter receiving the inputs from the IB and the state government concerned, the Centre should process these names within eight to 12 weeks, and send them to the Supreme Court collegium with their comments for a final approval, taking a maximum 18 weeks in the entire process.As laid down in the MoP, the Supreme Court collegium, led by the CJI, will send its final recommendations in the next four weeks, and these recommendations will preferably be put up before the Prime Minister, who will advise the President in the matter of appointment. The court has said that in case the government has any reservation regarding certain recommendations, those names may be sent back to the Supreme Court collegium with specific reasons.However, the bench held, if the collegium reiterates the recommendations unanimously, “such appointment should be processed and appointment should be made within three to four weeks”. The current MoP does not lay down a timeline also for the cases when collegium reiterates names.The court also emphasised the requirement of the chief justices of the 25 high courts to recommend vacancies as early as possible, and as and when new vacancies arose, irrespective of whether their old recommendations were cleared or not. By prescribing the timeline, the bench dismissed a contention that this subject was beyond the ambit of judicial directives. It noted that the restraint imposed by the Constitution bench in the Third Judge’s Case (1998) related to the judicial review of particular appointments, and not to the aspects of the appointment processes such as delays. The order by the apex court came at a time when high courts in the country have a staggering vacancy of 411 judges -- more than a third of the total positions, as on April 1.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-lays-down-timeline-for-judicial-appointments-in-high-courts-101618943679720.html
21-04-2021||India||CBI may take few more days over probe against Anil Deshmukh||Though 15 days have passed since the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) registered a preliminary enquiry (PE) against former Maharashtra home minister Anil Deshmukh on the orders of Bombay high court to investigate allegations of corruption and extortion, the agency may take few more days to conclude its findings, two people familiar with the development said on Tuesday.The reasons for not concluding the preliminary probe are the complex nature of the investigation, CBI’s internal mechanism of reviewing a case at various levels, and unforeseen delays due to surge in Covid-19 cases, they said, adding that the agency does not want to rush its probe though it has recorded the statements of most of the key people in last two weeks.“The Supreme Court order doesn’t mention that we have to mandatorily finalise the PE in 15 days. It says we must enquire the allegations as soon as possible, preferably in 15 days,” said one of the officers cited above.“As a rule, the 15-day deadline, or any deadline given by courts, to conclude enquiry/investigations begins from the day CBI receives the certified copy of the order of that particular court -- in this case agency received the copy of Bombay high court order on April 12, so we still have 5-6 days,” he added.In the last two weeks, a CBI team led by superintendent of police Abhishek Dular has recorded the statements of Deshmukh; his two personal assistants Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde; former Mumbai Police commissioner Param Bir Singh, who levelled the allegation that the former state home minister asked suspended assistant police inspector Sachin Vaze to collect ₹100 crore every month from bars, restaurants, hotels,and other sources in Mumbai; deputy commissioner of police Raju Bhujbal; advocate Jayshree Patil, who is a petitioner in the case; assistant commissioner of police Sanjay Patil; hotel owner Mahesh Shetty; Vaze; several other Mumbai police officers; and some other hotel and bar owners.It has also scrutinised records – financial documents, statements of witnesses and people arrested by the National Investigation Agency (NIA) during its February 25 Antilia bomb scare conspiracy and March 5 Mansukh Hiran murder probes.The agency declined to comment if the investigating officer (IO) has submitted his findings, but a second officer said that there was scrutiny at multiple levels in CBI before the report in finalised.The PE will be converted into a first information report (FIR) only if there is “prime facie” (at first sight) evidence against Deshmukh, and the agency feels there is need to further investigate the allegations, the second officer said.Deshmukh, who resigned at Maharashtra’s home minister hours after a CBI probe into Param Bir Singh’s allegations, has consistently denied any wrongdoing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cbi-may-take-few-more-days-over-probe-against-anil-deshmukh-101618943618279.html

The centrally sponsored drive will continue to be restricted to those above the age of 45, and will remain free of cost.The Uttar Pradesh government decided it will pay for the vaccines of all adults above the age of 18, although it was not immediately clear whether the state will buy doses directly or create a mechanism that could involve reimbursing private hospitals for doses to these groups.Vaccine makers separately confirmed they were ramping up production. The maker of Covaxin, Bharat Biotech, on Tuesday announced they will scale up manufacturing capacity to 700 million doses annually.The company, as well as Serum Institute of India, which makes Covishield (the other vaccine in use in India), were recently given a ₹4,500 cr credit line (of which SII gets ₹3,000 cr) to expand their capacities. SII too has said that it will ramp up production to 100 million doses a month soon from its existing capacity of 60 million doses.Also read: Rahul tests Covid-19 positive, PM wishes quick recoveryA third coronavirus vaccine likely to be available soon is the Russian Sputnik V, which has tied up with India’s Dr Reddy’s for distribution. According to a person aware of the specifics, the first batches of Sputnik V – which was approved by India’s regulators earlier this month -- is likely to be imported by the end of April or early May.“Once more vaccines come into the market, and the existing companies begin scaling up, the supply chain will further strengthen. We should be able to see the difference by June,” said an official aware of the vaccination planning, asking not to be named.Modi’s meeting included executives from SII, Bharat Biotech and DrReddy’s, as well as Biological E, Gennova and Zydus Cadila. Biological E has tied up with two American vaccine developers -- J&J and Biological E -- while Zydus Cadila and Gennova are testing their own candidates.Officials in various states also said they were expecting guidance from states on how to go about sourcing doses. In a special cabinet meeting on Tuesday, the Maharashtra government decided it will use the state’s development funds to procure vaccines, including those which may need to be imported, state health minister Rajesh Tope said.“We currently have two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, but if the need arises, we have also decided to import stock of other vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Sputnik from other countries,” Tope said after the meeting.Health department officials said the state will also have to take a call on which section of the 18-44 age group it would bear the vaccination cost for, as well whether it would need to exercise control over how many vaccine doses can private hospitals buy. This will prove vital to ensure equitable vaccination for all, an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/states-plan-vaccine-expansion-pm-asks-firms-to-raise-capacity-101618943378337.html
21-04-2021||India||‘Form mohalla committees…’: PM Modi's appeal to youth in address to nation||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Tuesday urged the youth to form committees in their societies, “mohallas” (colonies) and apartments to ensure all Covid-19 related norms are adhered to, amid a rapid rise in daily cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) with several states and Union Territories (UTs) resorting to curfews or lockdown to curb the spread of the pandemic.“I request my young friends to form small committees in their societies, mohallas and apartments and help in making sure that Covid-19 discipline is followed. By doing this, state governments will neither be required to create containment zones nor impose curfews or lockdowns,” PM Modi said in a virtual address to the nation on Tuesday night on the prevailing pandemic situation in the country.Prime Minister Modi made an appeal to children as well, asking them to create such an atmosphere in their homes that their family members don’t go outside without any work or any reason. “Your Zidd (stubbornness) can bring huge results.” he added.India’s Covid-19 disease caseload went over 15.3 million after 259,170 cases and 1,761 deaths were recorded in the last 24 hours, according to the Union ministry of health and family welfare (MoHFW) dashboard earlier in the day. There are 2,031,977 active cases currently while recoveries stand at 1,3108,582. Death toll, meanwhile, is at 180,530.PM Modi also informed in his virtual address that work was on to increase the number of hospital beds, adding that large Covid dedicated hospitals were being built in some cities. “The Centre, state governments and private sector are trying to make oxygen available to all those who are in need of it. Many steps are being taken in this direction,” he said. The Prime Minister’s assurance came after some states and UTs reported a shortage of beds, oxygen and essential drugs such as Remdesivir to treat the infected patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-in-pm-modi-s-address-to-nation-an-appeal-to-his-young-friends-101618934305248.html
21-04-2021||Today's||With design changes, Svamitva scheme can be a game changer||The Survey of Villages Abadi and Mapping with Improvised Technology in Village Areas or Svamitva scheme, launched in April 2020, can play a key role in ensuring secure property rights for rural India. The scheme aims to provide an integrated property validation solution for rural India through the demarcation of inhabited areas using drones. By providing a Record of Rights (RoRs) to village household owners in inhabited rural areas, it attempts to create accurate land and property records, which can be pivotal in reducing property-related disputes and facilitating monetisation of rural residential assets for credit and other financial services. By providing clear records of land ownership, it also envisages improved tax collection through the gram panchayat institutions. As of March, drone survey has been completed in over 31,000 villages, and property cards distributed to about 230,000 property holders in 2,626 villages.But the scheme’s legal, social and economic design needs more thought. One, property cards distributed under the scheme need legal validity in order to enable citizens to establish their title and to avail financial services. The Framework for Implementation of the Svamitva Scheme places the responsibility of carrying out appropriate amendments to the revenue laws for this purpose on the respective state revenue departments. As these departments make the required changes, a careful consideration of the laws will ensure that no legal loopholes impact its effectiveness. For example, in Haryana, the Svamitva scheme has been implemented under section 26 of its Panchayati Raj Act. However, section 26 of the Act only empowers the panchayat to prepare the maps of the said area, not to create the associated RoRs. Panchayats, in this case, may not be the competent authority to complete this process of entrusting property titles to rural residents. Thus, there is a possibility of disputes if due legal process is not followed. To ensure such inconsistencies do not arise, a review of the state laws related to land and revenue impacting the legality of property cards should be undertaken. These experts could be tasked with drafting amendments to the existing laws or framing new laws to create legally admissible property cards.Two, at 12%, single women form a significant share of the population but are often devoid of property ownership. The scheme presents an opportunity to enable recognition of women’s ownership rights as it issues property cards based on “possession” and not “inheritance”. To ensure this, states can also consider including details of more than one owner on the property cards, and recognising joint ownership of property by women.Madhya Pradesh and Odisha have existing schemes that provide homestead land to weaker sections such as Dalits and single women. Svamitva can strive to include those in possession of these lands and also include low-income families and SC/ST communities who have been residing in village commons for generations. There is also scope to rope in civil society organisations for gender and caste-based sensitisation of field functionaries. Third, the Fifteenth Finance Commission report has emphasised the importance of property tax as “the most effective instrument for revenue mobilisation by local bodies”, thereby encouraging the administration to “build a framework for property taxation with universal coverage.”To ensure that Svamitva is able to achieve the objective of building financially resilient local governments, legal changes are needed to empower panchayats to both collect and utilise property tax. Gram panchayats may also be authorised to revise property tax records at the time of land record updates (registration, mutation) to ensure robust and consistent revenue collection. A Geographic Information System-based-based software may be provided to panchayats to manage property and taxation records. Such software is available for municipal corporations and urban local bodies. As more states gear up for the implementation of Svamitva, including these design principles could ensure the realisation of rural India’s aspirations.Shivani Gupta is a senior policy analyst, The Quantum Hub The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/with-design-changes-svamitva-scheme-can-be-a-game-changer-101619017963938.html
21-04-2021||Today's||The new vaccine policy needs an overhaul||Indulging in eerie Covid statistics of daily numbers of tests and cases is facile, futile, and a façade. Facile because these numbers are a function of inadequate testing and flawed reporting; futile because they do not help solve the crisis; and a façade because they hide real human agony and distract attention away from the core issue. Instead, there is only one number we need to focus on every single day in the fight against Covid.Seven per cent. That is the percentage of Indian adults who have received at least one dose of the Covid vaccine thus far. The government’s single-minded pursuit should be to see how the 7% figure can grow to at least 75% in the shortest possible time.To this effect, on April 19, the Narendra Modi government announced a “liberalised and accelerated Covid-19 vaccination strategy” with much fanfare. Alas, it turned out to be a confused and complicated strategy that threatens to derail a smooth vaccination roll-out. Here is why.As per this new vaccination strategy, if you are a 45-year-old Tamilian who wants to get vaccinated after May 1, you will have to first wade through these myriad set of options — a free vaccine offered by the Government of India (GOI) in a public hospital, or a vaccine for a price offered by the GOI at a private hospital, or a vaccine offered by the government of Tamil Nadu that may either be free or charged depending on the rules in the state; or a priced vaccine offered by a private hospital of their own accord.Also Read | ‘For a few industrialists’: Rahul Gandhi compares vaccine policy with note banIf you are a vaccine maker, you have to create two equal categories of all the vaccines produced — one to be sold to GOI at a fixed price and another to be sold to state governments or a private player at a different price, which will presumably be higher than the price offered to GOI.If this was not head-spinning enough, state governments can buy the vaccine directly from the manufacturer at a price different from what the Centre pays but most states are starved of funds. They will need to borrow money to buy the vaccine for which, as per constitutional norms, they have to seek permission from the Centre.Different prices for the same product may be the norm for airline tickets but for the critical task of getting a majority of Indians vaccinated quickly, the new vaccination strategy is an abominable aberration. It does not require an economist to infer that creating multiple fixed price systems and buying channels for the same product will inevitably lead to people trying to arbitrage and create parallel unofficial markets. Covid vaccination is a national mission of utmost importance and urgency, not some trivial stock market type activity to match buyers and sellers of vaccines.Also Read | Karnataka govt sets up war room to monitor supply of oxygen, RemdesivirInstead, here is a plan that the government must adopt to smoothen the vaccine roll-out strategy.One, the Centre must fix a uniform standard price for all vaccines transparently, after negotiations with all the vaccine manufacturers. Two, state governments and private players must be allowed to procure vaccines directly as per their requirements, at this fixed price.Three, the Centre must facilitate unconditional borrowing for the state governments for the purpose of Covid vaccination through a special borrowing window with the Reserve Bank of India for a specific period of time, at a specific rate of interest, and an amount for each state depending on the size of their population (not the number of Covid cases, which is merely a function of testing).Four, states should be free to roll out their own vaccination strategy as they deem fit. Private players can also set up their own facilities for vaccination. Five, the Centre should then play the role of the mediator and judge, monitoring and measuring the pace of vaccination in each state and district through the CoWin platform. This information should be published daily, which can spur healthy competition across states and districts to rapidly vaccinate their residents.And six, the Centre takes on the responsibility to ensure adequate availability of vaccines through negotiations with vaccine makers across the world, and lets states and private players focus on implementing the vaccination process for all citizens.Also Read | Japanese PM Yoshihide Suga calls off India visit amid Covid-19 spike: ReportIt is a testament to the spirit of the free enterprise of the modern world that we have a plethora of choices of scientifically proven vaccines available in such a short time to put an end to the Covid-19 nightmare. Our task now is to focus on getting the maximum number of Indians vaccinated in the shortest possible time. The principles that made the vaccine available to humankind are exactly the ones that will also enable us to achieve this objective — unleashing the spirit of competitive dynamics of various states with the soft-touch guiding hand of the Centre.Covid-19 has not just taken thousands of lives away from us but has also ruptured the economic structure of our society and left profound scars that will take a long time to heal. The defeat of Covid is merely the first step in the long and arduous climb back to normalcy for India. We will then have to repair and mend our broken economy through a series of bold measures aimed directly at the people in the form of income supplements and job creation through investments.Vaccines are the surest way to defeat Covid-19. Victory against Covid is possible only through a sensible and simple vaccination strategy, not a convoluted and complicated one like the government has announced.Praveen Chakravarty is a political economist and senior office-bearer of the CongressThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-new-vaccine-policy-needs-an-overhaul-101618995822988.html
21-04-2021||Today's||The Taste with Vir Sanghvi | Covid-19: Here’s What You Need To Know||For weeks now, this column has been about Covid. Even before this wave of the Pandemic reached today’s heights, I have been complaining about the ineptitude of the government’s Covid managers. These were the people who wanted to keep such a tight control on the battle against Covid that they destroyed our vaccination strategy by refusing to order enough vaccines, by fighting off demands for private sector involvement in distribution, assured us that the Pandemic was in its end game and took too long to approve new vaccines.One by one, every single idiotic position they adopted has collapsed and government policy has been reversed. But it has taken too long for that to happen and hundreds of people have lost their lives in the meantime.You could easily make out a case of criminal negligence against them. But, I hope, that at the very least, they will be held accountable and dismissed. Too many people have died. And India has paid a terrible price for their smugness, arrogance and stupidity.But now that we are in worse shape than ever before, here is a layman’s guide to the key questions about the pandemic.What accounts for this wave?Well according to our government, it is our own fault. We have ignored Covid protocols, not worn masks, gathered in crowded places, etc. Some of this is true. Indians have behaved irresponsibly. Forget about the metros, I have travelled through Agra, Jaipur and other cities and found the streets full of people who did not bother to wear masks.But here’s the problem: this was when numbers were actually going down. The irresponsibility of the public did not change. It was the same when Covid was on the decline and when the numbers rose again. So logic suggests that there has to have been a new variable.Or a new variant.Is this the current wave attributable to a different variant?Logic tells us it must be. Nothing else has changed. So why would numbers go up so drastically unless a more easily transmissible Covid variant is causing the infections?We have found new variants all over India. In Punjab the UK variant is partly responsible for the infections. And a so-called Indian variant was found late last year. It accounts for many of the Maharashtra infections.The trouble is that the virus mutates all the time. There are many variants. You need careful research to establish whether a new variant is more dangerous.We are still lagging behind in that research so there is no official word from the government. But the world seems to think that a new variant is causing this wave. That is why the UK has banned travel to and from India.How does one cope with a new variant?You can look at the experience of the UK. When it discovered a highly transmissible variant called the Kent variant (what we now know as the UK variant), the government locked down the country and speeded up vaccinations. It worked. The UK is slowly returning to normal.So why didn’t we do that?Because we say we are still not sure (at least officially) if a variant is responsible for our Pandemic. The crucial research is still incomplete. And there is a vaccination problem.What ‘vaccination problem’?First of all, we need to be sure that our existing vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin work against this variant.The government announced a few days ago – finally – that they worked against most variants, including the Indian mutation.The logical thing to have done would have been to begin to follow the UK’s example and stepped up vaccination for all.But there was a problem.India is the vaccine manufacturing hub of the world as we bragged when we sent lakhs of vaccines abroad. So vaccine availability should not have been a problem.But there is no accounting for human stupidity and arrogance. The Indian government delayed approving vaccines that the rest of the world had approved (such as the Russian Sputnik V) and did not order enough of the Covishield vaccine we were manufacturing in India.Why did they do this?Because they are arrogant idiots. Obviously, the Prime Minister shares this view of his medical czars.Because, after a public uproar, their policies were reversed. India said we would welcome any vaccine that was in general use abroad, we allowed vaccine imports and we gave money to the two Indian manufacturers to increase production.Much of this could have been done two months ago.Now, because it takes time to get vaccines, the earliest we can open up vaccination to all adults is 1 May.Will increasing vaccination help?Yes, of course it will.But recent experience shows us that even if you have had both your jabs (as Manmohan Singh did) you might still get Covid. But, say doctors, the vaccines will make the impact of the disease less serious. It is very unlikely that you will fall critically ill or die.What should we do then?Wear masks. Ideally N 95 masks, or if not, then two regular masks at the same time.Isn’t this the same old advice?Yes and no. Science is now more sure of the need for masks. The old view was that Covid spread through surfaces and big droplets. So if you used sanitizers on everything and maintained social distancing, you were fine. The sanitizers would disinfect the surfaces and the droplets would fall to the ground before they could reach anyone who maintained social distancing.The new view is that it is actually very difficult to get infections from surfaces. So sanitizers are of limited use. Just wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water.Covid, we now know, does not spread through large droplets that fall to the floor. The primary cause of infection is the breath of a Covid-infected person which comes out in a spray, full of micro-particles that may linger in the air.If the Covid affected person is wearing a mask, he does not spray as many micro-particles. And if you are wearing one too, you won’t inhale them.Is there a new general rule?Yes. Do not remain unmasked in a closed space unless you are with someone you are confident about, say your spouse or your kids. Otherwise, keep your mask on: a person may have Covid and be totally asymptomatic and still be infectious. At the very least, if you have to take off your mask, make sure the other person is wearing one.Even if the person who you are exposed to has been vaccinated, work on the assumption that he or she could be Covid positive.Is there a way out?Only to some extent. Scientists say that it is safer outside, so if you want to go to a restaurant then eat al fresco. You can perhaps take your mask off if you are isolated in a park.Are there any other things to worry about?Plenty. But here is just one. In the first wave, children did not seem to get Covid. Older people were at much more risk of infection. But in this wave, all ages are at risk.When will it get better?Things should improve once many more people are vaccinated. But even if all goes well, we won’t get to a stage where it makes much difference till September-October.So get used to life as a masked person.Batman came to terms with it. So should you.For more stories by Vir Sanghvi read here||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-taste-with-vir-sanghvi-covid-19-here-s-what-you-need-to-know-101618987370589.html
21-04-2021||Today's||As vaccination opens up, design a smarter communication plan||In public health, communication is often equated with sharing of information. If there is anything we have learnt over the past year, it is that information alone does not result in lasting behaviour change. This is particularly true in an environment burdened with information overload, blurring lines between fact, fiction and opinion. That is where strategic communication becomes vital to help shape behaviour. Information is cold, but communication can make it warm, personal and thereby more effective.As we enter the general public vaccination drive, in the middle of an unprecedented wave of infections, citizens will hopefully be more convinced of the need to take the jab. But instead of only leaving it to them, it is important to craft communication that combines motivation, relevant information and appropriate messaging.In February, The Indian Covid-19 Alliance (TICA), anchored by IDFC Institute, partnered with a market research consultancy Convergent View to understand issues surrounding vaccine hesitancy and eagerness. Our qualitative study showed that reversing the disruption in people’s economic stability, social life, and way of living is the most critical motivator to opt for the vaccine — more than safeguarding oneself from health risks.During the early period of the pandemic, when it was critical to adjust to a different way of living, communication was instructional, overloaded with information, and directing (one might even say ordering) the public on desired health behaviour to prevent the spread of the virus. This mechanism is not likely to work now.First, Covid-19 is not just a public health problem. The study’s respondents expressed concerns about a diverse range of issues – from children become addicted to mobile devices, to financial devastation. Any form of communication must consider this social and human aspect. Mainstream messages in the earlier phases of the pandemic focused on the actions we expected from the public but failed to pay attention to the stimulus most likely to trigger that action. Until we unearth those reasons, and listen to our audiences, we cannot expect behaviour to change.Second, the launch of the vaccination program in mid-January brought with it volumes of misinformation, disinformation, and every other kind of information resulting in an infodemic. Our study confirmed that too much erratic information is leading to vaccine hesitancy. Those who were reluctant feared severe side-effects both in the long and short term; believed in the vaccine being curative and not preventative; saw vaccines as not meant for healthy people; suspected vaccine tampering by health care workers; perceived it as a money-making exercise; preferred ayurveda to allopathic interventions; and claimed Covid-19 was being blown out of proportion. Other reports from our partners, frontline workers and NGOs suggest misinformation around more implausible side-effects of vaccination, including an inability to conceive, impotence, and an inability to consume alcohol or non-vegetarian food. The second wave may have changed incentives and dispelled some of this, but it is useful to know the nature of misperceptions out there.Third, there is both fatigue and lack of awareness of the importance of Covid-appropriate behaviour (both pre and post vaccination). Any future communication campaigns, therefore, need to emphasise the value of the Covid-19 vaccine not just from the lens of prevention of serious disease and fatality but by stating with conviction this it is currently the best and only known path to restoration of normalcy in our lives. Here lies the answer for “why should I” and the most compelling motivation for anyone to opt for the vaccine.India has a rich history of having successfully eradicated insurmountable diseases through public vaccination campaigns. It is the country’s responsibility to stop the spread of the coronavirus disease and treat infected patients. But it is an individual’s responsibility to manage their lives and families and do their bit. If each and every one of us has a strong enough personal motivation, we are more likely to do our bit by opting for the vaccine as and when offered.Kalyani Rajan is Visiting Senior Fellow and Shilpa Rao is Head, Stage Engagements, IDFC Institute.

21-04-2021||Today's||India’s war against Covid-19||We are facing a war on three major fronts — medical, financial, and a strained internal and external environment, which predates the pandemic and persists.To wage a successful war, the entire national capacity has to be leveraged. Resources, energies and mindshare of leaders have to be synergised and concentrated on the point of decision, which, in this case, is minimising the damage of the pandemic. Synergy has to be shepherded through a series of negotiations, persuasion and coordination. Like in any war, this has to be achieved while incurring casualties within the very machinery tasked to execute these complicated manoeuvres.We have some strategic advantages. Though belated, a sense of national emergency is kicking in among citizens. We have an excellent communication system with deep penetration of mobile phones, which is useful for planning. Aadhaar is a robust mechanism to coordinate and control vaccination and lifesaving drug delivery. Our technology prowess can help solve resource allocation problems and guide policymakers. Our top 200 corporates have the muscle to reach every nook and corner of the country in terms of logistical and management bandwidth. We also have a fair amount of idle aviation capacity to cart resources between cities.Also Read | Covid-19: 10 states account for over 77% of new casesOur challenge, thus, is not at an absolute resource shortage but the ability to join the dots, monitor execution and bridge gaps quickly. If we have to fight a war against the pandemic, then we might as well follow the ten principles of war.The first principle is the selection and maintenance of a singular unambiguous aim. We must have the aim of fighting the health and financial crisis, and maintain it throughout. In wars, contradictory aims have to be managed with compromises. Wartime decisions can seldom satisfy all stakeholders and hence statesmanship is needed.Second, the maintenance of morale. This has three elements. Citizens have to be given the true picture, no matter how grim; shown the roadmap for the way out; and demonstrated quick wins. If there is dissonance between the narrative and reality, the credibility of the narratives and narrators gets diffused, diminishing unity of purpose.Third, offensive action, or a series of practical steps that seize initiative, maintain momentum and create advantageous positions. Resources must be allocated proactively and initiative left to local leaders to implement the strategy. Higher formations focus on provisioning of resources and lower ones deploy those on the ground. There will be compelling and unsatisfiable demands from lower formations but that is the nature of war; hence, higher formations will need to make strategic long term priorities. Towards that end, cities which are strategic, financial and industrial hubs will need to be safeguarded first. If those nodes fail, everything else will collapse.Fourth, security — defined as provision and maintenance of an operating environment that affords necessary freedom of action to achieve objectives. Imbalance in supply and demand, especially of lifesaving resources, breeds moral and material corruption. Any blockage of resources, be it because of bureaucratic hurdles, apathy or greed, sabotages the war effort. The government should leverage capacity of institutions created specifically for fusing thousands of databases that can provide visibility of resource allocations and dispensation, preventing leakages and delays. The mandate of such organisations needs to be changed but that too is the nature of war. Entire assembly lines convert to producing war material in times of existential emergencies.The fifth principle — surprise — acts in reverse in this case. There must be second and third order of thinking so that surprise is minimised. Every decision has unintended consequences, for instance the exodus of migrants following the lockdown. In wartime, decisions are often between one wrong and lesser wrong. Red teams must evaluate the implications of major decisions and create credible implication flows that allow decision makers to evaluate the lesser evil. These teams must be populated by imaginative thinkers pooled in from every ministry and the corporate sector.Sixth, concentration of forces. Prioritising frontline workers for vaccination was an example of this principle. Often leaders spread their resources too thin so they don’t make a decisive impact.The seventh principle, economy of effort, recognises that resources will always be short in war and therefore every effort must be leveraged to its fullest. This implies strict watch on wastage, cold chain storage, and ironing out process delays to ensure that there is least friction in the system.Eighth, flexibility. Once there is an overall strategy, implementation must be delegated down with adequate empowerment and oversight. For instance, local leaders may find that their population can be more easily vaccinated as a family unit, rather than age criteria. Such changes must be allowed on ground.Ninth, cooperation. This involves teamwork and a sharing of dangers, burdens, risks and opportunities in every aspect of warfare. This key principle is often the Achilles' heel of most campaigns as dangers, burdens and risks are often borne by the majority while a smaller cohort seeks the opportunities and glory. Such campaigns usually lose steam, morale and consequently their efficacy.The last principle, sustainability, is to generate the means by which fighting power is sustained and freedom of action maintained. Which is where the larger issue of the economic front kicks in. Without that engine grinding back, the war against the pandemic will start sputtering.These principles of war give us a road map. The only silver lining of a nation at war is that despite internal bickering, there is an opportunity to unleash its full potential. It is not the absolute lack of resources or knowledge that defeats nations but hubris of past victories, underestimating the adversary, and not altering strategy when required.Raghu Raman is founding CEO, Natgrid The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/indias-war-against-covid19-101618913917918.html
21-04-2021||Editorials||Covid-19: In distress, civil society steps in||As India battles the most devastating public health crisis it has ever seen, and systemic failures are apparent all around, there is one silver lining — the role of civil society in aiding citizens. Civil society here is not just the conventionally understood structure of established professional organisations or neighbourhood civic bodies. A more loose, spontaneous, conglomeration of disparate citizens is playing an equally critical role in helping fellow citizens. During the first wave of Covid-19, many such citizens and groups came together to support the returning migrants. This year, too, they are doing a lot of the heavy lifting — from sharing information about hospital beds and medicines to amplifying the needs of patients and their families on social media. Society, samaaj, is leveraging its power to help neighbours, friends, and extended families. A lot of this is restricted to people with access to social media, but it has still been of great help. While information on beds, medicines and oxygen is critical, what is equally important for patients and their families is to know that there is a community out there that cares, and the battle against Covid-19 will not be a lonely one. But civil society, in any form, doesn’t have the scale and the reach of the State. It is imperative that the government aids this Herculean effort by providing correct and timely information to society and meeting the scarcity and shortages across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/covid19-in-distress-civil-society-steps-in-101619018623852.html
21-04-2021||Editorials||Reassuring the nation on Covid||As India began its battle against the first wave of Covid-19 last March, when about 500 cases were being reported daily, Prime Minister (PM) Narendra Modi began a series of addresses to the nation — to warn citizens about the disease and call for a people’s curfew, to declare a lockdown, to urge citizens to applaud health care workers, and to extend the lockdown. He told people what they could expect, and what the State was doing to help them. As India confronts a fierce second wave, with close to 300,000 cases being reported daily, PM Modi finally addressed the nation for the first time — on this wave — on Tuesday. The frequency of his public engagements in 2020 was correct, for citizens needed to be prepared for the pandemic and comforted through the lockdown. His address in 2021 was surprisingly belated, for if anything, given the dire situation, citizens needed to hear from their leader earlier about what the State was doing to help. The PM had four core messages. This wave is intense; the government has done a lot to boost health infrastructure and will continue meeting supply deficits; citizens must be responsible and social groups must enforce Covid-19-appropriate behaviour; and states must only impose lockdowns as a last resort. The PM’s acknowledgment of the intensity of the wave is welcome — though if only the Centre had picked the trends early enough and prepared, the situation may not have turned so alarming. And while it is true that India is better equipped today than it was last year, the PM’s report card does not fully align with the lived experiences of citizens. For many, who are today desperately looking for beds, oxygen, medicines, better is not good enough. The State is almost absent at a time when citizens need it the most, and they are left to their own devices, and the help that others, including social networks, can provide — but the State’s role, unfortunately, can’t be crowd-sourced.The PM stressed on the role of states and society in managing the pandemic, especially its current wave. Empowering states is good, but this must be done with adequate resources and a consultative spirit; the pandemic’s bruising second wave has seen too much politicking and finger-pointing between the Centre and states. Asking citizens to be responsible is crucial, but this carries far more credibility when the political leadership itself is responsible and does not engage in reckless political rallies and enables large and potentially dangerous religious congregations. Finally, in this, the hour of their greatest need for some, people needed the PM to offer them assistance — and succour. The speech stopped short of that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/reassuring-the-nation-on-covid-101619018147525.html
