The district is leading by having administered the highest per million (10 lakh) doses in the first phase of inoculation against the deadly Coronavirus. According to data available on the Co-WIN application till April 28, SAS Nagar (Mohali) has administered nearly 2.36 lakh doses per million population in the district, followed by 2.12 lakh in Pathankot and 2.03 lakh in Gurdaspur. In absolute numbers, Jalandhar, Amritsar and Ludhiana districts have administered higher number of vaccines than Mohali, but in terms of the proportion of population of the district, it has emerged the leader. At least five panchayats in Mohali, Tarouli, Rasoolpur, Barsalpur, Madanheri and Bahadurgarh have achieved 100% vaccination, with all eligible persons above 45 having taken the jab. Punjab chief secretary Vini Mahajan has appreciated this, saying that the targets were achieved at a time when the health workers were under pressure, with high positivity rate being reported from across the state. “Initially, vaccine hesitancy was quite high but then we followed the Lok Sanjhedaari model and collaborated with religious, political and industrial leaders. Day and night camps were also held. Our vaccine wastage of less than 1% is also the lowest in the state,” said Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan. The laggard districts Mansa, Sangrur and Ferozepur districts have fared the worst in vaccination. In Mansa, the vaccination per million to date is 61,359; Sangrur stands at 68,771 with Ferozepur at 75,610. Mansa chief medical officer Dr Sukhwinder Singh said the biggest reason behind the low vaccination coverage has been the reluctance of farmer groups. He added that when the drive was started in January, farm groups had told them they wouldn’t wear masks or take the vaccine shots. “We faced major hurdles in carrying out vaccination. Finally, we reached out to religious and social leaders to motivate people. With a deadlier strain now claiming lives, residents of the district are coming forward for vaccination and testing,” the CMO added. The farmers’ agitation was also the biggest hindrance in vaccination not taking off in Sangrur, with an official saying that residents told them that they did not believe in a virus and that the vaccine was a ploy of some sort by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to weaken their agitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/mohali-leads-in-vaccination-drive-in-punjab-farm-stir-slowed-some-districts-101619634100602.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Casteist slur: Yuvraj trying to save his skin by giving different interpretation: Police to HC||The Haryana Police have told the Punjab and Haryana high court that former cricketer Yuvraj Singh has admitted to using a derogatory term in a live show and now to wriggle out of it, he is coming up with a different interpretation of what he had said. Hansi superintendent of police Nitika Gahlaut told the court that Yuvraj joined probe on April 14 and produced a written statement which is almost a reiteration of what he said in the plea before the court. “The petitioner is not denying the use of the controversial term rather his major contention is that the word used was in the context of someone in inebriated condition and was not a remark made in derogation of any community. He is trying to give another interpretation to save his skin from the clutches of law,” she said in a reply filed on Wednesday. The police have responded to a plea from the ex-cricketer in February seeking quashing of the FIR. The FIR was registered on February 14, eight months after he apologised for the “unintentional remarks” made during an Instagram live video in April 2020. The FIR was registered on the complaint of one Rajat Kalsan of Hansi, under Sections 153-A (promoting enmity) and 153-B (assertions prejudicial to national integration) of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and under the Scheduled Castes and the Scheduled Tribes Prevention and Atrocities Act, 1989. The HC, on February 25, had asked the police to not take any coercive action against him. The police say a survey was carried out and it was found that the term in contention is abusive and used in a derogatory sense. “The person who consumes bhaang is called as ‘nashedi’ and not ‘bhangi’ (term used by him),” police said, citing the survey. The police added that Yuvraj could not produce any document in support of his claims. The police also say him being a resident of Chandigarh would be aware of which castes are under Scheduled Castes category in the region and that it is highly probable that he used the term in a derogatory sense. The police say the trial court should be allowed to appreciate the evidence and plea should be dismissed in the high court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/casteist-slur-yuvraj-trying-to-save-his-skin-by-giving-different-interpretation-police-to-hc-101619634099391.html

28-04-2021||Gurugram||Residents above 18 years register for Covid-19 vaccinations||With the process of registration for Covid-19 vaccination for beneficiaries above 18 years of age commencing on Wednesday, many city residents got themselves registered on the Co-win portal, said officials familiar with the matter.The registration process commenced around 4pm, but the wait time was long as the portal experienced heavy traffic, with millions across the country trying to register on the portal at the same time. Health department officials said that after 5.30pm, the registration process was smoother with many Gurugram residents being able to log in and finish the registration process.Pravin Malik, a resident of Sare Homes and a social activist, said that he applied for the registration though Co-win application as the Aarogya Setu app was too slow. “I applied on the system and got an OTP after the portal sought my details and identity card details with a date of birth. I was registered for Rohtak, as the system was not accepting registration for Gururgam,” said Malik, adding that once he gets the slots he would have to go to Rohtak for vaccination. As per the directions of the union government, all residents above the age of 18 years are eligible for vaccination from May 1. The Haryana government has ordered five million doses of vaccines for the campaign, at a cost of ₹250 crore, the government said on Wednesday.In the run-up to this vaccination drive roll out in the district, Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram, said that a meeting of the district task force would be convened within the next two days to chalk out a strategy for the mass inoculations.“The guidelines for vaccination and the entire plan will be shared by the state government and accordingly, implemented by us. The new arrangement would be different as vaccination at government centres and private hospitals will be separated. The hospitals can now obtain vaccines directly from manufacturers and we won’t supply the doses any more,” said Yadav.For the next two days, Yadav said the focus of the health department would be to use up all the doses available for vaccination, although the process would take place at fewer vaccine sites than usual due to low availability. “We are waiting for directions from the state government in this matter,” he said.Earlier in the day, chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said that registration data for the Covid-19 vaccination would be available by April 30.“This vaccination campaign will be conducted in hospitals, community health centres, primary health centres, dispensaries, and other institutions. Those who register will get the vaccination date and venue message on their mobiles,” said Khattar.He also said that all the information related to Covid-19 can be obtained on the 1075 helpline number.Khattar also said that number of patients coming from Delhi had put pressure on hospitals in Gurugram, Faridabad, Panipat and even Ambala. He said that the number of patients coming from Delhi to the hospitals in the NCR districts of Haryana is adding to the problems faced by the hospitals. However, he said that the state government will not refuse treatment on ethical grounds.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-above-18-years-register-for-covid-19-vaccinations-101619633439409.html
28-04-2021||Gurugram||Hospital where four died on Sunday to shut operations within a week||The management of Kathuria Hospital on Khandsa Road, where four people died due to an oxygen shortage on Sunday afternoon, decided to shut its operations after patients currently undergoing treatment recover. New admissions were also stopped, said hospital officials, citing shortage of oxygen as the reason for shutting operations.Dr AK Kathuria, the owner of Kathuria Hospital, said that operating the facility without an assured supply of oxygen is not feasible as another tragedy could unfold. “We are getting help from the district administration but the shortage is still acute. We have decided to discharge all patients by next week when their condition improves. We will cease operations till the situation changes,” said Kathuria.On Tuesday, the hospital discharged six patients, while three were discharged on Wednesday. “We have 18 patients at present,” said Dr Kathuria.Officials responsible for the oxygen supply said that they were also facing difficulties in supplying oxygen to smaller hospitals as the capacity to hold oxygen is less and it was not possible to supply it every two hours. The hospital has a capacity of 30 beds, with a requirement of 40 oxygen cylinders per day.“We are assessing these hospitals and their cylinder capacity to hold oxygen. The hospitals should have oxygen storage capacity to manage operations for at least 10 hours. A call will be taken in this regard so that the entire dynamic of oxygen supply doesn’t get disturbed. This may reduce the number of beds but these will be increased where capacities are higher,” said Vinay Pratap Singh, commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram.On Sunday afternoon, four critically ill Covid-19 patients died around 3pm after the hospital ran out of oxygen around 11am. A magisterial inquiry in the matter is also pending.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hospital-where-four-died-on-sunday-to-shut-operations-within-a-week-101619633438725.html
28-04-2021||Gurugram||Five industrial tankers converted to transport oxygen, sent to Odisha plant||The regional transport authority (RTA), in a bid to smoothen oxygen supply in the district, converted five nitrogen and argon tankers into oxygen tankers to enable transportation of oxygen from a plant in Rourkela of Odisha.Dhaarna Yadav, secretary, RTA, Gurugram, said that the tankers are owned by private companies that supply nitrogen and argon to factories and private industries. “These tankers were sent to the Panipat industrial area and were converted by an agency overnight. It took six hours to get them cleaned and nozzles were changed to equip them to carry oxygen. A special team was deployed at Panipat cleaning station to check the oxygen level and pressure in these tankers for uninterrupted supply,” she said.Yadav said these tankers were sent to Rourkela by train from the Faridabad railway station and will return late Saturday or Sunday, with a supply of nearly 50 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen supply.At present, the district requires 70 MT of oxygen. Officials said that the 50 MT, coupled with the supply from plants in Bhiwadi and Panipat will ensure a smooth supply of oxygen to all hospitals.Several private hospitals in the city are facing an acute shortage of oxygen, as reported by HT over the past few days. Hospitals also took to social media over the past few days to send out distress calls to the district administration, to help them get oxygen.As the district is facing an oxygen shortage amid a massive surge in Covid-19 cases, the district administration is trying to arrange oxygen from other states. Officials said that a green corridor will be created from the Faridabad railway station to Gurugram to facilitate the movement of these tankers, along with a police escort.Yadav said they are coordinating with the Rourkela administration to ensure there is no delay in loading and transporting oxygen to Gurugram. “We have intensified our focus on transporting oxygen, which is a key challenge. The conversion of tankers for oxygen will increase the oxygen supply and the demands are likely to be met. We are also trying to arrange oxygen from other places to ensure regular supply for the private hospitals,” she said.Additional chief secretary TC Gupta on Tuesday formed a team of five officials to assess demand for oxygen, its transportation and distribution. The commissioner of Municipal Corporation of Gurugram, (MCG) Vinay Pratap Singh, was appointed as the team leader along with additional deputy commissioner Prashant Pawar, deputy civil surgeon Anuj Garg and RTA secretary, Dhaarna Yadav. Amandeep Chauhan, the district drug controller, was designated the coordinator.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/five-industrial-tankers-converted-to-transport-oxygen-sent-to-odisha-plant-101619633379940.html
28-04-2021||Gurugram||91 large outbreak regions notified, lockdown-like curbs to be enforced||With no signs of the Covid-19 infection abating, the administration on Wednesday notified 91 large outbreak regions in the district and deployed police personnel to restrict the movement of public in these areas. Officials of the district administration said that lockdown-like curbs will be imposed to prevent a localised spread of infections.Dr Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner of Gurugram, who issued the directions on Wednesday, said that non-essential movement will be checked while those moving to and from the areas will undergo medical checks. Mandatory temperature checks will be done and symptomatic people will be tested using rapid antigen kits, Garg said. The use of the Aarogya Setu application will also be mandated, he said.According to the data shared by the district administration, a maximum number of the large outbreak regions (LORs) are concentrated in the condominiums along the Golf Course Road, Golf Course Extension Road, MG Road, Sohna Road and the Southern Peripheral Road. These areas fall under the jurisdiction of the primary health centres of Tigra, Chanderloke, Nathupur and Badshahpur. According to the district administration, a LOR is defined as an area where there are at least 15 Covid-19 cases, with a localised increase within a defined geographical area. The cases may not be linked epidemiologically but will be considered a LOR for operational purposes. Areas, where at least five Covid-19 cases have been reported, are classified as containment zones. However, officials said that most of the containment zones at present fall within the LORsResidents in LORs, who have taken permission from the subdivisional magistrates to hold social gatherings or other events would not be allowed to do so. Residents would have to reapply for permission and the same will be allowed outside restricted zones, the police said.Pradeep Kumar, SDM, Pataudi, said that all Covid-19 protocols and safeguards like social distancing will be enforced strictly in the LORs. “The enforcement of Section 144 of the CrPC would be strict to break the chain of infection,” he said.Officials of the Gurugram police department said that 400 police personnel were deployed in the LORs notified by the administration, to keep a check on public movement and ensure that markets remain closed, with Section 144 of the CrPC, restricting gathering of four people or more in public spaces, in force.“We have deployed police personnel police station wise and they are setting up barricades to restrict movement of people. They would also ensure that more than four people don’t gather at shops and markets remain closed in these LORs. No social gathering or function is allowed in these areas,” said Subash Boken, public relations officer, Gurugram police department.The police said that personnel were also deployed across its east, west, south and Manesar police districts to enforce Covid-19 protocols.The police also appealed to residents to shut religious places inside containment zones, as gatherings of four people are not allowed. “The markets will remain closed in these areas and anyone coming out from these LORs would be tested for temperature and other symptoms by the health authorities,” a senior police official said, requesting anonymity.The health department is in the process of constituting teams for intensive testing, screening and contact tracing of people in LORs. “Multiple teams of health workers will visit isolated patients and assist them in treatment. Increasing testing in these areas and screening of people in large numbers will help in breaking the chain of infection,” said Dr Virender Yadav, chief medical officer, Gurugram.Yadav said that they will also form teams to work on contact tracing of Covid-19 patients. The teams will be constituted based on the number of LORs under each public health centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/91-large-outbreak-regions-notified-lockdown-like-curbs-to-be-enforced-101619633379258.html
28-04-2021||Gurugram||Only registered hospitals will get oxygen refill: MCG||Even as hospitals continue to grapple with oxygen short supply despite the district receiving 35 metric tonnes (MT) per day, officials of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) said that only hospitals registered in Gurugram will be granted supply.In an order issued late on Tuesday, MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh observed that hospitals and nursing homes located outside Gurugram district are sending their vehicles to oxygen refilling stations meant to service hospitals and nursing homes of Gurugram, thereby adding “undue pressure” on the oxygen quota allocated for the district. At least six people have died in the city since Sunday due to a shortage of oxygen, according to private hospitals.“In order to stop this practice (of nursing homes and hospitals outside Gurugram district availing of the services of the city’s three oxygen refilling stations), it has been decided that henceforth, only hospitals and nursing homes located in Gurugram district and registered on web portal covidharyana.in will be entitled to get gas cylinders filled at oxygen refilling stations registered with the district administration and in no circumstances will any outside hospitals or nursing homes be allowed access to oxygen refilling stations,” the order stated.A senior official of the MCG, privy to the matter, said, “We had received reports of hoarding of oxygen by small private companies, which was having an adverse effect on both the supply and demand. Many of these companies were selling oxygen to residents at exorbitant rates in black. Hence, over the past two days, we stopped entertaining requests from such companies or individuals and only hospitals and nursing homes were allowed procurement of oxygen from the three refilling stations. The MCG is also in the process of creating a mechanism of our own to ensure personal delivery of oxygen cylinders.”Singh directed the Gurugram police and executive magistrates to ensure that the directions are complied with and that all hospitals and nursing homes accessing the three filling stations are registered with the district administration.Further, the order stated that Gurugram-based hospitals will get the supply only if they update data regarding allocation of beds and occupancy on the state Covid-19 portal by 5pm every day. If registered hospitals or nursing homes fail to update the data, then the district administration will consider discontinuing or limiting the supply of oxygen.Gurugram has three oxygen refilling stations, two of which are in Manesar and one is in Sector 16. The district received 20 MT of oxygen from the INOX oxygen plant in Bhiwadi of Rajasthan and 15 metric tonnes from the Air Liquid Company in Panipat.KK Rao, the commissioner of Gurugram police, said that they have created green corridors for the oxygen tankers from Panipat and Bhiwadi to reach the city without delay and that personnel were deployed at all three refilling stations to ensure compliance with the orders issued by the MCG.“Our teams are escorting tankers to all the plants and teams have been deployed at the distribution plants as well, as identified by the district administration. We are also coordinating with the teams to ensure there is no ruckus created at these filling centres where long queues have been witnessed,” he said.The MCG, in its order, also stated that the civic body’s joint commissioner, Pradeep Ahlawat, has been designated as the nodal officer to ensure “equitable distribution as per requirement at oxygen refilling stations.” Singh said that Ahlwat and his team will ensure that the distribution is done on a token system and that the distributors do not indulge in profiteering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/only-registered-hospitals-will-get-oxygen-refill-mcg-101619633378713.html

All passengers trains will also be escorted at strategic timings. We are also enhancing strategic deployment of forces, intensive patrolling and boosting up intelligence sharing with state police,” DB Kasar, SER chief security commissioner cum RPF IG, said.Members of banned extremist faction CPI(Maoist) on Monday blew one meter of rail track on Howrah-Mumbai main line between Sonua and Lotapahar stations under Chakradharpur division of SER.Earlier in the day, Kasar inspected the blast site and was scheduled to have a series of meetings with Railway, RPF and state police officers in the next two days.“A comprehensive investigation is going on, as prima facie looked to be a part of larger game plan involving Maoist massacre of 22 CRPF jawans in Chhattisgarh, support to farmers’ protest etc. The banners and pamphlets clearly mentioned both,” said Kasar.Another senior railway security officer said the blasting on the rail track came off as a major concern because preliminary investigation found that they used highly explosive ammonium nitrate instead of steel can IEDs. “The pieces of the track were blown as far as 35m away,” he said.Maoist squads led by Central Committee Member Patiram Majhi alias Anal da, carrying a reward of ₹1 crore on his head, and Suresh Munda, carrying ₹10 lakh reward, are active under Sonua-Chakradharpur belt.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/now-pilot-escort-for-oxygen-express-101619626118424.html

AKU became headless after its pro-VC, S M Karim, who was made to officiate as acting V-C by the Raj Bhawan, was reportedly asked to resign over the controversy surrounding the continuance of Rajiv Ranjan as registrar. A few days ago, Karim tendered his resignation after accepting the resignation of the registrar. Raj Bhawan issued the notification Wednesday, accepting Karim’s resignation, and handed over additional charge to SP Singh. The registrar at AKU is also under additional charge from another university. AKU, set up in 2010 to regulate all technical institutions by bringing them under one umbrella, has been without a regular V-C since September 20, 2020, when the term of Arun Kumar Agarwal ended. Since then, Karim had been holding the additional charge of V-C. Earlier, Bihar Raj Bhawan had also given SP Singh the additional charge of Pataliputra University and Maulana Mazharul Haq Arabic and Persian University in Patna in addition to LNMU to make it four. Asked whether it will be tough for him to handle four universities in the midst of the pandemic, Singh said one has to shoulder responsibility when it comes. “I am a performer. In Pataliputra University, I have done what was not done in the last two-and-a-half years. As long as the additional charge is there, I will discharge my duties with full devotion,” he said, after taking charge at AKU. Apart from Singh, TM Bhagalpur University VC Neelima Gupta is also holding the additional charge of Munger University, while BRA Bihar University VC Hanuman Prasad Pandey holds the additional charge of Nalanda Open University (NOU). But then, it is not the first time that any V-C has been given charge of up to four universities in Bihar. It had also happened during the time of former Bihar Governor late Devanand Konwar when the government and the Raj Bhawan were at loggerheads over the appointment of VCs and the matter landed up in the Supreme Court. Advancing summer vacation In view of the pandemic, the LNMU VC and TMBU V-C have moved a proposal to the Raj Bhawan for advancing the summer vacation in universities to May. Earlier, Patna University teachers association and employees association had also approached the VC for it. However, the Raj Bhawan has not yet taken any decision on it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/one-v-c-four-universities-to-oversee-101619625998883.html

About 370 Covid patients, most of them under critical care, are undergoing treatment at the NMCH. Junior doctors, numbering around 150, play a crucial role in management of Covid at the hospital, already facing tremendous resource crunch due to heavy load of patients.Health minister Mangal Pandey and principal secretary (health) Pratyay Amrit, refused to respond despite repeated calls. NMCH officials, pleading anonymity, said they were striving hard to win over the agitating doctors to put off their strike during the crisis.One of the attendants, Ashutosh Dubey, said chaos and confusion prevailed in the hospital after PG doctors began refusing to attend on critical patients despite repeated pleas. “Oxygen supply to beds was suspended for some time in the night as well. However, it was restored soon on intervention of senior doctors and NMCH management,” he said.This is the third time this week when junior doctors, who are doing PG courses, went on flash strike, demanding safety and security on the campus. The junior doctors and subordinate doctors allege that they were often abused and assaulted by kin of the patients.Junior doctors’ association president Ram Chandra claimed situation at the NMCH was not improving despite announcements and assurances from the minister concerned and senior officers. “We will not resume work until the health minister and principal secretary, health, visit the NMCH and fulfilled their demands,” said Chandra.The junior doctors have been demanding immediate deployment of paramilitary forces, appointment of doctors and other health staff like nurses and ward boys as per requirement and availability of proper medical infrastructure.Meanwhile, with 13,374 new cases of Covid-infection detected in the last 24 hour, total number of active cases in Bihar has mounted to 98,747 on Wednesday. Chief minister Nitish Kumar expressed his grief over the demise of Pankaj Kumar Singh, director of industries department, due to Covid.

This test and the checking is carried by the Pune Municipal Corporation’s (PMC) health department, but currently it doesn’t seem to be happening. “We check passengers coming from other states to Pune railway station for the RTPCR test report.

28-04-2021||Pune||Citizens with disabilities want independent vaccination centre||Citizens with disabilities in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad believe that a separate vaccination centre will ease the process in terms of easy access, convenience and a quicker process. With long queues at most vaccination centres every day, disabled are finding it difficult to navigate through the entire procedure. “People do help us in finding a chair or offer us spaces, but these days many hesitate because of Covid-19. People do allow us to get ahead in the queue and doctors also help us, however, the procedure takes a long time. If there is a different centre then we might not have to deal with long queues and nobody has to bother about us,” said Savita Darkunde, who works at Bank of India, Swargate. Darkunde, who is blind, took her vaccination a few days back and was accompanied by her four friends to the centre. “I was even helped by the hospital staff, but real problems arise for those who are illiterate, as they don’t understand things easily and their disability makes things more difficult for them,” added Darkunde. Pravin Parkhe, who is partially blind and works as an assistant general manager, grade 3, at the Food Corporation of India said, “If there are 10 vaccination centres for citizens, one should be devoted for the specially-abled. Everyone doesn’t offer help, some have reservations, and it creates unnecessary arguments especially when things are so tense at centres due to vaccine shortages.” The National Federation of Blind has written a letter to the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) and Pimpri-Chinchwad Municipal Corporation (PCMC) asking them to make 500 doses of vaccination available and the staff to undergo vaccinations after May 1. “For the specially-abled, going at centres is becoming difficult with no public transport and most of them cannot drive on their own due to the disability. I hope the administration provides us the vaccines so we will provide them a suitable place where they can come and vaccinate all of us or we are also ready for door-to-door vaccination,” said Sushil Patil, treasurer, National Federation of Blind. PCMC starts separate centre for specially-abled From Wednesday, the PCMC administration in coordination with Rotary Club of Pimpri has started a vaccination centre for the specially-abled. The first day did not have a big response as many of them were still unaware about the centre. “We have forwarded messages on their groups and also planned a one common pick-up point in the allocated areas where our bus will go pick them up and drop as well. From tomorrow (Thursday) rush will increase,” said Mehul Parmar, president, Rotary Club of Pimpri. The PCMC administration did not release the number of people vaccinated on the first day at the centre. In the twin cities, there are a total of 2,145 people above 45 who are eligible for vaccination.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/citizens-with-disabilities-want-independent-vaccination-centre-101619625458424.html

This decision was taken due to the rising number of Covid cases followed by strict lockdown in the state. Those students who have not yet filled up their examination form can register online and fill up the form with a late fee of ₹250. “Earlier, the last day to submit the examination form for HSC students was April 4, with transfer of credit and students with limited subjects were allowed to fill the form by April 22. Due to the rising number of Covid cases in Maharashtra the state government postponed the HSC exams,” said MSBSHSE secretary Ashok Bhosale. “So, it is now decided that students who have not yet filed up the examination form until April 23, can now register online and fill up the form up even one day before the examinations begin.

28-04-2021||Pune||Parents fear delay in RTE admissions will affect children||The school admissions under the Right To Education (RTE) have been affected with the extension of lockdown likely till May 15. The lottery for RTE was declared on April 7. However, the admission process is yet to begin due to the current lockdown. Parents now fear that this delay, similar to last year, will affect their children academically. The RTE admissions under RTE for academic year 2020-2021 were finalised in January 2021.Speaking about the delay in the admission process, Soni Rathod from Undri said that her 6-year-old son has been selected under RTE for admission in Class 1. “I have not received any message as of yet to start with the admission process. I have seen my number on the online lottery of admission under the RTE. The online lottery was on April 7,” said Rathod. “Due to lockdown, there has been a delay. We went to the RTE office as well for enquiry. We were informed that the process will start soon and the details will be uploaded on the website. We want the online school to start so that the child is busy. The process should not be delayed as the child will suffer academically,” said Rathod. Under RTE, 25 per cent seats of the unaided private schools are reserved for students from economically backward sections at entry level of preschool and Class 1. For the academic year 2021-2022, there are 982 RTE registered schools in Pune. Of the 55,813 applications, 14,567 students were selected in Pune during the online lottery. Mukund Kirdat, city-based education activist and member of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), said that even though lockdown is in effect, the education department should start with the admission process. Across Maharashtra, there are 82,129 students selected under RTE during the online lottery. “The schools have already started their admissions. In such cases, there is a huge list of parents waiting under the RTE. If the regular admission under RTE is not done, then the waiting list parents will also suffer. Because some parents are hoping to secure admission through RTE, they have not applied through normal admission for their ward,” said Kirdat. He further added that the education department does not seem prepared even during the second wave. “Document verification for parents under the RTE can start as there are not a lot of parents at a particular school. Such special provisions should be made so that the process is finished soon, and students start their academic year,” said Kirdat. Education department officials said that parents can look for more information regarding the online admission process on the official website of RTE.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/parents-fear-delay-in-rte-admissions-will-affect-children-101619625218388.html

If societies who want to conduct tests, they can arrange it for themselves, but no compulsion has been made from our side,” said Suhas Patwardhan, chairman, Pune district cooperative housing federation limited. “In my society we have not made it compulsory. I feel domestic workers are more aware about the current scenario and they are keeping their health in check. My maid said that she has to take care of two families – one her own and second, ours, so she gives top priority to her health,” said Rajendra Chuttar, president, Baner-Pashan Link Road welfare trust. In Wagholi, people have taken extra precautions and only allowed maids at homes where the residents need medical attention. “Since the last 15 days, we have put restrictions on the entry of domestic helpers in the society and are only permitting them at homes where there are health issues. We are conducting RT-PCR tests at regular intervals,” said Sanjeev Patil, director, Wagholi Housing Societies Association (WHSA).

On April 22, another set of restrictions were introduced by the Maha Vikas Aghadi-led state government on inter-city and inter-district travel, office attendance, and weddings till May 1.Tope pointed out these restrictions have helped in bringing stability in cases hoping they will start declining in the near future.Maharashtra on Wednesday joined the list of states which will provide free vaccination to all residents between the ages of 18-44 in the third phase of the nationwide vaccination drive, scheduled to start from May 1. All residents will have to register themselves on the CoWin app in order to get inoculated, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray’s office said.Also Read| Covid-19: Maharashtra to vaccinate all citizens between 18 and 44 years for freeThey will be further divided into three categories- 18-25 years, 26-35 years and 39 to 44 years in order to avoid any inconvenience, Tope said on Wednesday.However, Maharashtra is still continuing to report a shortage of vaccine doses. Health minister Tope said a full-fledged roll-out of the May 1 vaccination drive is not possible due to this shortage and the state government is unlikely to get vaccine doses from both Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech before May 20.According to news agency PTI, health experts have warned a slowdown in Maharashtra’s vaccination drive can pave the way for a third wave of the Covid-19 disease in the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maha-sees-record-jump-in-daily-covid-deaths-at-985-mumbai-s-new-cases-increase-101619623131174.html
28-04-2021||Pune||Dose shortage hits Covid vaccination drive in Pune||PUNE At least 39 lakh people from Pune district under the age of 45 years will have to wait for their turn to get vaccinated as the state public health minister Rajesh Tope announced that full-fledged rollout of the inoculation drive from May 1 is not possible for the want of vaccines.While the wait for younger ones has extended further, those above the age of 45 years are also facing problem as the drive had to be stopped on Wednesday as the administration did not have a stock of Covishield doses.At many places, senior citizens had to return without jab as centres did not get vaccine supply.Pune last received its stock on Sunday which was 35,000 for the city and 55,000 for the rural areas. However, on Wednesday the entire stock along with the ones in the pipeline, the ones already distributed to the hospitals and the centres, came to a complete grinding halt.Asif Shaikh, a beneficiary, said, “Today (on Wednesday) I went to three vaccination centres in Pune, but they didn’t have and when I asked them about availability they said they don’t know. Now, where is management and why we can’t get the vaccine?”Another beneficiary Harish Pandey said, “My parents (70 and 65-years-old) have received the first dose of vaccine and now they are waiting for the second dose. I am worried they will receive it on time due to shortage.”Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MLA Siddharth Shirole tweeted on Wednesday that, “Unfortunately Pune has run out of stock Covshield vaccine for today (28/4). I am going to be talking to the city & state administration today to understand the exact reasons behind the supply vs. demand mismatch, and hopeful resolve the same by tomorrow.” (sic)A senior Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) official who is responsible to procure and distribute vaccine in the city said, “We have not got the stock as of yet and when we asked the state about when the next stock would arrive we have not got any answer on the same. We get to know only an hour before the stock arrives and state officials who inform us get to know only half an hour before the stock arrives. The Covaxin doses are reserved to be used only as a second dose and even that is now over.”Currently, all aged above 45 are eligible to get the vaccine until May 1 when all aged above 18-44 will get the vaccine unless the state government decides to postpone it due to lack of vaccine.As of the latest data from the state health department as of Tuesday Pune district has vaccinated 44.11% of the estimated population aged above 45 years with the first dose. Out of the 1.17 crores estimated population of the district, 35 lakh are estimated to be those aged above 45 years. Out of the 35 lakh, 15.54 lakh have got the first dose.Registration woesOn Wednesday, the Co-WIN app was to open up for vaccination of those aged between 18-44, however many complained that they could not get themselves registered. While those who got themselves registered could not get a schedule since the app showed only distant locations available for vaccination like Indapur, Alephata and Baramati and some said that those aged below 45 were unable to get the slot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/dose-shortage-hits-covid-vaccination-drive-in-pune-101619622818178.html

28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Property not registered on carpet-area basis to be declared illegal: HARERA||Any property sale agreement, if not registered based on carpet area alone, will tantamount to indulging in unfair trade practice by the promoter and attract action, the Haryana Real Estate Regulatory Authority (HARERA), Gurugram cautioned.The HARERA, Gurugram has issued regulations for sale of apartment or building in any real estate project on carpet-area basis, said HARERA, Gurugram, chairman Dr KK Khandelwal.“Any sale of real estate project (on any other basis except carpet area) after the Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 coming into force will be declared null and void by HARERA,” Dr Khandelwal said.He added that property in real estate projects is not properly described by way of mentioning super area without specifically giving details and breakup of the components included in the super area.He said that the practice of sale of real estate on super area basis is misleading, ambiguous, opaque, and gives rise to confusion and complexities, and at times, triggers avoidable litigation.The HARERA chairman said that to ensure sale of plot, apartment, building, etc in a transparent manner and to protect the interest of consumers in the real estate sector, regulations have been made by the Authority.Khandelwal said that before Real Estate (Regulation and Development) Act, 2016 came into existence, there was lack of a legal description for the term ‘carpet area’.“Now, this vagueness and uncertainty has been addressed. The term carpet area has been specifically and distinctly defined under Section 2(k) of the Act (ibid),” he said.He added that the definition of carpet area as provided under Section 2(k) of the Act means the net usable floor area.“Externals wall, service shafts, balcony, verandah and open terrace have been excluded from the definition of carpet area. However, the internal partition walls of the apartment are not excluded as they form a part of the integral structure that is the carpet area,” he said.“The definition of carpet area has now been made transparent and leaves no scope for any ambiguity categorically specifying the property,” said Khandelwal.All walls that are constructed or provided on the external face of an apartment will be regarded as ‘external wall’ and all walls or independent columns constructed or provided within an apartment will be regarded as ‘internal partition wall’, he added.He said that no conveyance deed of a real estate unit will be registered except on the basis of carpet area.In cases where the real estate unit is allotted to the allottee prior to the Act coming into force, the promoter at the time of registration of the conveyance deed will make disclosure of all the components constituting the super area and the conveyance deed will be registered only on carpet-area basis.Dr Khandelwal said that regulations will be applicable to all real estate projects, irrespective of the fact that they are registered or registerable or exempted from registration.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/property-not-registered-on-carpet-area-basis-to-be-declared-illegal-harera-101619620778703.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi-NCR helps: Residents run errands, arrange meds, cook food, amid rising cases||One act of kindness can save a life. And folks in Delhi-NCR have taken upon themselves to help out people as much as possible in these trying times, amid the rising coronavirus cases. Whether it’s offering to cook food for the Covid positive individuals/families, running a local errand, arranging medicines, looking for plasma donors, or helping out with information such as on available hospital beds, they are doing it all! Some like restauranteur Ankur Malhotra, from Noida, is part of many WhatsApp groups, and help in passing on the relevant information. “My friends call me jugadu. Things are really bad and getting worse. Some people want injections, medicines or where beds are available with oxygen. I keep on passing information and sharing references to anyone who needs them,” he says. Kirti Khanna, a corporate professional, recently took to social media to extend help with local errands such as arranging medicines and food. “I’m seeing friends lose their relatives. I could figure out that there is a lot of chaos, and people genuinely need help. And the feeling of helplessness of not getting some of the basic is very overwhelming at times. So I thought I could connect people to chemists in Gurugram. I love to cook so I can provide food. My husband is home so he can deliver. I can just talk to them to make them feel better. Simply try to be there. When the world is going crazy, all you need is an act of kindness,” she says.Sakshi Banga, a Delhi-based lawyer, who is going all across the city delivering medicines herself, says, “The situation is horrifying right now. I’m helping out people as much as possible. And we all need to help each other out! People have been asking about availability of beds, plasma donors, Remdesivir, and even doctor’s appointments for a video consultation... People aren’t able to connect to good doctors, especially those who have peculiar conditions. I’m available at 9871073448, if anyone needs help.”Gurugram-based homemaker Priyanka Talreja, who recently sent food to a Covid patient and a relative in her family, says she’s open to helping out others too. “You need to eat well for recovery during Covid. I would try my level best to help others, too. This is the time when we need to stand by senior citizens, and those living alone, arrange medicines. My cook called me, and I arranged the number of a guy who does our check-up. So, help in whatever little ways we can.” And then there are some like Aditya Amit Gundh who are running informal groups that promote art, spirituality and fitness to ease the anxiety and stress induced due to the pandemic. He says, “There are people who want to talk, as there is a lot of anxiety and fear. There is a real threat outside, but perceptive threat is also why people are suffering because of fear of loss of job, and health concerns. Within this group, there are people capable to help in times of need. We are offering people to just open up, call us and just speak. Every Sunday there is an online baithak where poets, singers come together to entertain people. Anyone can log in at Instagram.com/dimensionscommune.”Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhincr-helps-residents-run-errands-arrange-meds-cook-food-amid-rising-cases-101619620480065.html
28-04-2021||Other||Covid patient inflow from Delhi-NCR leading to shortage of oxygen-support beds in Haryana hospitals||Amid reports of bed shortage and oxygen support system in Delhi and National Capital Region (NCR), increasing number of patients from there are getting admitted at hospitals in Haryana from the past few days.Recently, Haryana health minister Anil Vij had said that patients from Delhi are coming to Karnal, Rohtak and Ambala. “As per a survey, 70% patients in the districts of Gurugram and Faridabad hailed from Delhi. Extra beds are being made available for these patients,” Vij said.MOST PATIENTS FROM DELHI IN CRITICAL STAGEAs per officials of Karnal health department, nearly 32% of the total Covid-19 patients hospitalised in hospitals in district are from Delhi-NCR.Most patients coming from Delhi are in a critical stage and require oxygen support, said the officials.As per data, of total 443 beds with oxygen support at 17 Covid hospitals in district, 142 are occupied by patients from Delhi. And 63 of total 197 patients put on ventilators are from Delhi.Also, 102 of total 440 patients admitted at hospitals in Rewari are from Delhi, Rajasthan and other districts; and 350 of nearly 1,000 patients in Hisar are from Delhi, Punjab and Rajasthan. However, 95 of over 500 patients undergoing treatment in Jhajjar are locals.A PGIMS official, pleading anonymity, said 401 Covid patients are undergoing treatment at the institute and many of them hail from Delhi-NCR districts.Similarly, around 10-15% patients admitted in Covid hospitals in Panipat and Kurukshetra are from other districts and most of them are from Delhi, increasing bed occupancy, especially in the ICU.Doctors said most patients from Delhi are admitted in private hospitals in Haryana.STATE HOSPITALS FACE SHORTAGE OF BEDSWith number of patients increasing with each passing day, the district administrations are facing shortage of beds.In Karnal, only 10 beds with oxygen support are left unoccupied and one with ventilator support.Karnal deputy commissioner Nishant Kumar Yadav said, “Around 32% patients from Delhi are admitted in Karnal hospitals as we cannot refuse treatment to anyone. Providing life-saving facilities is our top priority.”He said following surge in number of patients, an oxygen storage tank is being set up at Kalpana Chawla Government Medical College and Hospital (KCGMCH), Karnal and number of ICU beds with oxygen support is being increased from 60 to 100.OFFICIALS COMPILING DATARohtak civil surgeon Dr Anil Birla said many patients from Delhi-NCR are admitted at hospitals in district and have been shifted here due to shortage of beds in the national capital.“We are compiling report as to how many patients from Delhi, Gurugram and Faridabad are undergoing treatment in district,” he added.Sonepat civil surgeon Dr JS Punia said many patients from Delhi are visiting hospitals in district for Covid treatment.Jhajjar chief medical officer Dr Sanjay Dahiya said due to proximity to Delhi-NCR, many patients from there are coming for treatment at hospitals in district.“We have 160 ICU beds in district, including private hospitals. Of these, 147 are occupied. There are 26 ventilators in district, of which 23 are occupied; 447 oxygen beds (excluding ICU), of which nearly 400 are occupied. There can be shortage of beds in future but for now, the situation is under control,” he added.LOCAL KIN HELPING OUT NCR PATIENTSAccording to doctors, people are taking help of local relatives to admit patients by giving address of the local relative as attendant of the patient.Kurukshetra chief medical officer Dr Sukhbir Singh said, “Patients from Delhi are coming to our hospitals but we don’t have the exact data of them as many are providing local address of their relatives. We are ensuring that all patients coming to us get treatment as per government norms.”Anju Gupta, of Delhi, said she has shifted her husband to a private hospital in Sonepat after they failed to find a bed in Delhi. “At this time, our focus is on my husband’s recovery. Two days ago, when the oxygen supply was about to run out, my relatives managed to bring three gas cylinders for my husband,” she added.Ankit Kumar, of Gurugram, said he has shifted his mother to a private hospital in Bahadurgarh after they failed to find an ICU bed for her. “Our only one concern is getting enough oxygen supply. Doctors are working really hard to treat my mother whose lungs got infected,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-patient-inflow-from-delhi-ncr-increasing-in-haryana-hospitals-101619619278779.html

28-04-2021||Delhi||It appears you want people to die: Delhi HC tells Centre||The Delhi High Court Wednesday said it appeared that the Centre wanted people to die as according to the new protocol on use of Remdesivir for COVID-19 treatment, the drug was to be given only to those on oxygen support."This is wrong. This is a complete non-application of mind. Now people who do not have oxygen will not get Remdesivir either. It appears you want people to die," Justice Prathiba M Singh said to the central government.It appears the Centre was changing the protocol to reduce the shortage of the drug, the high court said."This is complete mismanagement," the court added. It was hearing a plea by a lawyer who is suffering from COVID-19 and was able to get only three out of the six doses of Remdesivir required.Due to court's intervention, the lawyer got the remaining vials on Tuesday (April 27) night.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/it-appears-you-want-people-to-die-delhi-hc-tells-centre-101619611572785.html
28-04-2021||Bangalore||Bangalore Talkies: Conservancies changed face of Malleshwaram||Art holds a dubious place in many circles. There are those who say self-righteously, “I just don’t understand this modern art.” There are economists and investors who put a price tag on this deep human instinct to paint and express -- just visit the Bhimbetka caves in Madhya Pradesh to see early rock art. There is the art that is taught in schools but as children get older, it gets taken out in lieu of maths and science. Globally, art departments are suffering from funding-cuts, thanks to the pandemic. And then there is art that is inclusive, expansive, out on the streets. Never before have we wasted art more than during this pandemic when we all have been stuck at home.You want proof? Come to Malleshwaram in Bengaluru and you will see a colourful, spirited and resounding defense to the question: of what value is art?It is art that has drawn me to Malleshwaram several times during Covid. Walking through streets where the artists have painted an ode to their neighbourhood is nothing less than a joyous and healing experience. But let us begin from the beginning.In early April, a group of artists got together to paint walls in different parts of Malleshwaram (and all across Bengaluru). There is Anpu Varkey’s mural of the white sari-clad feet of a woman near Seva Sadan. Round the corner in a tiny lane, Chandana B V has painted the champaka or sampige flowers that fill Malleshwaram with its fragrance. Diagonally across the road is a woman contemplating over a fresh cup of filter coffee, by artist Enoch Ebenezar. Artist Girija Hariharan has painted a lovely portrait of sari-clad women surrounded by marigolds in the lane just behind Veena Stores, known for its idlis. Spandana Vella has painted sparrows, beloved to Bangaloreans. Saksham Verma has created the title ‘Malleshwaram in many hues’ both in English and Kannada. There are other artists who came together to form Geechugalu, a collective that has painted these murals.You can see the photos of their murals across Bengaluru on their website geechugalu.wordpress.com or on their Facebook page ‘Geechugalu’ or ‘Bengaluru Moving’ that are posted along with the hashtag #malleshwaramhogona or ‘let’s go to Malleshwaram’. As a friend Madhu Natraj says: “Do you need any more proof that Malleshwaram is the centre of the universe?”But then, I knew that, Madhu. It was art that took me to Malleshwaram.What is interesting though is the foundation upon which all this art flowered. A number of civic and government agencies have joined hands with passionate citizens to create these murals and street art.Take ‘Bengaluru Moving’ for instance. It promotes a cause that is dear to all Indians: safe streets for walking. Bengaluru’s traffic is horrible. That we all agree, even those who love this city. The way forward is public transport like Namma Metro and pedestrian-friendly streets. The goal is to encourage more citizens to use “non-motorised transport” like bicycles or our own two feet. But how to walk in a city that is all dug up?Enter the lanes that architect Suchitra Deep calls “conservancies”. Suchitra lives and works in Malleshwaram. As we walk together through the congested thoroughfares of Malleshwaram, Suchitra quickly turns into tiny lanes that run parallel to the main streets. These, she says, are “conservancies” that were used primarily for manual scavenging when Malleshwaram used to have large plots with several bungalows. Today, these tiny lanes have no traffic and are a pleasure to walk through. In fact, I couldn’t believe that they were right in the heart of the city. No horns, no scooters, just me and the art that lined the walls. Very civilised and healing.Suchitra has been mapping the “conservancies” since 2013. A confluence of grants kick-started her idea to convert them into walking streets. The community group she is part of, Malleshwaram Social, collaborated with Sensing Local which is an “urban-living lab”, according to its website. Sensing Local works on a variety of issues to help create sustainable cities. Together, they created M-ULL (Malleshwaram Urban Living Lab) and won a grant from the Department of Urban Land Transport (DULT) as part of its Sustainable Urban Mobility Programme (SuMA). Sensing Local also got a grant from Purpose with the goal of improving walking and pedestrian-friendly streets. These grants brought in the artists. So there you go: a government department (DULT) helping a variety of urban initiatives to beautify streets. Thank you, DULT, SuMA, Sensing Local, Malleshwaram Social and Geechugalu. Today, about 160 people are working together on this project.What is Suchitra’s learning from all this? “I had many ideas as an architect but my own limitations stopped me from going further. Each collaborator we brought on board gave us more reach, but still we needed funds. DULT stepping in helped us with that and involved the government. The Purpose grant helped bring in the artists. The moment you have artwork on this scale, it makes it pop. So it takes the coming together of many individuals and organisations to make change happen in the correct way.”Shoba Narayan is waiting for the dust to clear as she kicks up some dirt, all while trying not to fall into the gutter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/bangalore-talkies-conservancies-changed-face-of-malleshwaram-101619610938127.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Amid Covid crisis, PG students to continue as resident doctors||Amid the surge in Covid-19 cases, Baba Farid University of Health Sciences (BFUHS) has directed all medical colleges in Punjab to continue with the services of MD and MS students as resident doctors till fresh admissions. The National Medical Commission (NMC) has issued a circular, asking PG students in medical colleges across the country to continue as resident doctors to help the healthcare system deal with the rising Covid-19 cases during the second wave of the pandemic. Also read: PM Modi sanctions procurement 1 lakh portable oxygen concentrators from PM-CARESNo fresh admissions to PG medical and diploma courses were done in the state medical colleges due to the postponement of the National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-PG) exams. More than 400 final year MS and MD students are working as residents in three government and four private colleges. Students of most PG colleges were roped in last year to augment trained manpower for the treatment of Covid and non-Covid patients. BFUHS seeks to ensure that the present batch continues to serve as resident doctors to help deal with the Covid crisis until fresh admissions are made to PG courses and final year exams are held. Dr Raj Bahadur, vice-chancellor of BFUHS, said that due to the surge in Covid cases, the NEET-PG exam was postponed, resulting in delay in the joining of new batches for postgraduate courses. “In order to ensure that there is no shortage of residents in handling the surge, all medical colleges have been asked to continue with the services of final year PG students as residents until the fresh batch of students join,” he said. The post-graduate medical course exams have been stalled in the states due to the escalating Covid situation. Tackling Covid the priority Dr Ruhee Dugg, the BFUHS registrar, said: “While there are no classes for PG courses right now, we are providing online classes to MBBS batches.” Dr Rajeev Sharma, the principal of Guru Gobind Singh Medical College and Hospital, Faridkot, said due to the rising caseload, all PG students, including 80 final year students, are performing duties at the college’s Covid wards. “Tackling Covid is our priority so all other activities, including exams, stand postponed for now. Usually, the duty burden on PG students is decreased a month before their exams. But right now, they are performing duties round the clock to support the health system, so it is not the right time for exams,” he said. Dr Jaspinder Pratap Singh, a final year PG student, said he has no problem performing duties for an extended period, but it should be counted under senior resident shift. “The bond period to serve as a resident doctor for final year postgraduate students will end in May, so the period we have to serve in June onwards should be counted under the senior resident doctor’s shift,” he said. NEET-PG exams are generally conducted in February every year and the final year exams are held from April-May in Punjab medical colleges.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/amid-covid-crisis-pg-students-to-continue-as-resident-doctors-101619610279119.html
28-04-2021||Mumbai||Antilia bomb scare, Hiran murder case: Sunil Mane’s NIA custody extended to May 1||A special court here on Wednesday extended till May 1 National Investigation Agency (NIA) custody of Mumbai police officer Sunil Mane, arrested in connection with the Antilia bomb scare and the subsequent murder of Thane trader Mansukh Hiran.Mane was arrested on April 23 after he was called for interrogation in connection with the Antilia and Hiren murder cases. He was remanded to NIA custody till Wednesday, when the federal agency sought his custody further.Claiming that Mane played a role in the conspiracy of Hiran’s murder, the agency said they wanted to confront Mane with certain documents related to vehicles seized and also with call data record related to the case.On February 25, a Mahindra Scorpio was found abandoned near Antilia, the South Mumbai residence of industrialist Mukesh Ambani, with 20 loose gelatin sticks and a threatening note, and a case was registered with Gamdevi police station on the same day.Sachin Vaze was in charge of the case, but was removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV, and had reported it stolen on February 17. Hiran himself was found dead in a creek on March 5. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car in November and returned it in early February.Also Read | Suspended Mumbai cop Sunil Mane was in area when Mansukh Hiran was killed: NIANIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and the murder case on March 24. Vaze was named the main accused in both and was arrested by NIA on March 13.The Maharashtra government transferred then police commissioner Param Bir Singh over his management of the case. Singh wrote a letter to the chief minister, alleging that home minister Anil Deshmukh instructed Vaze and some other Mumbai police officers to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants, hookah parlours per month and when no action was forthcoming approached the courts.The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct a preliminary inquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation. Accordingly, the central agency registered an offence against Deshmukh on April 24 after a preliminary probe.Meanwhile, Vaze, who is presently in judicial custody, has asked the court to permit him to have a chair and mattresses in prison as he has difficulty in sitting on the floor. He further claimed that he has been suffering from dental issues. The court has asked the prison authority at Taloja jail to provide him necessary medical assistance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/antilia-bomb-scare-hiran-murder-case-sunil-mane-s-nia-custody-extended-to-may-1-101619609798205.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Delhi Covid patients putting strain on Haryana hospitals: Khattar||Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar on Wednesday said that health institutions of the state are under stress primarily because Delhi-based Covid-19 patients have taken admission in hospitals from Gurugram to Ambala. “We will not deny health facilities to Delhi-based patients in our health institutions. Patients from Delhi are coming to Gurugram and in some cases up to Ambala in large numbers,” Khattar said at a press conference in Chandigarh, admitting that the administration had not anticipated the size and scale of the second Covid-19 wave.Also read: Maruti Suzuki to shut down Haryana plants to make oxygen availableOver the past three days, Haryana has logged over 11,000 new cases daily with 11,931 fresh Covid-19 cases and 84 fatalities on Tuesday. Active cases climbed to 84,129 on Tuesday. Khattar said once the caseload of Delhi stabilises, it will reduce pressure on Haryana also as the flow of patients to the state will slow down. Says what hit us is nothing short of tsunami Stating that meeting the demand of medical oxygen was the biggest challenge before the state government, he said no one had imagined that there would be such a massive demand for oxygen cylinders. Khattar said Covid is not just on the rise, but its graph is surging beyond estimates. “One can expect a deluge in the rainy season and prepare accordingly, but what has hit us is nothing short of a tsunami,” he said. Tankers being flown to Orissa The transportation of medical oxygen was another area of concern and he pointed out that the state was facing a shortage of tankers to transport the oxygen. After the Centre on Wednesday increased the oxygen quota of Haryana from 162 to 232 MT, the state government despatched five tankers to Orissa to fetch the oxygen by road. The chief minister said two tankers were being sent to Orissa by air and they will come back by road with the oxygen. Under the revised plan, Haryana was allocated 70 MT of medical oxygen from Orissa. “After we start receiving and supplying 232 MT of oxygen, we will be able to assess the requirement,” he said, urging people to come forward and fight the pandemic unitedly.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/delhi-covid-patients-putting-strain-on-haryana-hospitals-khattar-101619609378219.html

These plants convert liquid oxygen to a gaseous state and then it is administered to patients."Our two liquid oxygen plants at the trauma center are left with just a few hours of supply. We are expecting a truckload of raw stock supplies any time today. We hope that with this fresh arrival of stock our two plants will continue to function without a break," he said.Siddiqi said the third liquid oxygen plant in the old building is functioning round the clock and is a "lifesaver". This plant has raw stock "for another 36 hours", he said.Uttar Pradesh on Tuesday recorded its highest Covid-19 death toll so far as 265 people succumbed to the disease, while the state added nearly 33,000 fresh cases, taking the overall tally to 11,53,097, according to official data.In view of the shortage, AMU Vice Chancellor Tariq Mansoor Wednesday announced that the university will install a new oxygen plant within the next 30 days.The university has from its own resources generated ₹1.4 crore for purchasing this plant on an emergency basis, he said.AMU Registrar Abdul Hamid said, "Our main priority is to save human lives". The new plant will also be able to refill oxygen cylinders, he said.Aligarh MP Satish Gautam had told reporters on Tuesday night that he had a telephonic conversation with the Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath.The chief minister has assured that medical oxygen is being brought from Bokaro in Jharkhand and with this, the immediate requirements of Aligarh, Mathura, and Agra will be fulfilled.He said that the chief minister has assured that the present shortage would be met.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/273-patients-counting-on-few-hours-of-oxygen-amu-s-hospital-sends-out-alert-101619607637285.html

28-04-2021||Delhi||Covid positive pet parent in Delhi-NCR? Boarding facilities come to the rescue!||To feed or take out your furry bundle of joy becomes difficult when you or your family come in contact with Covid-19. And this has led many Covid positive families to send their pets to boarding facilities in Delhi-NCR, which are taking ample precautions to take care of the pawsome beings in the most hygiene way. “The problem is if a family has one Covid positive member, who gets hospitalised, then how do they take care of the ailing patient as well as their pets? In such cases often neighbours denying to help because not everyone is comfortable with animals,” says Vipul Agrahari, from Happy Petting. He says he has been getting four to five calls every day to enquire about the facility. “A lot of first timers are calling. And people calling us say that they need seven to days of boarding, till the time their second test is done, and the report comes out negative. But, not just those with Covid are looking for boarding facilities at present. During the lockdown last year, with all the time people had, they preferred to buy a dog, which has increased the number of pet dogs, and even birds, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs. Those pet parents, too, are looking for boarding facilities; but don’t want to board their small pets at big farmhouses. So we provide separate boarding facilities to cater to their needs,” adds Agrahari. “I’m getting around three calls per day from people where in the who family has become Covid positive,” says Arun Shivakumar, from Delhi-based Pet Home Boarding. He adds, “About 60% pets at our three acre farm are from families that have tested Covid positive recently. We have 38 dogs as of now. And we go and pick them up with utmost safety while wearing masks, gloves and keeping sanitisers handy. And we offer to keep them for a minimum of 15 days. But, as soon as we bring them here, we give them a shampoo bath. Dogs don’t get affected by coronavirus, but they can be a carrier of it. So, we also sanitise ourselves to evade any possibility of getting the virus.” Kuldeep Singh Chauhan, a farm-based boarding Pet Lovers Hut, in Delhi and Gurugram, says it’s difficult to provide pick up facility due to rise in demand. “People are enquiring for boarding facilities for 15 days, and we are getting a lot of calls! I’m not giving the facility of pick up now. Normal tareeka nahin hain ab pets ko rakhne ka. Relatives or friends of the Covid affected families are still leaving their pets with us. And first we give the dog a bath, and only then take him inside the kennel. If even someone isn’t infected with Covid, it’s difficult to be sure about it in such times. Bahut se log toh batate hi nahin hai. This has happened in the past, and later when they came to pick up the pet then they said that they were in quarantine. Hence we have to be extra cautious now, and don’t take any chances.”There are some kind souls who are helping others take care of their pets in these difficult times. Take for instance Tara, a Delhiite who works in an e-commerce firm. “I love dogs, and my husband and I am willing to take people’s dogs into our house. We offer to take of pets of families who have turned Covid positive, and have got a couple of calls so far. There are a lot of people who need help right now. So, if we can help, then why not? But we can’t take multiple pets since we don’t have a house help at present.” she says.Author tweets @Nainaarora8Follow more stories on Facebook and Twitter||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid-positive-pet-parent-in-delhi-ncr-boarding-facilities-come-to-the-rescue-101619603919035.html

Acting on a tip off, a police team raided the house of one Mohit Kumar at Devgarh village under Sahodra police station area of West Champaran district and seized the statue, weighing 7.75 kgs. Its antiquity and value have not been established yet. “During interrogation, we learnt that the statue was brought from Kathmandu. Further investigation into the matter is on,” said Upendra Nath Verma, superintendent of police (SP), Bettiah on Wednesday. Measuring 21cm in height and 15cm in width, the idol (black in colour), is believed to be made up of ‘Ashtadhatu’ or octo-alloy (eight precious metals) and its estimated value in the international market remains to be assessed. The police have approached the archaeological survey of India for this purpose. Ashtadhatu is often used for casting metallic idols in Jain and Hindu temples in India.“ASI’s visit will make things clearer,” said the SP. There are two Indian nationals among those arrested. They are identified as Mohit Kumar and Manoj Kumar, both residents of Bhikhnathori village located on the Indo-Nepal border. The arrested Nepalese nationals were identified as Raju Rana and Vinod Khabas - residents of Sundar Basti in Thodi area of Nepal’s Parsa district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/lord-budhha-s-idol-smuggled-from-nepal-seized-in-bihar-4-arrested-101619602717624.html
28-04-2021||Pune||Sutradhara’s tales: A “Gao-Kus” organises Pune to form a medieval “Kasba”||Till date, we have been discussing Pune’s time-line through scattered remains. Today, we shall geo-tagging the names found through various archives and public memory to physical locations, to make the first map of Pune in medieval times. In the last column, we witnessed the Bara Arab building a formidable fortress - Kille Hissar - on the banks of the Mutha during Bahamani rule. Some residential arrangements would have been made for soldiers, officers, commanders, helpers and Muslim residents. But, what was this fortress protecting? Bara Arab built the Killa-e-Hissar on the elevated portion formed between the then Ambil odha and the Madhala odha (stream passing through Pawale chowk), on the remains of previous settlement. He moved the settlement outside fort walls. Thus, instead of a complex settlement with temples, houses and public places, Pune was divided into a distinct military base and a civilian settlement separated by fort walls. The civilian population was shifted west of the fort and occupied the area form Madhal odha to the Nagjhari stream, on the border of present day Somwar peth. After the disintegration of the Bahamani dynasty, Nizamshahi rule descended on Pune. It was time of frequent conflicts and constant battles. Many medieval towns and villages of Maharashtra had a “Gao-Kus” -fortification wall along the boundaries built for protection against enemy attacks. In order to protect the settlement of Pune, it was appropriate that an additional fortification wall - Gao-Kus - be built around the civilian settlement. There was significant population of potters along the river Mutha, as water and river soil is their main raw material. The area occupied by potters was known as Kumbharli, then. Thus, it was only logical for the gateway to the northeast to be named as :Kumbhar Ves”. It survived till few decades back when it was demolished during road expansions. The Kumbhar Ves Maruti shrine exists even today. There are references to a small, dam wall and bridge, Dagadi Pul, built near Kumbhar Ves during the Nizamshahi period, which served as singular path to cross the river. The fertile grounds along the Nagjhari river to the fort were cultivated for flowers and vegetables, predominantly by the Mali caste or “gardeners”. The entire fertile track was known as “Mali” and the term has been frequently referred to in archival records to denote irrigated and cultivable lands. The gateway opening towards the Nagjhari stream to enter Mangalwar peth was known as Mali Ves, which is lost today. The area has several families belonging to the Mali caste residing in the neighbourhood at present.The area, which is uncultivable and used for non- agriculture purpose is called Mujeri, and lies next to Mali. It is mainly allotted for building settlements or people who practice livelihoods other than farming. The fortification wall near the Nagjhari houses a Maruti shrine named Gao-Kus Maruti, even today. It finds mentions in various medieval records. One can still observe the fortification wall’s heavy rectangular blocks marking the end of Pune’s settlement. If we venture along the Nagjhari stream one finds remains of the ghats, bastions and steps leading to the stream. The southern gateway marking the boundary of the settlement was “Kedar Ves”, named after the Kedareshwar temple, next to the present day Kasba Ganpati. The older settlement of Kasars (specifically referred to as Bangadi Kasar) or bangle makers, are from this area. They are distinct from the Tvastha Kasar or the Tambat (coppersmiths) who settled in same area in a later period. The entire area around the Pawale chowk to Kedareshwar is hence, known as Kasarli - the settlement of Bangle makers - in medieval archives. The western region of Pune is where the Mawal region lies and hence, the gateway was named as “Mawal Ves”. Thus, the medieval settlement of Pune was effectively protected on all four sides by the town wall and the military garrison near the river in the north. Purandare Daftar informs us that Pune was reorganised by combining Kasarli, Kumbharli and Pune villages. NV Joshi, a 19th century Marathi writer erroneously reported in the book Pune Sharache Varnan, that Kasarli, Kumbharli and Punawadi were the three villages brought together. Unfortunately, there is no evidence to suggest that any particular part of Pune was known as Punawadi. But, the name has stuck and many books on Pune still carry this wrong information.Dr Jaymala Diddee rightly observes that Kasarli and Kumbharli, which are closely located along with Pune’s main settlement, are not separate villages, but different areas of the same town. On the ground, the medieval settlement of Pune consisted of Kasarli, Kumbharli, an older settlement, and parts of Mali and Mujeri. It is pertinent to note here that during this period, the rural character of Pune’s original settlement has undergone significant change. The previous “Balutedars” of the rural Pune, were recognised as the artisans or Kasab-dars. The artisan settlement in Persian is commonly known as “Kasbah”. Here in Pune, communities practising various professions such potters, bangle makers, gardeners, and farmers, were settled within the town wall to form the Kasba - a medieval, semi-urban settlement. It also included the traders, Brahmins, and Maratha village officials. This resettlement formed an epicentre which served as the foundation for expansion of urban Pune later.The “Kasba Pune” is an excellent example to study the town planning of medieval India. Bharat Itihas Samshodhak Mandal’s register, “Pune Nagar Samshodhan Vruta 1-4”, and Dr Avisnash Sowani’s thesis on urban development, bring to us many important archival records to help us identify places in medieval Pune. In next column we shall study the quintessential “Kasba of Pune” and its movers and shakers in greater detail.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sutradharas-tales-a-gao-kus-organises-pune-to-form-a-medieval-kasba-101619600618333.html
28-04-2021||Lucknow||Prayagraj businessman adopts 3 govt hospitals, to set up oxygen plant||A Prayagraj businessman says he is setting up a modern oxygen generation plant to supply free gas to three city-based, state-run hospitals, which experienced shortage of the life-saving gas in the past couple of weeks as its demand rose dramatically due to a sharp rise in Covid-19 patients requiring oxygen support.A former student of Allahabad University, Umesh Jaiswal has promised lifelong supply of free oxygen to Tej Bahadur Sapru (Beli) Hospital, Dufferin Hospital and Colvin Hospital beginning August, when he expects the new oxygen plant to start operating.The plant is to come up in a plot measuring 7,400 square meters at sector 3 of Naini Industrial Area. The district administration and Uttar Pradesh State Industrial Development Corporation have helped him procure the land for the proposed plant, says Jaiswal.While Tej Bahadur Sapru (Beli) Hospital is a dedicated Covid treatment facility with 180 beds, the other two--Dufferin and Colvin, are non-Covid hospitals with a combined capacity of around 350 beds. Dufferin is a women-only hospital.All three hospitals put together, on an average require about 225 oxygen cylinders daily. The Beli hospital alone requires 200 of these cylinders. All three have been facing shortage of oxygen from time to time during the recent weeks, said authorities, who didn’t wish to be named. From August onwards, their oxygen needs will be taken care of by Jaiswal’s plant, with a planned capacity to refill 1100 cylinders a day, which can even go up to 1500 cylinders.Jaiswal says his decision was driven by the “recent deaths” in the district due to shortage of oxygen. “I have a separate business, never in my wildest dream had I thought of putting up an oxygen plant,” he says. He says he was inspired on the occasion of Ramnavmi after reading about a Varanasi businessman, who decided to install an oxygen plant to help Covid patients. “Then and there, I also decided to initiate something of this kind for Prayagraj,” says Jaiswal.Jaiswal’s primary business is road construction. He says he was advised by close friends to set up a large and modern plant if he really wanted to make a difference.“The next day, I spoke to senior superintendent of police (SSP), Prayagraj, Sarvashresth Tripathi, who helped me meet the divisional commissioner Sanjay Goyal, who forwarded my proposal the same day to the authorities concerned,” he said.After the district magistrate’s (DM) approval, all the required paperwork was completed swiftly. “I have given orders to a Gujarat-based company for installing an automatic oxygen synthesis plant, which can produce liquid oxygen and its gaseous form simultaneously,” he says.The district authorities are confident that the project will take off very soon. “All support is being extended to the businessman for setting up the plant on priority. We are confident that work on it will start anytime in the coming few days,” said Bhanu Chandra Goswami, DM Prayagraj.The plant is estimated to be built at a cost of ₹14 crore and the registry of the land it will be built on, will be done in a couple of days, Jaiswal says.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/prayagraj-businessman-adopts-3-govt-hospitals-to-set-up-oxygen-plant-101619600557808.html
28-04-2021||Patna||23-pairs of passenger trains suspended in Bihar due to poor occupancy||The Eastern Central Railway (ECR) announced suspension of 23 pairs of inter-Bihar passenger trains apart from a few bound to Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh. The suspension, effective Friday, was due to a drastic drop in occupancy amid the second wave of Covid-19, which is sweeping the state along with the rest of the country.“Movement of 23 pairs of special passenger trains for short distances will stand cancelled since April 29 till further date owing to poor occupancy and with a view to curb the spread of Covid,” said chief public relations officer (CPRO), ECR, Rajesh Kumar. He said no decision had been taken to suspend the movement of long-distances express trains, however, factors, such as the number of reservations, were being monitored and the long-distance special trains may be regulated in future if passenger traffic remains low.“Trains passing through Bihar are low on occupancy. Still, they are being run for the convenience of the people,” said a railway officer.Passenger train services from Patna to Gaya, Mugalsarai, Muzaffarpur, Barauni, Rajgir, Bhabua are among those suspended apart from some services from Muzaffapur to Narkatia, Raxaul and Samastipur.Oxygen Express not to deliver oxygen to BiharThe Central Eastern Railway (CER) chief public relations officer (CPRO) clarified that no Oxygen Express was presently scheduled to deliver the precious gas to Bihar. The railways have been running this facility to deliver liquefied oxygen to states such as Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, where hospitals are suffering a critical shortage of medical oxygen leading to deaths of Covid patients.Hospitals in Bihar are also grappling with the shortage of oxygen supply with the administration trying to revive defunct refilling plants and enhance capacity of existing oxygen generation plants with the refilling centres across the state.On April 20, state health minister Mangal Pandey had claimed the crisis will be over once the Oxygen Express became operational. He was not available to comment on the current situation in the state.Covid fund to help infected railway employeesThe ECR set up a Covid fund to help infected employees. Public relations officer (PRO) Rajesh Kumar said 3,884 employees had turned positive and 50 persons had succumbed to the disease in the last one year. As many as 1,891 employees of the zonal railways were still under treatment, he added. ECR is trying to set up Covid control helpline centres at all divisions of the zone, he said.Alarming rise in Covid infections continue12,604 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported in Bihar on Tuesday, increasing the virus caseload to 428,001, with capital Patna being worst-hit, a health department bulletin said. The state saw 85 fresh casualties, taking the death toll to 2,307.

28-04-2021||Mumbai||PG medical students to continue as resident doctors till new admissions||The National Medical Commission (NMC) issued a circular, asking medical students in post graduate colleges across the country to continue doubling up as resident doctors to help healthcare apparatus deal with the massive rise in Covid-19 cases seen during the ongoing second wave of the pandemic.Final year PG medical examinations have been stalled in most states due to the deterioration of Covid situation. Similarly, no fresh admissions to PG medical and diploma courses were done due to the postponement of National Eligibility-cum-Entrance Test (NEET-PG) exams. Students of most PG colleges were roped in last year to augment trained manpower for treatment of Covid and non-Covid patients. The fresh NMC directive seeks to ensure that the current batch continues to serve as resident doctors to help deal with the present crisis until fresh admissions are made to PG courses and final year examinations are held.NEET-PG exams are generally conducted in the month of February every year and the final year examinations are generally held between April-May in Maharashtra colleges.“The start of the 2021-2022 academic session will be delayed and the new batch of first year PG students will join only after NEET-PG examination is held, followed by counselling to allocate colleges,” the NMC circular released on April 27 said. It further states that the students continued deployment as residents will help ensure there is no shortage of hands to deal with the surge of Covid-19 cases.Originally scheduled to take place on April 19, the National Board of Examinations (NBE) postponed the entrance examination to PG medical courses earlier this month after a fresh Covid surge in several states. Similarly, all under graduate (UG) and PG medical examinations were postponed in several states, including in Maharashtra.With no new students joining medical institutes anytime soon, the NMC has also advised colleges to continue providing accommodation and stipend to the PG students during this extended period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/pg-medical-students-to-continue-as-resident-doctors-till-new-admissions-101619588977088.html

28-04-2021||Delhi||GNCT Act, which gives more powers to Delhi L-G, comes into force from April 27||Delhi’s Lieutenant Governor Anil Baijal is now the ‘government’ in the National Capital as the Centre notified the amended Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi (Amendment) Act, 2021 on Tuesday. A gazette notification issued on Tuesday says the act comes into force from April 27, which means that day-to-day decisions taken by the Arvind Kejriwal Cabinet in the Union Territory will have to have opinion of the L-G. The act, passed by the Parliament last month, gives overarching powers to the Delhi L-G in day-to-day functioning of the Union Territory; a move criticised by Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leaders and other Opposition parties saying this obstructs the functioning of an elected government. On the other hand, the Centre has claimed that the act promotes “harmonious relations between the legislature and the executive, and further defines the responsibilities of the elected government and the Lieutenant Governor, in line with the constitutional scheme of governance of Delhi, as interpreted by the Supreme Court.” According to the controversial act, the “government” in Delhi would mean L-G in the context of all legislations to be passed by the state assembly. This, according to the Centre, is in consistency with the status of Delhi as a Union Territory to address the ambiguities in the interpretation of the legislative provisions. The bill makes it mandatory for the Delhi government to take the opinion of the L-G before taking any executive action in the city. It also bars Delhi government from making any rule to enable itself or its committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions. Any rule made till this act comes into effect will be void, according to the bill. According to the act, the Delhi assembly won’t be able to make rules for regulating its procedure and the conduct of its business which are inconsistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Parliament of India. The Supreme Court had, on July 4, 2018, ruled that the L-G cannot interfere in every decision of the Delhi government and that he must act on aid and advice of the council of ministers. The Centre has however said the new act seeks to clarify the expression of government in order to give effect to the interpretation made by the Supreme Court. “The Government of National Capital Territory of Delhi Act, 1991 (1of 1992) was enacted to supplement the provisions of the Constitution relating to the Legislative Assembly and a Council of Ministers for the National Capital Territory of Delhi and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto. Section 44 of the Act deals with conduct of business and there is no structural mechanism provided in the act for effective time bound implementation of said section. Further, there is no clarity as to what proposal or matters are required to be submitted to Lieutenant Governor before issuing order thereon,” the statement of objects and reasons stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/gnct-act-which-gives-more-powers-to-delhi-l-g-comes-into-force-from-april-27-101619584356811.html

The chief minister Arvind Kejriwal Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) government is also not allowed to make any rule to enable itself or its Committees to consider the matters of day-to-day administration of the Capital or conduct inquiries in relation to the administrative decisions.The Act states that the Delhi assembly won’t be able to make rules for regulating, its procedure and the conduct of its business that are inconsistent with the Rules of Procedure and Conduct of Business in the Parliament of India.While there are no comments so far on the act from Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia, and senior AAP leaders , they had earlier termed it “unconstitutional” and “anti-democracy”.

Families of Covid-19 patients alleged that hospitals asked them to shift their relatives to other facilities as they did not have sufficient oxygen supply left.Even as officials of the district administration refuted allegations that the incident affected oxygen supply, hospital managements and residents said they were left in the lurch. No injuries were reported in the incident.Bharti Joshi, a resident of Sector 4, said that she received a call from Shri Guru Gobind Singh Tricentenary Hospital located in Village Budhera around 5.30pm. “They asked me to take my husband as there was no oxygen supply due to an oxygen cylinder blast in Manesar. I told them that my husband will die if we remove him from oxygen support, they said he will die if they leave him here. No bed is available anywhere and my husband’s situation is critical,” she said.Officials at the SGT Hospital confirmed the incident and said they would run out of oxygen by 10.30pm. “We have asked the families to take their patients as we will not be able to provide oxygen support. We have run out of oxygen supply. We are trying to get the cylinders refilled from different plants as directed by the district administration,” said a senior doctor, requesting anonymity.Dr Bijender Sindhu, the nodal officer of SGT Hospital, said that there were nearly 60 Covid-19 patients, all of whom were on oxygen support.“We are getting 18-20 cylinders a day but we need at least 90. The district administration is helping us but the supply is limited due to which we are facing an acute shortage for the last 10 days,” he said.People at the spot said the situation became tense after they were informed that oxygen might not be supplied on Tuesday night and the area was cordoned off, said a senior police officer privy to the matter. The plant, which refills cylinders for a majority of private hospitals, shut operations for two hours.Yash Garg, the deputy commissioner, said that it was a small incident. “This incident has not impacted the oxygen supply of the city and if any hospital is asking families to shift patients, we will check the issue,” he said.Hitesh Yadav, the assistant commissioner of police (Manesar), said, “No injuries were reported and the supply was resumed soon after.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/cylinder-blast-at-refill-facility-in-manesar-causes-panic-101619579310061.html

For instance, HT reported earlier that a dealer in north Delhi offered to sell a customer a vial of remdesivir for ₹25,000, as against an MRP of about ₹3,000.Police said they have also started monitoring the activities of staff at hospitals and pharmacies to see how oxygen and medicines were reaching black marketeers.On Monday, a woman nurse of a private hospital was arrested for allegedly selling remdesivir injections, and the technical director of the intensive care unit (ICU) of another private hospital was arrested for rerouting oxygen cylinders to the black market, a senior police officer said. “The nurse was selling one remdesivir vial for ₹38,000 to her conduit, Sudhir, who further sold it to any person in need for ₹60,000. Both were arrested on Monday,” said DCP (Rohini) Pranav Tayal.Over the past week, Delhi Police have arrested 18 people and recovered 104 remdesivir vials, over 100 oxygen cylinders and oxymeters, and other crucial kits, in eight searches.The latest search was carried out on Monday, when three men, including the 41-year-old technician director of a private hospital in south Delhi’s Aya Nagar, were arrested for allegedly hoarding and black marketing oxygen and nitrogen cylinders and oxygen flowmeters, police said. “They were selling a standard oxygen cylinder for ₹50,000 and the smaller one for ₹30,000,” said DCP (south) Atul Kumar Thakur.“The arrested persons used to purchase old cylinders from scrap dealers through auctions. We are trying to ascertain from where they had managed to refill the cylinders,” DCP Thakur said.They were identified as Ansar Ahmed,41, and his associates Sumit Saini,33, and Mohit Kumar, 23. The arrests came after information was received through police informers.Social media has been flooded with SOS messages from patients or their families, seeking medicines and oxygen. The officer cited above said racketeers were cashing in on their desperation. In many cases, the fraudsters took money but never delivered the items, he added.“Our personnel are keeping a vigil on chemist shops, scrap dealers, hospital staff, dealers and distributors of medical equipment, and oxygen refilling stations. Social media monitoring is also being done,” said Delhi Police spokesperson Chinmoy Biswal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/decoys-informers-help-police-nab-black-marketeers-101619559723252.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi's crematoriums run out of wood, seek forest dept’s help||Delhi’s municipality-run crematoriums are running out of wood required for pyres on account of the rising number of Covid-19 deaths -- 2,648 since April 20 according to the HT dashboard -- and sought help from the state forest department, as per municipal officials.The municipal agencies in the city (north, south and east MCDs) have approached the state forest department to help arrange for wood. Separately, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC) has asked issued an order directing officials to use dried cow dung as fuel.Senior civic officials said that their crematoriums have been leased out to NGOs who arrange wood through government suppliers. Before the second wave hit the city, the largest crematorium of Delhi, the Nigambodh Ghat, required 6,000-8,000 kg of wood daily, but this has now risen to 80,000-90,000 kg daily.North MCD mayor, Jai Prakash, said the stock of wood in crematoriums is depleting fast. The corporation has had to create additional makeshift cremation facilities in parking lots and parks, and the requirement for wood has significantly gone up. “We require the cooperation of the Delhi government to meet the daily wood demand,” he said.All three municipal corporations are controlled by the BJP.The city’s forest department said it has received requests from municipal agencies for wood. Deputy conservator forests (north division) Aditya Madanpotra said on Tuesday that they have granted permission to the National Capital Region Transport Corporation (NCRTC), which is constructing the regional rapid transit system (RRTS) in Delhi, to cut the branches and tops of at least 500 trees in advance to meet the demand of crematoriums.The south division of the forest department has also granted permission to cut 200 dead and dried trees in different locations on request from SDMC.Shiv Kumar, one of the caretakers of the Paschim Vihar cremation ground, explained that each pyre needs 500-600kg of wood. “Because of the shortage, we have brought it down to 450 kg... Every day we are getting over 200-300 bodies, so you can calculate how much wood we need daily,” he said.EDMC on April 25 issued a notice allowing the use of dried cow dung at crematoriums. “We are asking NGOs, citizen groups and cow shelters to donate cow dung cakes for this purpose,” said Nirmal Jain, mayor, EDMC.SDMC has also written to the Delhi government to ensure that the supply of wood from neighbouring states to reach the city without interruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhis-crematoriums-run-out-of-wood-seek-forest-dept-s-help-101619559472773.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||Low turnout at Delhi's 24x7 vaccination centres||The turnout at the Delhi government-run 24x7 vaccination centres has dropped significantly due to the lockdown, several district officials said.They also pointed out that several health care workers tested positive for Covid-19 in the infection’s fourth wave in the city, leading to a staff crunch, and there was a need to rework the round-the-clock vaccination plan for the effective utilisation of personnel.“We have eight sites where we provide 24x7 vaccination. We used to get about 70-100 people at all the sites between 9pm and 9am in a day before the lockdown. But now, the numbers have dropped to somewhere around 35-50,” a senior official from the northwest district said.Each vaccination site has a team of five people, including one vaccinator. The Delhi government on April 5 ordered that one-third of all vaccination centres in government-run hospitals function will round-the-clock.The north municipal corporation, which runs one 24x7 centre, said just 10-15 people come to take the vaccine after evening. The mayor of the north corporation, Jai Prakash said, “Most people come during the day for vaccination. We are getting 10-15 people at our centre between 9pm and 9am The Delhi government needs to rethink the 24x7 vaccination centres to ensure effective utilisation of health care workers. Now, we are facing a staff crunch as many workers have contracted the infection. Maybe the timing can be revised till 10pm or 11pm, since not many people come late night, or something should be done to encourage people to come at night.”A district magistrate who asked not to be named said that government hospitals treating Covid-19 patients were also facing a staff crunch.“Hospitals treating Covid patients have raised the issue of running these 24x7 centres these days. We will take up the matter with senior officials. So far, there is no problem in running the 24x7 facility in the non-Covid hospital,” said the district magistrate.A Delhi government spokesperson did not comment when asked if there were plans to reassign staff at round-the-clock vaccination centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/low-turnout-at-24x7-vaccination-centres-101619559249868.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||Record 381 deaths in Delhi, positivity rate still over 30%||For the eighth day in a row, the Capital’s Covid-19 positivity rate remained over 30% -- on Tuesday, the city recorded 24,149 infections over 73,800 tests, a positivity rate of 32.7%.On Tuesday, with 381 new deaths, Delhi also reported its highest ever single day death toll. This was the sixth consecutive day when the city recorded more than 300 deaths. The total number of deaths was 15,009 on Tuesday.Positivity rate -- the proportion of samples that return positive for Covid-19 -- is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when coupled with increasing new cases, it indicates that the virus is spreading fast within the community. The city had never before seen this high a positivity rate for so long.The city had earlier recorded a positivity rate of more than 30% only a few times – three separate days in April-May of last year when the number of tests wasn’t consistent, four straight days in June when the city recorded its first wave and one day in July.A total of 24149 new deaths were reported in the city on Tuesday, taking the total number of confirmed Covid-19 infections in the city to 1,072,065, according to the daily health bulletin released by the Delhi government.Experts said that the worst is yet to come for the city, as cases and deaths are expected to continue rising in the near future particularly because the positivity rate is so high in the Capital right now.“All the statistical models indicate that with the current trajectory, the number of cases will likely peak in mid-May. And deaths will peak two weeks after that. Last year, the curve of the infection was bell-shaped. This year, however, it is almost vertical. What this means is that the decline will also be slower,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head of the department of epidemiology at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR).He also called for a push towards genome sequencing, so that variants of Sars-CoV-2 can be tracked in the city.“Now, there is a clustering of cases; entire families getting infected in one go. This is the time there should be cluster sampling done for genome sequencing. And, it is important to get the results of the samples collected in April in the same month so that action can be taken based on the information.”The number of hospitalisations have also remained at around 18,800 for three days now, with many hospitals running out of beds to treat Covid-19 patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/record-381-deaths-in-delhi-positivity-rate-still-over-30-101619558940784.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||Never asked for a five-star Covid facility: Delhi High Court||The Delhi high court said on Tuesday it did not make any request for creating Covid-19 facilities for its judges, staff and their families in a five-star hotel and that an order saying so was “very misleading”.“Do you think we as an institution can ask something like this when people are dying due to the lack of oxygen and they are not getting rooms in the hospitals? Will this not be patently discriminatory that people are not able to get beds and we say reserve 100 rooms in a 5-star for us?”The Delhi government on April 25 issued an order directing The Ashoka hotel to convert 100 rooms into a Covid-19 care centre, where priority was to be given to Delhi high court judges and other judicial officers and their families. The order said that Primus Hospital would manage the Covid care centre at the five-star hotel in Chanakyapuri, adding that it was done on the request from the Delhi high court. The order was withdrawn on Tuesday night.“The projection is that we have made this request to benefit ourselves or that you have done this to appease us,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said. The court took suo motu cognisance of the matter and issued notice to the Delhi government seeking to know its stand.Terming the government’s move as “unthinkable”, the bench said: “This is very, very misleading. High court has not made any request. There is no communication in this regard… We have not made any such request. We have not said anything of this kind. Two of our judicial officers have died. Our concern as their well wishers, therefore, was that we wanted in case they need hospitalization, then they should not face any problem and that has been translated into this order,” Justice Sanghi said.The court said that the government cannot create such facilities for a certain class of people and asked the Delhi government to take “corrective measures” to withdraw the order.When senior advocate Rahul Mehra, for the Delhi government, tried to apprise the court that media was making a wrong projection and that it was their “mischief”, the bench remarked that the press had not done anything wrong in reporting it.“Media is not wrong in pointing this out,” it observed.The bench noted in its order that an enquiry was made with the registrar general of the Delhi high court about any request, “who in turn denied in negative”.A Delhi government spokesperson said deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday asked for the file to investigate how such an order was passed in the first place. “Not even the deputy chief minister, who is the nodal minister for Covid management in Delhi or the Delhi health minister were aware of the order. No copy of the order has been sent to them either. That is why the deputy CM has asked for the file,” the spokesperson said.According to the April 25 order issued by the sub-divisional magistrate, Chanakyapuri, Geeta Grover on April 25, Primus Hospital in Chanakyapuri was directed to run a Covid Health Care facility, provide ambulance for transfer facility and also be responsible for disposal of the biomedical waste.The matter will now be heard by the chief justice of the Delhi high court as a public interest litigation (PIL).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/never-asked-for-a-five-star-covid-facility-delhi-high-court-101619558782960.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||Emergency services hit amid clash after patient dies in private hospital||The family members of a patient who died of Covid-19 and security staff at the emergency department of the Indraprastha Apollo hospital clashed on Tuesday morning, leading to injuries to several people, officials said.A 60-year-old woman was brought to the hospital emergency ward last night. She required an intensive care unit (ICU) bed. However, there were no ICU beds available, a hospital official said.“She was given oxygen and first aid in the emergency department. The doctors had requested the family to take her to another hospital as there were no ICU beds available at Apollo and the patient was crashing,” the official said. The woman died at around 8am, after which her family and some alleged local residents vandalised the emergency department. In the clip, the security staff could also be seen hitting people with sticks.In a statement on Tuesday, the hospital said, “Unfortunately, the patient died at around 8 am, post which the patient’s family members resorted to vandalism, destruction of hospital property and assault on our doctors and staff. The situation was brought under control through hospital security staff and use of the police. While the hospital deeply condoles the death of the patient, it is deeply shocked at the behaviour of the patient’s family against doctors and healthcare workers who are providing untiring services amidst the pandemic.”The hospital had to suspend emergency services for around two hours after the incident, officials said.According to the police, the only people injured in the incident were the two sons of the dead woman. RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east), said that no complaint to the police was made by either side until Tuesday evening. “No one from the hospital is injured,” Meena said.The DCP said the family of the woman brought her to Apollo Hospital around 2am on Tuesday after she tested positive for Covid-19. “They brought their own oxygen. Since there was no bed available at the hospital, they waited until morning, but the woman died,” the DCP said.Her death led to a heated exchange between her relatives and the hospital guards. “The patient’s relatives and the hospital guards then clashed and two sons of the deceased suffered injuries. No one from the hospital was injured,” said the DCP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/emergency-services-hit-amid-clash-after-patient-dies-in-private-hospital-101619558462876.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||‘You’re not taking action’: Court pulls up Delhi govt||The Delhi high court on Tuesday said its confidence in the Delhi government was “shaken”, and that it may ask the Centre to intervene if they are unable to efficiently manage supplies of oxygen and other essential resources amid the second Covid-19 wave. It also said that the families of those who died in the city hospitals due to shortage of oxygen must be compensated, and directed the government to submit a complete list of the victims.“Set your (Delhi government) house in order... enough is enough. If you (Delhi government) cannot manage then tell us, we will ask the Centre to send its officers. We will ask them to take over,” a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli told senior advocate Rahul Mehra, who represented the Delhi government.The bench was incensed by the Delhi government’s inability to curb black-marketing and hoarding of oxygen cylinders and medicines in the city after complaints from various hospitals that they were not getting oxygen from refillers and that the government was not helping them.They contended that the Delhi government was supplying oxygen to refillers without any direction or accountability.On its part, the Delhi government expressed helplessness, saying the refillers were not giving them details of their supplies to the hospitals and nursing homes.Anguished at this, the bench told the government: “There is an artificial shortage of oxygen. Your management of the oxygen cylinder distribution is nothing but a ‘lollipop’. This cylinder business is a mess. You have to look into it and put your house in order. Your system has failed. Black-marketing of oxygen still continues. How are people procuring oxygen? Large-scale hoarding is going, and you are not taking action,” the court told the Delhi government.It also directed the Delhi government to take over the plant of a city-based oxygen refiller, Seth Air Product, which apparently withheld 20 metric tonne of oxygen without supplying it to several hospitals, including Maharaja Agrasen and Venkateshwara.Seth Air’s representative Tarun Seth sought to defend the firm, saying the Delhi government had not given any direction on the supply of cylinders.But the bench retorted: “We will take you in custody... People are dying and you are making profit even at such time. This is not the time to become vultures. If any person dies for shortage of oxygen, we will hang you.”Issuing contempt notices to five refillers for not appearing before the court on Wednesday, the bench remarked: “If they are belligerent, then they will see our belligerence. We will keep them in custody if they are playing with people’s life like this...”“We will not countenance such actions. We make it clear that if any of the refillers do not provide the requisite data then strict action would not be taken not only by Delhi government but also this court,” the bench said.During the proceedings, the court was also informed by S Bankata, a doctor at Batra Super Speciality Hospital, that they lost 21 patients between Saturday and Sunday due to shortage of oxygen. Last week, Jaipur Golden Hospital said that it lost over 20 lives due to shortage of oxygen.At this, the court ordered: “We direct the Delhi government to file a report after taking enquiries into deaths from the hospitals and nursing homes which have taken place due to the shortage of oxygen. The report should have the name of the patient, the ward/room, time of death in a tabular form.”“We have to compensate these persons. It is the responsibility of the State,” said the bench, asking for all details in four days.The court was hearing a plea by lawyer-petitioner Rakesh Malhotra, who, along with several hospitals, sought directions to the Centre and the Delhi government for better facilities and the continuous supply of oxygen in hospitals and nursing in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/youre-not-taking-action-court-pulls-up-delhi-govt-101619558181460.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||Oxygen supply in Capital to be pushed up, says Kejriwal||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Tuesday said that his government will import 18 cryogenic tankers from Thailand and 21 ready-to-use oxygen plants from France, and added that they were setting up 1,200 more intensive care unit (ICU) to provide relief to a health care system that has been stretched beyond its capacity amid a raging fourth wave of Covid-19 infections.The health infrastructure in Delhi, which is in the middle of a “last resort” lockdown to arrest the alarming spread of the infectious disease, remains overwhelmed by record highs in infections and deaths, with complaints of shortage of medical oxygen and ICU beds pouring in from across the city.In a digital news briefing on Tuesday, the chief minister said that within a month, 44 oxygen plants will be set up at various hospitals in Delhi, including 21 that will be imported from France. Of these, the Centre will install eight oxygen plants by April 30, he said.Kejriwal said the situation has improved significantly in the past two days after the chaos witnessed last week due to an oxygen shortage. “We do not have as many SOS calls from hospitals now as we got on three days last week – Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I want to thank the central government for helping us through this time by providing their top officials who worked in close coordination with the senior officers of the Delhi government. I thank our Delhi government officials too who have worked day and night to address the crisis,” he said.Delhi reported 24,149 fresh cases on Tuesday even as 381 people died of the infection in the city. The positivity rate continued to stay above the 30% mark at 32.72%Due to a shortage of tankers, the Delhi government was facing problems in transporting its oxygen quota decided by the Centre, he added. “Hospitals were jam-packed, and I was scared that a major untoward incident may lead to deaths due to lack of oxygen.”Kejriwal said they were arranging 500 ICU beds at the Ramlila Ground in front of the Guru Teg Bahadur Hospital. “Another 500 ICU beds are being readied at the main Ramlila Ground in front of Lok Nayak Hospital. At the Radha Saomi Satsang facility, we are arranging 200 ICU beds.” Kejriwal said that by May 10, the Delhi government will add 1,200 ICU beds to the Covid-19 infrastructure.He said the current Covid-19 wave is dangerous because it is more infectious and is making patients severely ill. “That is why the demand for ICU beds has increased manifold.” He said every hospital is treating patients more than its capacity. “All ICU beds are full. The central government gave us 500 ICU beds at the DRDO [Defence Research and Development Organisation] facility in Delhi Cantt, but all beds got filled in just three hours.”“The Delhi government has decided to import 18 cryogenic tankers from Bangkok [Thailand], which will start arriving from tomorrow [Wednesday],” he said. Kejriwal said they have sought the Centre’s help to have the Indian Air Force airlift these tankers. “Once these 18 tankers reach the city, the problem of transporting liquid oxygen will be solved, and Delhi will get its full quota of oxygen from the Centre…”“We are importing 21 PSA oxygen plants from France. These are ready-to-use plants and will be installed in different hospitals. In the next month, we will be installing 44 oxygen plants in Delhi. Of these, eight are being installed by the Centre. For some reason, the project was delayed, but now by April 30, these eight plants will be ready. The remaining 36 oxygen plants will be set up by the Delhi government of which 21 are being imported from France and 15 are indigenous.”A government spokesperson said while IAF is airlifting these tankers, the Union ministry of home affairs (MHA) is coordinating the transportation till Delhi.The Centre provides up to 490 MT of oxygen to Delhi daily, but the Capital has faced a deficit of about 100MT due to transportation issues, according to people aware of the developments.The Delhi high court on Tuesday said its confidence in the Delhi government has shaken and it may ask the Centre to step in to manage the escalating situation.Kejriwal said many chief ministers and industrialists came forward to help the Delhi government after he wrote to them seeking support. “Talks have advanced with some of them, but they have requested not to be named. So, I thank all the chief ministers, industrialists, NGOs, and religious organisations who have come out to help us in this crisis. Whatever decisions I announced is because of their help in some way or the other.”Posting a message on Twitter later, Kejriwal thanked Jharkhand chief minister Hemant Soren after he announced that 58MT oxygen was being sent to Delhi from a plant in his state.Dr PK Bharadwaj, secretary of Delhi Voluntary Hospitals Forum, said, “Whatever the government is doing now – like getting the tankers and oxygen plants – is a good step but should have been done before. We must ensure that all hospitals install at least small oxygen plants that can act as buffer before they are given registration, just like we ask for fire clearance.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/oxygen-supply-in-capital-to-be-pushed-up-says-kejriwal-101619557959914.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt to add 1,000 ICU beds at Ramlila grounds||With Delhi running out of intensive care unit (ICU) beds by Tuesday, and with no let-up in the number of fresh cases of Covid-19 being reported from the city, ICU facilities are being created at central Delhi’s Ramlila Maidan and another vacant Ramlila ground in east Delhi, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Tuesday. The facility in central Delhi will be linked to the Lok Nayak hospital while the one in east Delhi will be attached to Guru Teg Bahadur hospital, Kejriwal said.The two facilities will be in addition to the 200 ICU beds that are being readied at the Sardar Patel Covid Care Centre in south Delhi’s Chhatarpur. All 1,200 ICU beds will be ready by May 10, the chief minister said.“We are arranging 500 ICU beds at the Ramlila ground in front of GTB hospital. Another 500 ICU beds are being readied at the main Ramlila Maidan in front of Lok Nayak hospital. At the Radha Saomi Satsang facility, we are arranging 200 ICU beds. By May 10, we will add 1,200 ICU beds to our Covid-19 infrastructure which is now completely overstretched,” Kejriwal said. He further said this wave of Covid-19 is more “dangerous” because it is more infectious and is making people severely ill.“Despite trying our best, every hospital in Delhi is currently overburdened. Each hospital is treating patients beyond its capacity. All ICU beds are full. The Central government gave us 500 ICU beds at the DRDO facility in Delhi Cantonment, but all beds there got filled in just three hours. That means Delhi has so many serious patients roaming around the city in search of ICU beds and treatment,” he said.Spokespersons of Lok Nayak and GTB hospitals were unavailable for comment.With Delhi continuing to report well over 20,000 fresh cases of Covid-19 every day since the past 10 days (from April 17), the city has run out of dedicated ICU beds for Covid-19 patients.North MCD mayor Jai Prakash, under whose jurisdiction the Ramlila Maidan in central Delhi falls, said, “We have granted permission to the Delhi government to convert the Ramlila Maidan into an ICU facility of 500 beds... We also assured the government of our cooperation and help to control this pandemic.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-to-add-1-000-icu-beds-at-ramlila-grounds-101619557484822.html
28-04-2021||Lucknow||Lucknowites rising to food cause amid Covid chaos||The surge in Covid19 cases and suffering of people has brought a human side to all. Many good samaritans have emerged to the occasion and are offering services in their own personal capacity. Some Lucknowites have identified home-cooked food needs of those in quarantine and helping them in all possible way. Geetika Kapoor, an educationist, got inspired by a boy in Sector-63, Noida who started free-of-cost food to quarantined senior citizen in his locality. “When my brother was in quarantine in Vikas Nagar we took services of tiffin provider. So, I thought over it and initiated this service in Gomti Nagar for senior citizens. I posted on social media and from Monday started with 11 people. I prepare lunch for them and another portion for dinner and get it delivered by my driver,” she said. People from different places are calling her to help with funds which she politely refused. “The happiness that I am getting in serving people is beyond explanation. My friend Neeti Juneja got motivated and she too has started with eight people in Surya Nagar, Agra. I hope more people join in this tough time which I pray get over soon.” Last week, four friends Talha Alvi, Ali Rizvi, Shirish Sharma and Amit Kumar decided to start free quarantine food service. “We friends pooled in some funds and started food service at Ali’s home from Saturday. As orders started pouring in, we hired a cook and we are now given 75 deliveries for some 30 families in Gomti Nagar and Indira Nagar,” said Amit, a businessman. Since they were delivering themselves, it became challenging. “So, Akashi Abraham is helping us with their Project Khel volunteers. We are exploring delivery by food aggregators for far-off places. We are even managing a delivery at Sushant Golf City as people are really in need,” he added. Similarly, Mashi Biryani World is providing free quarantine food to people in isolation in Chowk locality. “This is our third day. Our target area is Old City, and we now are providing services to patients admitted in as well. Ranging from 40 and 60 packets we are offering. On Labour Day (May 1) too we will be providing free meal too all food aggregator delivery boys,” said its owner Rizve Mashi. Besides these samaritans, many restaurants are also quarantine food for a small price. Sassy Canteen in Gomti Nagar, The Bun-tie Project on Faziabad Road and many others are offering homestyle cooked food for the quarantined lot which can offer them nutritious food.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/lucknowites-rising-to-food-cause-amid-covid-chaos-101619557473198.html
28-04-2021||Delhi||With ICU beds running out in city, struggle to get care for critically ill||Some patients being wheeled in to hospitals by the time it’s too late, others being given oxygen on stretchers and chairs in the triage area, and some others lying in ambulances, autos and vans parked outside hospitals seeking medical treatment — these scenes have been recurring in the national capital for over the past week as hospitals run out of ICU beds and shut down emergency departments for want of oxygen ports and cylinders.On average, the city has reported over 24,000 cases daily over the past seven days. Though only a small percentage of them need hospitalisation and nearly 20,000 people have also been recovering from the disease, Delhi’s overall bed capacity of 20,751 -- and particularly its ICU capacity of 4,742 -- is not being able to keep up with the inflow of fresh patients.Only 13 beds were vacant, according to the Delhi government’s portal on Tuesday night. Of these, 11 were at a hospital meant for pregnant women who have contracted Covid, and the other two -- one at the AIIMS Trauma Centre and the other at Medeor Hospital in Qutab Institutional Area, were also unavailable because of a queue of patients slotted for the beds.This has led to hospitals being forced to turn away the critically ill patients, either for want of oxygen or beds, and more patients and their relatives have been desperately running from one health facility to another.“We had to close the casualty Tuesday; there is no space to even sit there. We have been taking in patients who need ICU care and giving them oxygen in the casualty; there are eight such patients in the hospital right now. There are no ICU beds; we have accommodated as many patients as we can. Now there are no oxygen ports to attach ventilators to,” said Dr Sumit Ray, medical superintendent, Holy Family hospital in Okhla.The situation is getting worse, according to another doctor from the hospital. “Wards are jam-packed; people are being ventilated using anaesthesia machines that are normally used in surgeries. There are patients on stretchers, wheelchairs, even on the floor. And everybody is on oxygen except those who are to be discharged. At least 10 to 15 patients are being brought dead every day. We are subconsciously triaging patients, and taking in the relatively healthier ones who have a chance of survival,” the doctor said, asking not to be named.Dr PK Bharadwaj, chief executive director of Saroj hospital in Rohini, agreed that daily about 10 patients are wheeled by the time it’s too late to save them.“If I decide to add 100 beds in the hospital today, they will get filled just by those who have called me today,” he said.For the patients they cannot admit, the hospital take them into its emergency departments, gives them medicines and oxygen to bring up the saturation to 90%, before allowing them to leave to continue their hunt for a hospital bed.A resident doctor from Lok Nayak hospital, who has been working in the ICU, said: “We are getting young patients without comorbidities. But they are struggling too. The other day, when a patient was wheeled into the ICU, her oxygen saturation was 10%. I’ve never seen oxygen saturation that low in a patient without any other disease.”A doctor from Safdarjung hospital said on condition of anonymity: “Every time we discharge a patient, the bed is filled up immediately. Patients are desperate to get an ICU bed, but ICU beds cannot be created just anywhere -- they need proper infrastructure to provide high flow oxygen of up to 60 to 70 litres a minute.”Dr CM Bhagat, director of Bhagat Chandra hospital near Dwarka, said, “Every day, one or two patients are brought dead because they have been running around the city in search of a bed. Every day, I get requests from at least 200 people.”At the smaller 50-bed Panchsheel hospital, which does not have ventilator or high-flow oxygen beds, several patients chose to stay on whatever oxygen was available rather than risking going out and not getting a bed.“They told me, let the patients stay there, they will die if taken back home,” said Dr VK Goyal, medical director of the hospital.Demand for helplineThe hospitals have suggested creating a central helpline for allocating beds to patients so that they do not have to go from one hospital to the other.“There should also be an ambulance stationed at all big hospitals to transport patients to other facilities. I have several patients in the casualty who just need a little oxygen support; they at least can be managed at smaller hospitals,” said Dr Ray.He also suggested that the government take control of a few big centres completely and keep them only for patients being referred by other hospitals.Dr Bharadwaj said, “We also need to educate people on how to take care of the sick at home.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/with-icu-beds-running-out-in-city-struggle-to-get-care-for-critically-ill-101619557141737.html

We are still ascertaining whether she was legally separated from Sheikh or not,” the DCP said.But when Saina was in jail, the DCP said, Waseem entered into an extramarital relationship with her sister. “When Saina was released from jail on bail, Waseem did not meet her. That led to frequent quarrels between them,” the DCP said.Also Read | ‘Your system has failed’: HC asks Delhi govt to take action on oxygen hoardingThe quarrels culminated in a final showdown outside Saina’s house on Tuesday morning. CCTV footage showed Waseem purportedly pulling out a gun and trying to shoot Saina. It was at that moment that Saina’s domestic help, Shahdat, tried to step in but got shot.Thereafter, Waseem can purportedly be seen taking several aims at his wife’s head and other body parts, reloading his gun and then shooting at the collapsed woman repeatedly.In between, he brandished his gun, threatening local residents to stay away during most of the drama.The DCP said that since the suspect was known, his parents were contacted and he was nabbed soon.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/man-kills-drug-dealer-pregnant-wife-in-delhi-video-of-killing-surfaces-101619556652532.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Bambiha gang shooter held in Moga for killing Lawrence Bishnoi aide||The Moga police on Tuesday arrested a Bambiha gang shooter who allegedly gunned down gangster Lawrence Bishnoi’s aide Gurlal Brar outside a night club in Chandigarh in October last year. Brar was state president of the Students Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU). The arrested accused was identified as Beant Singh, a resident of Maadimustafa village in Baghapurana sub-division of Moga district. He is also wanted in other criminal cases, including that of ransom and dacoity, registered at various police stations across Punjab, said Moga senior superintendent of police (SSP) Harmanbir Singh Gill. Beant was arrested along with his accomplice Sunil Kumar, alias Baba of Moga, who is also facing 12 criminal cases. Five pistols, ammunition and drug powder were recovered from their possession. The SSP said in retaliation to Gurlal Brar’s murder, the Bishnoi group had killed Ranjeet Rana near Muktsar and Youth Congress district chief Gurlal Pehalwan in Faridkot. During preliminary interrogation Beant revealed that he along with his two accomplices killed Gurlal Brar to avenge the murder of Lavi Deora (a member of Bambiha group), who was killed by the Bishnoi gang at a fair in Kotkapura in 2017, the SSP said. “Beant has also revealed that the sarpanch of his native village, with whom he had an old rivalry, was his next target,” SSP Gill claimed.A case under section 25 of the Arms Act and section 22 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act was registered against the two accused.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/bambiha-gang-shooter-held-in-moga-for-killing-lawrence-bishnoi-aide-101619556272509.html

They also guided patients in home isolation on how to improve oxygen levels by ‘proning’ (lying on your belly). This, they said, will reduce the load on hospitals.In a Facebook Live session by Sanjivani Group, on the official page of the district public relations officer (DPRO), cardiologist Dr Bishav Mohan, who was the moderator, posed questions on behalf of residents to expert Dr Rajesh Mahajan. RTA secretary Sandeep Singh Garha was also on the expert panel to respond to queries pertaining to the arrangements put in place by the Ludhiana administration.Dr Rajesh Mahajan said Covid patients with mild symptoms do not need a CT-scan after they have undergone an RT-PCR (reverse transcription- polymerase chain reaction) test. He added that they could take multivitamin, vitamin C and simple crocin tablets during their quarantine period with strict monitoring of oxygen level, which should not fall below 95.He said people must continue to wear masks, practice social distancing and hand hygiene to break the transmission chain.Answering to a query of a Covid patient, Dr Mahajan asked him to wear a face-mask even at home to curtail spreading it to anyone who has recovered from the disease, and wait for four weeks before getting the Covid jab.Dr Mahajan also spoke about proning to improve oxygen levels. He added that lying face down was known as proning which was a medically accepted position to improve comfort and oxygenation. He said that if the oxygen level drops below 94, a patient in home isolation must lie on their belly as the position improves ventilation.Expert also said that home isolation patients must practice proning by learning the correct way from their doctors.Meanwhile, RTA secretary Sandeep Garha said the administration was adopting an effective mechanism for patients in home-isolation. He added that the department’s staff members call them every day to enquire about their health status, including oxygen levels, fever, cough or other symptoms so that in case anyone develops serious issues, they can be shifted to nearby health centres.Helpline numbersResidents can reach out to the administration on helpline numbers: (6284912553) for beds, (7837018500 and 0161-2421091) for oxygen, (9814718704) and (6284531852) for any kind of psychological help for Covid patients and state health helpline 104.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patients-with-mild-symptoms-don-t-need-ct-scan-say-experts-101619556152592.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||In second wave, virus is spreading fast within families: Kashmir experts||In the second wave, coronavirus is spreading fast within families as compared to the previous year, health experts in Kashmir say. More and more families, with all or most of the members, are getting infected as people living in close spaces, particularly in Srinagar, are more prone to contracting Covid.“The virus during this wave is more communicable. That is the reason that the number of cases is rising immediately and virus is spreading fast within families. This year, a Covid patient’s chances of infecting others are more than last year,” said Dr Rouf Hussain Rather, community medicine specialist and in-charge of data analysis at divisional Covid control room.“Family means a unit. It rarely happens if anybody gets infected that his family won’t be affected. Such cases are more this year,” he said. Rather attributed the exponential increase in cases in the second wave to two key factors — virus being more communicable and absence of lockdown.President of Doctors Association Kashmir and an influenza expert, Dr Nisar ul Hassan, said that new studies have proven that Covid spreads more in indoor settings as it is airborne. He said that there are more contributing factors specific to Kashmir. “Climate is one of the reasons. Even in summers due to chilly weather, our doors and windows remain closed. You are vulnerable because of the climate and because of congested places. There are less nuclear families here and most people still live in joint families in Old City. After hospitals, these houses can be super-spreading places,” he said.With all or most of the members getting infected, families are approaching many social organisations and NGOs for help. Members of Athrout Kashmir, an organisation engaged in philanthropic work in the Valley, said they have been witnessing multiple cases where entire families have been infected with Covid. “The last two days have been very emotional at Athrout. We are receiving several such cases. Yesterday, a Covid patient walked into our office for an oxygen concentrator for his mother. He said his entire family has tested positive and he has nobody else to arrange oxygen support for his mother,” the organisation mentioned on its Twitter handle.In another post on Saturday, it said: “A man walked into our office today requesting for (an) oxygen concentrator for his mother. Seven of his family members were tested positive and he was the only one who had escaped the virus. He said, ‘Life is no less than a nightmare when seven of your family members need oxygen supply’.”The organisation said that it has issued 30 oxygen concentrators and BIPAP machines in the last 48 hours. “Every machine provided carries a sorrowful tale of plight and helplessness. We request all such unfortunate families to please call on our numbers and we will ensure help reaches you,” Athrout said.Another organisation, SRO (Social Reforms Organisation)-Kashmir has now asked such families to contact them for food and other needs.“If whole family has reported COVID+ and there is no one to cook your food. DM (direct message) with your number and location. Someone with whom we have tied up will call you. Only DM, don’t use our helpline for this. Srinagar city limits only,” it said on its Twitter post.The doctors say that when the whole family gets affected by Covid, it takes away the support system of the patient. “The Covid decimates the support system of a patient which is the gruesome part of it. When a person gets sick in a family, generally other members pitch in and try to serve the patient, but in Covid, most of the times 60-70% family members are involved. So one loses a big support system when he/she is ill or critically ill,” said Dr Asif Wani, lecturer at government medical college in Srinagar.“What I understand is that it is not only a medical emergency but a socio-medical emergency. Besides the medical, there are social implications of this disease as well,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/in-second-wave-virus-is-spreading-fast-within-families-kashmir-experts-101619555798182.html

28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Grim scenario: More Covid patients dying in rural belt in Punjab||In what could add to the worries of Covid-hit Punjab that is witnessing a sharp spike in deaths this year, the government data has revealed that the case fatality rate (CFR) or the mortality rate due to contagion is far more in rural areas than the urban population. The CFR in villages is 2.8% against 0.7% in urban areas, said state health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu on Tuesday. The minister said 58% of Covid deaths this year are of patients from rural areas, even as the villages accounted for only one-fourth of the total cases (27%). “Urban areas which are reporting far more positive cases (73%) have witnessed 42% of deaths,” he added. At present, the Punjab CFR stands at 2.02% and 82.5 % of deaths have been recorded from a population that is above 51 years of age, said Sidhu. Stressing upon the need for early diagnosis as well as treatment of coronavirus, the minister attributed the high number of deaths in the rural areas to delay in approaching the healthcare facilities. “Even those having mild symptoms should visit their nearest healthcare facility immediately,” he added. He said as per record 83.92% of patients have visited the hospitals first time with severe symptoms, 0.11% visited with moderate symptoms and 7% visited the health facilities with mild symptoms from January 1 to April 12. Pointing out the risk factors of the population who are suffering from co-morbidities, the minister said that patients with hypertension and diabetes are advised to strictly follow the COVID-19 appropriate behaviour as their lives are at high risk if they catch the contagion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/grim-scenario-more-covid-patients-dying-in-rural-belt-in-punjab-101619555794679.html

28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Shimla sees surge in oximeter, oxygen concentrator demand||With Covid-19 cases increasing rapidly, Shimla town is seeing a surge in demand for oximeters and oxygen concentrators. The two main hospitals in Shimla — state’s premier facility Indira Gandhi Medical College and Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Hospital — are running short of beds, despite more than 1,300 Covid-infected patients being under home isolation. The government has already taken over the regional ayurveda hospital in Shimla and still negotiating with private hospital owners, who so far have been reluctant to extend facilities. Besides, the district administration has been mulling to creating a makeshift hospital at Shimla’s ice skating rink which is the biggest open space in the town after the Ridge. The ice skating rink, nowadays popular as ice skating club, was set up in 1920. The site of the rink is most ideally situated adjacent to the Circular Road, just below the Scandal Point and conveniently approachable from all parts of the town. “I am feeling helpless. Throughout the day, I have been attending calls for oxygen cylinders and concentrators,” said Sumit Sharma, who runs an NGO that provides oxygen concentrators and cylinders for free to caner and tuberculosis patients. “There is panic among people. Some of them are even demanding ventilators, which cannot be operated by individuals,” he said, adding that demand has increased manifold. There are many families under home isolation that have not even tested for Covid-19 infection and have self-isolated themselves. “It’s harrowing time for patients in home isolation. There were no oxygen concentrators available in the market and I had to arrange one from a close relative from Kotkhai for a friend of mine,” said former Shimla mayor Sanjay Chauhan. “There is no end to calls for oxygen concentrators. In fact, the demand had increased ever since people realised the conditions of Shimla hospitals during the first wave. We have supplied more than 500 concentrators in Shimla town alone in last one year. We have about 15 concentrators available to be rented and all of them are booked,” said Mohit Sirkek, who is associated with a Chandigarh-based private company supplying medical equipment in Shimla. The demand for oxygen concentrators is out of panic too. “Actually, people only require supplement when the oxygen saturation drops below 94. Some cases are genuine while some are just demanding the oxygen concentrators out of panic. Lot of cases of breathlessness are being reported in the hospital,” said professor of pulmonary medicines in IGMC, Dr RS Negi. The normal oxygen level should remain above 94, he added. State logs steepest daily spikeHimachal on Tuesday recorded steepest spike of 2,157 Covid infections ever since the outbreak in March last year, taking the state’s caseload past 90,000-mark. The total case tally now stands at 91,350. The death toll mounted to 1,374 after 27 patients succumbed to the contagion. Of the new cases, highest 631 were reported in Kangra. This is highest ever single-day spike registered in any district ever. Hamirpur saw a spike of 300 infections while 264 cases were reported in Solan, 238 in Mandi, 195 in Shimla, 118 in Una, 110 in Sirmaur, 103 in Kullu, 86 in Chamba, 82 in Bilaspur, 17 in Lahaul-Spiti and 13 in Kinnaur. Ten deaths were reported in Kangra, four in Shimla, three in Mandi, two each in Kinnaur and Una, and one each in Chamba, Hamirpur and Solan. The active cases in the state have also crossed 15,000-mark and reached 15,151. Recoveries climbed to 74,783 after 1,305 people recuperated. Identify sites to be turned into makeshift Covid care facilities: Jai Ram to officialsChief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Tuesday visited Sundernagar to review the facilities being created for patients at the makeshift Covid care hospital. The chief minister also visited the old buildings and structure of BBMB colony at Salapar to explore the possibilities of creating additional facilities for Covid-19 patients if the situation warrants.While presiding over a meeting to review Covid-19 situation at Lal Bahadur Shastri Government Medical College in Nerchowk at Mandi district, Jai Ram said that in view of sharp surge in number of infections in the state, the Himachal government had decided to upgrade the bed capacity for patients to about 5,000.He said that Nerchowk medical college has been dedicated as Covid-19 hospital and additional 100-bed makeshift facility was coming up in the adjoining complex of the hospital, which would be ready within next four to five days.Jai Ram said the state government was upgrading and enhancing its capacity to meet any eventuality. He said that about 1,000-bed capacity would be created for Covid patients at Parour in Radha Soami complex of Kangra district. He said that work on MCH building at Mandi would be completed within a month for which additional funds had been provided.He said that state government has also urged the people visiting or returning to Himachal to get RT-PCR negative report and stay in home isolation for at least two weeks.The chief minister directed the officials to provide oxygen facility to maximum beds in the Nerchowk medical college. He said that the bed capacity of hospital at Ratti must be enhanced from 25 to 50.Jai Ram also directed the officials to enlist all such institutions/buildings in the district that could be used for providing better medical facilities to the Covid-19 patients in case of increase in number of patients.He also felt the need for strengthening home isolation facilities in the state. He said that efforts would be made to strengthen healthcare facilities in Bilaspur and Hamirpur districts to lessen the load on medical college at Nerchowk. He also asked the officers to ensure proper coordination among them for effective tackling of this pandemic.Later, the chief minister also inspected under-construction makeshift pre-fabricated hospital at Bangrotu in Mandi district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/shimla-sees-surge-in-oximeter-oxygen-concentrator-demand-101619555792514.html

Punjab DGP Dinkar Gupta said Gavi had fled the state as police were chasing him. He said Gavi had close links with drug smugglers based in Pakistan and Jammu & Kashmir. Gavi had also managed to give police the slip in 11-kg heroin recovery case in February 2020. The police also recovered a Toyota Fortuner SUV, five mobile handsets and three internet dongles from his possession. Police tracked the location of Gavi in Sarai Kila where he was living in a rented flat at Sri Nath Global village on a fake identity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wanted-gangster-jaipal-s-aide-gavi-arrested-from-jharkhand-101619555612426.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Capt dares Sidhu to contest from Patiala, Cong MLA hits back||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Tuesday dared Congress MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu to fight an election against him from Patiala, saying that he (Sidhu) would lose his security deposit. Amarinder said that Sidhu cannot take him on from Patiala as long as he is in the Congress, but is trying to jump ships. “He can fight against me but he will lose his deposit like General JJ Singh (retd) did,” the chief minister said in an interview to a TV channel when asked about the increased political activities of Sidhu and his wife, Navjot Kaur Sidhu, in Patiala. Former army chief was the SAD candidate against Amarinder in the 2017 assembly polls and had lost his security deposit. Both Amarinder and Sidhu belong to Patiala. Amarinder’s broadside against Sidhu, on a day he held meetings with party legislators, signals the start of a full-on war between the two. Sidhu, who had resigned from the state cabinet two years ago, has been taking swipes at chief minister ever since the Punjab and Haryana high court on April 9 quashed the chargesheets filed by the Punjab Police SIT in the 2015 Kotkapura firing case. Sidhu promptly took the social media to hit back at Amarinder, and said his fight is for justice and punishing the guilty, and an assembly seat is not even worth discussion in the same breath. “Efforts to derail Punjab’s conscience will fail,” he tweeted, asking the CM not to beat around the bush and explain why there has been no justice in sacrilege cases. “Netritva par sawal hai? Mansha par bawal hai (Leadership is under question and there is uproar on intent),” he added. Terming Sidhu’s attacks as “indiscipline”, Amarinder said he was probably trying to go to the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) or some other party and only he can tell which one. “The BJP will not take him as he left the party after abusing everyone. The SAD is also not a choice. He is attacking the chief minister which clearly means he is preparing to go…the sooner he wants to go he can go,” the chief minister said in his first response to the former minister’s frequent digs. On the efforts to make Sidhu the state unit chief or deputy chief minister in the state cabinet, Amarinder questioned these demands. “Why should he be made the party president? What is lacking in (present state unit chief) Sunil Jakhar who is doing a very good job,” he asked. The chief minister said that Sidhu joined the party just four years ago and all the cabinet ministers are senior to him. “Several of them started in Youth Congress. Are they senior or someone who has joined recently? Delhi (Congress central leadership) has to take a decision. If I am asked for my opinion, I will tell them exactly this,” he said without mincing words. The Amarinder-Sidhu face-off has put paid to AICC general secretary in-charge of Punjab affairs Harish Rawat’s efforts for cricketer-turned-politician’s rehabilitation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-dares-sidhu-to-contest-from-patiala-cong-mla-hits-back-101619555075411.html

The committee is head by municipal corporation (MC) commissioner Pardeep Sabharwal, who conducted a meeting with the MC staff on Tuesday.During the meeting, the department also decided to set up a control room at the civil hospital to arrange ambulances to carry bodies. Videos of family members taking the bodies in a cycle rehra and auto rickshaw had gone viral on social media sites on Monday, following which the administration swung into action. The family members of the victims said ambulance drivers were demanding up to ₹3, 500 for ferrying the bodies.According to Covid protocol, employees or volunteers wearing PPE kits are supposed to ferry the bodies to cremation grounds. Carrying bodies in auto rickshaws and cycle rehras increase the chances of infection among the others.MC secretary Jasdev Sekhon said the cremation of Covid victims is being carried out at three cremation sites in city -- Dholewal area, Model Town extension and cremation ground near Arora palace on Gill road. The MC has also identified five more cremation grounds for the cremation of Covid victims, if the need arises. These include a ground in Barewal area, another one behind KVM School, Daresi area, near Gaughat Gurdwara and Jamalpur area.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-admin-instructs-hospitals-against-releasing-bodies-sans-ambulance-101619554772338.html

Later, all accused were released on bail.However, some of the alleged key violators, including the newly elected senior deputy mayor Ashok Pradhan, finance minister Manpreet Badal’s son Arjun Badal and the minister’s brother-in-law Jaijeet Johal, did not figure in the FIR. Goyal, a city-based wine contractor is a close aide of Manpreet and Johal. Pradhan had confirmed to the media that most of the 43 Congress councillors and party leaders had a brief social gathering on Friday. SSP Virk said more arrests will be made after thorough verification. “As a raiding party did not find any conclusive evidence at Three Palms resort, located on the city outskirts, our teams followed FB pages of the suspects to gather photographic evidence. On the basis of these digital proofs, the accused were zeroed in and taken into custody,” said the SSP. A large group of Congressmen had gathered at the luxury resort to celebrate the installation of the first Congress mayor of Bathinda, the traditional bastion of Akalis. Photos and videos of the party at the resort that were leaked are being shared widely on social media through the FB pages of some councillors. Police administration faced wide criticism for trying to hush up the violation due to the presence of politically influential persons at the unauthorised gathering posing a risk of virus spread.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-resort-bash-bathinda-mayor-s-husband-2-councillors-among-12-arrested-101619554533801.html

Sandhu, who was conferred with the bravery award for fighting against terrorism in Punjab, was gunned down by two bike-borne men at his home in Bhikhiwind town of Tarn Taran district. The NIA had taken over investigation from the state police in January this year. NIA officials said Sandhu was killed to terrorise Indians, especially those who are opposed to the Khalistani ideology. The accused are Sukhmeet Pal Singh, alias Sukh, alias Bhikhariwal; Sukhraj Singh, alias Lakhanpal; Sukhdeep Singh, alias Bhura; Gurjit Singh, alias Bha, of Gurdaspur district; Ravinder Singh, alias Ravi Dhillon; Akashdeep Arora, alias Dhaliwal; Jagroop Singh of Ludhiana, and Inderjit Singh alias Inder, of Tarn Taran.The charge-sheet was filed in the NIA Special Court, Mohali, under sections 120B (criminal conspiracy), 201 (causing disappearance of evidence), 212 (harbouring offender) and 302 (murder) of the IPC and Sections 25 (1B) and 27 of the Arms Act, and Sections of the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). NIA officials said the transnational conspiracy was hatched by Pakistan-based self-styled chief of KLF Lakhvir Singh Rode and top foreign based KLF terrorists who provided arms, ammunition and funds to the accused. WELL-OILED NEXUS, SAYS AGENCY“A well-oiled terrorist-narcotics-criminal nexus, wherein narcotic drugs and weapons were smuggled by Pakistan-pbased entities from across the International Border in Punjab for generation of funds for executing terrorist acts has also been unearthed,” the officials claimed. They added investigation had established that the foreign-based KLF leadership had recruited, financed and armed gangster Bhikhariwal and tasked him to execute the killing through his associates. After the killing of Harmeet Singh alias Happy PHD, the operational chief of the KLF in Pakistan, in January 2020, Bhikhariwal was directed by Rode and other KLF operatives through encrypted communication platforms to kill Sandhu.The reconnaissance of the target was carried by charge-sheeted accused Inderjeet Singh, while sharp-shooters Gurjit Bha and Sukhdeep Bhura were recruited for killing Sandhu. The other chargesheeted accused are associates of Sukh Bhikhariwal who were instrumental in organising logistics and shelter to the shooters, said officials. Bhikhariwal was deported from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) by the Delhi police in December 2020 in pursuance of a case in which Gurjit Bha and Sukhdeep Bhura were arrested with their three Kashmiri accomplices for attacking a police party. Bhikhariwal was also wanted by the Punjab Police in around a dozen criminal cases, including the Nabha jail break on November 2016.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/shaurya-chakra-awardee-s-murder-nia-files-charge-sheet-against-8-klf-terrorists-101619554232336.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Cong MLAs press Capt for quick action in sacrilege cases||A day after Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar and cooperation minister Sukhjinder Singh Randhawa offered their resignations over the state government’s handling of the sacrilege and police firing cases, several party MLAs on Tuesday conveyed to chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh their apprehensions about the political fallout if justice is not delivered in these cases quickly. The MLAs, who met the chief minister at his farmhouse in Siswan village near here, pressed for quick action in these politically sensitive cases before the state assembly elections due early next year, citing growing anxiety about the government’s ability to deliver justice on this emotive issue. The common thread running through the feedback shared by several MLAs on mood on the ground was that the government cannot be seen procrastinating on taking action in the matter, and that it should move fast after the legal setback so that they can answer the people, according to sources. The Congress had, in the run-up to the 2017 state polls, promised strict action against those responsible for sacrilege and the subsequent police firing. The party legislators met Amarinder in two separate groups of 15 each. While MLAs from Ludhiana, Patiala and Sangrur met him first, those from Ferozepur, Fazilka and Muktsar were part of the second group. Punjab Congress president Sunil Jakhar, advocate general Atul Nanda, director general of police Dinkar Gupta and justice Mehtap Singh Gill (retired) were also present. The council of ministers had, in its meeting on Monday, decided to set up a new special investigation team (SIT) to probe the Kotkapura firing case in compliance of the order of the Punjab and Haryana high court which quashed the report of the earlier team. It also decided to file an appeal against the HC order in due course. Nanda briefed the MLAs about the circumstances in which the government set up the fresh SIT and reasons, including gaps in the investigation led by then IGP Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, that were cited by the high court while quashing the charge sheets filed by the Punjab Police in the firing case. The chief minister is scheduled to meet MLAs from Majha and Malwa and the remaining districts on Wednesday. One of the participants said everyone was really concerned about the impact of the high court order. “They pressed the urgency of the matter and wanted the chief minister to find a way at the earliest,” he said. Khanna MLA Gurkirat Singh Kotli said the members told the chief minister that people were really worried and there are likely consequences if this sentiment persists. “Capt Saab assured us of quick action. We expressed our confidence in the chief minister and his leadership,” he said. Amarinder met the party MLAs on the day he also lashed out at the party’s Amritsar East MLA and former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu who has been sniping at him ever since the court quashed the SIT report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/cong-mlas-press-capt-for-quick-action-in-sacrilege-cases-101619553753659.html

The state on Sunday had booked 30 lakh doses with the SII. Punjab health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said, “We cannot say if the drive will start from May 1 as the central government has not been able to issue adequate doses to vaccinate even the 45-plus category. Many vaccination centres in Punjab remained closed on Saturday due to shortage of jabs. Can vaccination for all be done like this?” “We have been told that the central government would get supply of all doses before May 15,” Sidhu added. An inadequate supply of Covid-19 shots has hit the vaccination drive in Punjab with 310 centres administering the jabs across the state were closed. The state on Tuesday witnessed one of the lowest single-day vaccination tally at 35,833. Of these, 9761 were those getting the second shot. This despite the fact that the state health department on Monday claimed to have over 1 lakh doses at its disposal. This low vaccination was attributed to poor supply of jabs and the strike by the National Health Mission (NHM) employees who had decided to boycott all Covid-related work for the day.Director (health and family welfare) Dr GB Singh said the vaccination process was hit at 294 government-run centres and 16 private facilities. The state has a total of 3,040 vaccine centres of which 254 are run by private hospitals. “The centres where the vaccination came to a halt did not get doses because of less availability with the districts. The supply to the centres is given on the basis of the demand and we have to maintain stock for the second dose as well,” he added. On Tuesday, the state got 1.5 lakh doses from the central government and now has nearly 2 lakh doses available with it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccination-for-all-above-18-in-punjab-from-may-1-to-get-delayed-101619553516205.html

In a statement, he said that Jakhar and Randhawa offered their resignations in the cabinet meeting only for the purpose of “observable optics” for the public eye. Randhawa and Jakhar had offered their resignations on Monday over the sloppy manner in which the sacrilege and the subsequent police firing cases have been handled. “If the governance in the state of Punjab has gone literally berserk and failed to deliver, the Congress party is also to be blamed squarely,” the former deputy speaker said. He said Jakhar has apparently failed to appraise the Congress high command with regard to the domineering functioning of chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh ever since he assumed his second term as chief minister in March 2017.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/dont-just-say-quit-your-posts-bir-devinder-to-jakhar-randhawa-101619553332117.html

The Punjab and Haryana high court had delivered this judgment. Interacting with reporters at the Amb Sahib Gurudwara in Mohali on Tuesday, Singh said, “We will start our protest from Kotkapura on April 30, where we will burn the copies of judgment.” The former jathedar claimed, “We will burn copies of the judgement at all district headquarters and the central event would be held at Kotkapura Chowk, where these incidents happened six years ago. I appeal to political, social, religious groups of all shades to come together and send a stern warning to powers that be. Since the 1980s, successive governments in India have been meddling in Sikh religious affairs.” He alleged that the Badals were voluntarily playing into the hands of the establishment to enjoy power, perks and privileges. Former leader of opposition MLA Sukhpal Singh Khaira claimed, “Our protest is on the lines of farmers burning copies of the three farm laws in Punjab. It’s a democratic form of protest as this judgement has dashed all hopes of justice of the aggrieved family and community.” Former Punjab finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa said the CM apart from doing lip service isn’t at all interested in delivering justice to aggrieved family and community.

Though the curfew was to begin at 6pm, shopkeepers were to bring their shutters down by 5pm. Most shopkeepers at Chaura Bazar, Books Market, Ghumar Mandi, Jawahar Nagar Camp, Bhai Randhir Singh Nagar, Model Town and Sarabha Nagar were seen pulling the shutters down on their own but at some places, there was confusion over the timings, with many shopkeepers under the impression that they could operate till 6pm. But once the curfew kicked in, all prominent markets wore a deserted look and only a few people were seen walking on the streets.Joint commissioner of police (JCP, headquarters) J Elanchezian said that earlier the cops were getting shops closed at 8pm but on Tuesday, they began the drive at 5pm.“Checkpoints were also installed at various locations in the city for proper enforcement of night curfew. Action will be taken against residents found violating the orders,” he said while adding that only chemist shops and hospitals are allowed to operate after 5pm.Ajay Kumar, a garment shop owner in Chaura Bazar, said that at 5pm sharp, cops came and asked them to close their shops. “We thought the curfew would start at 6pm. We didn’t even get time to pack up properly,” he said. Jagjit Singh, an eatery owner near Old Session Chowk said, “We had to close our shop too early. Usually, people visit the shop in the evening to eat.

Ambulance driver Mahesh from Nainital district claimed to be constantly under mental stress while ferrying Covid-19 patients and felt relieved, to some extent, by dancing at the wedding procession in the Haldwani area on Monday.Mahesh, ambulance driver at Dr Susheela Tiwari government hospital in Haldwani, said, “I am constantly working to ferry Covid-19 patients to the hospital and I didn’t go home due to which I am under a lot of stress. I couldn’t stop myself after seeing the baraat (wedding procession) in front of the hospital.” The wedding procession was passing in front of the hospital where Mahesh works. He could not resist the tune of the band and came out from his ambulance to take part in the procession. Everyone was surprised to see a PPE-clad ambulance driver dance in the baraat (procession), some even distanced themselves from him. “I danced for nearly 10 minutes and forgot everything. It was a relief,” he said. “After dancing, my mind felt a little better and I forgot my stress. And that is why I danced,” Mahesh added. Yuvraj Pant, a psychologist at Dr Sushila Tiwari government hospital, said, the ambulance driver was on duty to take the bodies of the patients who died from the Covid-19 to the post-mortem house. “There are frequent deaths from Corona infection. In such a situation, he was under a lot of stress.” “There is ‘shaking therapy’ to get relief from stress. When the stress hormone is released, it is found in the blood. In such a situation, if the body is moved through dance, sports and yoga, then the stress is released,” Pant said. He further said, “this is how Mahesh was able to reduce his stress by dancing. We all should undergo shaking therapy during the present scenario so that the stress, anxiety, blood pressure, heart problems can be overcome and their side effects are reduced,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/uttarakhand-ambulance-driver-dances-in-ppe-kit-at-wedding-procession-video-goes-viral-101619552252381.html
28-04-2021||Mumbai||Vaccination for all: 3 main challenges for Mumbai’s hospitals||On Tuesday state health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state will need 120 million doses for 57.1 million residents in the ages of 18-44. The state currently has a few hundred thousands as part of the national Covid-19 inoculation drive, which is currently open to those above 45, health care and frontline workers. It remains uncertain that the drive, which was to open to all adults starting May 1, will begin. However, vaccine stock is not the only challenge that Mumbai faces. The expanded rollout will nearly double the city’s target population, requiring the government as well as the private sector to add more centres, decentralise procurement and ensure crowd management. Mumbai currently has 132 vaccination centres including 42 civic-run, 17 state-run and 73 privately run centres. Its current target population above 45 years is around 4 million. With the addition of the population between 18 to 44 years, another 4 million people will be added to this pool. Mumbai has so far administered over 2.8 millon doses – nearly 60,000 on Tuesday itself. HT spoke to several experts and asked them one main question: What will it take to ensure effective vaccination of all adults?DECENTRALISING EFFORTS “Mumbai’s current vaccination capacity is 85,000 doses per day,” said Dr Mangala Gomare, executive health officer of BMC. “We have administered a maximum of 67,000 doses in a day. As the vaccination stock gets streamlined, we can achieve the total capacity and expand further,” she said. According to Gomare, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW) has now allowed states to directly sanction private hospitals as vaccination centres, where earlier, proposals needed to be sent to the ministry for approval. “As more private hospitals are added, vaccination drive will be decentralised gradually,” she said. The guidelines issued by the Centre last week also confirmed that manufacturers of Covid-19 vaccines will be free to supply 50% doses to states and in the open market – which can be procured by hospitals or corporates directly – and the manufacturers will have to make an advance declaration of the price before May 1. States will, however, need to monitor the hospitals that have procured stocks, and declared them on the COWIN app. Thus, apart from the vaccination drive that the state will carry out, procuring stock from the Centre, and from manufacturers, private hospitals will also be able to buy vaccines and vaccinate people. The civic body is also considering the possibility of using large community halls, schools and other such spaces for vaccination. Augmentation of vaccination booths in the currently functional jumbo vaccination centres is also a priority. However, the big challenge that poses the BMC, and other authorities is to ensure that as new vaccine centres get approved, they stay true to the guidelines laid down by the National Expert Group on Vaccine Administration for Covid-19 on the procedure and guidelines for administration of the vaccine at state and district level. For example, every centre must necessarily have an area where those who have just been vaccinated can sit for at least 30 minutes to ensure that in case of any adverse effect detected, they can be treated immediately. It must also ensure safe storage, transportation and delivery of vaccine doses, which should be maintained at the right temperature. According to Gomare, bigger health facilities will be able to make such arrangements. “The problem is with dispensaries and urban health centres which have very small spaces. But we are in the process of shortlisting centres which may have large halls or open grounds nearby, that can be linked to the centres and converted into post and pre-vaccination waiting areas,” she said. SCALING UP INFRASTRUCTURE The BMC plans to scale up the jumbo facility at the Bandra Kurla Complex so as to double the number of vaccination booths from 15 to 30. The BKC facility is among the largest civic-run centres with the capacity to carry out 8000 vaccinations per day. On Tuesday, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal directed civic officials to identify locations for additional 227 vaccination centres in the city -- one in each electoral ward. Chahal has directed these centres to tie up with local hospitals nearby where citizens will be rushed in case of any adverse effect. “We have administered a maximum of 6800 doses in a day,” said Dr Rajesh Dere, who heads the facility. “Given that we have a large space, increasing the capacity further will be easy for us,” he said. The facility built on the MMRDA grounds has structural stability up to May 31. A structural stability assessment is carried out by engineers to ascertain if the structure is safe and can withstand internal activities as well as seasonal changes. An audit will be conducted to ensure monsoon preparedness, as well. Private hospitals too have begun discussions on increasing their capacity. “We currently have five booths and we are looking at adding another five as vaccination opens for all adult populations. The question is if we will have enough stocks,” said Dr Gautam Bhansali from Bombay Hospital. “Our hospital is also considering 24/7 vaccinations,” he said adding that the space management will be easier with online slots. At Parel’s Global Hospital, authorities are looking at doubling the number of vaccination counters. The hospital currently has three counters and has carried out an average of 220 vaccinations in a day. “We expect the numbers to go up to 450-500. The number of doctors, nurses and associated staff will be accordingly increased,” said Dr Jigna Shrotriya, deputy general manager (Medical Services), Global Hospital. PRICING Dr Santosh Shetty, chief executive officer of Kokilben Dhirubhai Ambani Hospital said that securing doses for the private sector seems to be the biggest challenge. “We have spoken to the manufacturers and they have commitments to the centre and states up to May end. Accommodating the private sector is likely to happen only after the third week of May,” he said, adding that their hospital has administered nearly 800 doses in a day when the supply of stocks was good. “We can easily double our capacity by simply adding more hours. Space is not a problem at our hospital.” “We don’t know how soon the stocks will arrive after we start the process,” Bhansali said. India is currently administering only two vaccines: homegrown Covaxin by Bharat Biotech and AstraZeneca’s Covershield manufactured by Serum Institute of India. The Centre is procuring them at ₹150 per dose and distributing them to the states. But from May 1, the states will also make their own purchases and private sector hospitals too will have to procure vaccine doses from the manufacturers. The vaccine manufacturers have quoted different selling prices for the Centre, states and the private sector. “The centre has offloaded the pressure onto the states. This will have significant implications on the vaccination drives, especially in high burden states like Maharashtra,” said Soumitra Ghosh, assistant professor at the Centre for Health Policy, Planning and Management, Tata Institute of Social Sciences. “Shifting away from the centralised model leaves the manufacturers with an upper hand. This decision will lead to profiteering, chaos and confusion over the coming days,” he said. Private hospitals will have to further work out their pricing based on storage, handling and manpower costs. “If the need arises, we will cap these costs in the private sector,” said Dr Subash Salunkhe, advisor to the state on Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccination-for-all-3-main-challenges-for-mumbai-s-hospitals-101619552072837.html

As an average of 1,908 housing units is sold every month in Mumbai, it will take at least 57 months to sell its unsold inventory, according to a study conducted by real estate research firm Liases Foras, which pointed out the realty sector’s grim situation, especially amid the second wave of Covid-19 lockdown, where the entire sector has been paralysed. In any realty market, the ideal inventory should not be above 15-20 months. According to Pankaj Kapoor, managing director, Liases Foras, this huge inventory is a cause of worry. “The second wave of Covid-19 will only make things difficult for the real estate sector as the sales volume will decrease significantly,” said Kapoor, adding, “In addition, the state government has made things more difficult by withdrawing the stamp duty cut in March-end. The stamp duty cut had helped drive the sales in the past few months,” he added. The Builders’ Association of India (BAI) said both slowdown and government policies have caused havoc in the realty sector, resulting in the piling up of such a huge inventory. “There was an economic slowdown in the past few years which slowed down our sales considerably. In addition to it, the government levied huge premiums and taxes, forcing us to hike the real estate prices, which drove homebuyers away from the market,” said Anand Gupta, chairman, BAI (housing and RERA committee). “Just as things were looking up, the second Covid-19 wave and the subsequent lockdown again dissuaded homebuyers from buying properties,” he added. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) region, which along with Mumbai includes Navi Mumbai, Thane and Raigad, also has an unsold inventory of 286,992 units. It will take at least 48 months to clear MMR’s inventory, given that approximately 6,000 units are sold monthly. Paras Gundecha, founder of Gundecha Group – one of the leading real estate firms – said that the coming days may not be good for the realty sector. “The real estate sector is driven by sentiments, and currently we are witnessing a negative sentiment all across. We will face difficult times in the coming days due to the Covid-19 wave, and for this, the government needs to give us incentives like re-imposing the stamp duty cut,” said Gundecha. The real estate industry in the past few years has been going through a recessionary phase. Builders raised realty prices to unaffordable levels, forcing many buyers to postpone their plans to purchase. In addition, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), as a cautionary exercise, laid down stringent lending norms. However last year, the Covid-19 pandemic caused an upheaval in realty market, with sales plummeting considerably. Last August, the government announced its decision to reduce stamp duty levied on sales of apartments to 2% from September 1 to December 31, 2020, and then hike it to 3% from January 1 till March 31, 2021. The move had played a huge role in boosting sales of both primary and secondary market. However, after March end, the government refused to extend this scheme despite the real estate sector’s plea. The second wave of Covid-19 then hit the country, bringing more distress for the sector.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/realty-crisis-108k-units-remain-unsold-in-mumbai-101619552012885.html

Punjab Pollution Control Board (PPCB) data shows that Mansa reported 25 rabi crop farm fires between April 15-25, the highest among seven the southern districts in the state. Bathinda and Fazilka have recorded 16 each, followed by Faridkot (10), Moga (8), Ferozepur (9) and Muktsar (2).Sources said the cases may increase in the next few weeks before paddy transplantation begins, also claiming that the number might be higher, as the data is based on satellite imageries taken by the State Remote Sensing Centre and some fires might have escaped its radar. PPCB state nodal officer Ashok Sharma said in the corresponding last year, no major incident was reported due to the climatic conditions. “Around April 13 last year, parts of Punjab had witnessed spells of rain and hailstorm, and it had delayed harvest. The PPCB started monitoring fires on April 15. Data has been sent to the field staff for cross-verification and to fine the erring farmers,” Sharma added. Bathinda chief agriculture officer (CAO) Bahadur Singh Sidhu said nothing alarming has been noticed. “Wheat stubble is used to make dry fodder for cattle, and few farmers burn only leftover roots. These roots can be easily mixed into the soil, but some farmers find it easier to burn it,” he said.33 INSTANCES IN SANGRURSangrur district has reported 33 cases of wheat residue burning to date, even as the state is battling covid-19 pandemic. The smoke due to stubble burning is likely to worsen the respiratory disease in patients. Farmers claim that if they do not burn the wheat crop residue, their fields will consume more water during preparation for next crop. “Farmers are helpless and have to burn stubble. If the government takes action, we will oppose it,” said Gobinder Singh, Sangrur block chief of BKU (Ekta-Ugrahan). PPCB executive engineer Rajeev Gupta said no challans had been issued yet. Sangrur chief agriculture officer Jaswinder Pal Singh Grewal said it was irresponsible of farmers to burn crop residue. “There is no need to burn wheat residue, as it can be managed easily. Nodal officers are looking into the matter,” added Grewal. Dr Rahul Gupta, of Sangrur civil hospital, said the residue burning practice is harmful amid Covid-19 pandemic as the smoke affects throat and lungs. “People suffering from asthma and old allergies are prone to covid infection and residue burning precipitates it. This time, covid patients are coming in large numbers from villages. If stubble burning cases increase, the number of covid patients will also rise,” added Dr Gupta.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/wheat-stubble-burning-starts-in-malwa-experts-warn-covid-scenario-could-worsen-101619552012424.html

The education department announced the formation of the study group in a government resolution (GR) dated April 26. As per the GR, the study group was formed in light of the “confusion and miscommunication” caused among the government officials while representing various cases filed by school staff. “The government pleader representing the state and in turn the school education department’s officers in each such case are usually not the same. On many occasions, it is observed that there is a lack of coordination among the officers of the department giving instructions to such government pleaders, and resultantly, such submissions are made on behalf of the state government by such government pleaders in similar matters, which are substantially inconsistent,” stated the GR. With similar cases being filed by staffers and in light of the inconsistency in response from the government, the Bombay high court had vide its order dated April 1 observed, “Once the position of law is laid down by this court and if the state does not challenge the view taken, there is no reason why the state government should not issue clarificatory instructions to its officers to bring the position in consonance with the law laid down.” The government has thus formed a 12-member study group with the joint secretary of the school education department as its chairman. “This study group ought to give suggestions as to how this type of litigation does not arise in the first place. It will also give suggestions as to how in respect of such common disputes, the state government and resultantly, the school education and sports department is able to put up a common as also consistent defence in all such matters, before the hon’ble courts” stated the GR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/study-group-to-look-into-litigation-by-school-staff-101619551951519.html

It’s most likely a phishing attack to hijack your biometric as well other confidential data from your cellphone.The police have warned users not to install fake oximeter mobile applications from any links they may have received over email, SMS or social media. According to them, cyber criminals are employing such means to steal personal data and passwords, which can be misused in stealing cash from bank accounts and blackmailing.Amid the ongoing surge in Covid-19 cases, links for downloading such applications are doing the rounds on various social networking sites.Cyber cell-1 in-charge inspector Pawan Kumar said that they found such dubious apps and consulted medical experts about their authenticity. The experts claimed that phones cannot measure blood oxygen levels as they have no physical SpO2 blood oxygen sensor.Kumar said that after downloading such apps, the users are asked to put their finger on the rear camera of their phone. “These apps steal biometric details such as fingerprints. Some applications also claim to measure body temperature, heartbeats and even blood pressure to trap the users,” he added.“Cyber criminals have also launched other phishing applications such as pink WhatsApp to defraud the users. We advise all not to download such apps,” he said.Perils of video chat with strangers Sub-inspector Jatinder Singh, in-charge of cyber cell-2, said that fraudsters are trapping people through video calls too.“Cyber criminals, including women, honey trap phone users by sending them friend requests and ask them to video chat with them. The fraudsters then record these videos, morph them, and blackmail people to extort money from them,” he said.The police have received some complaints regarding such fraud and are investigating the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-cyber-cell-warns-of-fake-oximeter-apps-101619551832059.html

Several attendees also raised objections as a copy of the draft environment impact assessment (EIA) report has not been shared publicly, as per the rules of the Environment Impact Assessment Notification (2006), for the project. “Central guidelines clearly state that the full EIA report is to be shared publicly in multiple languages, 30 days before the public hearing. This is a crucial step towards educating people about the projected benefits and pitfalls of a certain project, which has been completely sidestepped by BMC. How are stakeholders expected to make their decisions based on incomplete information,” said Shweta Bhatt, director (conservation) of Conservation Action Trust. The Maharashtra Pollution Control Board (MPCB) has only shared an executive summary of the EIA report on its website. As per the document, the project is being executed at a cost of ₹504 crore. An environment management plan (EMP) has also been drawn up with a capital cost of ₹ 815 lakh and recurring cost annual cost of ₹96 lakh. “An additional air pollution control plan has also been put in place with a budget of ₹25 crore,” said Minesh Pimple from BMC’s solid waste management department. In response to citizens’ objections, Pimple said BMC will be putting up a copy of the full draft EIA report under the ‘solid waste management’ section of its website. “The executive summary covers the project in totality. But as some people are seeking more technical information, the full report is being uploaded on our website. Any inquiries based on that should be directed to us by Monday [May 3],” he added. Bhatt, among other attendees, also pointed out that the WTE model has seen little success as well as public resistance in other parts of the country. “This model incentivises the production of waste instead of focusing on-source segregation. Across Europe, WTE plants are being shut down because they emit carcinogenic dioxins and furans. In India, the calorific value of waste is low, making it unsuitable for incineration and more harmful, emissions wise,” said Sushant Bali, an environmentalist who attended Tuesday’s meeting. Moreover, of the 100-odd attendees who were present during the online hearing, only one, Mejaz Ansari, was a resident of the area. “There are lakhs of people who live near the Deonar garbage dump whose lives are already affected. Most of them will not able to attend online hearings. This public hearing should be delayed till the Covid-19 situation has improved. How can a public hearing be held when the people most directly concerned cannot attend,” said Ansari. BMC officials, however, maintained that the project is essential to tackle Mumbai’s burgeoning waste problem. “People need to understand that our aim is not power generation, but eliminating waste. Take any country in Europe where source segregation is done. It has taken them decades to reach there. The larger public does not follow the solid waste management rules at source, necessitating such an intervention,” said Pimple, clarifying that a second public hearing would not be held, despite citizens’ requests. The Deonar dumping ground is India’s oldest landfill, set up in 1927. Currently, the site receives 800 tonnes of solid mixed waste and 1,200 tonnes of construction and demolition waste each day. As per the summary EIA, “Entire waste is being dumped in an unorganised way. This causes environmental damage, which makes the surrounding areas of Chembur, Govandi and Mankhrud unfit for habitation.” The proposed WTE plant is being built at a budget of just over ₹500 crore, and will produce 4MW of power. BMC’s proposal allows for expansion up to 8MW. An area of 12 hectares has been earmarked within the dumpsite to set up the power plant. The terms of reference were granted by the state environment department last June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/4mw-waste-to-energy-plant-at-deonar-mumbaiites-oppose-plan-101619551771556.html

The chief minister’s office should give orders for the supply of oxygen to districts located in Bareilly division, he said.Jawahar Lal Rajput, the BJP MLA from Garautha assembly constituency in Jhansi, said the hospitals in Jhansi were facing an oxygen crisis. There was an immediate need of oxygen to save lives, he added.“I have written a letter to the chief minister and informed the officers in the chief minister’s office as well. On Monday, I talked to chief secretary RK Tiwari to expedite the supply of oxygen to Jhansi (from the stock) that Uttar Pradesh has received from Bokaro (Jharkhand) and the central government,” he said.Rajput said that in order to expedite the supply of oxygen to hospitals in the seven districts of Bundelkhand region, the state government should run an Oxygen Express train to the oxygen plant at Rourkela Steel Plant in Odisha.“In comparison to Bokaro, it will take less time to get lifesaving oxygen from the Rourkela Steel Plant for the Bundelkhand region,” he said.BJP MLA from Bairia seat in Ballia Surendra Singh said, “I have sent a letter to the chief minister to ensure the rapid supply of oxygen to hospitals in Ballia district. The hospitals in the districts are facing an acute oxygen crisis. The lives of a large number of patients are at risk. Rather than centralized supply from Lucknow, the state government should decentralize the oxygen supply across the state. The Oxygen Express and tankers should unload oxygen in east UP, rather than in Lucknow. Valuable time will be lost in the supply of oxygen from Lucknow to the other districts,” he said.Leader of Opposition and Samajwadi Party (SP) MLA from Bansdih in Ballia Ram Govind Chaudhary said, “I am regularly drawing the attention of the state government toward the oxygen crisis not only in Ballia, but also in various other districts of the state. I have told the chief minister that officers are misguiding him and giving wrong data regarding supply of oxygen to various districts. Since Saturday, the officers are saying that oxygen is reaching the hospitals in east UP. Three days have passed, but oxygen has not reached the hospitals. The state government should take the Opposition into confidence, hold meetings and make the oxygen supply transparent to instill confidence among the people,” he said.Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) MLA from Bhinga Aslam Raini said, “I am writing letters regularly to the chief minister’s office to draw attention to the lack of health facilities in the hospitals in Shravasti, Balrampur and Bahraich districts. The government and private hospitals located in these three districts are facing oxygen shortage and several patients have died. The supply of oxygen by road to districts in the Terai region of UP will take time. The state government should airlift oxygen cylinders to the airstrips and helipads in the area for quick supply.”UP Congress Committee president and MLA from Tamukhiraj in Kushinagar Ajay Kumar Lallu said his party had been drawing the state government’s attention to the “oxygen crisis” following a surge in Covid-19 cases. “The districts in east UP and hospitals located in the far-flung areas are the worst affected. The coronavirus infection has spread in the rural areas. The patients admitted in the community health centres require oxygen. The Congress government in Chhattisgarh has sent oxygen tankers to a private hospital in Lucknow,” he said. For his part, Congress MLC Deepak Singh on Tuesday said he committed his legislators’ fund for Covid management, especially for oxygen and ventilators for Amethi district.“I wrote to the district authorities asking them to purchase and install oxygen concentrators. Also, I have asked them for the training of staff for handling the ventilators,” he added.Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD) national secretary Anil Dubey said, “We do not have any legislators (MLA or MLC), but I wrote to the chief minister, demanding oxygen supply, especially allowing cylinders to the individuals and also removing the rider of CMO’s referral for admissions to Covid hospitals.”Samajwadi Party MLC Udaiveer Singh said: “This government, its ministers, and district officials are not listening to anyone. They have become inaccessible. District officials have been busy with panchayat polls more than the Covid management. Leave alone the Opposition, this government is not listening to its own party MLAs. It has made things so centralised that now people like us cannot help people directly--be it with oxygen, ventilators, hospital beds, or Remdesivir. How can a legislator help a person with his Covid treatment, if he is not getting a bed? The issue is not funds but management. Last year, ₹1500 crore of MLA funds accumulated for Covid was not utilised, oxygen plants were to be made but they were not installed. The CM and PM CARES funds were unutilized.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/constituents-in-distress-up-lawmakers-press-for-oxygen-supply-101619551713213.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Badnore blames influx of outsiders for second wave in Chandigarh||UT administrator VP Singh Badnore on Tuesday blamed the influx of outsiders for the Covid-19 second wave in the city.Addressing the media, in only his second such interaction since the outbreak last March, Badnore said, “Three major activities have taken place in Chandigarh, which could have contributed to the second wave in the city. The city hosts the legislative assemblies of Punjab and Haryana. When house sessions take place, a large number of outsiders come to the city, which cannot be avoided as the city is the capital of both the states.”Badnore further said that a major influx of outsiders in the city was also witnessed when physical hearing of cases had restarted in the Punjab and Haryana high court. During the first wave last year, only virtual hearing of cases was being done.“Similarly, when we opened the OPD in PGIMER, a large number of outsiders had started to pour in,” he said.The UT administration had called a meeting of mediapersons for seeking their suggestions on Covid-19 management in the city.When asked about opening of the OPDs in Chandigarh hospitals, Badnore said, “We have to create a balance between physical and virtual examinations of patients. There is no system for testing for Covid before the OPD. All of them also cannot be directed to get tested before they come to the OPD.”‘50% ICU beds occupied by patients from other states’Badnore said that majority of the beds have been occupied by people from outside Chandigarh and it has been challenging for the administration to ramp up the medical facilities. “No doubt to keep the number of fatalities low, we need the health facilities to be active to deal with severe cases. However, when it comes to ICU beds, less than 50% are occupied by patients from Chandigarh, while others are occupied by people from as far as Ladakh and J&K. The issue is that we cannot refuse them,” said the administrator. Health officials said the situation is similar in the case of oxygen beds as well. Government hospitals in Chandigarh have been able to mobilise only 126 ICU beds with ventilators, with a few diverted from non-Covid wards. On Tuesday evening, only 14% (18) ICU beds were available, with nine at GMCH-32, eight at PGIMER, one at GMSH-16 and none at the hospital in Sector 48. Meanwhile, the occupancy of 666 oxygen beds stood at 78%.Army to set up 100-bed facility at PU hostel within a week In order to strengthen the health infrastructure, the administrator said that the Indian Army will be establishing a 100-bed hospital for Covid-19 patients at the Panjab University International Hostel.Later, Col Jasdeep Sandhu, director, civil military affairs, Western Command, said that the necessary liaison has been established with the Chandigarh administration and the 100-bed hospital will be established by moving a field hospital from Himachal Pradesh.“Our medical teams are visiting the selected place on Wednesday, and the hospital will be functional in five to six days,” he said.The Western Command has already agreed to set up a 100-bed Covid hospital in the neighbouring Mohali district as well.Badnore also chairs an all-party meetEarlier in the day, the administrator chaired an all-party meeting at the UT Guest House to seek suggestions from political parties on Covid management strategy.In the meeting, Congress opposed the imposition of lockdown in the city. Congress councilor and leader of opposition in the MC, Devinder Singh Babla, said, “The administration is confused as they put a lockdown for a day and then suddenly the next day, they discontinued it. The health department is not ensuring that necessary drugs are being made available to the patients. Price of the drugs/medicines should be regulated and availability be checked.”The Aam Aadmi Party, on the other hand, backed the lockdown only if the experts advised in its favour. They also suggested fully exploiting the health infrastructure lying in disuse in several locations in the city like Palsora.Former city MP and senior BJP leader Satya Pal Jain advised the administration of a health war room, which should have a helpline for oxygen and medicine availability and one for the patients needing help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/badnore-blames-influx-of-outsiders-for-second-wave-in-chandigarh-101619551652156.html

Almost all medical stores are pulling down their shutters by 10pm, including those in front of KGMU, Balrampur Hospital and Ram Manohar Lohia hospital in Gomti Nagar. As a result, many families are having a harrowing experience while searching for life-saving drugs in the state capital during late night hours. Vikas Thakur, 48, a resident of 645A/1276, Saraswatipuram, Jankipuram, reported breathing trouble on Monday around 4pm. His oxygen level was hovering between 88 and 92. The family booked an online consultation with a doctor. By the time Vikas’ turn came and the family received doctor’s prescription suggesting immediate hospitalisation, it was 9pm. Thereafter, Vikas’ wife, Kavita Singh, daughter Muskan, 22, and family friends began a frantic search for medicines prescribed by the doctor. These life-saving drugs were the only hope for the family as arranging an oxygen cylinder was next to impossible. “All medical stores in front of KGMU, Balrampur Hospital and Lohia (RML) were closed. Not a single one was open. We managed to get only three medicines from a local medical store. We could not get a single life-saving drug prescribed by the doctor, including Medrol 16mg and Fabiflu,” said Kavita Singh. All of us returned with no option but to pray and wait for the morning, she added. At 9am on Tuesday, a family friend queued outside Sachdeva Medical Store at IT Crossing. It was around 11am that he was able to get all medicines barring an injection. “From IT Crossing to Jankipuram, we tried to reach home by a two-wheeler. After around 15 hours of doctors’ consultation we were able to give medicines to Vikas,” said Ravi Kumar, Vikas’ friend. But the search for medicines did not end here. Injection Medrol 40mg was yet to be procured. “This is an important injection advised by the doctor for infection in the chest. From Jankipuram to IT Crossing it was not available in any other medical store,” said Kavita. Finally at 3pm, the family managed to get the injection from the medicine market, Aminabad. After oxygen cylinders, getting emergency drugs is also proving to be an ordeal for family members of Covid patients, said kin of Vikas. “No one wants to take a risk. No medical store owner is willing to keep the store open through the night. Generally, by mutual consensus medical stores operate turn-wise during night outside KGMU, Balrampur Hospital and RML hospital,” said a medical store owner near Balrampur hospital. The fear of the pandemic is such that no one is willing to keep his medical store open during night hours, he added. Experts suggest that some medical stores all across the city must be kept open through the night on rotation basis so that patients can get emergency drugs even at odd hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/searching-for-live-saving-drugs-at-night-is-an-ordeal-in-lucknow-say-covid-patient-s-kin-101619551471486.html

She has high blood sugar and blood pressure. When her oxygen saturation level declined to 79, the family members became anxious, but my mother immediately started doing exercise to increase the oxygen level. She also used the lung exercise instruments to get normal oxygen saturation counts. For a day, she remained on oxygen support at home. Her endeavour to recover paid dividends. Soon, the oxygen level shot up to 94 and, on Monday, it increased to 97.”After 12 days, not only Vidya Devi, but the remaining family members, who had been Covid-19 positive, also recovered.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/82yearold-woman-defeats-covid-in-gorakhpur-101619551351440.html

The district has a fatality rate of 1.09%.It has been learnt that one of the nine patients, a 40-year-old man, who was on Bi-PAP support, collapsed and died at the toilet of the isolation ward in the city’s civil hospital on Monday evening.While the recovery rate is 84.16% with 382 patients recovering on Tuesday, 332 fresh cases were reported, taking the active caseload to 2,889.Most of the patients who died were admitted at late stages and some had multiple ailments, said civil surgeon Dr Kuldeep Singh.Dr Sanjeev Singla, deputy civil surgeon, told the reporters, “It’s high time that residents follow Covid-appropriate behaviour. I could attribute the sudden surge to many of the mutants that have emerged overtime and symptomatic patients hiding in their homes, reporting to hospitals late.”Meanwhile, panic spread across health circles as a patient’s attendant complained of “no availability” of O2 for her infected family member at the city’s civil hospital.Mithun Verma, a Congress councilor from ward number 10, also alleged that the attendants of patients have to bring out the empty cylinders and replace them with filled ones, amid the unavailability of staff.SDM (City) Sachin Gupta reached the facility to check on the scare and said, “There was some panic that the oxygen might finish and the filled cylinder won’t be available enough O2 was available with the hospital and the patient is stable.”Eight ventilator beds available for online bookingThe district administration has started online booking for 75% of available beds in government and private facilities, according to which only eight beds were vacant as on Tuesday.These included six at the district’s largest dedicated Covid facility at Maharishi Markandeshwar University, Mullana, and two at the civil hospital in Ambala Cantt. No ventilator bed was available in the city that has been largely affected by the second wave.To avail the facility, the patient or the attendant has to fill the required details at the dedicated portal “Ambala Hospital Covid Management” accessible from the Ambala district website.SDM Gupta, in-charge of the initiative, said that the patient is given a window of 3 hours to arrive at the hospital, failing which the booking lapses. “It is only after the primary diagnosis and at the discretion of the doctor that the patient will be admitted,” the IAS officer said.Utsav Shah, chief minister’s good governance associate, said that the availability numbers will be updated at least twice a day through the nodal authority at the civil surgeon’s office, who will be connected with the respective hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/nine-patients-succumb-to-covid-19-in-ambala-district-101619551232679.html

28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Panel for sweeping reforms in PU senate, syndicate||The high-level committee constituted to examine the governing structure of Panjab University (PU) has accepted the suggestions made by the three-member sub-committee regarding the constitution and composition of varsity’ senate and syndicate.Based on these suggestions, the recommendations of the panel and the comments of the Punjab government, the final report will be prepared by the committee and submitted to the office of the vice-president of India, M Venkaiah Naidu, who is the chancellor of PU.No registered graduates’ constituencyThe high-level committee during the last meeting on April 19 has resolved that as a substitute to registered graduates’ constituency, four eminent PU alumni be nominated by the chancellor. They have also resolved that 18 persons will be nominated by the chancellor instead of the existing provision of 36.In the last meeting, the nominees of the Punjab government had sought time to seek the views of their state on the proposed changes, which will be incorporated in the final report.Recommendations of sub-committeeAccording to the recommendations made by the sub-committee, the election will be held for only 14 members of the senate, including two professors elected from university departments and two members elected from among associate and assistant professors. Four members will be elected from among the principals of affiliated and constituent colleges and six members will be elected from among the teachers of affiliated colleges. Besides this, two members will be from the Punjab legislative assembly. There will be no separate constituency of faculties.The 11-member panel of experts was constituted by the chancellor in February to recommend governance reforms in light of the National Education Policy (NEP-2020) after the University Grants Commission (UGC) in November had informed PU to initiate governance reforms as per the provisions mentioned in the PU Act and regulations.The committee has received only 167 responses from the stakeholders, out of which 113 have given suggestions on governance reforms. Moreover, only three meetings have been held by the committee.No election for syndicate members proposedAccording to the report submitted by the sub-committee, which was accessed by HT, instead of 15 elected members, it was proposed that 10 members be nominated to the syndicate by the vice-chancellor on seniority basis by rotation. These members will be from among the deans of faculties, university teachers, college principals and professors, and a teacher other than professors of colleges. The report also states that a person once appointed as a member of the syndicate will not be repeated.Propose realignment of territorial jurisdictionThe high-level committee has also accepted the proposal submitted by the sub-committee regarding the realignment of territorial jurisdiction of PU.

28-04-2021||Other||UP panchayat polls: HC seeks SEC’s explanation over deaths, Covid violations||The Allahabad high court on Tuesday took note of reports related to deaths of government employees on panchayat election duty and directed the State Election Commission (SEC) to explain by the next hearing as to why it failed in checking non- compliance with Covid-19 guidelines during various phases of the panchayat elections in the state. The court also asked the SEC to explain why action may not be taken against it and 27 of its officials for the same, including prosecuting those responsible for such violations. The court mentioned a news report which alleged there were 135 deaths of government employees on panchayat election duty due to Covid-19. The state is witnessing four-phase panchayat elections that began on April 15 and will end on April 29. Fixing May 3 as the next date of hearing in the case, the court directed the state government to place before it by then the details of beds for Covid-19 patients, medicines and oxygen supplied in various hospitals of Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Agra, Kanpur Nagar, Meerut, Ghaziabad, Gautam Buddha Nagar, Gorakhpur and Jhansi. The high court also directed the state government to ensure health bulletin, twice a day, in major government hospitals of Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Agra, Kanpur Nagar, Gorakhpur and Jhansi, giving health updates of the patients. The hospitals were asked to use large screens to give details of patients and their oxygen saturation levels. Further, the state government was directed to declare on the district portals of these cities the number of beds that were occupied and vacant in Covid-19 wards and ICUs of all government and private hospitals. The bench comprising Justice Siddhartha Varma and Justice Ajit Kumar passed the order on a suo motu public interest litigation (PIL) on the spread of Covid-19 in the state and the condition of quarantine centres. The court said that mere antigen negative report should not be a ground to discharge a patient as such patients could still infect others. They needed to be shifted to non-Covid wards for at least a week. For this, the government needed to gear up to set up makeshift wards on the campuses of hospitals, the court said. The court directed that government hospitals be provided with sufficient medicines and injections, including Remdesivir, for patients. The oxygen supply to hospitals should remain uninterrupted, the court said. On the difficulties faced by Covid-19 patients, the court observed, “If even after seven decades of our attaining freedom with so many heavy industries set up, we are not able to provide oxygen to our citizens, it’s a matter of shame.” The court said the authorities concerned must ensure proper management of doctors, medical and paramedical staff as they were all working day and night and getting infected as well. On certain reports of attacks on medical staff by the public, the bench said, “When near and dear ones die, they go frustrated at the system of healthcare in the state and soft targets of their ire are the medical and paramedical staff.” “The situation overall in the major cities of Uttar Pradesh has gone very chaotic for the current Covid surge. Whether it is day or night, the ghost of Corona is marching on the roads and streets of the major cities of the state and it can be anybody’s fate. Those who are resourceful will survive and the rest as histories of past pandemics tell us may die for want of proper healthcare. As the government in its wisdom has resolved to only two days’ weekend lockdown to break the chain and has further proceeded with some measures as a sequel to that, but mere fact that number of positive cases, as have been shown to have been reduced a little in numbers due (to) two weekend lockdown days, nothing remarkable seems to have been achieved on the front of public health care to the satisfaction of the people,” the bench observed. The state government was asked to increase the number of ambulances immediately and to ensure that ambulances must be well equipped with life-saving devices. The bench also directed the government to ensure that every Covid related death was reported to a judicial officer to be appointed by district judge at the end of the day. The government should also ensure the correctness of the data forwarded to the officer concerned each day. Further, cremation in Covid death cases must be done as per the guidelines issued by the government. The bench observed, “We make it clear that we will not tolerate any paperwork or public announcements to show account of the steps taken and its sufficiency as it is now an open secret that government had gone complacent due to weakening of virus impact by the end of 2020 in the state and the government got more involved in other activities, including panchayat elections.” “Had it been constantly vigilant, it would have prepared itself to face the onslaught of the pandemic in its second wave. Posterity would never forgive us if we remain oblivious to the real public health issues and let the people die for want of adequate health care,” the bench added. The court said, “Though we acknowledge the fact that government alone cannot fight with its available resources and needs people’s cooperation and active participation of various other non-government bodies, but those in power must shun the attitude of ‘my way or no way’ and should welcome suggestions from all the quarters.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-panchayat-polls-hc-seeks-sec-s-explanation-over-deaths-covid-violations-101619550632682.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Panchkula reserves Sector-20 crematorium for Covid deaths||Amid a surge in deaths due to coronavirus, the Panckula municipal corporation (MC) has set aside Sector-20 crematorium exclusively for the disposal of bodies of Covid victims.As per the data, as many as 90 Covid victims were cremated here between April 1 and 27. Of these 47 were Panchkula residents.“Against one to two Covid victims being cremated per day last year, the number has now gone up to 13 in a day. At times, the figure is much more,” said an official at the crematorium, which has 15 sheds with one being non-functional.Earlier, only two sheds were reserved for cremating virus victims, but from the past three to four days, all sheds have been dedicated for the purpose, the official said adding, “Today, we disposed of 13 bodies.”The MC has deputed three sanitary workers to help with the last rites of the victims. “Cremation of one body takes five to six hours. Though we have kept additional sheds for Covid victims, an electric crematorium will be of great help,” he said.Gas-based crematorium soon Meanwhile, mayor Kulbhushan Goyal on Tuesday said that a gas-based crematorium will be opened for free of cost cremation of Covid victims.On a visit to the Sector 20 cremation ground, Goyal informed that the proposed crematorium will be made operational within a day or two.“This will be Panhckula’s first gas-based crematorium where people dying of Covid-19 will be cremated for free,” the mayor said adding, “Up to six bodies can be cremated at the facility in a day.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/panchkula-reserves-sector-20-crematorium-for-covid-deaths-101619550631971.html

28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab, Chandigarh slug it out over oxygen quota||As most state and UT governments are scrambling to maintain a steady supply of medical oxygen for Covid-19 patients, Punjab and Chandigarh were recently found jostling over the quota of the life-saving gas.The two governments clashed over the sanctioning and supply of 20 metric tonnes (MT) of oxygen while trying to convince the Centre on who should get it.The dispute started when the Union government allocated 20 MT of liquid oxygen to Chandigarh-run hospitals through Inox plant in Barotiwala, Himachal Pradesh.“Punjab requested the Centre to allocate the oxygen quota to the state government rather than Chandigarh. The Centre even accented to the same,” said a senior UT official not wanting to be named.On this, the Chandigarh administration raised an objection with the central government insisting that the quota should be given to the UT.“Both Punjab and Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) were getting oxygen from a supplier in Dehradun. As there was some disruption in this supply, Punjab insisted that as per its requirement, it should be given the Chandigarh quota. It was under the impression that the 20 MT quota granted to Chandigarh also included PGIMER’s share,” said the UT official.The UT then again approached the Centre. “We informed the Centre that our requirement is 40 MT and we need the sanctioned quota of 20 MT. We also clarified to Punjab that the allocated 20 MT does not include PGIMER’s share, which is independently getting its oxygen supply,” the official added.When contacted, the UT adviser Manoj Parida confirmed the dispute. “We have now sorted out the issue, and the Centre has reassigned the 20 MT oxygen quota to Chandigarh,” he said.Parida also assured that oxygen available in city hospitals was sufficient to deal with the surge. Three oxygen plants have been commissioned at Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32; GMCH, Sector 48; and Government Multi-Specialty Hospital, Sector 16 – which will fulfil 50% of their requirement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-chandigarh-slug-it-out-over-oxygen-quota-101619550571988.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||Longer night curfew, lockdown on the cards in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh authorities are “actively considering” extending the night curfew in the city on the lines of Punjab and Haryana, and are also open to a longer lockdown in the coming days, said a top source in the administration on Tuesday. “This will bring uniformity and facilitate greater coordination between the three administrations in the tricity,” said the official, while adding that the decision on the night curfew extension is likely to be taken within a day or two.The administration had first imposed the night curfew on April 6, from 10pm to 5am. The timings were revised to 9pm-5am on April 23, and now, the administration is likely to revise them further to 6pm-5am. “There is no alternative now, but to impose stricter restrictions in the city with a sharp increase in the positive cases in the past one week,” said the official, who did not wish to be named. The Punjab government had announced fresh restrictions on movement on Monday, extending the night curfew by two hours, from 6pm to 5am, and ordering a strict weekend lockdown. Earlier, Haryana had also directed the closure of non-essential shops from 6pm.  “We will be discussing the imposition of longer lockdown and weekend lockdown with the central government, and also deliberate upon it in the Covid war room meeting,” said the official. The UT officials, it is learnt, are also in talks with their Punjab and Haryana counterparts for a pan-tricity lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/longer-night-curfew-lockdown-on-the-cards-in-chandigarh-101619550513864.html

28-04-2021||Mumbai||HC takes note of chaos at crematoriums, calls for a report from state||The Bombay high court (HC) on Tuesday directed the Maharashtra government to provide a status report on crematoriums and morgues across the state, after being informed that the situation at cremation centres was chaotic. It was also brought to the notice of the court that the crematoriums were insufficient to deal with a large number of bodies of Covid victims being brought for a funeral.The court also questioned the centre regarding the lax surveillance as a result of which private persons – a member of Parliament (MP) from Ahmednagar managed to get stock of life-saving drugs like Remdesivir from a pharmaceutical company in Delhi, while the SOPs entail pharma companies to provide its manufactured stock directly to the states. A division bench of chief justice Dipankar Datta and justice Girish Kulkarni, while hearing the public interest litigation (PIL) filed by advocate Sneha Marjadi, said that though the PIL was originally scheduled to be heard on May 4 it was listed on Tuesday to ascertain the progress and compliance of its orders on April 22. The PIL sought directions to the state, Centre and civic authorities against the mismanagement of the second wave of Covid-19. Advocates Simil Purohit and Arshil Shah for the petitioner informed the court that though the BMC had been updating data on the number of Covid-19 positive cases the helpline for the availability of Covid-19 beds in the hospital was not operational. The BMC through senior counsel Anil Sakhare however disagreed and said that the helpline number was very much functional. The bench then directed the advocates to call helpline number 1916 to verify the claims of BMC. After the calls were answered, the bench sought to know how best the BMC could make known the vacancy of beds so that it would be immediately reflected on the dashboard on the BMC portal. When the petitioners’ advocates drew attention to the issue of dead body management and sought directions to augment the existing infrastructure to cope with a large number of bodies of Covid-19 victims being brought for the funeral the court directed the state government to immediately ask all district collectors to ensure effective dead-body management and have synchronized system for crematoriums. The court then observed that in some crematorium gas furnaces were not in order and relatives of deceased Covid-19 patients faced various issues, the court directed the state government to inform it on measures taken by authorities to improve the condition of crematoriums and also sought the status of morgues in the state. The court also took note of the report that an MP from Ahmednagar had got 10,000 vials of Remdesivir to distribute locally while the state was the sole implementing authority for distributing the life-saving drug. The bench observed that the Aurangabad bench had taken cognizance of the report on April 26 it had not passed any specific order on it.Aurangabad bench had in its order had stated: “Meantime, respondent authorities be at liberty to take effective steps, as they would have taken in the event of such eventuality and do what a call of duty demands them to do.” In light of this, the bench asked the state, “How can 10,000 vials be made available by airlifting them from Delhi by a chartered plane? Would it not amount to private distribution by the person? Delhi itself is in crisis.” The court added that if it found further instances where pharmaceutical companies were providing Remdesivir directly to private individuals, it would pass an injunction against the duo. “We want drugs to reach everyone who is needy and should not be only in the hands of a few,” added the bench and posted the PIL for further hearing on April 29.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-takes-note-of-chaos-at-crematoriums-calls-for-a-report-from-state-101619550511457.html

This is the property of the community and the SGPC cannot sell it or let anyone acquire it forcibly. The CM has assured us that the land will not be acquired at any cost,” Kaur said. Kaur added that the issue of the solar system being installed at Golden Temple Complex has also been taken up with the Punjab CM. “The SGPC wants to install a 2.2 megawatt (MW) solar system in collaboration with the Sikh sangat. Due to lack of space, the system will be installed at the Gurdwara Satlani Sahib. We have appealed to the CM for clearance,” she said.“The CM was also asked to immediately release ₹43 crore scholarship funds for Scheduled Caste (SC) students enroled in SGPC’s educational institutions. The balance of 2017-2019 has not been released. We are struggling to pay salaries,” Kaur added. Kaur also asked the CM to issue instructions for passing the construction plans of new sarais (inn) for the sangat arriving at the Golden Temple. She added that the CM was also asked to hand over the Bassi Pathana Jail in Fatehgarh Sahib district to the SGPC and allow renovation of the historic Diwan Todar Mal’s Haweli (mansion). “Sri Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji, the 9th Guru, was kept in Bassi Pathana Jail and it must be preserved with its heritage intact,” she added.Kaur said the SGPC has invited Punjab chief minister Captain Amarinder Singh to the function being organised at Gurdwara Guru Ke Mehal in Amritsar on May 1 to mark the 400th birth anniversary of ninth Guru.

28-04-2021||Mumbai||State records highest one-day Covid toll of 895||After a significant drop in daily Covid-19 cases (48,700) on Monday, the daily caseload went up again to 66,358 on Tuesday, although authorities said the state has reached its peak and a downward trend is expected soon. The state, however, reported its highest one-day spike in deaths of 895, which took the toll to 66,179. The state cabinet is likely to take a decision on extending the existing lockdown, which is till May 1, further. The state has also sought an expression of interest from global supplies for oxygen, Remdesivir and oxygen concentrators. Mumbai continued to see a drop in cases on the second day in a row, logging 3,999 cases, although the testing was lower at a little over 30,000. The city has reported less than 4,000 cases over last two days, after clocking more than 5,000 cases continuously for more than a month since March 24, when it reported 5,190 cases. The city’s case tally stands at 635,483 and toll at 12,920. “The drop in state’s cases on Monday was a ‘weekend effect’, as the number of cases and their reporting goes down on weekends. They went up on Tuesday, but have not crossed the average mark of daily caseload, which has been hovering around 66,000. We can easily say the Covid-19 case trend has stabilised,” a health department official said. Nashik outstripped other districts in daily caseload, reporting 12,436 cases and 69 deaths on Tuesday. Pune district logged 9,078 cases and 80 deaths, 6,895 cases and 63 deaths in Nagpur, 1,840 cases and 8 deaths in Chandrapur and 1,562 cases and 18 deaths in Sangli. Aurangabad district added highest 162 deaths on Tuesday, although the new cases logged were 1,468. The state has 672,434 active cases as on Tuesday, down from 699,858 on April 22. Pune has highest active patients (104,561), followed by Nagpur (75,219), Thane (72,302) and Mumbai (68,603). Amid the rise, the state is expected to extend the ongoing complete lockdown at least by a week. “Task force members, officials from health and other departments are of the opinion that it should be extended at least by a week. They feel it would help in reducing the cases and relieving the stress on health infrastructure. The decision is expected to be taken in state cabinet on Wednesday,” an official from Mantralaya said. State health authorities say that the districts like Nashik, Nagpur and Ahmednagar will follow the trend witnessed in Mumbai, MMR and Pune and stabilise in the next few days. The high number of deaths is expected to continue for the next few days. “The rise in the death number is always seen a couple of weeks after the spike in the cases begin,” said an official from the health department. Maharashtra public health minister Rajesh Tope said they expect the cases to decline in coming days. “From daily caseload hovering around 65,000, it dropped to 48,700 on Monday. The number of patients discharged was more than the new cases. It has resulted in the improvement in the recovery rate from 81% to 83.5%,” he said. Dr Lancelot Pinto, an epidemiologist from Hinduja Hospital, said the lockdown has helped in bringing down the cases and the trend is likely to continue. “Maharashtra is witnessing the downward trend early than that anticipated at national level, because the second wave hit Mumbai and Maharashtra first. Similar trend was witnessed during the first wave too. We can avoid the spikes in cases by adapting mass vaccination drive. However, the mortality rate is expected to continue for a week or two as it always lag behind the cases by 2-3 weeks,” he said. Prof Manindra Agarwal who was associated with the Covid-19 research in IIT Kanpur said that Mumbai is past its peak. While Pune and even state has reached its peak, Nagpur will reach its peak in next two days. “Pune and Maharashtra saw erratic trend of cases with ups and down, but it was very steady curve for Mumbai. Cities like Nashik and Nagpur are still reporting high cases, but they will reach their peak in couple of days,” he said. Tope said that the state government has called for supply from international market for 25000 metric tonnes of liquid oxygen, 10 lakh vials of Remdesivir, 40,000 oxygen concentrators and oxygen tanks for the districts. “The expression of interest has been called for by relaxing stringent conditions. We expect the response in three days. The procurement will help tide over the shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir and ramp up the health infrastructure,” he said. The test positivity rate (TPR) too has declined over the last one week to 23.51% despite the significant rise in the tests at the daily average of 2,73,283 between April 21 and 27. Against 1913001 tests during this period, the state reported 449726 cases. The positivity rate in the earlier two weeks (April 14-20 and April 7-13) was 24.76% and 24.71% respectively. The daily testings in the state have been stepped up gradually from 2,34,652 during April 7-13 to 2,54,526 during April 14-20 and 2,73,283 in the week ended on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/state-records-highest-one-day-covid-toll-of-895-101619550332915.html

The premier biological research institute of the country will not only sequence the genome and list the number of variants, but will also map behavioural patterns of each strain based on the health issues faced by the patients and the treatment provided. Genome sequencing is an exercise to study changes in the structure of the virus over time. A combination of changes in the ribonucleic acid of the virus can give birth to a new variant. CSIR-IGIB will collect 100 samples from each district and send them to the National Centre for Cell Science (NCCS), Pune and CSIR-IGIB, Faridabad for genome sequencing. It will start in 10 districts, where samples will be collected for a month (100 samples from each district), followed by another 10 districts the next month. This will go on until all 36 districts in the state are covered. The study will be completed in four months, officials said. The aim is to help the state identify the number of active strains in Maharashtra, their effect on human bodies and determine the change in treatment protocol or public health strategies required to contain the spread, officials said. Chief secretary Sitaram Kunte confirmed that a memorandum of understanding has been signed between the state medical education department and CSIR-IGIB to start the project. “CSIR-IGIB will collect around 100 samples from each of the districts. It will also take clinical data of the treatment prescribed to each patient and their response to the treatment. The research organization will list the number of variants found during the genome sequencing process and also map their patterns that include how they affected the human body or which part of the body, etc. It will also help ascertain if there are different variants infecting citizens in different regions of the state,” Kunte said. Among the worst-hit states, Maharashtra is yet unaware of the number of strains and their behaviour that may have led to the surge in cases. The National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) recently confirmed the presence of a double mutant variant in the tested samples, but also said the data was not enough to attribute the surge to it, officials said. “The double mutant variant has been found in 206 samples in Maharashtra. It is high in Nagpur, at 20% of the samples, but there is not enough data to correlate it with the nature of the surge,” NCDC said on April 14. At 24%, the double mutation virus – now classified as B.1.617 – was the most common in the samples sequenced in the 60 days prior to April 2. The variant was first detected on October 5 and was relatively obscure till it was found in increasing number of samples from January, the India situation report on outbreak.info showed. On April 1, it accounted for 80% of all analysed genome sequences of mutant variants sent by India to the global repository GISAID. B.1.617 was first found in a large number of samples in Maharashtra, the first hot spot of the second wave of infections, which, till April 7, added more than half the new cases being recorded in the country. Maharashtra has so far reported around 4,400,000 cases and average daily cases have been around 59,000 a day this month. It has also reported maximum casualties and the tally has reached around 66,000. Dr Shashank Joshi, who is handling responsibility for coordination of the project, said they know there are variants of concern, but to correlate this we have to match the clinical data such as symptoms, age etc. with the genetic data. “We need to collect more data to say the current variants of concern are responsible for the current circumstances. We will be collecting district-wise random samples every week in a systematic way. These samples will be sent to the NCCS, Pune laboratory and IGIB laboratory, Faridabad and then the data will be used to determine district-wise strategies,” Dr Joshi, who is also a member of a state appointed task force for the clinical management of critical patients, said. Currently, 13-14 districts in Maharashtra are badly hit with the pandemic. “They are now in the phase of recovery, but there are variants of concern operating in each district. This independent survey will give us a deep understanding of what is happening. It will also give us insights on our public health strategies or treatment strategies whether they need to be modified,” he clarified. Dr Anurag Agrawal, director, CSIR-IGIB, said he would comment only after commencement of the project. Saurabh Vijay, secretary of state’s medical education department, said the study is necessary to take necessary steps in advance. “It is natural behavior of the virus to mutate. In such a scenario, we need to understand at least what is happening with the changing behaviour of the virus so that we can be better prepared,” he said. The ministry of health and family welfare, in its statement issued on March 24, said that 771 of the 10,787 samples that were sequenced were found to have the variants of concern (VOC). The Centre last month said that three known VOCs were also found in Maharashtra. The Centre revealed 56 of these were B.1.1.7, five B.1.351 and one P.1. State health minister Rajesh Tope recently said 1,100 samples have been collected from Maharashtra as part of regular surveillance of genome variations and of them, 500 samples have been examined. “We have sought a detailed report from the Centre, but were informed that it will be made available only at the end of the research,” Tope said to a news daily??? In another release issued on April 16, the ministry also said the states were advised to send samples of genome sequencing along with clinical data of positive patients, but many states are not doing so. A consortium of 10 national laboratories called — Indian SARS-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics (INSACOG) — was formed in December 2020 to carry out genome sequencing of circulating viruses and correlate the findings with other trends. “The INSACOG guidelines were shared with states. It would have helped INSACOG discover other variants of concern. However, several states, including Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan and Kerala have not shared such data, although others, including Punjab and Delhi have,” it stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/covid19-csir-igib-to-study-4-000-maharashtra-samples-for-genome-sequencing-101619550211314.html
28-04-2021||Mumbai||HC deplores state govt’s failure to procure more Remdesivir vials||The Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court on Tuesday expressed exasperation at the failure of the state to provide sufficient Remdesivir vials to Nagpur and adjoining districts even though the Central Committee had allocated nearly 4.35 lakh vials for 10 days. When the state argued the Centre had not sent vials as per the state-wise chart, the HC bench admonished the state for not pursuing it with the Centre. The next hearing has been scheduled on April 29.A division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote, while hearing the suo motu public interest litigation, was informed that on April 24, following its April 23 directions to the state to seek allocation of more Remdesivir injections for 10 days from April 21 to 30 in view of the shortage being faced by Maharashtra, the Central committee had revised the allocation list. The committee had increased the allocation to 4.35 lakh vials for the period. The central committee order dated April 24 required the state to take certain steps and place its supply order with the manufacturer. However, advocate S P Bhandarkar, amicus curiae, submitted that despite orders from the bench the shortage persisted and even oxygen and beds for the growing number of Covid-19 patients were in short supply. The government pleader for the state informed the bench that nodal officer for the state of Maharashtra has been appointed and he was coordinating with other nodal officers and manufacturers. The bench then asked the nodal officer to file an affidavit to place on record steps in pursuance of April 24 central government order.The bench questioned why private pharmacists in Vidarbha were allowed to directly place orders with manufacturers. The state further informed that apart from sourcing Remdesivir and other life-saving drugs locally, it was also planning to import from Bangladesh, Singapore, Hong Kong etc and permission was sought from the Centre and a response was awaited.On being informed of Covid care centres not making Remdesivir available for needy patients, the court directed the district collector Nagpur and NMC to carry out individual checks at different hospitals. The bench also directed the DC Nagpur to set up control room of 30-40 officials on 8 hour shifts to oversee allocation of beds and oxygen cylinders. The bench also sought to know why the manufacturing plants around Nagpur had not supplied oxygen. The bench was then told that the collector of Nagpur had messages that from Wednesday Nagpur would get 110- 130 MT oxygen from Bhilai Steel Plant, as per earlier order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/hc-deplores-state-govt-s-failure-to-procure-more-remdesivir-vials-101619550151312.html

Members of the Covid task force were also present in the meeting, wherein, all private hospitals have been asked to appoint one person in each hospital to ensure the smooth functioning of all safety norms and continuous supply of electricity and oxygen. “Hospitals should be in touch with Thane Municipal Corporation’s (TMC) oxygen cell and ensure there is enough supply of oxygen at all times. We have to ensure there are no untoward incidents caused due to any lapses. Hence, we are putting into place certain rules like appointing an officer for this purpose,” said Vipin Sharma, TMC commissioner.Urban development minister, Eknath Shinde has ordered a structural, fire and oxygen audit of all hospitals, private and government, within the Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR). Moreover, instructions have been given to deploy fire engines outside every Covid centre to prevent accidents. In every civic body, the assistant commissioner and the ward officer will be responsible for monitoring the oxygen supply in private hospitals. Similarly, Navi Mumbai Municipal Corporation (NMMC) has set up a war room for oxygen supply, intending to not inconvenience the patients’ family. A team of six officials led by deputy municipal commissioner Babasaheb Rajale has been deployed. This team will monitor the oxygen reserve in every government as well as private facilities every three hours.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/appoint-staff-to-ensure-oxygen-supply-in-hospitals-is-constant-tmc-101619550091941.html
28-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra seeks 120mn doses for 18+||The Maharashtra government has sought 120 million Covid-19 doses from the two Indian vaccine manufacturing companies for the inoculation of 57.1 million citizens in the 18-44 age category. With the availability of vaccines a challenge, there is a question mark over the vaccination drive for those in the 18-44 age group from May 1. The state government will allow vaccination for this group only by appointment on Cowin app. The Maharashtra government, meanwhile, is scheduled to decide on free vaccination in the state cabinet meeting on Wednesday. In a related development, the state on Tuesday crossed the landmark of administering 15 million vaccine doses, State public health minister Rajesh Tope said the state wrote to the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech on April 26, but so far, the companies have not responded. He added that Serum Institute, which manufacturers Covishield shots, has conveyed that they cannot commit to orders before May 20. “Availability [of vaccines] is the biggest challenge. Even if we are ready to spend, there is no stock available. We have written to Serum and Bharat Biotech but so far, they have not responded. We have sought 12 crore vaccines, asked them the delivery schedule, and the rates. Covishield will not be available before May 20. All states will face this question on how to start vaccination from May 1 if there is no vaccine available,” Tope said.Besides the challenge of vaccine availability, the state cabinet is expected to discuss invitation of global tenders to procure vaccine for foreign manufacturers in its meeting on Wednesday. Senior officials said that the state would need consent from the Centre to import. One option that is being considered, officials said, is to invite expression of interest and not tender to import vaccine. “We can gauge the schedule and rates through an expression of interest,” an official said requesting anonymity.Maharashtra deputy chief minister and finance minister Ajit Pawar said that they do not think the Centre would deny permission to import vaccines given that Indian manufacturers cannot match the pace of demand. “We will discuss details on floating global tenders for vaccine. After I made the statement [earlier] about importing we were asked how can we float tenders without a go-ahead from the Centre. If Indian manufacturers—Bharat Biotech and Serum—are unable to provide, then importing is an option and I do not think that the Centre will deny the permission,” Pawar said.He also added that the proposal to provide free vaccination will be discussed in the cabinet meeting. “The proposal [for free vaccines] will come up in the cabinet, I have signed it and now the file is with the CM for his signature. The proposal will be discussed tomorrow [Wednesday] in the cabinet; all the cabinet ministers will give their opinions. A decision in the interest of the people that decision will be made and announced by the chief minister.”When asked about the financial burden on the state government if it decides to provide free vaccines, Pawar said, “The government will take a decision on it tomorrow (Wednesday). Actually, it is the responsibility of the Centre government to vaccinate all the people. But, the Centre’s stand on it is not clear and we are following it up with the Centre on the vaccination of people in the age group of 18 to 44. If the time comes, the state government will take decision in the interest of the people.” It is estimated to cost ₹7,500 crore for the free vaccination of the 18-44 category, Tope had told HT.Tope added that people in the 18-44 category should not rush to the vaccination centres unless an appointment is confirmed on the Cowin app. He reiterated that since there is no vaccine, there is a question mark over the drive itself.“The vaccination for 18-44 category will only happen through the Cowin app. Nobody can go directly to the centre for vaccination. Only after booking an appointment online, one can go to the centre for vaccination. So, do not throng at the centers. As of now, vaccines are not available. Even if we want to start it, manufacturers cannot provide us. There is a hurdle till manufacturers provide the vaccine so till then nobody should rush to the centers. There is a question mark over the drive starting on May 1 because of availability,” Tope said.The health minister added that the state expects the Centre to intervene to bring down the prices quoted by the two Indian manufacturers to supply shots to the state governments. Serum Institute has announced a price of Rs400 per dose for state governments and Rs600 per dose for private hospitals. The Hyderabad-based Bharat Biotech has fixed the price of its Covid-19 vaccine, Covaxin, at Rs600 per dose for state governments and at Rs1,200 per dose for private hospitals. “We expect the Government of India to intervene and help reduce the rates of vaccines so that it does not burden the state exchequer,” Tope said.Maharashtra, on Tuesday, administered 15 million Covid-19 vaccine jab to its citizens. The landmark came a day after the state vaccinated over 500,000 beneficiaries--its highest in one day. Maharashtra tops the list of states with by administering 15 million doses since the drive commence on January 16. Health minister Rajesh Tope and deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar lauded the efforts of the healthcare workers. Pawar in a tweet said, “The invaluable contribution of our healthcare workers, officials & social organisations has resulted in the State completing a record of 1.5 cr vaccination! With our combined efforts we shall continue to vaccinate more & more people in future too.” Tope said that the “milestone” was crossed and now the state’s target is to vaccinate 800,000 people in a day.On the lack of vaccines, a war of words broke out between the Maharashtra Vikas Aghadi and opposition Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Sachin Sawant, Congress spokesperson, targeted prime minister over the lack of availability, saying what is the strategy of the Centre. “If Serum tells @OfficeofUT ji that it can not supply vaccine till 20th May as all stock is booked by Modi govt. It has put vaccination for age group 18-44 under question mark We can’t simply discuss lack of vaccines after so many mnths of corona.Modi ji, Whr is ur strategy? (sic)”. Sawant further stated that the Centre restricted the supply to two companies and put the onus on State governments to procure vaccines for 18-44 age group.BJP, meanwhile, asked the clear the doubts of people over the vaccination drive from May 1. Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said that the state government should put out list of the vaccination centers in advance to avoid crowding. “Considering the large number of people in the age category, the state should give list of centres in the urban areas and in the districts. Additional vaccination centres should be made and their locations should be announced. The State should also announce whether people can walk-in to the centres or they need prior appointment,” Upadhye asked in a statement.The MVA and BJP also battled over the supply of stock from the Centre for the vaccination of people over age 45. As Maharashtra went past 15 million mark in total inoculated beneficiaries on Tuesday, PWD minister Ashok Chavan said that the state has the capacity to vaccinate 600,000 people daily. “Had adequate vaccines been provided, Maharashtra would have crossed 20 million mark by now. Today, one out of six people in Maharashtra would have been vaccinated,” Chavan said in a tweet.Responding to it, Upadhye said, “Maharashtra has the capacity but due to its negative politics it has averaged 200,000 vaccinations per day. The truth is that the Centre is providing all the vaccines, but the planning is poor. What is the plan for vaccination of people between 18 and 44? Will it be free? How many vaccines have been ordered?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-seeks-120mn-doses-for-18-101619550091327.html
28-04-2021||Other||Oxygen shortage: 7 patients shifted from Thane’s Diya Hospital||Seven patients had to be shifted from Diya Hospital in Waghbil to Universal Hospital in Gokul Nagar due to a shortage of oxygen. Despite Universal Hospital being a non-Covid facility, permission was granted for the same by the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) at the eleventh hour.Moreover, Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) provided five jumbo cylinder to Diya Hospital. The hospital raised an alarm when it was depleting its supply and asked the relatives of the seven patients admitted in the hospital to be shifted elsewhere. Dr Harish Kedar, a partner with Diya Hospital, said, “There are seven patients in the ICU, all of them are on oxygen support. We realised about the depleting oxygen supply at 4pm and contacted the vendor. But as there was no assurance of supply. We then informed the TMC.”Although TMC made provision for 20 jumbo cylinders late on Tuesday evening and gave a backup too for these patients, as a precautionary measure the hospital shifted the patients to a different hospital around 8pm.This saved the seven patients and their relatives a lot of anxiety and nightmare of shifting hospitals at the last moment. One of the seven patients had tested negative but still required oxygen for breathing assistance, she was also moved to Universal Hospital. Officials of the TMC rushed to a private vendor at Turbhe who provided oxygen cylinders. Shankar Patole, Assistant Municipal Commissioner, TMC said, “If hospitals inform us at the eleventh hour it is very difficult to make provisions for the supply; in this instance, the said hospital’s vendor could not continue the supply of oxygen. Hospitals should ensure that there is confirmed provision of oxygen for at least next 24-48 hours.” He added, “When we come to know of a shortage, we need to coordinate, make arrangements for the supply and the cylinders have to reach the hospital as well, all of this requires time. We have currently provided 25 jumbo cylinders to Diya Hospital. Moreover, two dura cylinders will also be given, to be kept as a standby in case of an emergency.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-shortage-7-patients-shifted-from-thane-s-diya-hospital-101619550032433.html
28-04-2021||Mumbai||Poll rallies led to Covid spread, Sena alleges; BJP blames Maharashtra govt for its failure||Citing the Madras high court’s (HC) observations that Election Commission (EC) is responsible for the Covid-19 surge, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut said that Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) gathered people in poll-bound states for campaigning, who got infected and spread it elsewhere in the country. The Sena leader added that while Madras HC said EC should face murder charges, the Centre is planning to reward the former Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) by appointing him a governor. Raut further said that the Centre should take the Madras HC’s remarks seriously. The Madras HC on Monday came down heavily on the EC for “not stopping political parties” from violating Covid-19 protocols during their campaign rallies for Assembly polls in four states and a Union territory over the last month. It further said that murder charges should probably be put on the panel for being “the only institution responsible for the situation that we are in today”.Speaking to reporters in Mumbai, Raut said, “A few senior BJP leaders in Delhi were preaching to us that the Covid has nothing to do with the elections. They were saying that Covid cases were rising in states like Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh where there were no elections. This was not correct. The people from across the country were mobilised in West Bengal for campaigning and returned to their states which led to a surge in Covid cases,” he added.Countering the allegation, Maharashtra BJP chief spokesperson Keshav Upadhye said, “Maharashtra government has failed on all counts including tackling the Covid outbreak in the state. The Shiv Sena and other two parties daily come up with different ideas to blame the Centre for their failure.”Raut added that even though the court has blamed the EC, the Centre is planning to give former CEC Sunil Arora, who is tipped to be the next governor of Goa, a “return gift”. He said, “The Madras HC said that the EC should be held responsible [for spreading the virus]. PM Narendra Modi, who has now been taking the Covid seriously, will certainly take the Madras HC’s remarks seriously. But I have heard in the last few days that the government is planning to reward the retired election commissioner, under whose tenure the elections were held, by appointing him as a governor. However, we trust Prime Minister Narendra Modi ji.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/poll-rallies-led-to-covid-spread-sena-alleges-bjp-blames-maharashtra-govt-for-its-failure-101619549851329.html

Currently, the city has 56 vaccination centres including private and government centres; however, only around 40 are functional regularly due to the shortage of vaccines. Preparations are in place for two jumbo centres; one will be set up at Kausa stadium and the other at Vartak Nagar. “We will be following the same model as BKC and NESCO facilities. It will help in accommodating a large number of people and in conducting vaccination drive for more beneficiaries. Moreover, we have shortlisted a few more private hospitals that can partake in the vaccination process. As of now, the state government directives have mentioned the involvement of private hospitals for vaccination from May 1 onwards. So preparations are also on those lines, however, considering the shortage of vaccines we are not sure how much of these can be possible. We have all the infrastructure in place and even now if we get the desired number of vaccines we can begin with the vaccination process,” said Khushboo Tawri, medical officer, TMC.Currently, TMC has 56 vaccination centres including 13 private hospitals, with the capacity to conduct 10,000 vaccinations daily. However, only around 40 centres are operational regularly due to the shortage of vaccines.

28-04-2021||Other||In 2nd covid wave, 25% of deaths reported from Jalandhar, Hoshiarpur||For the past two months, the two Doaba districts of Jalandhar and Hoshiarpur have reported around 25% of Punjab’s 2,716 deaths due to covid-19, data with the state health department shows. From Feb 26 to April 26, Jalandhar recorded 351 deaths, while Hoshiarpur reported 338 deaths for a total of 689. Amritsar saw 303 deaths and Ludhiana 283. After a quick analysis of this data, the Punjab health department has sent a team to Hoshiarpur to study the other contributing causes of these deaths, as the district has a relatively low population. Punjab reported 1,64,362 new positive cases, with 43,348 (25%) cases coming from Doaba region. Overall, Jalandhar has seen 1,054 deaths; Hoshiarpur (704); Amritsar (896); Patiala (735), while Ludhiana has 1,309 highest in the state till April 26. From March 25-April 26, Amritsar has recorded the most deaths at 245; Hoshiarpur (222); Ludhiana (211); Patiala (178) and Jalandhar 176. Hoshiarpur, Jalandhar, Kapurthala and Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar have also doubled their case count since February. The health department believes that UK strain of Covid-19 has led to the steep rise in active cases in Punjab. Over 80% of samples of Covid positive people sent for genome sequencing to the Pune laboratory in March were found having the UK strain. In Jalandhar, the UK strain had mainly hit Phillaur and Nurmahal towns that reported a high number of cases. In Hoshiarpur, 31 cases of the UK strain were detected. State nodal officer for Covid-19, Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said, “The high number of deaths in Hoshiarpur is a concern and we have been studying the situation of the district. In Dasuya and Hoshiarpur hospitals, patients refused to be treated in hospitals outside the district for level-3 care. Late reporting of patients was another reason for higher number of deaths.” Hoshiarpur civil surgeon Dr Ranjit Singh said level-3 treatment had now been started in Hoshiarpur and private hospitals had also been roped in. Jalandhar district family welfare officer Dr Raman Gupta claimed late reporting of patients led to the deaths and co-morbities was also a factor. “Now, however, we are also seeing deaths of pregnant women,” he said, adding that the new strains of the virus, including the UK one, has been very infectious.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/in-2nd-covid-wave-25-of-deaths-reported-from-jalandhar-hoshiarpur-101619549673161.html

While lockdown is considered to be a major reason, there was a dip in the testing rate by 12%. During the surge, the average number of per day cases was 1,200 with the highest on April 4 with 1,536 cases. The number of tests conducted, including both RT-PCR and antigen, during the same time was around 8,000 daily. Since April 18, the number of cases has been below 1,000. NMMC has been reporting around 700 cases daily on average. The minimum number of cases recorded was 503 on April 26. However, the testing has gone down to 7,000 per day. NMMC commissioner Abhijit Banagar said, “The RT-PCR testing that was being done at private labs has gone down, due to which, the average number of daily testing has also gone down. In a way, it is a good sign that people are not panicking and rushing to do RT-PCR tests and are doing the same as per the need. Our lab has a capacity of conducting 3,000 tests which we manage to stretch to 3,500.” Bangar added that lockdown has played a major role in the decrease in cases. An officer from NMMC requesting anonymity said, “As per the pattern observed in other states, the surge in cases is quick, however, the decrease too is equally fast. We had reached the peak in early April and the cases are now coming down as per the pattern seen elsewhere.” According to activist Anarjit Chouhan, “Even as the cases might have come to 500 per day, there was a time when we had only 50 to 55 cases per day. So definitely, this not the best that the corporation can do. Also, I am sceptical regarding the death rate being recorded by NMMC. The deaths might be much higher than those reported.” While the mortality rate from April 1 to April 17 was 0.04%, it went up to 0.53% from April 18 to April 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/new-cases-in-navi-mumbai-down-by-42-nmmc-credits-lockdown-101619549491262.html
28-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: Vaccine for 18-44 age group at private centres only||To prevent overcrowding at Covid-19 vaccination centres in the city, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) has decided that starting May 1, the government and civic vaccination centres will vaccinate only citizens over 45 years of age, while those in the 18 to 44 years age group will be vaccinated at private hospitals. Further, vaccination for them will be done only through appointments, and no walk-in vaccination will be allowed. However, the decision on who will have to pay and who would get the vaccine for free will be decided by the state government.According to the civic body, the citizens in 45 years and above age group will be vaccinated at 63 government and BMC-run vaccination centres and can also opt for private vaccination centres. Those in the 18-44 age group will have to go to 73 private hospital-run vaccination centres.The civic body is also in the process to increase the vaccination centres from the current 134 to 389 to cater to the growing number of people to be vaccinated. The new arrangement for different centres for different age groups may change at a later stage, said civic officials. The vaccination for the age group between 18 to 44 is likely to kick off from Saturday.The BMC, on Tuesday, also announced that it is in touch with vaccine manufacturers directly to procure vaccine doses for the city.On Tuesday, the single-day highest 72,606 citizens were vaccinated in the city.Meanwhile, municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal on Tuesday directed civic officials to identify locations for additional 227 vaccination centres in the city. The above decisions were taken by Chahal in a video conferencing meeting with health department officials and all 24 ward officials in the city.The 227 additional vaccine centres can be local health posts of the BMC, nursing homes, private hospitals, community/marriage and party halls. All the ward officials are directed to be prepared with the list of such locations in the next two days. Chahal has also directed that these centres should have tie-up with local hospitals nearby where citizens will be rushed in case of any adverse effect, said civic officials.However, a decision on whether citizens between 18 to 45 years of age will have to pay up for the vaccination or not will be decided by the state government, post a decision on pricing. The BMC official added, “We have been directed to sign a memorandum of understanding (MOU)’s with nursing homes and hospitals nearby the vaccination centres. This means if we have a vaccination centre in our health post or say marriage hall, the MOU will cover the individual who may require hospitalisation post-vaccination. The hospital or nursing home should be located nearby the vaccination, and the individual reporting adverse effect post-vaccination will be rushed there.”A BMC official who attended the meeting said, “The plan, for now, is to vaccinate 18 to 44 years of age group only at private vaccination centres based on appointments. This arrangement will remain for now to ensure there is no crowding at vaccination centres. In the coming days, we will add 26 private vaccination centres that will take the count to 99.”Currently, the city has around 136 vaccination centres including 63 run by the civic body and government as 73 by private hospitals. The civic body will add 227 more centres (one centre in each electoral ward) and allow 26 more at private hospitals, which would mean there will be 389 vaccination centres in the city.The civic body aims to start around 500 vaccination centres in the city.Mumbai Mayor Kishori Pednekar had told HT last week, “We are planning to have nearly 500 centres in the city for vaccination, and the same will be implemented with the help of corporators.”The BMC has also appealed to housing societies and corporate offices to tie up with private hospitals and get vaccinated in bulk once the stock arrives, BMC said in a statement.The BMC in its statement added that in the coming days additional 26 hospitals will be added to the list taking the total number of private vaccination centres from 73 to 99. Also, the BMC is going to set up a cold storage facility for the storage of vaccine doses in Andheri that will supply to the western suburbs. Currently, Kanjurmarg cold storage facility can store 12 million vaccine doses. Additionally, there is a storage facility for storing vaccine doses in Dadar for the island city and central Mumbai.According to BMC officials, it will take a call on whether to float global bids and procure vaccine doses directly from the state government once the state issues guidelines on the same. It is in touch with the two manufacturers namely Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech who are currently authorised to manufacture Covid-19 vaccines in India.Meanwhile, on Tuesday 72,606 citizens were vaccinated of which 2,484 were health care workers, 3,720 were frontline workers, 37,208 were senior citizens above the age of 60 and 291,94 were citizens in the age group of 45 to 59. Overall, since January 16, 2,355,215 citizens have been vaccinated in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-vaccine-for-18-44-age-group-at-private-centres-only-101619549431208.html

Cost of consumables for sample collection and support for checking, screening and contact tracing will also be covered.The sanctioned amount will also cover the cost of setting up additional testing laboratories within government, apart from cost of consumables and testing kits.The funds will be utilised for covering cost of PPE kits for healthcare, municipal, police and fire authorities, as well as thermal scanners, ventilators, air purifiers, oxygen generation and storage plant in hospitals, strengthening ambulance services for transport of patients, setting up containment zones, Covid hospital, Covid care centres and consumables at government hospitals, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/haryana-sanctions-rs-9-40-crore-to-dcs-for-covid-containment-measures-101619549134886.html
28-04-2021||Other||68% surge in IIT-Bombay’s intellectual property rights applications||The Indian Institute of Technology-Bombay (IIT-B) recorded a 68% rise in the number of intellectual property rights (IPR) applications for its innovations in 2020-21, , even as the pandemic had locked the campus for students last March. The institute filed 262 applications for IPR in the financial year 2020-21 as compared to 156 IPRs in 2019-20. Of the 262 applications, 15-20 were for innovations and solutions for Covid-19, 163 were patent applications, 88 were trademarks (as compared to mere eight last financial year), and 10 design registrations. IPR protects innovations from misuse, fosters competitive research and also helps commercialise new products and solutions in the market. The increase in trademarks indicates more licensing possibilities, said Milind Atrey, dean (research and development), IIT-B. “Trademarks are usually applied when either an industry partner is showing interest in getting a licence or when the researcher wants to start up a company. So an upward trend in more trademarks is a sign that more research is now getting ready for licensing,” said Atrey. The campus closed down on March 14, 2020, as Covid-19 cases surged. Soon, the institute announced an early summer vacation and semesters kicked off thereafter with online classes. Currently, there are around 3,000 research scholars and students on campus, but most of the 11,000-odd students are still studying online. “The pandemic shut down the campus for students but changed the priorities for resident faculty members and researchers. They could allocate more time to their research activities and prepare for the application process, which would have been put off otherwise,” Atrey added. The number of patents granted to researchers in the institute has also doubled, from 67 last year to 120 this financial year. Atrey attributed this rise to a more efficient filing process of the central government. “With streamlining of the patent filing process by the Indian patent office of the central government, the applications are now processed faster,” he said. While earlier innovators had to wait for five-seven years to get a patent, now the process takes around three years, he said. IIT-B’s director Subhasis Chaudhuri said that protecting IP is the first step towards the institute’s new focus on the translatability of research output. “IIT-B plans to put more emphasis on the translatability of our research output when protecting IP is the first step. Along with our incubator SINE (Society for Innovation and Entrepreneurship), newly established school of entrepreneurship and the forthcoming Research Park, we plan to set up a TRL (technology readiness level) booster in the campus. Hopefully, with such efforts, IIT-B can catalyse the growth in Indian industry,” said Chaudhuri. “We want to emphasise on the importance of industry collaboration in this process. So every research statement or problem should come from the industry, and every time a research is published or patented, it would be ideal to have an industry partner waiting. This is foster a more competitive research culture,” said Atrey. For all Indian patents, the institute bears the expenses for the application process. “Thereafter, if an innovator wants to apply for a patent abroad, we take a call on the commercialisation possibilities of the application process, taking into account the commercialisation aspect of the technology,” said Atrey.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/68-surge-in-iit-bombay-intellectual-property-rights-applications-101619549071165.html
28-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC quashes 2013 summoning order against Haryana politician Sukhbir Kataria||The Punjab and Haryana high court has quashed summoning order by a Gurugram court against former Haryana sports minister Sukhbir Kataria in a 2012 fake voters’ case.The complaint was lodged in 2012 by one Om Prakash who had alleged that 3,865 persons had been enrolled as voters twice and they had cast two votes at both places in 2009 assembly elections.Kataria had won the 2009 election from Gurugram by 2,140 votes. The allegations were also of misuse of the electricity bill, ration card, etc for enrolment as voters.The high court bench of justice GS Sandhawalia, while quashing the summoning order, observed that the magistrate ignored a report approved by Gurugram commissioner of police, who had been directed by the HC to look into the issue. Police, in the report, had claimed that the complainant did not cooperate and Kataria was also given a clean chit.The court also found that summoning of Kataria was on the basis of photocopy of documents on the basis of which, trial court had concluded that his handwriting and signatures matched with that of one used in the alleged forged documents.“The allegations of forgery to fill out the forms on part of Kataria as such would not be justified by the trial court in the absence of originals and without an opinion of any expert evidence,” the court recorded.The HC also quashed the FIR against Devinder Singh Kadiyan, a Haryana food and supply department officer, who was also an accused in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-quashes-2013-summoning-order-against-haryana-politician-sukhbir-kataria-101619549013949.html

When the state argued the Centre had not sent vials as per the state-wise chart, the HC bench admonished the state for not pursuing it with the Centre. The next hearing has been scheduled on April 29. A division bench of justice Sunil Shukre and justice Avinash Gharote, while hearing the suo motu public interest litigation, was informed that on April 24, following its April 23 directions to the state to seek allocation of more Remdesivir injections for 10 days from April 21 to 30 in view of the shortage being faced by Maharashtra, the Central committee had revised the allocation list. The committee had increased the allocation to 4.35 lakh vials for the period. The central committee order dated April 24 required the state to take certain steps and place its supply order with the manufacturer. However, advocate S P Bhandarkar, amicus curiae, submitted that despite orders from the bench the shortage persisted and even oxygen and beds for the growing number of Covid-19 patients were in short supply. The government pleader for the state informed the bench that nodal officer for the state of Maharashtra has been appointed and he was coordinating with other nodal officers and manufacturers. The bench then asked the nodal officer to file an affidavit to place on record steps in pursuance of April 24 central government order. The bench questioned why private pharmacists in Vidarbha were allowed to directly place orders with manufacturers. The state further informed that apart from sourcing Remdesivir and other life-saving drugs locally, it was also planning to import from Bangladesh, Singapore, Hong Kong etc and permission was sought from the Centre and a response was awaited. On being informed of Covid care centres not making Remdesivir available for needy patients, the court directed the district collector Nagpur and NMC to carry out individual checks at different hospitals. The bench also directed the DC Nagpur to set up control room of 30-40 officials on 8 hour shifts to oversee allocation of beds and oxygen cylinders. The bench also sought to know why the manufacturing plants around Nagpur had not supplied oxygen. The bench was then told that the collector of Nagpur had messages that from Wednesday Nagpur would get 110- 130 MT oxygen from Bhilai Steel Plant, as per earlier order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hc-deplores-maharashtra-govt-s-failure-to-procure-more-remdesivir-vials-101619548957213.html

Our entire focus should be on how people will recover and how we can provide them relief,” he told reporters in Rohtak on Monday.“And those who have died will not come back by creating a furore over it,” he said at one point, arguing that there was no point in getting into a debate on whether or not the official number of deaths was correct.The opposition Congress was quick to slam his remarks with party general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala saying, “These can only be the words of a merciless ruler. There is a need to make a noise over every death which is the result of the government’s inefficiency so that the deaf BJP government can hear the echo.”Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja also slammed Khattar for such an “irresponsible” statement. “The people are suffering from serious disease and waiting for medicines, oxygen supply and ventilators and Haryana chief minister is making irresponsible statements on Covid patients’ deaths.

Pune got its last supply of doses, 35,000, on Sunday, and has been awaiting fresh supply since. Pune Mayor Murlidhar Mohol tweeted saying that the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), would try to get direct supply from the Serum Institute of India (SII), to ensure that the universal vaccination programme to start from May 1 for all aged above 18 years, could go on smoothly.Mohol tweeted on Tuesday: “The corona vaccine will be available in the open market from May 1. Against the backdrop of this decision of the Central Government, we are trying to procure the vaccine directly on behalf of the Pune Municipal Corporation. The CEO of Serum Adar Poonawalla will be contacted and clarification will come soon. If the vaccine becomes available from Serum, it will help the people of Pune to get vaccinated faster.”On Tuesday, during a video conference, state officials informed all the district administrations that starting from May 1, private hospitals would not be able to procure vaccines from the state. A senior official who attended the conference said, “The state has said that the entire stock which will be available with the state will be only supplied to government hospitals and not private hospitals. All aged above 18 years to 44 years, would have to approach private hospitals. That age group will not be able to register appointments with government hospital in Pune. The private hospitals will decide the price while the government hospitals would be reserved for those aged above 45 years.” On Tuesday, state health minister Rajesh Tope also announced that SII has promised to provide the required stock to Maharashtra only after May 20. Since May 1 the central government has allowed the states to vaccinate all above the age of 18 years, however, the state government has expressed that this would mean 120 million more people are added to the eligibility criteria and that the state would need 240 million doses, at least, for these many people. However, SII, located in Pune, has a manufacturing capacity of six million every month and all the states and other countries and multiple multinational organisations are in the queue to procure vaccines from SII, which is mass producing Covishield. As of Tuesday, Pune is still vaccinating using the doses it got on Sunday. On Tuesday, 24,720 beneficiaries got the jab ,including health care workers (853), frontline workers (1,693), senior citizens (13,109) and those above 45 (9,065). However, many centres had to be shut as no vaccines were available. A senior PMC immunisation official said, “We are still using the doses we received on Sunday and we have not got any message regarding when we will get the next stock. We get the doses only an hour before, which also creates problems when we want to create sessions in advance.” On Monday a total of 185 vaccination centres were operational. However, on Tuesday, only 134 were operational.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pmc-to-source-vaccines-directly-from-serum-for-universal-vax-drive-mayor-mohol-centres-run-out-of-stock-on-tuesday-101619537489475.html

28-04-2021||World||Singapore, Canada, Norway send support for India’s Covid-19 response||Singapore, Canada and Norway have joined the list of countries that have announced support for India’s response to a devastating second wave of Coronavirus infections that has hit healthcare facilities across the country. The Singapore government despatched a consignment of 256 oxygen cylinders on two C-130 military transport aircraft to West Bengal. “Last year, [India] helped the world and [Singapore] by exporting essential medicines and supplies. Now, we stand with [India] as you fight Covid-19,” Singapore high commissioner Simon Wong tweeted. Singapore is among the first countries to send oxygen cylinders to India amid reports of a severe shortage of oxygen in several cities. The cylinders will support last mile oxygen delivery and more consignments are expected in the coming days. In Singapore, second minister for foreign affairs Maliki Osman formally handed over the assistance to Indian high commissioner P Kumaran at Paya Lebar airbase. Maliki said Singaporeans stand in solidarity with the people of India in the fight against the pandemic. “We have all witnessed in the past year how this pandemic is a trans-boundary threat. It gives no regard for country, nationality, or race. This is exactly why we must work collectively to support each other,” he said. On Saturday, the Indian Air Force airlifted four cryogenic tanks from Changi airport that will be used to transport oxygen. Canada announced it is providing $10 million for humanitarian assistance to the Canadian Red Cross to support the Indian Red Cross Society’s response to the devastating situation in India. This contribution will support the procurement of essential supplies and medicines, including oxygen cylinders and ambulances, said a statement from Canada’s foreign ministry. Canada’s international development minister Karina Gould said: “Canada stands with the people of India as they go through these difficult times. This funding will help meet some of the most urgent medical needs like purchasing and distributing essential supplies as well as supporting vital blood and ambulance services.” Foreign minister Marc Garneau also spoke with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar on Tuesday to convey Canada’s solidarity with the people of India, and said Canada is “exploring all options to support India’s urgent needs”. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau extended his support in a tweet. “Right now, the people of India are facing a tragic situation. To help with everything from ambulance services to buying personal protective equipment, we’re contributing $10 million to @IndianRedCross through @RedCrossCanada. We stand ready to donate extra medical supplies, too,” he said. The Norwegian government announced a contribution of 20 million Norwegian Kroners ($2.4 million) to be channelled through the World Health Organization (WHO) and International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The support will be used to scale up ambulance and blood donation services and medical helplines, buy equipment such as oxygen tanks for ambulances and procure hygiene products to migrant workers and other vulnerable groups. Norwegian ambassador Hans Jacob Frydenlund said, “We stand with you in this time of crisis, with the hope that the second wave will recede soon.” The Norwegian business community in India is also preparing to help in the quickest way possible, he added. Meanwhile, the UK announced its second consignment of support materials will include three large oxygen generation units, each capable of producing 500 litres of oxygen a minute. The first consignment of British medical equipment arrived on Tuesday, and more will be delivered over the week. The UK will supply a total of 495 oxygen concentrators and 200 ventilators from surplus stocks. The support was sent in response to a request from India and a pledge from Prime Minister Boris Johnson for the UK to do all it can to help, the British high commission said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/singapore-canada-norway-send-support-for-india-s-covid-19-response-101619634219270.html

Modi spoke to Putin on telephone against the backdrop of reports that the first Russian consignment of support materials for India’s Covid-19 response was expected to reach the country on Thursday. Russian military aircraft will deliver more than 22 tonnes of equipment, including 20 oxygen production units, 75 ventilators, 150 medical monitors and 200,000 packs of medicine. The leaders discussed the evolving pandemic situation, and Putin “expressed solidarity with the people and government of India and conveyed that Russia would extend all possible support in this regard”, according to a statement from the external affairs ministry. Modi thanked Putin and said the “prompt Russian support to India was a symbol of our enduring partnership”. The leaders decided to establish a new 2+2 dialogue mechanism comprising the foreign and defence ministers of both countries. Russia will be only the fourth country with which India has such a mechanism, the others being the US, Japan and Australia. The contact at the highest levels of the leadership in India and Russia came after bilateral ties went through a rough patch recently, following Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov’s visit to New Delhi. Lavrov’s decision to club the trip to India with a visit to Pakistan, and his comments about Moscow being ready to supply special military equipment to Islamabad, did not go down well in New Delhi. During their conversation, Modi and Putin also discussed cooperation between the two sides to fight the global pandemic. Putin appreciated India’s decision to grant emergency use approval for Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine, and the leaders “noted that the Russian vaccine will be manufactured in India for use in India, Russia and third countries”, the statement said. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity the first consignment of Russian-made Sputnik V doses is expected to reach India by the end of the month. The developers of Sputnik V have tied up with several Indian pharmaceutical firms to manufacture 850 million doses a year. Putin and Modi discussed ways to further deepen bilateral cooperation in different sectors in line with the bilateral special and privileged partnership. Modi conveyed his appreciation for Russia’s support for India’s Gaganyaan programme or first manned space flight, and the completion of the Russian phase of training for the four astronauts. The first manned space flight, originally planned for 2022, has now been pushed to 2023 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. The two leaders also noted the scope for increasing cooperation in renewable energy, including the hydrogen economy. They also recalled important decisions made during their last summit in Vladivostok in September 2019. Modi said he looked forward to Putin’s visit to India later this year for the bilateral summit, which would be an occasion to “continue their personal and trusted conversation”, the statement said. Putin assured Modi of Russia’s full support for the success of India’s presidency of the Brazil-Russia-India-China-South Africa (BRICS) grouping during 2021.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-sending-22-tonnes-of-equipment-to-india-as-covid-19-aid-both-sides-to-set-up-2-2-dialogue-101619631039284.html

It is necessary," Duterte said in a late night televised address.Non-essential movement, mass gatherings and dining in restaurants will remain banned in Metro Manila and in the provinces of Bulacan, Rizal, Laguna and Cavite for a further two weeks from May 1.Restrictions to curb the spread of the disease have taken a painful toll on the Southeast Asian economy, which suffered its worst contraction on record due to the pandemic last year.The Department of Health recorded 6,895 new Covid-19 cases and 115 more deaths on Wednesday, bringing the tallies to 1.02 million confirmed infections and more than 17,000 fatalities.While the government aims to inoculate 50 to 70 million out of the country's more than 108 million people, the pace of its inoculation campaign has been slow due to difficulties in securing supply.But Carlito Galvez, who is in charge of the government's vaccine procurement programme, said that will change in the second half when the bulk of the supply the country procured will have arrived, making 500,000 daily inoculations possible.Galvez also said the Philippines has told Israel of its wish to get AstraZeneca shots which it no longer needs.Around 1.56 million people have so far received at least one coronavirus vaccine shot. Only 3 million doses have been delivered, out of 140 million the Philippines aims to procure.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/philippines-extends-limits-on-movement-gatherings-to-curb-spread-of-covid-101619629125489.html
28-04-2021||World||US Feds execute search warrant at Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani's NYC home||Federal investigators have executed a search warrant at the Manhattan home of former President Donald Trump’s attorney Rudy Giuliani, a law enforcement official told The Associated Press on Wednesday.The former New York City mayor has been under investigation for several years over his business dealings in Ukraine. Details of the search were not immediately available, but it comes as the Justice Department continues its investigation into the former New York City mayor and staunch Trump ally.The official could not discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity. News of the search was first reported by The New York Times.The federal probe into Giuliani's overseas and business dealings stalled last year because of a dispute over investigative tactics as Trump unsuccessfully sought reelection, and amid Giuliani’s prominent role in subsequently disputing the results of the contest on Trump’s behalf.The full scope of the investigation is unclear, but it at least partly involves the Ukraine dealings, law enforcement officials have told the AP.Giuliani was central to the then-president’s efforts to dig up dirt against Democratic rival Joe Biden and to press Ukraine for an investigation into Biden and his son, Hunter — who himself now faces a criminal tax probe by the Justice Department. Giuliani also sought to undermine former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was pushed out on Trump’s orders, and met several times with a Ukrainian lawmaker who released edited recordings of Biden in an effort to smear him before the election.A message left for Giuliani’s lawyer wasn’t immediately returned. Giuliani had previously called the investigation is “pure political persecution.”Federal prosecutors in Manhattan had pushed last year for a search warrant for records, including some of Giuliani’s communications, but officials in the Trump-era Justice Department would not sign off on the request, according to multiple people familiar with the investigation who insisted on anonymity to speak about an ongoing investigation.Officials in the deputy attorney general’s office raised concerns about both the scope of the request, which they thought would contain communications that could be covered by legal privilege between Giuliani and Trump, and the method of obtaining the records, three of the people said. The people could not discuss the investigation publicly and spoke to AP on condition of anonymity.The issue was widely expected to be revisited by the Justice Department once Attorney General Merrick Garland assumed office. Garland was confirmed last month and Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco was confirmed to her position and sworn in last week. The Justice Department requires that applications for search warrants served on lawyers be approved by senior department officials.A Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The U.S. Attorney’s office in Manhattan and the FBI's New York office declined to comment Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-feds-execute-search-warrant-at-trump-attorney-rudy-giuliani-s-nyc-home-101619628746420.html
28-04-2021||World||Apollo 11 astronaut Michael Collins dies at age 90||American astronaut Michael Collins, who stayed behind in the command module of Apollo 11 on July 20, 1969, while Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin traveled to the lunar surface to become the first humans to walk on the moon, died on Wednesday at age 90, his family said.A statement released by his family said Collins died of cancer.Often described as the "forgotten" third astronaut on the historic mission, Collins remained alone for more than 21 hours until his two colleagues returned in the lunar module. He lost contact with mission control in Houston each time the spacecraft circled the dark side of the moon."Not since Adam has any human known such solitude as Mike Collins," the mission log said, referring to the biblical figure.Collins wrote an account of his experiences in his 1974 autobiography, "Carrying the Fire," but largely shunned publicity."I know that I would be a liar or a fool if I said that I have the best of the three Apollo 11 seats, but I can say with truth and equanimity that I am perfectly satisfied with the one I have," Collins said in comments released by NASA in 2009.Collins was born in Rome on Oct. 31, 1930 - the same year as both Armstrong and Aldrin. He was the son of a US Army major general and, like his father, attended the US Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in 1952.Like many of the first generation of American astronauts, Collins started out as an Air Force test pilot.In 1963, he was chosen by NASA for its astronaut program, still in its early days but ramping up quickly at the height of the Cold War as the United States sought to push ahead of the Soviet Union and fulfill President John F. Kennedy's pledge of landing a man on the moon by the end of the decade.Collins' first voyage into space came in July 1966 as pilot on Gemini X, part of the missions that prepared NASA's Apollo program. The Gemini X mission carried out a successful docking with a separate target vehicle.His second, and final, spaceflight was the historic Apollo 11.He avoided much of the media fanfare that greeted the astronauts on their return to Earth, and was later often critical of the cult of celebrity.After a short stint in government, Collins became director of the National Air and Space Museum, stepping down in 1978. He was also the author of a number of space-related books.His strongest memory from Apollo 11, he said, was looking back at the Earth, which he said seemed "fragile.""I really believe that if the political leaders of the world could see their planet from a distance of 100,000 miles, their outlook could be fundamentally changed. That all-important border would be invisible, that noisy argument silenced," he said.His family's statement said they know "how lucky Mike felt to live the life he did.""Please join us in fondly and joyfully remembering his sharp wit, his quiet sense of purpose, and his wise perspective, gained both from looking back at Earth from the vantage of space and gazing across calm waters from the deck of his fishing boat."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/apollo-11-astronaut-michael-collins-dies-at-age-90-101619628417380.html

Business has already begun to improve with March the best month since the pandemic's full force was felt.Sundeep Jain, Uber's chief product officer, said the company was "evaluating opportunities" to expand the vaccine program to other countries.The company also announced partnerships with Avis Budget Group Inc, Hertz and other vehicle rental agencies.From Wednesday, U.S. customers can book rental cars through the Uber app, with Uber offering up to 10% of the rental cost as a credit to the user to spend on other Uber services.In May, users in Washington D.C. can have their rental car delivered to and collected from their home, after paying a fee to Uber, which will rollout the service nationwide this year.Jain said users will be able to handle most rental car paperwork digitally, but declined to comment on the financial details of the partnerships.Uber's smaller rival Lyft Inc already offers car rentals in partnership with Sixt SE.Uber also said it would expand an option to reserve rides in advance to more U.S. and European cities and allow customers to book and collect food delivery orders during a ride-hail trip.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uber-app-in-us-to-enable-users-to-book-covid-19-vaccines-and-rental-cars-101619628198321.html

US and NATO ground forces are expected to be out of Afghanistan by September 11.Meanwhile, US special envoy Zalmay Khalilzad on Tuesday told the US lawmakers, "If the Taliban were to come back to power, the reality for Afghanistan's women and girls, I think, would be devastating."Biden administration has said it intends to focus on the Indo-Pacific region amid increased Chinese activity that threatens United States' interests in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-orders-embassy-staff-to-leave-kabul-as-it-begins-troop-pullout-101619623994546.html
28-04-2021||World||Biden administration to announce plan to ban menthol cigarettes: Report||The Biden administration this week is expected to propose a ban on menthol cigarettes, a move backed by civil rights groups that say Black Americans are hurt by the industry's aggressive targeting of the product, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.The administration will seek to ban menthol and other flavors in mass-produced cigars, the newspaper reported, citing unidentified administration officials who spoke on condition of anonymity.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration faces a Thursday court deadline to respond to a 2013 citizen's petition seeking a ban on menthols. Public health groups filed a lawsuit last year in federal district court in Northern California to require the FDA to respond to the petition.The Post said it could be years before any ban would take effect, but the move would be praised by anti-smoking groups. Tobacco use remains a leading source of preventable illness and death in the country, particularly for people of color.The FDA declined to comment on the report from Post."There is not an open question on whether menthol in cigarettes is harmful - the evidence is overwhelming and consistent,” Joelle Lester, director of commercial tobacco control programs at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in Minnesota, told the Post.The law center led a group of 19 public health organizations to file the 2013 petition.Last week, tobacco stocks tumbled after the Wall Street Journal reported that the Biden administration is weighing whether to move forward on a menthol ban or a nicotine reduction in all cigarettes—or both. Such a ban could impact Altria Group, maker of Marlboros; Europe's Imperial Brands, maker of Gauloises and Winston cigarettes; and British American Tobacco, maker of Lucky Strike and Newport cigarettes.Altria, Imperial Brands and British American Tobacco were not immediately available for comment on the Post report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-administration-to-announce-plan-to-ban-menthol-cigarettes-report-101619625405312.html

While ordering the sanctions, US President Joe Biden also called for de-escalating tensions and held the door open for cooperation with Russia in certain areas.Russia quickly retaliated by ordering 10 US diplomats to leave, blacklisting eight current and former US officials and tightening requirements for US Embassy operations.As part of the restrictions, Russia moved to ban the US Embassy and its consulates from hiring Russian citizens and third country nationals. Similar bans would also be applied to other nations designated as “unfriendly.”Lavrov said Wednesday that a list of those countries will be published soon to formalize the decision.Speaking in the interview with a Russian state TV host, Lavrov noted that Moscow has had a “positive” attitude to Biden’s proposal to hold a summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin, but added that Russia still needs to analyze all aspects of the initiative.Lavrov said he would attend a meeting of top diplomats of the Arctic nations in Iceland set for next month and would be ready to meet with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken if he also joins the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/usrussia-ties-worse-than-during-cold-war-russian-minister-101619624706128.html
28-04-2021||World||Melting glaciers disrupt China's plan to build dam over Brahmaputra in Tibet: Report||Melting glaciers and barrier lakes could threaten China's plan to build the world's biggest hydroelectric dam over the Brahmaputra River in Tibet close to the Arunachal Pradesh border, a media report said on Wednesday.The proposed dam which one Chinese official said has "no parallel in history” will be built in Medog county, where the Brahmaputra Grand Canyon is located. Medog is the last county in Tibet which is located close to the Arunachal Pradesh border.The plan to build the mega-dam, which is part of China’s 14th five-year plan beginning from this year, was approved by China’s Parliament, the National People’s Congress in March this year.But the engineers are concerned about the threats posed by landslides and barrier lakes to the dam, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.“But an icy obstacle could put a halt to much of the plan. In 2018, a landslide caused by a melting glacier blocked the Yarlung Tsangpo – the upper stream of the Brahmaputra River – at the Sedongpu Basin in Milin county," it said.It formed a lake containing about 600 million cubic metres of water. With the river spilling over the top at present, the dam could collapse at any time, it said.The Sedongpu lake sits just a few dozen kilometres upstream from the planned construction site of the super hydropower plant. With so much water hanging overhead, no construction workers can move in to clear the ground, it said.To build the big dam, they must get rid of the small dam formed by the landslide first, the report said.India and Bangladesh, the lower riparian states, have raised concerns over China's plan to build the massive dam on Brahmaputra River. But China has downplayed such anxieties saying it would keep their interests in mind.As a lower riparian state with considerable established user rights to the waters of the trans-border rivers, the Indian government has consistently conveyed its views and concerns to the Chinese authorities and has urged them to ensure that the interests of downstream states are not harmed by any activities in upstream areas.Brahmaputra river is known as Yarlung Zangbo in Tibet.The Brahmaputra is the longest river in Tibet and its valley in southern Tibet is the world’s deepest with a 7,000-metre (23,000-foot) drop from the highest mountain peak to the lowest basin.China plans to build a hydropower plant in the valley with electricity generation capacity reaching 70 gigawatts, about three times that of the Three Gorges Dam, currently the world's largest built by the country, the report said.Several teams of scientists and engineers have flown to Sedongpu in recent years, including some of the nation’s top experts in civil engineering, glacier study and landslide prevention. They collected a large amount of data on the site using drones and other advanced equipment and were asked by authorities to come up with a solution after finishing their assessment, it said.“The situation is very difficult. There is not an immediate solution yet,” Xing Aiguo, a professor of civil engineering at the Shanghai Jiao Tong University who was involved in one of the studies told the Post.The experts could not find a way to strengthen the landslide dam or remove it safely. Worse still, they found similar disasters would likely happen again in the same area, thanks to climate change.“The area is large and there are many glaciers,” Xing said. Even if there is a method, treating such a harsh natural landscape with engineering methods could be technically challenging and costly, he said.A quarter of the glaciers on the Tibetan Plateau have disappeared since the 1970s, and two-thirds of the remaining will be gone by the end of the century, the Post report quoted an estimate by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.Studies have found that increased meltwater and rising temperatures could make the “roof of the world” more habitable with greater crop yields and advancing tree lines, but the risk of natural disasters, including flooding and landslides, also increased.And ice could turn a landslide into something more destructive. At Sedongpu, for instance, the icy debris travelled more than 10km with a top speed of 72km/h according to an estimate by Tibet autonomous region's geological environmental monitoring station.The icy material also loosened the landslide dam and made it more prone to collapse. The sheer drop in elevation means even a relatively small amount of water could cause serious destruction downstream, it said.Liu Chuanzheng, a government researcher with the Consultative Centre of Geohazard Mitigation under the Ministry of Natural Resources in Beijing, said human activity in the Sedongpu area “should be avoided altogether”.“The development and utilisation of natural resources and energy in the Yarlung Tsangpo river must fully consider the situation of avalanches and debris flows in the Sedongpu valley,” he said in an official report about the landslide published in the journal Geology in China in 2019.Some Chinese scientists have proposed that instead of building a super dam, a 16km-long tunnel could be dug through one of the high mountains in the Yarlung Tsangpo valley.The water could be directed into the tunnel to push electricity generating turbines. This scheme would reduce the power output to 50GW – or about twice that of the Three Gorges Dam – but reduce the risk of damage from landslides or other natural disasters.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/melting-glaciers-may-disrupt-china-s-plan-to-build-dam-over-brahmaputra-in-tibet-101619621981025.html
28-04-2021||World||Medical oxygen: Why it is lacking and how it is made||Difficulty breathing is one of the most common severe Covid-19 symptoms, and as photos of people waiting in long lines for oxygen canisters in India and elsewhere attest, supplies of medical oxygen are far from adequate everywhere in the world.- Why the long waits for oxygen in developing nations? - India is only the latest country to confront a lack of medical oxygen supplies. Earlier in the pandemic there were similar scenes of long lines in countries such as Brazil, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Peru and Venezuela.Unitaid, a global initiative that helps low- and middle-income countries confront public health challenges, puts the lack of supplies of medical oxygen down to its cost, limited infrastructure and logistical difficulties.Medical oxygen is key to treating people in respiratory distress, whether at home or in hospitals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), one person in five suffering from Covid-19 needs medical oxygen to ensure that the level of oxygen in their blood is sufficient.- How much is needed in countries facing shortages? -In February, the WHO estimated that half a million people needed 1.2 million oxygen canisters a day.Unitaid put the price tag of helping the countries facing the greatest need at $1.6 billion this year."This is a global emergency that needs a truly global response," said Unitaid's Executive Director, Dr Philippe Duneton, in February.It has identified some 20 countries facing the greatest difficulties with oxygen supplies, including Malawi, Nigeria and Afghanistan.- How is oxygen made? - Oxygen is made in two ways:- Medical oxygen: is made by separating the oxygen from other gases and impurities found in air by repeated steps of compression, filtration and purification, according to Air Liquide Sante France.Such medical oxygen reaches more than 99.5 percent purity and is rigorously tested.It can be highly compressed into a liquid form, but has to be maintained below -182°C, which according to Air Liquide Sante France is the best way to meet variations in demand as one litre of liquid oxygen is the equivalent to around 800 litres when it is in normal gas form.Canisters that can travel with patients with one litre of compressed litres of oxygen contain about 200 litres of normal oxygen.- Compressed oxygen: machines that can separate out nitrogen from ambient air can raise oxygen levels to around 93 percent. The machines can be portable or larger to serve a hospital. However, these machines cannot meet surges in demand -- which rose by a factor of five or six in French hospitals as waves of Covid patients peaked. They are require lots of electricity and need to be regularly maintained by a technician.- Who are the main producers? -Outside of China, the three main producers of medical oxygen are the German firm Linde, which is allied with Praxair in the US; the French firm Air Liquide and the US company Air Products.But there are a large number of local and regional producers of medical oxygen given that it is difficult to shop long distances.Industrialised countries are better served as production facilities were designed to serve more than just the medical sector, such as the steel and chemicals industries.- What's being done for India? -The Indian military has used its cargo aircraft to transport oxygen tanker trucks where supplies are lacking, and a train called the Oxygen Express was put into service on April 22.The military has also said it plans to import 23 mobile production units from Germany.France plans to send eight such units that will be able to produce enough oxygen to serve 10,000 patients a day. It also plans to ship 200 tonnes of liquid oxygen to Indian hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/medical-oxygen-why-it-is-lacking-and-how-it-is-made-101619622810946.html

Beijing has also made substantial progress in militarizing its man-made islands in the past few years.Beijing claims sovereignty over all of the South China Sea. But Vietnam, Malaysia, the Philippines, Brunei and Taiwan have counterclaims. In the East China Sea, China has territorial disputes with Japan.This investment will also maximise local jobs through a targeted industry plan to contract local businesses throughout the entire supply chain, Morrison said."My commitment is keeping Australians safe and keeping Australians in jobs,” he said."All of our objectives through the activities of our Defence Forces is designed to pursue peace," he said during a press briefing."In a region as uncertain as this you need to ensure that you have the Defence capability that enables you to protect and defend Australia's interests in that region."And this enables us to ensure there's an appropriate balance — particularly in partnership with our United States allies to ensure we can promote an environment where peace will be the outcome."In an official statement, Defence Minister Peter Dutton said this significant investment would ensure the Australian Defence Force continues to deliver world-class training and our engagement with allies and other nations through the conduct of joint training exercises, including with the US Marine Rotational Force - Darwin.“This investment is critical to ensuring that our ADF land combat capability is equipped with the cutting edge technology it will require to maintain our competitive advantage,” Dutton said.These works will provide a strong economic benefit to the region, with significant opportunities for the local construction industry over a five-year delivery phase programme.Subject to parliamentary approvals, construction is expected to commence in the second half of 2021, with completion expected by mid-2026.The fraying of China-Australia ties that began with Canberra banning China’s Huawei from its 5G networks in 2018, worsened after Australia called on China to allow international investigators into Wuhan to probe the origins of the novel coronavirus last year.Beijing placed crippling tariffs on Australia’s barley exports and halted beef imports from four large meat plants. China also put embargoes on Australian cotton.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-plans-747-million-budget-to-upgrade-defence-bases-in-indopacific-101619622460424.html
28-04-2021||World||US Supreme Court arguments begin in cheerleader's free speech case||U.S. Supreme Court justices on Wednesday began hearing arguments on whether public schools can punish students for what they say off campus in a case involving a former Pennsylvania cheerleader's foul-mouthed social media post that could impact the free speech rights of millions of young Americans.The nine justices are considering an appeal by the Mahanoy Area School District of a lower court ruling in favor of Brandi Levy that found that the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment guarantee of freedom of speech bars public school officials from regulating off-campus speech.Many schools and educators, supported by President Joe Biden's administration, have argued that ending their authority over students at the schoolhouse gates could make it harder to curb bullying, racism, cheating and invasions of privacy - all frequently occurring online.The American Civil Liberties Union, representing Levy, has argued that students need protection from censorship and monitoring of their beliefs.Under a 1969 Supreme Court precedent, public schools may punish student speech that would "substantially disrupt" the school community. Levy's case will determine whether this authority extends away from school.Peeved because she was denied a spot in a tryout for the varsity cheerleading team after being a member of the junior varsity squad as a ninth-grader, Levy - age 14 at the time - made a Snapchat post that set the case in motion.On a Saturday while at a convenience store in Mahanoy City in Pennsylvania's coal region, she posted a photo of her and a friend raising their middle fingers, adding a caption using the same curse word four times to voice her displeasure with cheerleading, softball, school and "everything."As a result, Mahanoy Area High School banished her from the cheerleading team for a year. She and her parents sued, seeking reinstatement to the squad and a judgment that her First Amendment rights had been violated. A judge ordered Levy's reinstatement, finding that her actions had not been disruptive enough to warrant the punishment.The Philadelphia-based 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last year went even further, deciding that the Supreme Court's 1969 precedent, known as Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, does not apply to off-campus speech and that the First Amendment prohibits school officials from regulating such speech.The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has shown sympathy toward free speech claims in important cases in recent years.Now 18 and a college student studying accounting, Levy said the case has taught her that school administrators should have limits on what they can enforce."If a student is targeting the school or threatening someone or bullying someone, that's when I feel the school should step in. But for a student to express themselves and get in trouble for it, I feel like that's not right," Levy said in an interview.The court's eventual decision would affect public schools, as governmental institutions, but not private schools.A ruling in the case is due by the end of June.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-arguments-begin-in-cheerleader-s-free-speech-case-101619620260206.html
28-04-2021||World||World failed to prevent Covid-19 outbreak from overwhelming India, says Dr Fauci||Top US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci has said that countries around the world have failed to provide a global response to coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic to prevent the outbreak from overwhelming India, according to a report by The Guardian. Fauci, the White House’s chief medical adviser, told Guardian Australia that a global response with equity throughout the world was the only way to fight the pandemic.“And that’s something that, unfortunately, has not been accomplished. Often when you have diseases in which there is a limited amount of intervention, be it therapeutic or prevention, this is something that all the countries that are relatively rich countries or countries that have a higher income have to pay more attention to,” the 80-year-old immunologist was quoted by The Guardian as saying.India is witnessing an unprecedented public health crisis amid a continued rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths. The ministry of health and family welfare on Wednesday morning announced that India recorded 3,60,960 new Covid-19 cases and 3,293 related deaths in the last 24 hours, setting another new daily global record. India’s total active caseload is more than 29 lakh, which comprises 16.55% of the country’s total positive cases.The huge spike in active caseload has overwhelmed the health infrastructure, leading to a shortage of oxygen and other medical supplies. Several hospitals have been frequently sending out distress messages on social media to flag the acute shortage of oxygen supply. The Centre has now taken a series of steps to overcome the shortage.Meanwhile, the United States has pledged to send oxygen generators, storage containers, PPE, remdesivir doses, a team of public health experts, and raw materials for the Covishield vaccine being manufactured by the Pune-based Serum Institute of India. Fauci stressed that though the World Health Organization (WHO) was trying to accelerate support to India through the Covax initiative, the rich countries need to assume more responsibility, per The Guardian.“Because we’re all in this together. It’s an interconnected world. And there are responsibilities that countries have to each other, particularly if you’re a wealthy country and you’re dealing with countries that don’t have the resources or capabilities that you have,” he was quoted by the British news website as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/world-failed-to-prevent-covid-19-outbreak-from-overwhelming-india-says-dr-fauci-101619616882630.html
28-04-2021||World||Russian authorities paint over large mural of Alexei Navalny in St Petersburg||Russian authorities rapidly painted over a large mural of jailed opposition politician Alexei Navalny on Wednesday after it appeared overnight on a building in central St Petersburg.The mural in President Vladimir Putin's hometown showed a smiling Navalny, whose activist network is on the brink of being outlawed as "extremist", making a heart shape with his hands next to the slogan "A hero of a new time".Police arrived at the scene at 9am local time and workers arrived to start painting over it with yellow paint within around 90 minutes. It was unclear who painted the mural.Navalny, Putin's most outspoken domestic opponent, is serving a 2-1/2 year jail sentence for parole violations on an earlier conviction that he says was politically motivated.A court is considering a request by Moscow's prosecutor to ban Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation (FBK) and his regional offices on the grounds they are extremist. The next hearing in that case is expected on Thursday.Lyubov Sobol, a Navalny ally, mocked authorities for painting over the mural."That's how they transform everything 'alive' and beautiful into the impersonal and 'dead'. For us, Russia is for happiness, for them, it is for gloom and stagnation," she wrote on Twitter.(Reporting by Anton Vaganov; writing by Tom Balmforth; editing by Alexandra Hudson)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-authorities-paint-over-large-mural-of-alexei-navalny-in-st-petersburg-101619616288200.html
28-04-2021||World||US Navy Seals to shift from counter-terrorism, focus now on China and Russia||Ten years after they found and killed Osama bin Laden, U.S. Navy Seals are undergoing a major transition to improve leadership and expand their commando capabilities to better battle threats from global powers like China and Russia.The new plan cuts the number of Seal platoons by as much as 30% and increases their size to make the teams more lethal and able to counter sophisticated maritime and undersea adversaries. And there will be a new, intensive screening process for the Navy's elite warriors, to get higher-quality leaders after scandals that rocked the force and involved charges of murder, sexual assault, and drug use.Rear Adm. H. Wyman Howard III, the top commander for the Seals, laid out his plans in an exclusive interview with The Associated Press. He said the Navy’s special operations forces have been focused on counterterrorism operations but now must begin to evolve beyond those missions. For the past two decades, many have been fighting in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan. Now they are focused on going back to sea.That decision reflects the broader Pentagon strategy to prioritize China and Russia, which are rapidly growing their militaries and trying to expand their influence around the globe. U.S. defense leaders believe that two decades of war against militants and extremists have drained resources, causing America to lose ground against Moscow and Beijing.The counterterrorism fight had its benefits, allowing the Seals to sharpen their skills in developing intelligence networks and finding and hitting targets, said Howard, who heads Naval Special Warfare Command, which includes the Seals and the special warfare combatant-craft crewmen. "Many of these things are transferable, but now we need to put pressure on ourselves to operate against peer threats."As a result, Howard is adding personnel to the Seal platoons to beef up capabilities in cyber and electronic warfare and unmanned systems, honing their skills to collect intelligence and deceive and defeat the enemy.“We are putting pressure on ourselves to evolve and understand our gaps in capability and what our true survivability is against these threats” posed by global competitors, he said.Adm. Mike Gilday, the chief of naval operations, said the goal is to better integrate the Seals into the Navy's missions at sea.“As the Navy Special Warfare community returns more and more to its maritime roots, their increased integration across the Fleet — above, under, and on the sea — will unequivocally enhance our unique maritime capabilities to help us compete and win against any adversary," Gilday said in a statement to the AP.Increasing the size of the Seal platoons will add high-tech capabilities. And decreasing the number of units will allow Howard to rid the force of toxic leaders and be more selective in choosing commanders. That decision is a direct result of the erosion in character that Navy officials have seen within the force.In recent years, Seals have been involved in a number of high-profile scandals. One of the most well-known was the arrest of Navy Special Operations Chief Edward Gallagher on war crimes charges that included the murder of an Islamic State militant captive and attempted murder in the shootings of civilians during a 2017 deployment to Iraq.Gallagher was acquitted of all charges except one, posing in photos with the dead captive. A jury recommended his rank be reduced, cutting his pension and benefits as he was about to retire. But President Donald Trump intervened and ordered that Gallagher be allowed to retire without losing his Seal status.More recently, a Seal team platoon was pulled out of Iraq in 2019 amid allegations of sexual assault. Members of Seal Team 10 were involved in cocaine use and tampering with drug tests. And Navy Seal Adam Matthews was sentenced to a year in military prison for his role in the 2017 hazing-related death of an Army Green Beret in Africa.Navy leaders also chafed as Navy Seals broke away from their “quiet professional” ethos, publicizing their participation in the raid into Pakistan that killed bin Laden, the al-Qaida leader responsible for plotting the 9/11 attacks. Two Seals wrote books about the mission, prompting a rebuke from the Naval Special Warfare commander at the time, Rear Adm. Brian Losey.“A critical tenant of our ethos is ‘I do not advertise the nature of my work, nor seek recognition for my actions,’” he said.Since taking over last September, Howard reached out to the Army and the Marine Corps for ideas on how to better screen his commando forces and assess them as they move through the ranks. Almost immediately, he instituted a “double-blind” process for candidate interviews that were being used by the Army, so that neither side is influenced by actually seeing the other.In addition, he is intensifying the screening process with more psychological assessments to evaluate personality traits. And he is expanding other assessments done by the subordinates and peers of candidates up for review. The increased scrutiny, said Howard, will extend through all the ranks and will help leaders get a better understanding of each service member's character. The process, he said, will provide more feedback for individuals so they can improve and will also help top leaders pair commanders with the right teams.In some cases, Howard said, sailors who already had gone through the initial Seal screening had to do it again under the new process. Not all did as well the second time.“We learned that some of the officers that scored in the midrange are officers that I thought would have scored much higher,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-navy-seals-to-shift-from-counter-terrorism-focus-now-on-china-and-russia-101619615605042.html
28-04-2021||World||Covid-19: UK joins France with vaccine passport plan to lift travel||Britain is working on a digital Covid-19 vaccine passport as the move to restart travel in Europe gathers pace.The UK initiative, disclosed Wednesday by Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, is based on an existing National Health Service app, which will be adapted to help travelers prove they’ve had a jab or tested negative for the virus. The announcement comes a day after France started to trial short flights with a tracing app updated to host records of shots and tests, on short flights.“In terms of vaccine certification, I can confirm we are working on an NHS application,” Shapps told Sky News. “It will be the NHS app that is used for people when they book appointments with the NHS and so on.”Vaccine passports are emerging as a key plank of efforts to jump-start European tourism in time for the summer peak. Britain had previously said that they were under consideration ahead of a planned reopening on May 17, while the European Union aims to introduce digital passes by June after governments reached a deal on technical standards earlier his month.In virtual talks Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang discussed the use of vaccine certificates as a way to boost travel, as well as working together to ease the impact of the pandemic, according to a German government statement.While Britain needs to remain cautious and protect the gains of its vaccine rollout, current data “does continue to look good” for reopening travel, Shapps said.International FlightsThe minister told Times Radio that he will chair a meeting of Britain’s G-7 counterparts next week to discuss international co-ordination on the recognition of vaccine passports.Within Europe, Greece has already started easing travel with some countries including its fellow EU members, with a full lifting of restrictions for international tourists set for May 15.Britain, which along with Germany is the biggest source of visitors to Mediterranean sun spots, is set to announce a Green List of countries to which leisure travel will be permitted early next month.Spanish tourism minister Fernando Valdes Verelst told The Sun newspaper on Wednesday that Britons will be allowed back in from June once an agreement on mutual recognition of vaccine passports is in place.Shapps said he couldn’t comment specifically on Spain before May’s planned announcements.EU PlanFollowing government approval for the EU’s plans on April 14, the European Parliament is set to adopt a position on the European Commission proposals Wednesday. Further negotiations will follow before an agreement on the final wording of rules is hatched sometime next month.Didier Reynders, the EU’s justice commissioner, said in a speech to the Parliament that lawmakers should move quickly to allow travel across the bloc to resume for summer, warning against rigid rules for vaccine passes or delays to gage the impact of jabs on new Covid variants.France’s transport minister, Jean-Baptiste Djebbari, said Tuesday that the country’s fledgling vaccine passport, which already has about 15 million users as a Covid-tracing app, is being deployed on services between Paris and the Mediterranean island of Corsica.The trial will be extended to Air France-KLM flights to overseas territories next week and then to some neighboring countries. Talks have also been held with the UK on bilateral travel arrangements and discussions with the US will be next, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-uk-joins-france-with-vaccine-passport-plan-to-lift-travel-101619614990572.html
28-04-2021||World||Covid: Vietnam urges vigilance as neighbouring nations battle infection spikes||Vietnam on Wednesday warned against mass gatherings ahead of long public holidays this weekend and said it would speed up its vaccine rollout amid a worsening coronavirus situation among its neighbours."A new Covid-19 outbreak is threatening to happen, especially during the upcoming holidays," the health ministry said in a statement.It called for "unanimity and determination" among the public to keep the virus at bay.Vietnam has been widely praised for its record in containing its outbreaks quickly through targeted mass testing and a strict, centralised quarantine programme.That has helped keep its case tally to 2,865, with only 35 deaths reported since the pandemic began, one of the best records in Asia."For the sake of the country, of the community and of the people, each citizen should be unanimously determined to hold on to our success in preventing and fighting against Covid-19," the statement said.The ministry separately said provinces, especially those bordering Cambodia, need to increase vigilance due to people illegally crossing the border into Vietnam.Cambodia has seen its case total jump from about 500 to 11,000 in the past two months, with 82 deaths, while nearby Thailand's infections tally has more than doubled in April alone to nearly 62,000, with 178 fatalities.Cases in Laos have nearly doubled since Saturday, to over 600, according to its state media."The global disease situation is evolving in a complicated manner, especially in some neighbouring countries, putting huge pressure on Vietnam," Deputy Prime Minister Truong Hoa Binh said in the statement.The government on Wednesday said its Covid-19 vaccine rollout would be expedited, with the aim of administering all of the 928,800 AstraZeneca doses it has received so far by May 15. About 260,000 people have so far been inoculated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid-vietnam-urges-vigilance-as-neighbouring-nations-battle-infection-spikes-101619612653515.html
28-04-2021||World||UK's Johnson faces formal investigation over funding of apartment renovation||Britain's Electoral Commission has opened an investigation into the financing of the refurbishment of British Prime Minister Boris Johnson's apartment, saying there were grounds to suspect an offence may have been committed.Eight days before local elections across England and for the election of the Welsh and Scottish regional assemblies, Johnson is facing a stream of allegations about everything from his muddled initial handling of the COVID-19 crisis to questions about who leaked what from his office."We are now satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an offence or offences may have occurred," the Electoral Commission said of the financing of the apartment above Number 11 Downing Street where Johnson resides."We will therefore continue this work as a formal investigation to establish whether this is the case," the commission said.The investigation will determine whether any transactions relating to the works fall within the regime regulated by the commission and whether such funding was reported as required.If it finds that an offence has occurred, and that there is sufficient evidence, then the commission can issue a fine or refer the matter to the police.Asked who paid the initial invoices for the refurbishment, Johnson said he had covered the costs and he had conformed in full with the code of conduct and ministerial code."The answer is I have covered the costs," said Johnson under questioning in parliament from opposition Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, who cast Johnson as "Major Sleaze".Though Johnson has over the years repeatedly weathered gaffes, crises over Brexit and disclosures about his adultery, he is now grappling with an array of accusations which opponents say show that he is unfit for office and that his government is riddled by sleaze and cronyism.His supporters deny he has done anything wrong and say he is focused on the COVID-19 crisis. Starmer said Johnson had been selecting wallpaper for 840 pounds ($1,164) a roll in the middle of the crisis.DOWNING STREET APARTMENTAsked last month about the refurbishment, Johnson's spokeswoman said all donations and gifts were properly declared, and that no Conservative Party funds were used to pay for it.Johnson has a taxpayer-funded 30,000 pound ($42,000) allowance each year for maintaining and furnishing his official residence, but anything above that must be met by the prime minister.Ministers have said Johnson has paid for the work himself, but it is unclear when he paid, and whether the refurbishment, reported to have cost 200,000 pounds ($280,000) was initially financed by a loan of some kind. Under political financing rules, Johnson would have been required to declare this.Critics say that if the funds had come originally from a Conservative Party supporter, this would raise the question of influence-peddling.Johnson was asked in parliament if the refurbishment was financed by Conservative Party donor David Brownlow."The answer is that I have covered the cost," Johnson said.Dominic Cummings, who was Johnson's main adviser on the Brexit campaign and helped him to win an election in 2019 before an acrimonious split last year, said on Friday that Johnson had wanted donors to pay for the renovation secretly.Cummings said he had told the prime minister such plans were "unethical, foolish, possibly illegal".In a further potentially damaging allegation, the Daily Mail newspaper on Sunday cited unidentified sources as saying that, in October, shortly after agreeing to a second lockdown, Johnson had told a meeting in Downing Street: "No more fucking lockdowns - let the bodies pile high in their thousands."Asked in parliament if he had used those works, Johnson repeatedly denied that he had."No," Johnson said. "I didn't say those words."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uks-johnson-faces-formal-investigation-over-funding-of-apartment-renovation-101619611635271.html
28-04-2021||World||Egyptologists uncover rare tombs from before the Pharaohs||Egyptian archaeologists working on the Nile Delta have uncovered dozens of rare predynastic tombs dating to the period before Egypt's Pharaonic kingdoms first emerged more than 5,000 years ago.They also found tombs nearby from the later Hyksos period (1650 to 1500 B.C.), when Western Asian migrants took over the country, putting an end to Egypt's Middle Kingdom.The findings in the Dakahlia province north of Cairo could shed light on two important transitional periods in ancient Egypt, Egyptologists said.The tombs include 68 from the Buto period that began around 3300 B.C. and five from the Naqada III period, which was just before the emergence of Egypt's first dynasty around 3100 B.C., according to a statement from the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities.They also include 37 tombs from the time of the Hyksos, who first began migrating across the Sinai into Egypt around 1800 B.C."This is an extremely interesting cemetery because it combines some of the earliest periods of Egyptian history with another important era, the time of the Hyksos," said Salima Ikram, an Egyptologist at the American University in Cairo."Egyptologists are working to understand how the Egyptians and the Hyksos lived together and to what degree the former took on Egyptian traditions."The Buto tombs were oval-shaped pits with the corpses placed inside in a squatting position, mostly on their left sides with the head pointing west, the ministry statement said.Some of the tombs from the Naqada period contained cylindrical and pear-shaped vessels.The Hyksos tombs were mainly semi-rectangular with the corpses lying in an extended position and the head also facing west."The mission also found a group of ovens, stoves, remnants of mud brick foundations, pottery vessels and amulets, especially scarabs, some of which were made of semi-precious stones and jewelry such as earrings," the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/egyptologists-uncover-rare-tombs-from-before-the-pharaohs-101619603992113.html

He has encouraged use of medications that scientists say are worthless. Critics say his policies, along with a bungled vaccine campaign, have contributed to the world's second-highest death toll from the coronavirus.While the investigation isn't formally aimed at criminal allegations, it potentially could lead to charges. It's also likely to provide a drumbeat of embarrassing accusations ahead of the 2022 presidential election.Bolsonaro has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and instead blames governors and mayors, saying their restrictions on activity have caused more problems than the coronavirus.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-senate-begins-inquiry-govt-s-handling-of-coronavirus-pandemic-101619608236157.html

28-04-2021||World||US agency revokes Trump-era memo for smoother H-1B visa extension||The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on Tuesday issued policy guidance instructing officers to defer to previous approvals while extending work visas such as H-1B. The guidance instructs officials to generally defer to prior determinations of eligibility when the same parties and facts are involved as in the initial petition.However, the officers may not defer to a prior approval when there is a material error, material change, or new material facts that adversely impacts the petitioner’s, applicant’s, or beneficiary’s eligibility.The US immigration agency has basically restored its policy guidance issue in 2004 which was rescinded during the Trump administration. In 2017, the USCIS rescinded the 2004 guidance, treating each visa extension request as a new application. This requirement led to an increase in additional documentation which increased administrative burden and costs for sponsoring employers.“With this update, USCIS is reverting in substance to prior long-standing guidance issued in 2004, which directed officers to generally defer to prior determinations of eligibility when adjudicating extension requests involving the same parties and facts as the initial petition or application,” the USCIS stated.The agency said that the update in its policy has been made in accordance with US President Joe Biden’s executive order titled ‘Restoring Faith in Our Legal Immigration Systems and Strengthening Integration and Inclusion Efforts for New Americans’. The executive order, issued in February, had directed the secretary of homeland security to identify barriers that impede access to immigration benefits and fair, efficient adjudications of these benefits.“Affording deference to prior approvals involving the same parties promotes efficient and fair adjudication of immigration benefits,” the USCIS added.The Biden administration has undone several Trump-era immigration policies, including the suspension of employment-based nonimmigrant visas. In early April, the US department of state announced that H-1B applicants who were denied a visa due to travel ban can now reapply by submitting a new application. The department also assured that the visa applications of those who have not yet been interviewed or scheduled for an interview will be prioritised and processed in accordance with the existing phased resumption of routine visa services.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agency-revokes-trump-era-memo-for-smoother-h-1b-visa-extension-101619607578916.html
28-04-2021||World||Beijing sees lowest birth rate in 2020, China’s population to decline: Reports||Beijing recorded its lowest number of births in 2020, official data has revealed, with a top expert saying the Chinese capital’s population could start shrinking from 2022, and China’s by 2027.The change in Beijing’s demographics, a city of more than 21 million people, is an indication that the number of people in China could start to decline six years from now, according to a report published in the tabloid Global Times on Wednesday.The number of newborns in Beijing hit a new low in a decade in 2020, decreasing by 32,000 as against the previous year to a total of 100,368.Not just Beijing, a dozen Chinese cities in eastern China’s Zhejiang and southern China’s Guangdong provinces have reported the numbers of newborns in 2020 hitting a new low in the past six to 10 years.The state media report comes a day after the London-based Financial Times newspaper reported that China was poised to report its first population decline in five decades following a once-in-a-decade census, which was completed last December.The FT report said the latest census figures are expected to show China’s population slipping to under 1.4 billion.The statistics from the new census were expected to be released earlier this year, but have been delayed possibly because of the complexities that have emerged around the population figure.The population figure is considered sensitive and won’t be published until government departments have a consensus on the data and its implications, The Financial Times wrote, citing its sources.A population drop will add pressure on Beijing to roll out measures to encourage couples to have more children and avert an irreversible decline, the report said.Overall, the number of babies born in China fell by 580,000 to 14.65 million in 2019 and the birth rate of 10.48 per thousand was the lowest since 1949 when present methods of collating data began, according to the National Bureau of Statistics. The two-child policy implemented from 2016 has failed to make an impact on the low birth rates.Speaking to Global Times, Huang Wenzheng, a demography expert from the Beijing-based think-tank Centre for China and Globalisation, said the narrowing gap between newborns and deaths indicated that the capital city may see more deaths than newborns starting 2022 - which will mark a natural negative growth in population. Huang said it would impede the capital’s economic development.“Beijing’s figures indicated that China’s total population will soon start to decline, which may come before 2027,” Huang said. “A soon-to-decline population is predicted by demographers, which would allow India to replace China as the world’s most populous country, perhaps in 2022, if not this year.”That would be earlier than the prediction of a 2017 UN report, which had said India’s population will surpass China’s by 2024. India’s current population is 1.39 billion.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/beijing-sees-lowest-birth-rate-in-2020-china-s-population-to-decline-reports-101619607399599.html
28-04-2021||World||Joe Biden to pitch sweeping 'family plan' in speech to Congress||Marking his first 100 days in office, President Joe Biden will use his first joint address to Congress to pitch a $1.8 trillion investment in children, families and education that would fundamentally transform the role government plays in American life.Biden will make his case Wednesday night before a pared-down gathering of mask-wearing legislators due to coronavirus restrictions and in a U.S. Capitol still surrounded by black fencing after insurrectionists protesting his election occupied the very dais where he will stand.In the nationally televised ritual of a president standing before Congress, Biden will lay out a sweeping proposal for universal preschool, two years of free community college, $225 billion for child care and monthly payments of at least $250 to parents. His ideas reflect the frailties that were uncovered last year by the pandemic, and he will make the case that economic growth would best come from taxing the rich to help the middle class and the poor.His speech will also provide an update on progress in combating the COVID-19 crisis he was elected to tame, showcasing hundreds of millions of vaccinations and relief checks delivered to help offset the devastation wrought by a virus that has killed more than 573,000 people in the United States. He will also champion his $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan, a staggering figure to be financed solely by higher taxes on corporations.Seizing an opportunity born of generational calamity, Biden has embraced momentous action over incremental progress, with the goal of making the economy fairer and stronger. But he will be forced to thread the needle between Republicans who cry government overreach and some Democrats who fear he won’t go big enough.The Democratic president's strategy is to sidestep the polarization and make his appeal directly to voters. His prime-time speech will underscore a trio of central campaign promises: to manage the deadly pandemic, to turn down the tension in Washington and to restore faith in government as an effective force for good."He is a big-government Democrat, and he has not been at all reluctant to propose big initiatives in a response to a national crisis," said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton University presidential historian.No American politician has more familiarity with the presidential address to Congress than Biden. He spent three decades in the audience as a senator and another eight years seated behind President Barack Obama during the annual address when he was vice president.For the first time on Wednesday, a female vice president, Kamala Harris, will be seated behind the chief executive for the speech.Biden also knows that most of those seated before him have, like he did, looked at the president and envisioned themselves one day in his place. He has heard the memorable phrases and the long list of promises — often unmet — and seen the partisan reactions intensify as the years have hurried by.He chose to delay this speech, typically given in the afterglow of a presidential inaugural. In doing so, he gave himself the chance to not simply speak of the pain of the COVID-19 crisis but also to talk about tangible progress in beating it back.The setting will be unlike for any of his predecessors, with members of Congress spread out and socially distanced and many Republicans citing “scheduling conflicts” to explain their absence. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that Biden's presidency “can best be described as the Biden bait and switch.”“President Biden ran as a moderate, but I’m hard pressed to think of anything at all that he’s done so far that would indicate some degree of moderation," McConnell said.Yet the desire for swift action is born from political necessity. Biden understands that the time for passing his agenda could be perilously short given that president’s parties historically lose congressional seats in the midterm elections, less than two years away. The Democrats’ margins are already razor-thin.Biden will talk to Congress amid the start of a potentially booming recovery, one that could determine whether the U.S. economy can once again fire on all cylinders after a morale-crushing pandemic and a humbling financial crisis with shock waves that linger a dozen years later.In his first three months in office, Biden signed a $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill — passed without a single GOP vote — and has shepherded direct payments of $1,400 per person to more than 160 million households. Hundreds of billions of dollars in aid will soon arrive for state and local governments, enough money that overall U.S. growth this year could eclipse 6% — a level not seen since 1984. Administration officials are betting that it will be enough to bring back all 8.4 million jobs lost to the pandemic by next year.Biden's speech Wednesday is about how to sustain those gains once the debt-financed boost fades. Federal Reserve estimates suggest that the economy will slip to more modest 1.8% growth after at least two years of robust gains, potentially leaving the Biden era with some happy memories but few enduring legacies.New in his Wednesday speech is a “families” plan that could cement his legacy with $1.8 trillion worth of spending over 10 years.A significant amount of the proposal would ensure that eligible families receive at least $250 monthly per child through 2025, extending the enhanced tax credit that was part of Biden’s COVID-19 aid. There would be $200 billion for free preschool for all 3- and 4-year-olds. Another $225 billion would pay for subsidized child care and invest in child care workers.A national paid family and medical leave program would be started at a cost of $225 billion. Another $200 billion would go to permanently reduce health insurance premiums for people who receive coverage through the Affordable Care Act.For $109 billion, people could attend community college tuition-free for two years. There would be $85 billion for Pell Grants to help more people afford higher education. Historically Black and tribal institutions would be eligible to receive $46 billion.Funding all of this would be a series of tax increases on the wealthy that would raise about $1.5 trillion over a decade.Biden wants to boost IRS enforcement and require disclosures by financial institutions, specifically targeting the rich. The White House estimates that would bring in $700 billion over 10 years. He would raise the top tax rate on the most affluent families from 37% to 39.6%. People earning in excess of $1 million a year would see their rate on capital gains — the profits from a sale of a stock or home — nearly double from 20% to 39.6%, which would mean the wealthiest Americans could no longer pay at a lower rate than many families who identify as middle class.The president has drawn a firm red line that no household earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes, a move that both broadened the definition of the middle class and clearly delineated just how extreme inequality has become.Economist Owen Zidar, whose research suggested that capital gains tax hikes could raise meaningful revenues, said the programs funded by the proceeds might allow poorer children to become inventors and entrepreneurs, positions that are increasingly reserved for the offspring of wealthy parents.“There are many missing Einsteins and Elon Musks,” Zidar said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-to-pitch-sweeping-family-plan-in-speech-to-congress-101619603980273.html
28-04-2021||World||Indian-American NGO raises $4.7 million for Covid relief; to ship 2,184 oxygen concentrators||An Indian-American non-profit body has raised nearly $4.7 million through social media towards Covid-19 relief efforts in India as the country battles a severe second wave of the pandemic."This is a collective effort that can save lives, defeat hunger, assure distressed people, and help India in its decisive fight against Covid-19," Sewa International USA said.On Tuesday, Sewa collected a shipment of 2,184 oxygen concentrators to be sent to India.In less than 100 hours of launching the fund-raising campaign, more than 66,700 Indian-Americans came out to raise over $4.7 million for Covid-19 relief efforts in India, it said.Over the last few years, Sewa International USA has emerged as the top Indian-American charity organisation in the US."Right now, our top priority is to quickly acquire oxygen concentrators and ship them to India as it can save lives. We are also providing support to hospitals run by Sewa's partner organizations to extend their capacity to treat more coronavirus-infected patients," the organisation said.Sewa's volunteers are working on building a digital helpdesk to provide critical information such as ambulance service, hospital bed availability and blood and medicinal supplies to people, it added."As the pandemic is causing economic hardships by forcing partial lockdowns, we are planning to distribute over 10,000 essential item kits to families and assist more than 1,000 orphanages and senior care centres," Sewa said."Working closely with our partner organisations, we are also distributing food and medicines to the needy in multiple places," it added.American Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (APPI), the largest ethnic medical organisation in the country, on Tuesday announced a nationwide campaign for medical oxygen, tele-consult and educational webinars to help combat Covid-19 in India."This is the time for immediate AAPI action. As doctors, we all share a visceral urge to do something about it," said Dr Sudhakar Jonnalgadda, AAPI president."We have located a source manufacturer that supplies oxygen concentrators, each of which can save several lives in India. The cost of each unit is around $500," he said."AAPI, with the collaboration of numerous members, has placed orders for securing and delivering 200 oxygen concentrators directly to hospitals in India with the help of SEWA International, a reliable non-profit organisation," Jonnalgadda said.The US India Chamber of Commerce DFW and the Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston – both from Texas – in partnership with the USICOC Foundation shipped out the first batch of 20 ventilators to the Indian Red Cross Society in Delhi to be disbursed to hospitals and field teams in hard-hit areas, a media statement said."It is our moral obligation to help India in every way that we can during this time of need. We will continue to provide support as long as it takes to bring the situation to normal," said Ashok Mago, founding chairman of the US India Chamber, who helped coordinate many of the necessary funds for the effort.Another next 30 ventilators are scheduled to ship out in the next few days.Jagdip Ahluwalia from the Indo American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Houston, who was coordinating efforts from the Houston area, said members of the organisation are coordinating with hospitals, NGOs, medical schools and government bodies in India to make sure the equipment is getting to trained professionals, who can put it to immediate use.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indianamerican-ngo-raises-4-7-million-for-covid-relief-101619600099545.html
28-04-2021||World||China wants to improve genetics of its pigs so they produce more meat and eat less||China will work to improve the genetics of its hog herd and other livestock in the coming decade with the aim of breeding animals that produce more meat and -- at the same time - consume less grains.Sow herd productivity is about 30% lower than in developed countries and dairy cows produce only 80% of the milk than their peers in some leading markets, Shi Jianzhong, an official with the agriculture ministry’s National Livestock and Poultry Genetic Resources Committee told reporters on Wednesday. China has to rely on overseas stock to produce white-feathered broiler chickens, he said.The drive to improve livestock genetics is part of China’s goal of relying less on imports to feed its massive and increasingly affluent population. However, the nation will continue to bring in animals from overseas to improve its domestic stock to catch up faster with advanced countries, said Chen Yaosheng, an official at the ministry’s National Pig Genetic Improvement Program.Millions of tons of feed grains will be saved and pressure on land will ease if hog quality can be improved to match that in advanced countries, said Sun Haoqin, another official on the livestock genetics committee. The move will also support China’s shift to industrialized hog and chicken farms, he said.China flew in 10,433 live swine worth $25 million in the first quarter, with the imports mainly coming from Denmark and the US, customs data show.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-wants-to-improve-genetics-of-its-pigs-so-they-produce-more-meat-and-eat-less-101619601379569.html
28-04-2021||World||Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning sails between Japanese islands||Japan's Defense Ministry on Wednesday confirmed that a Chinese aircraft carrier Liaoning after passing through waters between two Japanese islands returned to the East China Sea from the Pacific.The ministry said the Maritime Self-Defense Force confirmed that during the period from Monday to Tuesday the Liaoning, accompanied by five other vessels, sailed northward between Okinawa's main island and Miyakojima Island, and then entered the East China Sea, reported NHK World.Early in April, the fleet was seen sailing south in the same area and entering the Pacific.This is the second time that the Chinese aircraft carrier has passed between the two Japanese islands on a round trip.The Defense Ministry also said that, after entering the East China Sea, an early warning helicopter was viewed taking off from the Liaoning and coming around 50 to 100 kilometers to the northeast of Taisho Island, part of Japan's Senkaku Islands. This prompted the Air Self-Defense Force's aircraft to scramble.Japan controls the Senkaku islands. The Japanese government maintains the islands are an inherent part of Japan's territory. China and Taiwan claim them.The Defense Ministry said that the helicopter did not violated Japan's airspace. It added that the Chinese fleet did not violated Japan's territorial waters, reported NHK World.Meanwhile, Japan has welcomed the United Kingdom's plan to deploy a fleet led by its new flagship HMS Queen Elizabeth, to the Indo-Pacific region.Beijing announced earlier this month that the aircraft carrier group had conducted a naval exercise in the waters near Taiwan.Indo-Pacific region is largely viewed as an area comprising the Indian Ocean and the western and central Pacific Ocean, including the South China Sea.China's territorial claims in the South China Sea and its efforts to advance into the Indian Ocean are seen to have challenged the established rules-based system.China claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea and has overlapping territorial claims with Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Vietnam and Taiwan.China has been increasing its maritime activities in both the South China Sea and the East China Sea over the past few months, partly in response to Beijing's concerns over the increasing US military presence in the region because of escalating Sino-US tensions.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-aircraft-carrier-liaoning-sails-between-japanese-islands-101619601420874.html
28-04-2021||World||Where can you fly right now? India’s Covid outbreak stalls global travel rebound||The ferocious surge in new coronavirus cases that has turned India into the global pandemic hotspot has also reversed one of the airline industry’s biggest travel comebacks. Carriers in India had reached 87% of their pre-pandemic seat capacity through early April, based on a Bloomberg analysis of data from flight tracker OAG. That progress has now unraveled as the surge in infections led to a pullback in domestic flights, which make up the vast majority of the market.As of the start of this week, capacity had fallen to 71% of 2019 levels, a 16 percentage-point drop over three weeks, the data show. Further eroding demand is a move by nations including Singapore, Australia, the U.K. and the United Arab Emirates to impose restrictions on visitors from India. Using weekly OAG data, Bloomberg has built a flight tracker to monitor the pulse of the global air-travel comeback. The latest update shows continued progress in China, while plans to increase capacity in the U.S. and Europe haven't yet taken hold. With operators still canceling flights from India, the number of seats offered globally may have fallen slightly from last week.What’s Happening in Air Travel This WeekIndia’s expansive domestic network made it one of the world’s fastest-growing countries for aviation before the recent Covid-19 outbreak. Short-haul carriers such as IndiGo propelled India to the world’s third-largest market. And earlier on in the pandemic, the South Asian country of 1.4 billion people won plaudits for enforcing strict social distancing rules that lowered the infection rate. But now the country’s public health system is being overwhelmed by an aggressive surge in cases, with daily infections exceeding 300,000.As the outbreak overwhelms the nation’s hospitals and crematoriums,  an upturn in air travel won’t happen until the latest crisis is contained, said Rob Morris, the head of consultancy at U.K. aviation advisory firm Cirium.“It looks as though things will get worse for the Indian aviation industry before they get better,’’ Morris said. The Path AheadAmong major economies, only Thailand and Turkey have seen even bigger setbacks, though neither had made it back as far as India. With airlines still cancelling flights and countries throwing up more barriers, India’s market could plummet to as little as 25% of normal, says John Grant, chief analyst at OAG. Reacting to surging cases, Turkey imposed a three-week lockdown. Thailand, too, could be forced to tighten restrictions on businesses and travel as an outbreak that began from nightlife venues in Bangkok overwhelms hospitals and healthcare facilities.The reversal in India “highlights how fragile the recovery is and will be in the coming months as incidents like this occur elsewhere,’’ Grant said.  India’s troubles have already spilled over into connected markets. A blossoming trade in getaway flights to the Maldives has now faded. The same has happened with non-stop journeys that had been added by U.S. carriers such as United Airlines Holdings Inc. and American Airlines Group Inc. earlier in the crisis.The U.S. airlines have been using the flights to replace a fraction of the international business they’ve lost to the pandemic. At the start of the outbreak last year, India suspended regular international travel rules that would typically see many long-distance passengers routed through connecting hubs such as Doha and Dubai.It’s not just U.S. airlines that had hoped to claw back some international business with the help of India. The three big Persian Gulf carriers — Dubai-based Emirates, Abu Dhabi-based Etihad Airways and Qatar Airways in Doha — have wrestled for market share in India over the years.But in the wake of the latest outbreaks, the UAE -- home to Emirates and Etihad -- has halted incoming flights. Qatar, meanwhile has kept flying, consistent with its strategy of using the pandemic to gain market share, particularly from larger arch-rival Emirates.“It will frustrate their recoveries for sure, especially as these markets have a large proportion of local traffic and therefore were not requiring complex connecting travel requirements,’’ Grant said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/where-can-you-fly-right-now-india-s-covid-outbreak-stalls-global-travel-rebound-101619600275168.html

Particularly the attention is on the oral for the world and of us because provides several advantages and one of them is that you don't need to go to the hospital to get the treatment of which is the case with all the injectables so far but you can get it home," Bourla told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday, as cited by The Hill."If all goes well, and we implement the same speed that we are, and if regulators do the same, and they are, I hope that by the end of the year," Bourla added.The only antiviral currently approved for use against the coronavirus is Remdesivir, which is manufactured by Gilead Sciences. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) gave the drug full approval in October after it was granted emergency use authorization in May last year.He also said the medication could be "way more effective against the multiple variants" of the virus than current options adding that the mechanism of action, of the antiviral, is not expected to be subject to mutations, "particularly because it's not acting on the spike, as we all know, all the mutations that we are hearing right now are seeing this in the proteins of the spike.""This one doesn't work there so that allows us to believe that will be way more effective against the multiple variants. So, all good news. We are now progressing the studies and we will have more news around summer," the CEO added.The Hill further reported that thus far, more than 121 million doses of the vaccine have been administered across the United States.

Trudeau said on Tuesday, “It’s something the Canadians are extremely concerned about as we see the terrible and tragic images coming out of India. We know we have to be there for our friends.”It came after Canada’s foreign minister Marc Garneau spoke to India’s external affairs minister S Jaishankar on Tuesday to offer Ottawa’s assistance during the escalating crisis. “We are there to support in any way we can, and those conversations are very much ongoing,” Trudeau said. Also, there is package of physical materials being worked on, which will include oxygen concentrators, ventilators and pharma products from Canada’s emergency stockpile as Ottawa has assured India during a dialogue between the governments of its solidarity and commitment to render all aid possible.Those conversations are continuing as Canada’s public services and procurement minister Anita Anand said she, along with Garneau and international development minister Karina Gould, were “coordinating to ensure that we are mounting as much assistance as possible”. Anand said she had spoken with Canada’s high commissioner in New Delhi, Nadir Patel, and his Indian counterpart in Ottawa, Ajay Bisaria, to “ascertain the precise supplies that are needed in India and how best Canada can support the needs that India clearly has and that we clearly want to lend a hand with”.Gould meanwhile said, “Canada stands with the people of India as they go through these difficult times. This funding will help meet some of the most urgent medical needs like purchasing and distributing essential supplies as well as supporting vital blood and ambulance services.”As the Canadian government steps forward, community groups have been active in organising relief material and support for India. The Indo-Canada Chamber of Commerce (ICCC) has started an awareness campaign to point donors to organisations so engaged. ICCC president Vijay Thomas issued an appeal to the chamber’s members and stakeholders, informing them of the medicines and medical equipment urgently needed in India. It has identified charitable organisations functioning in the Indo-Canada corridor.One group, Vraj Community Services, has announced a drive in collaboration with South Asian Health Network to send oxygen generators with a capacity over eight litres each for distribution through Indian partners and NGOs to hospitals in the worst-hit areas. ICCC members have contributed towards purchasing 100 such generators. TiE Toronto has sent 100 oxygen concentrators, due to reach India on Wednesday, for distribution to tier two and tier three cities. The Freedom from Poverty Trust is providing oxygen cylinders for free to those in Lucknow that can’t afford them. Its founder, Montreal-based Shivendra Dwivedi, said that working with their partner, Comprehensive Rural Health Project in Jamkhed, Maharashtra, they have converted a hospital being jointly run there into a dedicated Covid-19 facility and is treating 92 patients admitted there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-sending-rs-60-crore-fiscal-support-to-india-for-pandemic-response-101619587296925.html

That's what's going to help to bring that kind of broad-based prosperity back... President Trump built the strongest economy our country has ever seen, and I am going to fight to bring it back," Greitens said.According to The Hill, former Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel also mentioned Trump's a dozen times in a press release announcing his campaign to replace retiring Senator Rob Portman."Josh Mandel was proud to be the first statewide elected official in Ohio to support President Trump in 2016 when others were supporting John Kasich. After seeing the second sham impeachment take place this February, Josh was motivated to run for the U.S. Senate to continue to fight for President Trump's America First agenda," said Scott Guthrie, Mandel's campaign manager.Meanwhile, Former Ohio Republican Party Chair Jane Timken called on Representative Anthony Gonzalez, one of the ten House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump in January, to resign.Trump remains the best fundraiser within the Republican Party. Several strategists said the average email solicitation with Trump's signature raises much more than an email without his name, The Hill reported.The ex-US president has so far endorsed eight Senators facing reelection next year, along with Brooks in Alabama and two candidates running for Congress.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-republicans-embrace-trump-for-2022-senate-elections-101619585505780.html
28-04-2021||World||Kamala Harris takes on 'hard work' in 100 days as Vice President||When President Joe Biden named Kamala Harris as his running mate, there were whispers about her ambition — would a former rival be a loyal soldier to a president she so sharply criticized on the campaign trail?Fueling those whispers was their relationship — while cordial, it was initially not particularly close.But 100 days into Biden's term, things look very different. Harris has become one of the administration’s most prominent advocates for Biden's agenda, standing alongside him at most of his major announcements and building a relationship that aides say is closer than most presidents had with their seconds-in-command.Harris has taken on one of the administration’s toughest tasks — addressing the root causes of migration to the U.S. from Mexico and Central America. The problem has bedeviled presidents from both parties for years and has no easy solutions.Tina Flournoy, Harris' chief of staff, said the vice president has “taken it on with gusto."“She has said to me, ‘When you decide you’re going to run for office and your name is on the ballot, next to it are not two boxes that say, ‘easy work’ and ‘hard work,'" Flournoy said.Of the hard problems, Flournoy added: “Are we supposed to ignore them because they’re hard? Or are we supposed to really dig in and try to fix them?”The COVID-19 pandemic has been the administration’s greatest challenge during its first 100 days. The public health and economic crisis of historic proportions has forced the White House to work differently from Day One of Biden’s tenure.The pandemic sharply limited travel by the president and vice president, which has had at least one silver lining: Because Harris hasn’t been on the move as much as past vice presidents early on, she’s spent more time with Biden, helping to cement their relationship. The two have had lunch every Friday, and on a typical day may spend four to five hours in meetings together, which ensures that her voice is heard and her fingerprints are left on major policy decisions, aides say. They point to the expansion of the child tax credit and child care funding as examples of her priorities.Harris had a role in developing Biden's agenda and "also the strategy of selling it, both to the American people, and on the Hill,” Flournoy said.Aides say Harris has also shown enthusiasm for some less-glamorous aspects of the administration’s $2.3 trillion infrastructure plan as she’s been promoting it — such as water issues, with which she had experience during her time as a U.S. senator for California, broadband access and provisions expanding electric vehicle use.Being the nation’s first Black, South Asian and female vice president informs her office in ways both big and small. And she will have a prominent place behind Biden on Wednesday as he addresses a joint session of Congress for the first time.Harris has chosen to champion issues that have been top priorities for much of her career and reflect her own lived experience. She told aides on her first day in office that she wanted to focus on relief to small businesses. She’s also focused on policies that affect women and children, including Black maternal mortality. And she has homed in on the disproportionate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and sluggish economy on women and people of color.Harris has decorated her office with small nods to her historic role: a bust of abolitionist Frederick Douglass, donated by her alma mater, Howard University, along with the shoulder bars from the first Black female brigade commander at the U.S. Naval Academy.Her support for the president and his agenda may have strengthened their relationship, but it's left some advocates wanting more from her on two major issues — criminal justice reform and immigration.On criminal justice reform — one of her campaign priorities — Harris has hardly been out front. While she’s spoken alongside Biden in response to recent mass shootings, and at an event announcing his executive orders on guns, the administration as a whole hasn’t made a significant public push on the issue.Andrea James, executive director and founder of the National Council for Incarcerated and Formerly Incarcerated Women & Girls, said that considering Harris is “a woman of color, her history, her pride and speaking about her mom who was a brave and courageous woman and fought obstacles because of the color of her skin,” they expected to see more from her speaking out on the issue.Aides say Harris is making calls to Capitol Hill and working on the criminal justice issue behind the scenes.On immigration, Harris has been hammered from the left and right as she's taken on her new role addressing the root causes of migration at the southern border.While Republicans have criticized Biden and Harris as absent on the issue because they haven't visited the border yet, progressive immigration groups complain the administration hasn't done enough to push for a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.Lorella Praeli, president of Community Change Action, said Harris was a “true champion for immigrants" as a senator and it was important that she now “lean in and she help to carry this issue."Some of Harris’ allies have expressed concerns that the problem is so amorphous and intractable that there’s no clear solution, and that Harris will be judged harshly even if she makes progress.The concern arises in part from a desire to protect Harris’ political future. While Biden insists he plans on running for reelection, many political observers believe he’ll decide against it, clearing a path for Harris.Experts and advocates focused on immigration say it’s too early to judge the outcome of her work there. Harris has thus far had conversations with the leaders of Mexico and Guatemala, and is planning her first trip to the region in June.Dan Restrepo, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress who’s been in meetings on the issue with Harris, said “she asks very good questions” and her early move to bring together experts on the migrant crisis “is a really encouraging sign.” He also pushed back against criticism that Harris doesn’t have the experience to tackle the issue.“I think the skill set that she brings to the table, as a successful politician and somebody who gets people, is probably the most important translatable skill,” he said.That human approach, aides say, shapes her approach to everything from policy to diplomacy.“She will emphasize that we need to speak directly with the American people, that she doesn’t want to just give rhetoric,” said Rohini Kosoglu, Harris' domestic policy adviser.When Harris is briefed before calling or meeting a foreign leader, she wants more than just the political topline, asking about the leader's hobbies and interests, ”so she has a real sense of the person,” Flournoy said. When she spoke with the Japanese prime minister earlier this month, she wanted to know about his love of baseball.And when she swears in new Cabinet members at her ceremonial office in the executive office building across from the White House, Flournoy says, Harris asks them to take a moment to be present, and tells them to think about “all the reasons you’re here and all the work you’re going to do."Then she brings them out on her balcony to look at the American flag flying high over the West Wing.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/kamala-harris-takes-on-hard-work-in-100-days-as-vice-president-101619584094567.html
28-04-2021||World||Hope Biden asks Pfizer to allow India to develop its vaccines, says Congressman Ro Khanna||With millions of lives at stake amid a rapid spread of COVID-19, Indian-American Congressman Ro Khanna said he hoped President Joe Biden would call the Pfizer CEO to let India produce its vaccine at least for six months or a year.Khanna, who represents Silicon Valley in the US House of Representatives, has been an ardent supporter of the move by India and South Africa at the World Trade Organization (WTO) for Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) waiver of COVID-19 vaccines."Allow India to develop that vaccine, and this is good in your own long-term interests. It's good for the United States and our interests with the role with India and the rest of the world," Khanna told the media.Major pharma companies like Pfizer and Moderna and organisations like the US Chambers of Commerce are opposing such a move.A day earlier, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai spoke with the CEOs of Pfizer and AstraZeneca regarding the TRIPS waiver, which is slated to come up before the WTO on May 5."I do know there are very senior people in the administration who are supportive of it. We are making the case to the White House. And my hope is that the President would at least call the Pfizer CEO and say, look, your long-term strategy in India, a huge market, just in your economic interest, at least waive it for six months or a year," Khanna said.Microsoft founder and eminent philanthropist Bill Gates in a media interview on Monday opposed the move.Asked about it, Khanna said, "I rarely think Bill Gates is wrong, but this is a case I hope he will engage. The point that Bill Gates made about manufacturing capacity being restricted is absolutely correct. But what I said is why not have a global fund, USD25 billion, to help with manufacturing capacity and then allow the vaccine recipes to be shared.""You're not going to have a lack of quality control. I think it is patronising to say that 100 other nations can't have a regulatory process to make sure that manufacturing is safe. They can and the World Health Organization can," he added."No one is asking Pfizer to manufacture these vaccines, no one is saying they need to do it for free. It's important to understand, they will get paid. They will be able to sell it. The reason they're not doing it would be pure greed," Khanna said.The United States government gave a USD2 billion guarantee to Pfizer to purchase vaccines."If it weren't for that, Pfizer would have never been able to do what they did. Our NIH gave the IP that allowed Moderna to develop the vaccine," he argued."What we're now saying is that they should share the vaccine recipe with over 100 countries who want to do the manufacturing. They're willing to do the manufacturing themselves, they need to have contract manufacturing. Pfizer would still get paid. Moderna would still get paid. But it is just wrong, morally wrong, strategically wrong for them not to share the vaccine recipe, which was developed with US taxpayer support," Khanna further said.He applauded Biden for committing to help India in its fight against the virus."But we also ultimately need to get vaccines to India. The president has said that he will release the AstraZeneca vaccine, which Americans are not going to use after it's deemed safe. But more important is Pfizer and Moderna need to license the vaccine recipe to allow India and other countries to manufacture it," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-biden-asks-pfizer-to-allow-india-to-develop-its-vaccines-says-congressman-ro-khanna-101619577044752.html

It's hard to take," Francois Legault, the premier of Quebec, told a news conference.The French-speaking province's chief public health officer Horacio Arruda said life-saving treatments did not work and the unidentified patient died of cerebral thrombosis after being vaccinated.But he cautioned that the death should not change the government's recommendations to use the vaccine for those over 45 years old."We knew about serious complications, there was one in 100,000 (doses administered). But we must remember that, to date, we have had more than 400,000 people who have been vaccinated with AstraZeneca," Quebec health minister Christian Dube added.As of last Friday, just over 1.1 million AstraZeneca doses had been administered nationwide.Only four other cases of blood clots associated with low platelets have been reported in the country, and each patient recovered.Prime Minister Justin Trudeau received an AstraZeneca shot on Friday.On Tuesday, the Canadian leader said about 60 soldiers had been deployed to overwhelmed hospitals in Nova Scotia to help care for critical patients.The day before about 30 army nurses and health technicians were sent to reinforce hospital staff in Ontario, which is struggling with a new wave of infections led by variants.In Quebec, which has suffered the most Covid deaths of any region in the country, the latest data showed rates of infections were slowing, allowing the government to announce it was pushing the start of a nightly curfew in Montreal from 8 pm to 9:30 pm (0130 GMT) starting next Monday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-reports-first-death-linked-to-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101619574904979.html

They are now back home and recuperating, she added.The first-ever Indian-American Congresswoman who represents Seattle in the US House of Representatives was recently in India to meet her ailing parents."It was rough. I've got to say both my parents are there. They're 80 and 90 years old. They were both diagnosed with COVID. They both ended up in the hospital. My dad needed oxygen," she told the media on Tuesday."Now in retrospect, I'm almost glad -- it's a strange thing to say that it happened when it did, because they were at the beginning of the surge. I'm not sure they could have gotten into the hospital or gotten oxygen had they not been. They are thankfully home and recuperating," Jayapal said."They've made it through the roughest time. And I think the fact that they got the first dose of the vaccine four weeks before actually helped to limit their symptoms. But we saw it happening," the Indian-American Congresswoman said.Jayapal said she was there in India with her parents as the cases started ramping up."I'm talking to my parents every day and I'm hearing, just the fear that everyone has because this is so extreme, it's coming so quickly. We pushed very hard to make sure, and we're grateful to the (US) President (Joe Biden) for making sure that we can get those raw materials (for the manufacture of COVID-19 vaccines in India) over there," she said.Applauding Biden for his statement on India, Jayapal said those things are going to start happening right away.The CDC is also sending a team to assist India. "That is immediate because there are no hospital beds. I saw it just in my little area, that hospital was completely full," she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/it-was-rough-pramila-jayapal-reveals-parents-tested-positive-for-covid19-101619570251749.html

That would extend an SEC crackdown on a deal frenzy in SPACs, which the regulator worries is putting investors at risk.Musk has had his own run-ins with the SEC. He reached a settlement with the regulator after he tweeted in August 2018 that he had "funding secured" to potentially take Tesla private in a $72 billion transaction. In reality, Musk was not close to acquiring funding.Musk and Tesla each paid $20 million in civil fines, and Tesla lawyers agreed to vet some of Musk's tweets in advance.Musk was sued by a shareholder last month who accused him of violating his 2018 settlement with the SEC. The case is ongoing.Musk also tweeted earlier on Tuesday that he found the Federal Communications Commission, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the Federal Aviation Administration to be "fair & sensible" and that he agreed with them "99.9% of the time"."On rare occasions, we disagree. This is almost always due to new technologies that past regulations didn't anticipate", he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/elon-musk-says-us-sec-is-sometimes-too-close-to-wall-street-hedge-funds-101619570025225.html
28-04-2021||World||US senators urge President Biden to impose more sanctions against Myanmar junta||A bipartisan group of U.S. senators on Tuesday urged the Biden administration to slap more sanctions on the military junta in Myanmar, including choking revenues to a state energy company, in response to its coup and violent crackdown on protesters.Senators Jeff Merkley, a Democrat, and Marco Rubio, a Republican, and four others urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen in a letter to "explore new avenues to support the people of Burma in their ongoing struggle for democracy in the face of escalating crimes against humanity."They want the Biden administration to stop royalties flowing from businesses including U.S. energy major Chevron Corp to Myanmar Oil and Gas Enterprise, or MOGE, an agency within the Energy Ministry. MOGE provides financial support to military leaders, including General Min Aung Hlaing, already under U.S. sanctions.MOGE is a partner in Yadana, a natural gas field in which Chevron has a 28.3% stake.Human rights groups have urged energy companies including Chevron and Total to cut ties to Myanmar after the military ousted the democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi on Feb. 1, detaining her and cracking down on protesters. More than 750 people have since been killed.Gas revenues from joint ventures involving companies like Total and Chevron are the most significant single source of foreign exchange revenue for the Myanmar government, generating cash payments of about $1.1 billion annually, the senators said.They proposed the ventures pay revenue into a trust to be held until Myanmar has a democratically elected government or to be used for humanitarian purposes, according to the letter, a copy of which was seen by Reuters.A Chevron representative said any diversion of revenues or taxes owed to MOGE into an escrow account "could be considered a breach of contract and potentially put employees of the joint venture partners at undue risk of criminal prosecution."Total did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The State and Treasury departments did not immediately respond.Chevron paid around $50 million to Myanmar between 2014 and 2018, according to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, which works to increase transparency in international business.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-senators-urge-president-biden-to-impose-more-sanctions-against-myanmar-junta-101619569541569.html

But the most recent data, was looking at convalescent Sera of COVID-19 cases and people who received the vaccine used in India, the Covaxin. It was found to neutralise the 617 variant," he said."So, despite the real difficulty that we're seeing in India, vaccination could be a very, very important antidote against this," Fauci added.The New York Times on Tuesday said Covaxin works by teaching the immune system to make antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. The antibodies attach to viral proteins, such as the so-called spike proteins that stud its surface.Developed by Bharat Biotech in partnership with National Institute of Virology and the Indian Council of Medical Research, Covaxin was approved for emergency use on January 3. Trial results later showed the vaccine has an efficacy of 78 per cent.Responding to a question, Dr Andy Slavitt, White House COVID-19 Response Senior Advisor, said that a strike team from the Center for Disease Control and Prevention is headed over to India to help coordinate this response."We are making sure that we are locating some of the raw materials necessary to create more vaccines in India, which I think is going to be an important help there," he said."We stand with the country of India during this very trying and tragic surge. We are working to deploy resources and supplies, including therapeutics, rapid testing kits, ventilators, PPE, and raw materials, that are needed to manufacture vaccines in India, and the CDC, which has a long history of working with and in India on public health measures, will be deploying a strike team to the country to support the public health efforts there," Slavitt said.Given the strong portfolio of approved, highly effective and safe vaccines here in the United States, the administration is looking at options to share AstraZeneca vaccines with other countries as they become available.This should amount to around 60 million doses or so over the next two months, he added."The AstraZeneca vaccine is highly safe and effective, and approved in many parts of the world, and since it is not approved for use in the US, we do not need to use the AstraZeneca vaccine here during the next few months," Slavitt said."We have sufficient supply of vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson & Johnson to accommodate our needs in the US," he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indias-covaxin-found-to-neutralise-617-variant-of-covid-19-says-dr-fauci-101619569155683.html
28-04-2021||World||UK government green lights 'self-driving' cars on motorways||The UK government on Wednesday became the first country to announce it will regulate the use of self-driving vehicles at slow speeds on motorways, with the first such cars possibly appearing on public roads as soon as this year.Britain's transport ministry said it was working on specific wording to update the country's highway code for the safe use of self-driving vehicle systems, starting with Automated Lane Keeping Systems (ALKS) - which use sensors and software to keep cars within a lane, allowing them to accelerate and brake without driver input.The government said the use of ALKS would be restricted to motorways, at speeds under 37 miles (60 km) per hour.The UK government wants to be at the forefront of rolling out autonomous driving technology and the transport ministry forecasts by 2035 around 40% of new UK cars could have self-driving capabilities, creating up to 38,000 new skilled jobs."The automotive industry welcomes this vital step to permit the use of automated vehicles on UK roads, which will put Britain in the vanguard of road safety and automotive technology," Mike Hawes, CEO of car industry lobby group the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said in a statement.But insurance companies warn that Britain's goal of being a leader in adopting self-driving cars could backfire unless automakers and regulators spell out the current limitations of the technology available today.They say calling ALKS 'automated,' or using the synonymous term 'self-driving', will confuse British drivers into thinking the cars can drive themselves, causing accidents and risking a public backlash against the technology."Aside from the lack of technical capabilities, by calling ALKS automated our concern also is that the UK Government is contributing to the confusion and frequent misuse of assisted driving systems that have unfortunately already led to many tragic deaths," said Matthew Avery, research director at Thatcham Research, which has tested ALKS systems.The dangers of drivers apparently misunderstanding the limits of technology has been an issue in the United States, where regulators are reviewing about 20 crashes involving Tesla's driver assistance tools, such as its 'Autopilot' system.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-government-green-lights-self-driving-cars-on-motorways-101619568508169.html

The higher risk comes from closer contact between passengers in the same rows clustering in the aisle as they stow their luggage.Delta adopted back-to-front boarding to “minimize contact with other customers,” according to its website, though the U.S. airline only boards 10 passengers at a time. The change was among several across the industry -- including blocking out middle seats --- to persuade passengers it is safe to get back on a plane.Scientists from institutions including the University of West Florida and Florida State University simulated 16,000 possible passenger movements for the study. “The new policies do not improve on the old ones in any situation,” they said. Delta’s media office didn’t reply to an email seeking comment.The risk of virus exposure could be reduced by stopping people using overhead storage bins, and by boarding passengers in window seats before those in aisle seats, according to the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/covid19-risk-greater-if-passengers-board-plane-back-to-front-finds-study-101619567574286.html

In all, we recovered 90 vials worth ₹4.86 lakh (each costing ₹5,400) from the five persons."They were selling each vial for up toRs 20,000. They confessed to have sold around 300 injections till now and had planned to sell another 300 in the black market," he said.He said the kingpin of the racket was Jatin Patel, who runs a pharmaceutical agency in Anand and used to procure Remdesivir from one Vivek Shah, who runs a pharmacy.The alleged role of Vivek Shah in the racket is under investigation, Singh said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remdesivir-vials-worth-rs-5-lakh-seized-in-gujarat-5-nabbed-101619630383194.html
28-04-2021||India||Re-registration of passenger vehicles becomes easier with 'IN' series. Know how||The ministry of road transport and highways (MoRTH) issued a new notification on Wednesday for draft rules to make the process of re-registration of vehicles easier for those shifting from one state to another, through the introduction of an ‘IN series’ of vehicles. This move marks the efforts of the government to introduce citizen-centric steps and IT-backed solutions for vehicle registration, the ministry said“The step comes in the context of several citizen-centric steps and an IT-based solution for vehicle registration taken by the government,” the ministry said in a press release.Issues of re-registration of vehicles on relocating from one state to another fall under section 47 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988. The act allows the owner to keep their vehicle in any state other than the state where the vehicle is originally registered (parent state) for a period of 12 months, as new registrations have to be made with the authorities concerned within 12 months.Under the existing rules, individuals need a no-objection certificate from the parent state and the road tax has to be paid in the new state on a pro-rata basis. Owners also have to start the process of refund of the road tax paid for the vehicle in the previous state on a pro-rata basis. This process is often cumbersome and the rules vary from one state to another.Keeping this in mind, the ministry has proposed a new system of vehicle registration on a pilot basis -- wherein vehicle registration would be marked as ‘IN’ series instead of bearing the parent state’s initials, which is applicable at present. The draft rule has been put up on the ministry's website inviting comments from states and UTs in the next 30 days.“Vehicle registration facilities under ‘IN series’ will be available to Defence personnel, employees of the Central Government, State Governments, Central/ State PSUs and private sector companies/ organisations, which have offices in five or more States or Union Territories,” the ministry said in the release.The motor tax on ‘IN series’ vehicles will be levied for two years or in multiple of two. The ministry expects this move to facilitate free inter-state movement of vehicles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/reregistration-of-passenger-vehicles-becomes-easier-with-in-series-know-how-101619629787833.html
28-04-2021||India||'Appalled,' says Chidambaram on govt’s denial of oxygen shortage, vaccines||Congress leader P Chidambaram on Wednesday criticised the government over its handling of the pandemic and asked if all media reports as well the cries for help ringing out of every adversely affected state were fake.“Are all the television channels telecasting fake visuals? Are all the newspaper stories incorrect? Are all the doctors lying? Are all the family members making false statements? Are all the visuals and photographs fake?” the former finance minister said via a series of tweets.He also said that he was ‘appalled’ by health minister Harsh Vardhan’s statement that the country is not facing a shortage of oxygen or Remdesivir. Both oxygen and Remdesivir are considered vital for critical Covid-19 patients as timely administration is vital for saving the life of the person infected by Covid-19. He also said he was surprised by the claim made by Uttar Pradesh chief minister Yogi Adityanath that the state was not facing a shortage of vaccines.“I am appalled by the statement of the Union Health Minister that there is no shortage of oxygen or vaccines or Remedesivir. I am also appalled by the statement of the UP. Chief Minister that there is no shortage of vaccines in UP,” Chidambaram said. Earlier on Monday, health minister Harsh Vardhan had said that India is better prepared to tackle Covid-19 this year compared to 2020.The government on Monday during the Covid-19 briefing highlighted that there is enough oxygen in the country but transportation remains a major challenge. Chidambaram also said that people need to ‘revolt’ against any government which assumes that all Indians are foolish. “People must revolt against a government that is assuming all the people of India are fools,” he said.Several nations have come to India’s aid to help it tide over the crisis presented by the second wave of Covid-19. The US, UK, Germany, Taiwan, Australia and France along with several other nations have come forward to bolster India’s response to Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/appalled-says-chidambaram-on-govt-s-denial-of-oxygen-shortage-vaccines-101619629628423.html

She holds the rank of an executive engineer. Vaishali will be discharging her duties in a challenging environment. “With two air- maintained detachments located at #10000ft and above, the alignment of road is going through some formidable passes and treacherous terrain of hard rock with vertical cliffs,” the BRO said on Twitter, giving the description of the work lying ahead for the woman officer. Vaishali, who has an M Tech degree, is from Wardha in Maharashtra. She is taking over the new assignment as CO after a successful stint in the Kargil sector, the officials said. “This is a humble beginning by @BROindia that will usher a new era of #Women Empowerment that will see women officers taking over most arduous tasks. #History in making,” the BRO said in another tweet. Last year, the BRO constructed key roads and tunnels in forward areas along the China border amidst the Covid-19 pandemic and the border standoff between India and China in the Ladakh sector. BRO is building strategic roads in Ladakh, Jammu and Kashmir, Uttarakhand, Himachal Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. It plans to complete all 61 strategic roads assigned to it along the China border by December 2022 to allow swifter mobilisation of troops and stores to forward areas.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bros-first-woman-commanding-officer-to-handle-road-project-near-china-border-101619628399779.html
28-04-2021||India||First US consignment of support materials expected by Friday, India asks for vaccines||With the first consignment of US support materials for India’s Covid-19 response expected to arrive by Friday, people familiar with developments said on Wednesday that India has sought ready-to-use vaccines from the Biden administration. The government’s international procurement programme is currently focused on critical medicines such as Remdesivir and oxygen-related equipment, especially concentrators, cylinders and large and small liquid oxygen tanks, that can be used to ramp up the supply of oxygen across the country. The first Russian consignment of support materials too is expected to arrive in the country on Thursday and the first batch of the Russian Sputnik V vaccine is set to reach India by the end of the month, the people said on condition of anonymity. Details of the first consignment being sent by the US are still being worked out, though it is expected to contain a mix of equipment and supplies and some of the materials that could be sourced from US military bases in different parts of the world, the people said. Asked about reported comments by senior US officials at a recent background briefing that India hadn’t made any request for ready-to-use vaccines from the Biden administration, the people said this matter was raised on a couple of occasions with the American side. “The Indian side has said it would be useful to have US vaccines, may not be specifically the AstraZeneca vaccine, since India now has a fast track mechanism for approving vaccines. The US is aware of our interest in procuring vaccines, AstraZeneca or otherwise,” said one of the people cited above. The people also noted that the US does not currently have a large stockpile of the AstraZeneca vaccine – some 10 million doses had been produced so far and about 50 million doses are expected to be manufactured in May and June. There is also no clarity on how many doses from this stockpile will be provided to the country though President Joe Biden has himself mentioned that some of it will be sent to India, the people said. The Indian side has managed to get support from a large number of people in the US, including the administration, members of Congress and private businesses, and this is expected to be reflected in the materials that are set to arrive in the coming days, they said. India’s missions around the world are focusing on procuring critical medicines such as Remdesivir, Tocilizumab, and Favipiravir, and the Indian side’s ability to convinced pharmaceutical major Gilead to donate 450,000 doses of Remdesivir is being seen as a “big success”. More supplies of Remdesivir are also expected from other countries, the people said. The current focus on oxygen-related equipment such as concentrators and cylinders is because it is difficult to import oxygen. “Liquid oxygen can’t be airlifted and has to be brought in by ship. Even there, we need special cryogenic tankers and their numbers are limited across the world. So far, there is one commercial shipment coming from Saudi Arabia,” said the first person cited above. Large oxygen generating plants, such as the ones being sent by Germany and France, are useful though they need considerable time to be installed and set up, the people said. On the other hand, large and small liquid oxygen tanks can help move the commodity from points of production to healthcare facilities across the country, they added. The people said there had been no formal response to offers of assistance from Pakistan and China. There are no problems with commercial procurements from China by private Indian firms, such as the purchase of large numbers of oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong, the people said. The Indian government, especially the external affairs ministry and health ministry, is accelerating the procurements from abroad by relaxing import procedures and waiving duties and also ensuring the supplies speedily reach the places where they are needed the most and are also used properly, the people said. All supplies from foreign governments and partners are being routed through the Indian Red Cross Society and countries are also free to provide aid directly to NGOs or other entities in India. The people reiterated that there had been no international appeal for assistance and India was looking to procure specific products from around the world.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/first-us-consignment-of-support-materials-expected-by-friday-india-asks-for-vaccines-101619626360094.html

He told reporters that the government has asked the police to track the missing people, even though many of them have switched off their mobile phones. “We are giving free medicines to people, which can control 90% of cases, but they have (Covid-19 infected people) switched off their mobile phones. They reach the hospitals in a critical stage to desperately look for ICU beds. This is what is happening now,” the minister said in Bengaluru. He requested those who have tested positive for the viral disease to keep their cell phones on so that the official responsible for contact tracing and follow-ups could reach them. “I pray to them with folded hands that Covid-19 cases will only increase due to this. It is wrong when you try for ICU beds at the last moment,” the minister said. He said that several patients are trying to hide their whereabouts by turning their cell phones off. “At least 2,000 to 3,000 people in Bengaluru have switched off their phones and left their houses. We don’t know where they have gone,” the minister added. The Karnataka government had recently increased its contact tracing activity after it was found that the officials in Bengaluru and other districts were tracing only 4 contacts per infected person, while the guidelines mandate tracing at least 20 contacts. Karnataka on Wednesday reported 39,047 new Covid-19 cases and 229 deaths taking the total active infections to 3,28,884 and the toll to 15,036. Out of the 39,047 new cases on Wednesday, 22,596 were from Bengaluru, while 137 lost their lives due to the virus. The government has imposed a lockdown for 14 days restricting the unnecessary movement of people starting from Tuesday night to contain the spread of the infection.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/nearly-3-000-covid-19-patients-in-bengaluru-missing-karnataka-revenue-minister-101619624799234.html

He died. Later repeated phone calls to the district administration to help us for the cremation went unanswered. We had to wait for 18 hours before help arrived,” said Babin Pal, the victim’s son. It was not a stray incident. Reports of such cases, where families of Covid-19 victims are facing harassment even after the death of their kin, have started to pour in almost every day. In the face of an exponential rise in the death toll over the past few weeks, the West Bengal government has directed district administrations to augment infrastructure at crematoriums, appointing a nodal officer who would coordinate the cremation process and take stock of the fleet of hearse vans among others. “It has to be ensured that bodies are disposed preferably within three hours and for this each block and subdivision has been asked to appoint a nodal officer who would get in touch with the victims’ families and coordinate the entire cremation process,” said a senior official. The district administrations have been directed to identify areas where more deaths were taking place and categorise them in three categories – A, B and C with A getting the top priority. “Officials have been asked to augment the infrastructure at crematoriums and burial grounds, augment man power, and find new spaces for burial. Also they have been asked to take stock of hearse vans, both government and private among others,” said the official The daily death toll of Covid-19 victims touched 73 on Tuesday, almost 25 times higher than what it was on February 26, when the Election Commission of India announced the assembly polls in West Bengal. The daily count of Covid-19 cases has shot up 75 times in the state. On Tuesday, the state registered 16,403 new cases up from 216 on February 26. The positivity rate -- the proportion of people testing positive to those tested – has also shot up from 1% to nearly 30% during the same period. Kolkata registered the maximum deaths – 24, followed by North 24 Parganas where 13 people died on Tuesday. The three crematoriums in the city, meant for Covid-19 victims, are all stressed and the civic body is looking to augment infrastructure by designating more crematoriums for Covid-19 victims. “If you go by official figures, then 50% of the victims dying every day in the city are cremated at the crematorium at Dhapa in east Kolkata, while the rest are sent to the other two crematoriums at Nimtala and Birjunala. But, actually the numbers are much higher. All the furnaces are burning constantly, and the crematorium staff are all overworked,” said a senior official of the Kolkata civic body.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-to-upgrade-crematoriums-take-stock-of-hearse-vans-as-covid-19-toll-mounts-101619623118826.html

28-04-2021||India||Serum Institute's Adar Poonawalla to get Y category security across India||Serum Institute of India's CEO Adar Poonawalla will get Y category security across India, the ministry of home affairs notified on Wednesday. The security category generally comprises 11 personnel, including one or two commandoes and police personnel.The move comes ahead of the third phase of the vaccination scheduled to begin from May 1. Pune's Serum Institute of India, which is the largest vaccine producer in the country by the number of doses produced in a year, is one of the lynchpins in India's expansion of the vaccination drive. Apart from SII's Covishield, Bharat Biotech's Covaxin is the other vaccine to be made available in the private market.The Central Reserve Police Force will provide him with security and it will be applicable across India, wherever he travels.SII reduces Covishield prices for states from ₹400 to ₹300 per doseOn April 16, the director of SII, Prakash Kumar Singh, wrote to the ministry seeking security for Adar Poonawalla. In his letter, Singh mentioned that Poonawalla was getting threats from various people regarding the supply of Covid-19 vaccines. "We are working shoulder-to-shoulder to fight against Covid-19 pandemic with the government of India under the dynamic leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi Ji," the letter said.In the past few days, Poonawalla has received flak for "profiteering" as his vaccine company was offering one dose of Covishield to the Centre at ₹150, while charging ₹400 from the state governments. On Wednesday, after the Centre opened registration for vaccination of people between the age group of 18 and 44 years, Poonawalla announced a reduction in the price as he slashed the price by ₹100. Instead of ₹400 per dose, states will now have to pay ₹300 per dose of Covishield. However, the reduction is not fully assuaging the concerns of the state governments as the difference between the prices still remains."As a philanthropic gesture on behalf of Serum Institute of India, I hereby reduce the price to the states from ₹400 to ₹300 per dose, effective immediately; this will save thousands of crores of state funds going forward. This will enable more vaccinations and save countless lives," Poonawalla tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/serum-institute-s-adar-poonawalla-to-get-y-category-security-across-india-101619618760837.html

The test firing at Goa completed a series of missile trials to validate its performance under extremely challenging scenarios,” the defence ministry said in a statement on Wednesday. The Derby missile achieved direct hit on a high-speed maneuvering aerial target and the Python missiles also achieved 100% hits, validating their complete capability, it added. The missiles were fired from Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) Tejas aircraft flown by IAF test pilots from the National Flight Test Centre. The defence ministry in February awarded a ₹48,000 crore contract to Hindustan Aeronautics Limited for 83 LCA Mk-1A jets for the IAF. The deal took the total number of Tejas variants ordered to 123. The 40 LCAs already ordered by IAF are in the initial operational clearance (IOC) and the more advanced final operational clearance (FOC) configurations. The LCA Mk-1A will come with additional improvements over the FOC aircraft, making it the most advanced Tejas variant so far.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/light-combat-aircraft-tejas-fires-python-5-missile-for-first-time-101619618018673.html
28-04-2021||India||Maharashtra may face 3rd Covid-19 wave if vaccination slows: Experts||A slowdown in the ongoing vaccination drive in Maharashtra, battling a savage surge in Covid-19 cases, will potentially pave the way for a third wave of the infection in the state, health experts warned on Wednesday.The warning came on a day when the Maharashtra government said it is not going to start the vaccination drive from May 1 for the 18-44 age group because of unavailability of sufficient doses.Health Minister Rajesh Tope has already expressed concern over the inadequate supply of vaccines for Maharashtra, the state worst-hit by the pandemic, amid reports of a shortage of doses for the existing beneficiaries (45-plus people), putting the inoculation drive on a slow track.The true curbing of Covid-19 can happen only if two thirds of the population eligible for vaccination is covered under the inoculation drive."Out of 9 crore people eligible for vaccination in Maharashtra, we have just covered over 1.50 crore so far, which is negligible," said a senior official from state health department.He pitched for fast-tracking the inoculation drive which began on January 16 with healthcare professionals and was later extended to cover frontline workers and people in the 45-plus age group."If we do not accelerate the pace of vaccination, sooner or later people will venture out for jobs and other work and this could invite the third wave of Covid-19, he warned.Relaxation of measures in December made people careless and this triggered the second wave of Covid-19 from February. We are still suffering from it."If we do not vaccinate a major chunk of the population quickly, we will be rolling out the red carpet for the third wave, the health department official said.In April so far, the state has added 15,53,922 fresh Covid-19 cases and 11,281 deaths.Tope on Wednesday said, The Maharashtra government is unlikely to get vaccines from Bharat Biotech or Serum Institute of India before May 20."In that case, we can not start vaccination for the 18-44 age group from May 1. We will have to wait for the third week of May.A member of the state task force on Covid-19 said with more vaccines in hand, Maharashtra could have inoculated a large number of people."There will be several hurdles in the monsoon to carry out the drive, including heavy rains and landslides," he said.A Congress leader said the Covid-19 situation is alarming but "we are wasting a golden opportunity to inoculate as many people as possible in the summer".If we go by the health ministers projection of six- month period required to inoculate 5.5 crore population in the state, then we can not expect current strict measures to remain in force for such a long period," the leader said.A scientist involved in genome sequencing of the novel coronavirus said if the virus keeps mutating, it will defeat the purpose of vaccination.If we spend such a long time for vaccination, we may find new mutations or variants of Covid-19 which would be immune to the vaccine," he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-may-face-3rd-covid-19-wave-if-vaccination-slows-experts-101619616385795.html
28-04-2021||India||Manipur medical institute starts producing oxygen to guard against Covid surge||Manipur’s top medical college has added capacity to produce up to 350,000 litres of medical oxygen daily, when its shortage has taken lives of many Covid-19 patients across the country, swept by the second wave of the disease. Located in Imphal, the Regional Institute of Medical Sciences (RIMS) began oxygen production on April 24 at its manufacturing unit at Lamphelpat .The institute’s director professor A Santa said, “We have started to produce D- type oxygen (in Jumbo cylinders) since April 24 onwards.” Each Jumbo cylinder contains around 7,000 litres of oxygen and according to Santa, RIMS was producing enough oxygen daily from the atmosphere to fill up 40-50 such jumbo cylinders with the help of five PSA (Pressure swing absorption) oxygen generator plants, installed recently to deal with any medical emergency in the landlocked state. “Each of these five generators can produce around 10 jumbo cylinders daily,” he said.“Many experts, including director AIIMS (All India Institute of Medical Sciences) have appreciated our initiatives,” professor Santa said proudly.RIMS is ranked 38th in National Institutional Ranking Framework on Human Resource Development (NIRF) 2019-20, released by the Union ministry of human resource development. The institute is also busy harvesting water for its sustainable use through different innovative ideas.Earlier, the medical college and hospital, with more than 1000 beds, used to purchase water from private tanker operators.The oxygen generator plants at RIMS were inspected by chief minister N Biren Singh on Monday. Earlier during the day, Singh had inspected another oxygen manufacturing unit at the state-run JNIMS hospital in Imphal.On Tuesday, Manipur reported 175 new Covid-19 cases, taking the state’s infection tally to 30,742 including 1,032 active cases, officials said. 29,317 patients have recovered so far. With three more deaths reported on Tuesday, the state’s death toll rose to 393.As of now, 662,531 persons have been screened at entry points and another 607,553 have been tested at other centres across the state.So far, 139,457 persons including healthcare and frontline workers have received the first dose of Covid vaccine.

Singapore, Canada send support material, funds for India’s Covid-19 response"We also reviewed our diverse bilateral cooperation, especially in the area of space exploration and renewable energy sector, including in hydrogen economy. Our cooperation on Sputnik-V vaccine will assist humanity in battling the pandemic," he further added. India and Russia have decided to jointly manufacture Sputnik-V vaccines. Sputnik-V was added to India's arsenal of vaccines on April 12 when an expert panel approved Sputnik-V, the vaccine against Covid-19 developed by Russia. The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) partnered with Dr Reddy's, Virchow Biotech Private Limited, Stelis Biopharma Pvt Ltd and Panacea Biotec this year to produce more than 700 million doses of vaccine.The government opened the registration for vaccination to those above 18 years of age on Friday. People aged above 18 years of age have been brought under the ambit of vaccination as the government tries to battle the second wave of Covid-19 which has led to record surges in daily cases as well as death toll. Along with Russia, the US, UK, Canada, Germany, Australia, South Korea as well as China have extended their support to India in order to help the nation turn the tide in its fight against the second wave of Covid-19.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-to-russian-president-vladimir-putin-on-several-issues-including-101619615479793.html
28-04-2021||India||Jammu and Kashmir: Increased compliance to SoPs as Covid cases at all time high||More and more Kashmir residents were now seen following Covid appropriate behaviour in the face of unprecedented number of infections and deaths, recorded during the second wave of the disease, crippling medical infrastructure in several states.Most people were seen wearing masks in public places with some even wearing double masks. While the markets operated at 50% capacity, the number of people venturing outside had also reduced substantially, said officials.Dr Naveed Nazir said the improvement in people’s attitude could perhaps be due to repeated warning that the fight against Covid was not over yet.“It needs to be appreciated,” he said referring to the increased public adherence to the Covid containment standard operating procedures (SoPs). “There is hardly anyone who doesn’t wear a mask. This is a good sign,” said, Dr Nazir, head of the Chest Medicines department at Government Medical College (GMC), Srinagar.He reiterated the need for people to take all the precautions to prevent the spread of the virus.Another senior doctor claimed to have done a rough calculation of the increase in compliance compared to the pattern seen at the end of the last month.“On the 30th of March, out of 109 people I observed, only 51 (47%) were wearing a mask and half of them were actually wearing it on their chin. But on 26th of April, out of the 155 people observed, 144 (93%) were wearing a mask, that too properly. Let’s pledge to increase the percentage of compliance even further,” said Iqbal Saleem, professor of surgery at GMC, Srinagar,On Tuesday, Jammu and Kashmir reported 25 deaths and 3,164 fresh novel coronavirus infections, the highest spike in daily case since the pandemic began. Of the new cases, 2,134 were from Kashmir while 1,030 were from Jammu. April has already seen over 35,000 new cases and 203 deaths in J&K.Not just wearing masks, many people in the UT are now lining up for vaccination after a lukewarm response shown till now.Shakeela Begum, a 48-year-old home maker, got herself vaccinated this week even though her husband, a Covid frontline worker, was not bothering to get inoculated.“After thinking a lot, I decided to go for the vaccination as it is for our safety. There are a lot of misconceptions about the vaccine among the people. But as images of people dying for want of oxygen go viral, many have changed their mind,” she said.Although the religious places are open and people have been praying in congregations due to Ramadan, the compliance to SoPs in these places have also increased.“After Kashmir reported a record number of cases and deaths this week, I decided to pray at home for the safety of my parents and children. I offer Tarawih (special Ramadan) prayers at home now,” said Ishfaq Ahmad, a government employee based in Srinagar.A prominent religious scholar, Mufti Nazir Ahmad urged that very few people should offer prayers at mosques. “There is no lockdown this time so people can offer prayers in mosques but [need to] bring down the number to a minimum. People should take all precautions both inside and outside the mosques. The situation is very bad,” he said.Many have been urging religious scholars to ask people to offer prayers at home. “Why should we wait for a government lockdown? Last time the scholars asked people to offer prayers at homes. This time the level of threat has increased. Researchers are saying that the virus spreads more in closed spaces,” said Abdul Majeed, a 61-year-old city resident.The Srinagar administration on Tuesday evening imposed section 144 CrPC barring assembly of five or more people.“The rush in public transport is a challenge. We are trying to find a solution by taking transporters on board to reduce the crowding,” said Srinagar superintendent of police, Sandeep Choudhary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jammu-and-kashmir-increased-compliance-to-sops-as-covid-cases-at-all-time-high-101619615438442.html
28-04-2021||India||75 lakh vaccine registrations today, no glitch, says Co-Win chief RS Sharma||The Co-Win website started Covis-19 vaccine registration for everyone between the age of 18 and 44 years. After an initial hiccup of OTP delay and server crash, Cowin.gov.in started taking registration and 3.5 million people were registered in one hour, though several users found no hospitals offering vaccines to people below the age of 45 years. National Health Authority CEO RS Sharma clarified why this is happening and when people will be able to book appointments.Slots depending on statesSharma said the availability of slots depends on states and private hospitals. When states and private hospitals come on board with the details of their centres, vaccine prices etc., people will be able to book appointments. Some states and hospitals may come on board on May 1 and later, he said to news agency ANI.In fact, after the registration process was open on Wednesday, Pune-based Serum Institute of India announced a reduction in the Covishield price from ₹400 to ₹300 per dose. So states are in the process of ordering vaccine doses from the makers. Once they are ready, slots will be shown on Cowin.gov.in.Difference between registration and appointment bookingSeveral users were allowed to register themselves on Co-WIN on Wednesday through OTP received on their mobile numbers. For registration, one has to mention the type of photo ID card (for example Aadhaar), the number mentioned on the card, name, gender, year of birth. With this information, the registration will be done.So the next time you log on to cowin.gov.in after registration, you will have to again give your phone number and an OTP will be received, but you will be taken straight to the page of booking appointment."We will continue to announce as and when States come on board. We will provide information in public. The advice to people is that you log in and get an appointment only when you see vacancies available," Sharma said.Can Cowin take the load?Before the website crashed for a few minutes on Wednesday at 4pm, Sharma told ANI that Cowin has registered about five million people in a day. The platform is prepared for a double number, he said. On Wednesday, 3.5 million people were registered in one hour. "We delivered 8.7 million SMSes in 1.5 hours," Sharma said. Why Central government hospitals are not mentioned on CowinIn the third phase of vaccination scheduled to begin on May 1, Central government hospitals will provide free vaccination for people between the age of 18 and 44 years. There will be no online booking of slots in these hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cowin-chief-explains-why-users-can-t-find-covid-19-vaccine-slots-for-18-after-registration-101619614746373.html

Gurugram added the most towards Tuesday’s tally with 3,684 cases followed by Faridabad (1,330), Sonipat (940), Karnal (725) and Hisar (642).Amid the recent spike in daily cases, the health infrastructure in Harayana is overburdened leading to a shortage of oxygen beds, medicines etc.Senior Indian National Lok Dal (INLD) leader Abhay Singh Chautala on Wednesday accused the Khattar government of mismanaging the pandemic and said the situation in Haryana is worse than that of neighbouring Delhi. Chautala also demanded health minister Anil Vij’s resignation for failing to handle the situation. But the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led state government has assured it is doing its best to deal with the crisis and has assured residents on availability of beds, oxygen, vaccines etc.Also Read| Delhi Covid patients putting strain on Haryana hospitals: KhattarKhattar said on Wednesday one of the primary reasons for this crisis in Haryana’s health infrastructure is the large number of patients coming to Haryana from Delhi and getting themselves hospitalised in Gurugram and Ambala. He added the situation in Haryana will normalise, once the Covid-19 figures in Delhi start reducing.The Haryana chief minister is also facing heat from the public and opposition parties over his remarks that it is pointless to argue over Covid-19 deaths as the dead won’t come back to life and the focus should be on providing relief to those who are suffering at present. He made this statement on Tuesday after he was asked by reporters about the alleged under-reporting of virus-related deaths in the state.Also Read| PM asks IAF to increase speed, scale of Covid relief operationsMeanwhile, the central government on Wednesday increased Haryana’s oxygen quota from 162 metric tonnes (MT) to 232 MT per day.

We don't know where they have gone,” PTI said quoting Ashoka.The minister urged infected citizens to keep their phones turned on, and expressed concerns about the damage these untraceable individuals will inflict on the state’s mounting toll of daily Covid cases."I pray to them with folded hands that Covid cases will only increase due to this,” the minister told reporters according to PTI.India has been reeling under the second wave of coronavirus and, from time to time, essential supplies like vaccines and medications are running out of stock. About 48 vials of Remdesivir injections went missing from a healthcare facility run by Aurangabad Municipal Corporation in Maharashtra. On April 15, about 320 doses of Covaxin had gone missing from Hari Bux Kanwatia Government Hospital in Jaipur.Karnataka reported 31,830 new cases of Covid-19 and 180 fatalities on Tuesday.

28-04-2021||India||War-rooms and oxygen: India's IT companies scramble to handle Covid-19 surge||India's giant IT firms in Bengaluru and other cities have set up Covid-19 "war-rooms" as they scramble to source oxygen, medicine and hospital beds for infected workers and maintain backroom operations for the world's biggest financial firms.Banks including Goldman Sachs and Standard Chartered, who run much of their global back office operations from large office parks in Bengaluru, Chennai or Hyderabad, have put in place infrastructure to vaccinate thousands of employees and their families when age restrictions are lifted on May 1.Workers at huge technology service providers Accenture and Wipro say teams are working 13-14 hours daily, under growing pressure and struggling to deliver on projects as staff call in sick and take time off to care for friends and relatives.They play down any threat of a collapse in operations - but at stake if the surge continues is the infrastructure put in place by the world's biggest financial companies in cost-cutting drives that have left them deeply reliant on the big Indian offices."Employees have contracted Covid-19 since the second wave began, causing severe pressure for projects that are nearing deadlines," said one employee at Accenture, asking not to be named because he was not authorised to speak to the media.Five other sources at Accenture confirmed the growing issues with pressure of work. Accenture said it was providing some medical care and covering the cost of vaccinations for its employees but did not comment on the impact on productivity.Wipro said about 3% of its 197,000-odd employees are currently working from office on critical projects and expects more of those employees to work from home going forward. For the employees working on those projects, Wipro said it has made living arrangements at the company's guest houses and hotels close to its offices.Infosys, India's second largest software services firm, said it was operating remotely across all offices and had not seen any disruption to client projects, despite the deteriorating health situation in the country in recent weeks.Tata Consultancy Services, India's top information technology (IT) services firm, similarly said its operations had not been affected.India's second wave of infections has seen at least 300,000 people test positive each day for the past week, overwhelming healthcare facilities and crematoriums and driving an increasingly urgent international response.Asia's IT capital Bengaluru, desperate to calm a daily infection rate five times higher than in last year's first wave, on Monday ordered a full lockdown that allows ordinary residents to leave their homes only briefly between 6 a.m. and 10 a.m.Local IT managers say they struggled to get global chiefs outside India to recognise the seriousness of the outbreak.Covid-19 'War Rooms'India's gigantic IT and call centre service industry employs more than 4.5 million people directly and relies substantially on thousands of graduates under the age of 30.They are paid a fraction of Western salaries and had largely ridden out the Covid-19 pandemic working from home until the relaxing of restrictions in recent months spurred companies to call more employees back to the office.Managers at Goldman Sachs' massive complex in Bengaluru, for example, told staff in early March to prepare to return to full-scale office working.Chief Executive Officer David Solomon said then that the bank owed it to its incoming class of analysts and interns to have them come to work in offices for at least part of the summer.The company quickly U-turned, sending all but essential employees home on March 27 as cases began to rise.New strains of the virus have since sent India's case numbers soaring to global records and brought more infections among younger Indians.But all 15 of the large companies Reuters spoke to this week said that they now had vaccination schemes in place and several outlined Covid-19 "war-rooms" they had launched to support staff and secure oxygen and other supplies."The problem was that those outside India were anxious not to be seen to be jumping the queue," says a senior manager who runs a workforce of more than 600 staff at a global bank in Bengaluru, asking not to be named."The India CEO and others here said: we don't care what it looks like, people are dying."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/warrooms-and-oxygen-india-s-it-companies-scramble-to-handle-covid-19-surge-101619609332142.html

The daily cases are hovering around the 60,000-mark. We are hoping that this was the peak in cases in the state and the daily cases will start declining in the next few days.”On April 22, the state government imposed the complete lockdown across Maharashtra amid a surge in Covid-19 cases.

It would cost the state government ₹6,500 crore to vaccinate around 57.1 million citizens in this age group.The decision comes in the wake of the Centre expanding the vaccination drive to all adults. The state, however, will not be able to roll out phase 3 on May 1 for want of enough stock. The state government has said the drive will be rolled out as per the availability of the vaccine.Public health minister Rajesh Tope said that the state government is trying to procure stocks on a war-footing. “We have been tapping all sources, but the companies manufacturing the vaccines have expressed their constraint in supply. To avoid crowding of beneficiaries at vaccination centres, we are further dividing the age group into three -- 18-25 years, 26-35 years, and 39 to 44 years -- to prioritise the older age group and those with co-morbidities. Vaccination will be done only by registering the beneficiaries on Co-WIN app,” he said.Also Read | How an IAS officer made a Maharashtra tribal district oxygen-sufficientTope said free vaccine will be available only at the government facilities. “We have 13,000 vaccination centres in Maharashtra, through which we are targeting to complete vaccination of 57.1 million people in the next six months,” he said.“Bharat Biotech has told us that they will be providing 1 million doses of Covaxin per month for the next two months and 2 million doses per month from July onwards. Serum Institute of India has assured us the supply of 10 million doses per month. We are also tapping the possibility of exporting Sputnik vaccine,” Tope said.He said rolling out the drive from May 1 would not be possible. “We do not want to start the drive in haste, and then shut the centres in case stocks run out. Instead, we will roll out the drive after the doses are available in expected quantity,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/maharashtra-cabinet-okays-free-covid-vaccination-for-age-group-of-18-44-yrs-101619607398196.html

He also instructed the tourists to stay inside their hotels during the 3-day long lockdown.“From Thursday night to Monday morning, there is a lockdown in the whole state. Essential services and restaurant kitchens will remain open for home deliveries. Industries will continue [to function], but public transport and markets will remain shut,” Sawant said.Sawant added that the Covid vaccination drive will continue as planned. The announcement follows increasingly louder calls for restrictions as hospital beds in the state were occupied and the queue of patients awaiting hospital beds was getting longer and longer.Goa recorded 2,110 fresh cases and 31 deaths on Wednesday, taking the number of infections to 81,908 and the death toll to 1,086. Around 16,591 people, close to 1% of Goa’s population, were currently infected with the virus, including more than a thousand, who were currently hospitalised. Several states have imposed weekend lockdowns as part of restrictions to curb the steep rise of cases in the second Covid wave, which has partially paralysed the health infrastructure.“We have to work towards reducing the mortality rate and the pressure on hospitals and doctors at the moment. We have taken this decision after consulting medical professionals in the field,” Sawant said.Sawant said late admission to hospitals was resulting in the loss of several lives that could have been saved.“Maximum deaths are taking place within 24-hours (of admission) with at least four patients expiring per day. At least two people are being brought dead to hospitals every day,” he said.Sawant stressed that those with symptoms should approach hospitals and not stay at home without treatment. “Start your treatment early,” he added while specifying that the Covid-19 treatment protocol had been modified in the state, recommending administration of medicines at the time of testing without waiting for the results.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/goa-weekend-lockdown-from-thursday-evening-as-covid-beds-run-out-101619605658710.html

Bhadauria told him that almost all IAF personnel have been vaccinated.Briefing PM Modi about IAF's preparedness, Bhadauria said the IAF has ordered its entire heavy lift fleet and a substantial number of medium lift fleets to be prepared round the clock “to operate in a hub and spoke model” for meeting all Covid-19 related needs of the nation and overseas.“Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria informed the Prime Minister that the IAF has ordered 24x7 readiness of the entire heavy lift fleet and substantial numbers of the medium lift fleets to operate in a hub and spoke model to rapidly meet all Covid related tasking across the country and overseas,” said the press release.The IAF has been using a variety of aircraft like C-17, C-130J, IL-76, An-32, Avro, Chinook and Mi-17 helicopters in their Covid-19 relief efforts. On Monday, the air force airlifted six empty cryogenic oxygen containers from Dubai to Panagarh in West Bengal for refilling. Last week, it had airlifted four such containers from Singapore to Panagarh.IAF has also been actively assisting in domestic efforts to tackle the Covid-19 crisis. It has dispatched aircraft to different parts of the country for ferrying oxygen containers to filling stations. On Saturday, IAF flew one such aircraft from its Hindan airbase outside Delhi to Pune for ferrying two empty cryogenic oxygen containers to the Jamnagar airbase which was then refilled and flown back to Pune. Similar journeys were also made to Bhopal and Ranchi. The IAF has also flown Covid testing equipment from Jammu to Leh and Kargil on Saturday.Bhadauria informed PM Modi about a dedicated Covid Air Support Cell set up by the IAF for better coordination with different ministries and agencies for Covid related emergencies. He also apprised the Prime Minister that hospitals under IAF have ramped up Covid facilities and treated civilians whenever possible. Defence minister Rajnath Singh had said on April 24 that the armed forces and the defence ministry "will leave no stone unturned in providing all possible assistance to the civilian administration".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-speaks-to-iaf-chief-rks-bhadauria-takes-stock-of-efforts-by-air-force-101619604014426.html

Taking to Twitter, Gandhi urged the Central government to work with a vision to curb the growing Covid cases and not spend money on Central Vista during these challenging times. “Central Vista -not essential. Central Govt with a vision- essential,” he tweeted. Last week also, Gandhi questioned the government’s priorities in handling Covid and the Central Vista project. “No test, no vaccine, no oxygen and no ICU,” he tweeted. The Opposition has been demanding that the fund for the project be devoted towards the country’s Covid response. Meanwhile, reports suggest that 180 vehicles have been granted permission to ferry workers to the Central Vista site even as the National Capital has been under lockdown for ten days now to flatten the Covid curve. New Delhi saw its first weekend curfew on April 16, when the Central Public Works Department, which is overseeing the project, wrote to the Delhi Police that “the project is time bound in nature and has to be finished by 30th November 2021” and the work is going on in three shifts.On Sunday, Srinivas BV, the president of Indian Youth Congress, tweeted his disappointment about how the government is spending ₹2,000 crore on the Central Vista Project instead of buying beds and ventilators. “It’s unfortunate how the Central Government is spending money on the Central Vista Project instead of buying ventilators and ICU beds which would have saved the lives of lakhs of people. It’s sad how the government is rooting for their own comfort over the lives of people.”The Central Vista Redevelopment Project, which would include a triangular parliament building, common central secretariat and a refurbished 3km Rajpath, was announced in 2019. On January 5, 2021, the Supreme Court gave a go-ahead to it.NO GOVT RESPONSEThere are currently 2,978,709 active Covid cases in the country and 201,187 deaths.

28-04-2021||India||How an IAS officer made a Maharashtra tribal district oxygen-sufficient||The district collector of a small tribal-inhabited district in Maharashtra saw the deadly second wave of coronavirus disease coming and prepared a series of contingency plan, at a time when the country, including the western state, struggled to meet the logistical challenges that a gasping healthcare system posed.A doctor-turned-bureaucrat, Dr Rajendra Bharud, the collector of Maharashtra’s Nandurbar has managed to keep the district running with an adequate supply of medical oxygen, hospital beds, isolation wards for Covid-19 patients and a well-planned vaccination drive.ALSO READ: EU comes to India's aid amid Covid-19 crisis; member states to help with oxygen, medicinesToday, the district has 150 vacant beds and two oxygen plants that have a combined capacity to produce 2,400 litres per minute. Not only did the district manage to control the positivity rate of the infection but it also slashed it by around 30%. Its robust healthcare system has led many from the neighbouring region in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat to seek admission in Nandurbar.Vision of the second waveNandurbar didn’t have any oxygen plant when the pandemic struck early last year. But Bharud got down to setting up a liquid oxygen plant in the tribal-inhabited district in September last year when the cases of coronavirus infection gradually began to go down.He had anticipated that there the cases could go up any moment and that an oxygen plant could come in handy if more people fall sick because of the disease. Without much ado, he got a plant set up with a capacity of 600 litres per minute.His fears came true in no time. According to media reports, when the second wave of Covid-19 hit Maharashtra this year, Nandurbar reported as many as 1,210 cases in a single day. Dr Bharud and his team felt that one oxygen plant was not enough, given how the people were contracting the disease.He mobilised funds to set up two more plants at the district hospital, pushing the capacity of the oxygen plant to 1,800 litres per minute. He said the district is expecting to ramp up the capacity to 3,000 litres per minute.Dr Bharud said the money was a crucial requirement in setting up a robust healthcare system that needs adequate ambulances, ventilators, beds, oxygen plants, vaccines, medicines, trained medical staff among others. The officer used a combination of resources, including district planning and development funds, state disaster relief funds, and mobilised the CSR units to meet expenses.He said his team provided the doctors in the district with all the resources they need to set up oxygen plants in the district. Not only that but his team also made sure that oxygen pipes were given as soon as saturation levels started dropping, instead of waiting for the critical stage.“This way, patients use only 30% of oxygen, as against 90% in the latter situation. When oxygen starts dropping, it directly affects the brain and kidney, which makes it harder for patients to recover fast. Hence, oxygen levels need to be managed and taken care of in the early stages itself,” Dr Bharud told a news portal recently.ALSO READ: Maharashtra reports 895 Covid-19 deaths in last 24 hours, highest since onset of pandemicThe 2013 batch IAS officer wishes that no patient should suffer for the want of oxygen.Optimum use of available resourcesTo prepare for exigencies, the district administration converted schools and community halls into Covid-19 centres and set up 7,000 beds just for isolation while equipping 1,300 beds with ICU or ventilator facilities.The district administration next set up a situation room and created a website to help control the panic and guide the citizens.Not only that but the district administration roped in local doctors and trained them to perform vital medical procedures such as intubating a patient and monitoring their oxygen level.Isolation coaches, but with comfortDr Bharud then requested the Western Railway to provide them with isolation coaches. In no time, the Indian Railways provided a 21-coach isolation ward train for Covid-19 patients in Nandurbar. Each coach can accommodate 16 patients who are provided with bedrolls, pillows, napkins. The facility has nine coolers, two oxygen cylinders and one bathroom with three toilets per coach.Union railway minister Piyush Goyal responded to Dr Bharud's call on Twitter. "Railways is devoting all its resources for fighting COVID-19. Isolation coaches has started functioning at Nandurbar, Maharashtra with COVID-19 patients being admitted," he wrote on the micro-blogging site.Railways is devoting all its resources for fighting COVID-19.

Of the 300,000 people in the district above the age of 45, as many as one lakh have already received their first dose of vaccine despite the lack of awareness around inoculation drives among the tribal populace in the district.“Instead of calling people to us for vaccination, we allotted 16 vehicles to every part of the district to give the vaccine. This way, people didn’t have to travel on hilly terrains. We roped in teachers and sarpanches to spread the word about the seriousness of the situation, and it worked,” the collector told the news portal.Dr Bharud has received kudos from people from all walks of life. From filmmaker Nandita Das, Biocon chairperson Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, entrepreneur Amit Paranjape, to bureaucrats, IAS officers and doctors, many took to Twitter to praise Bharud for this initiative.Maharashtra human rights commission secretary Tukaram Mundhe, himself an IAS officer, gave the example of Dr Bharud's initiatives to highlight how inspired leadership contributes to social well-being.This is how inspired Leadership contributes to social well being .

Kudos to this far thinking IAS officer Dr Rajendra Bharud 👏👏👍 https://t.co/mie2fhyE24Dr Bharud's life is a tale of wonder, too. He was raised by his widowed mother. Battling all odds, Dr Bharud completed his schooling in a small village in Dhule. His father died of malaria before he was born while his mother worked as a labourer on farms to fund his studies. He earned his medical degree from Mumbai's KEM hospital and Seth GS Medical College and has been an inspiration to the public health department and district collectors across Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/how-a-ias-officer-made-a-maharashtra-tribal-district-oxygensufficient-101619599643512.html

In addition, the DRDO has also started work to set up oxygen generating plants in four government hospitals in Delhi -- AIIMS, RML, Lady Hardinge, and Safdarjung -- by May 10 to help tackle the oxygen crisis amid the second Covid wave, officials familiar with the developments said on Wednesday. Another oxygen generating plant will be set up at AIIMS, Jhajjar. The DRDO has transferred oxygen generation technology to the industry, which has now stepped in to provide oxygen plants to state governments and hospitals. The technology transferred to the industry is based on the onboard oxygen generation technology developed for Tejas light combat aircraft. The oxygen generation plants can produce 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute. The DRDO has transferred technology to Tata Advanced Systems Limited, Bengaluru, and Trident Pneumatics Pvt Ltd, Coimbatore, which will be producing 380 of the 500 plants for installation across various hospitals in the country, the defence ministry said in a statement. The remaining 120 plants will be produced by the industry in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Petroleum, Dehradun, it added. “Each oxygen plant is designed for a capacity of 1,000 litres per minute (LPM). The system can cater to 190 patients at a flow rate of 5 LPM and charge 195 cylinders per day…. Hospitals will be able to generate on-site medical oxygen in a cost-effective manner,” the ministry said.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also been holding several meetings to ensure the availability of the gas which is key to Covid-19 treatment and its shortage has caused panic among citizens.The decision came after Mansukh Mandaviya chaired a meeting with fertiliser companies of the public sector, private sector as well as co-operative sector to explore the possibility of production of oxygen in their plants. “The fertiliser companies welcomed the initiative of MoS and readily showed interest to join the efforts of Government of India to fight Covid -19 situation in the country,” according to the ministry’s statement.In order to increase supply, the Centre said that IFFCO is setting up an oxygen plant with a capacity of 200 cubic meters per hour in its unit in Gujarat’s Kalol. The total capacity of the plant would be 33,000 cubic meters per day.Gujarat State Fertilizers and Chemicals (GSFS) and Gujarat Narmada Valley Fertilisers & Chemicals (GNFC) have already started the process to enhance their oxygen production capacities, the ministry said, adding that other fertiliser firms will also set up medical plants in hospitals and designated areas at selected locations across the country through corporate social responsibility (CSR) funding.“Altogether it is expected that approximately 50 metric tonnes (MT) of medical oxygen per day can be made available for Covid patients by the fertiliser Plants. These steps will augment the medical grade oxygen supply to hospitals in the country in the coming days.” the statement read.Meanwhile, the Centre has also waived customs duty and health cess on the import of oxygen and equipment related to the gas with immediate effect for three months after Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting to discuss ways to boost the battle against the pandemic on Saturday.India is also getting oxygen from other countries including Canada, Dubai and Singapore.

Earlier, the Yogi Adityanath-led UP government had strongly opposed the Supreme Court's suggestion to shift the 42-year-old journalist outside the state for treatment, contending that "similarly-placed accused" are getting treated in state hospitals. The government said that Kappan had tested negative for coronavirus disease and can be treated at a jail hospital in Mathura.The Supreme Court took up the matter at 1pm on Wednesday and asked solicitor-general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, to take instructions from the administration on treating journalist Siddique Kappan outside the state. A bench headed by Chief Justice NV Ramana also made it clear that Kappan be sent back to Mathura jail after recovery. The top court, however, granted liberty to the journalist to approach an appropriate forum challenging his arrest or for any other relief and disposed of the plea filed by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ).“Taking into consideration facts of the case, we dispose of the writ petition. Even though Solicitor General Tushar Mehta very seriously opposes, we are directing the state to shift the accused to RML or AIIMS or wherever treatment can be done,” said the bench, also comprising Justices Surya Kant and A S Bopanna.Mehta, representing the UP government, asked the bench to mention in its order that a hospital bed be vacated in Delhi for Kappan as the health care facilities are already full of patients. The apex court, however, declined to say anything on the issue.Siddique Kappan, a journalist from Kerala, was arrested last year on his way to Hathras where a 19-year-old Dalit woman had died after being gang-raped on September 14, 2020, in a village in the district. Her cremation at night by the authorities, allegedly without the parents' consent, had triggered widespread outrage.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-directs-up-to-shift-journalist-siddique-kappan-to-delhi-govt-hospital-101619598442765.html

The court also onMarch 31 barred the IAF’s Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) constituted from looking into the case from proceeding further in the matter.The complainant has alleged intimidation and harassment during the ICC proceedings and said she was asked “obscene and dishonourable questions”. She has also sought the transfer of the accused to prevent him from allegedly threatening and harassing her and other witnesses.Judge Sanjeev Kumar has given four weeks to the respondents, including the colleague, to file their objections. “Subject to objections and till next date before the Bench, it is provided that the Internal Complaints Committee, which is looking into a complaint of sexual harassment at workplace filed by the petitioner, shall not proceed further,” said Kumar’s order on March 31. The case has been listed for the next hearing on May 10.Also Read | Teacher fraternity will conduct online classes from home: JK govtThe complainant has accused the colleague of repeatedly demanding sexual favours, passing lewd remarks and touching her inappropriately.

28-04-2021||India||Odisha hopeful Covid graph plateauing||The Covid-19 graph in Odisha is plateauing, feel health officials, even as the total positivity rate (TPR) and R0 value continued to be high in the state. The second wave of the pandemic has been wreaking havoc across the country, and on Wednesday, the state reported an all-time high of 8,386 fresh cases in the last 24 hours, up from 6,073 cases reported the previous day.The TPR on Wednesday was 19.77 while R0 was 1.71, second only to Uttar Pradesh that has the highest R0 value among all the states. TPR is the total tests reports returning positive out of the total number of tests while R0 value is the average number of people who will contract the virus from an infected person.Director of medical education and training CBK Mohanty said on Tuesday, “In medical science, there is nothing absolute. Hence, we can say that we are in the plateau stage as the state has not witnessed a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in the past few days. We hope that the Covid graph will start witnessing a declining trend soon.” As per the mathematical models that the Odisha health department is using, the peak is supposed to come in the 1st-2nd week of May with a maximum of 10,000 cases. Accordingly, the state government claimed that it has lined up around 20,000 beds in Covid Care Centres as well as dedicated Covid hospitals in public and private sector.Also Read | Singapore sends two planeloads of medical oxygen to India amid Covid-19 surgeEpidemiologists, however, point out that the number of tests too have come down. On most of the days, the number of RT-PCR tests is around 40% of the total number of tests against the ICMR-mandated 70%.Former member of ICMR Dr Tribhuban Mohan Mohapatra said Odisha needs to accelerate testing. “The golden principles of testing, tracing and treating should be followed. At least 60,000 tests, including 30,000 through RT-PCR, should be conducted. Identification and isolation of cases followed by treatment should be the strategy,” he said.Renowned doctor Niroj Mishra said that high TPR is a cause of worry, even if the night curfew and the weekend lockdown may have helped plateau the graph. “In districts like Kalahandi and Nuapara that are close to Chhatisgarh, the TPR is in the range of 35-45 indicating high transmissibility. Unlike the first wave, the quarantine norms are not being enforced well by the municipal authorities and that’s the reason we are seeing a high TPR,” said Mishra.“We should be ready for a rise and try to increase our health infrastructure to deal with it,” said Jayprakash Mulyil, a renowned epidemiologist.Director of National Health Mission, Shalini Pandit, said tests declined due for want of kits. “RT-PCR tests this month are the highest they have ever been in the state. We are using our full laboratory capacity, 24 hours (three shifts). Rapid Antigen Test kits are in short supply nation-wide. However, availability is expected to improve in a week. We will ramp up as kits become available,” she said.Drugs Controller Annada Sankar Das said the state is now facing a shortage of Remdesivir injections. “Odisha will be allocated 21,000 vials of Remdesivir for April 21-30 period. The requirement was nearly 2,000 vials on Monday, but the state received only 92 vials. We have got information that even fewer vials are reaching today, but we have no information about the exact quantity,” he said.However, the state does not have shortage of medical oxygen. Industry secretary Hemant Sharma said against daily requirement of 40 tonnes, Odisha produces around 350 tonnes a day and sends 300 tonnes of oxygen to other states everyday.Meanwhile, chief minister Naveen Patnaik, who chaired a review meeting of the Covid fighting measures of the state said oxygen supply logistics plan should be monitored to ensure sufficient and timely supply of oxygen to the patients.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-hopeful-covid-graph-plateauing-101619592097136.html

Political and religious gatherings have been cited among the reasons for the worst surge of Covid-19 infections that India faces. The second wave of the pandemic has pushed the death toll in the country close to 200,000 and starved hospitals of life-saving medical oxygen and beds.“The SASB [Shri Amarnath Shrine Board] has temporarily suspended the registration of pilgrims in view of the spike in Covid 19 cases. There has been no decision yet to call off the pilgrimage,” said an official, requesting anonymity. “...decisions [such as calling off the pilgrimage] are taken at the board meeting. ...last year, the pilgrimage was cancelled on July 21 because of the rise in Covid 19 cases.”The official said the final decision will depend on how the Covid situation evolves. “Our intention is that if the situation improves, we will try and conduct the pilgrimage strictly in accordance with the Covid... [protocols].”Niteshwar Kumar, the chief executive officer of SASB, did not respond to calls and messages for comments.On April 17, the Mahamandleshwar, or head of Juna Akhada, the largest of the 13 sects of seers, Swami Avdheshanand Giri, was forced to declare the conclusion of the Mahakumbh in Haridwar amid the surge in Covid-19 cases. The announcement came after a phone call from Prime Minister Narendra Modi, requesting only symbolic participation in the fourth and last Shahi Snan (holy dip) on April 27 at the mega fair.The SASB last year arranged a live telecast of rituals from the cave shrine of Amarnath. In 2019, the pilgrimage was curtailed ahead of the nullification of Jammu & Kashmir’s semi-autonomous status as the erstwhile state was locked down and a communications blackout was imposed.In 2018, 285,006 pilgrims undertook the pilgrimage, and this year the government has been making arrangements for 600,000 devotees, officials said. On Tuesday, Jammu & Kashmir reported 25 Covid-19 deaths that pushed the toll from the pandemic to 2,197 in the region.Also Read | J&K’s daily Covid caseload crosses 3,000 mark, Section 144 imposed in SrinagarFormer Jammu & Kashmir police chief S P Vaid said given the magnitude of the pandemic, the pilgrimage should be curtailed but important rituals should be held strictly in accordance with the norms like wearing of masks, social distancing, and hand sanitisation. “We should not commit the blunder of what happened in Kumbhmela.”National Conference leader Israr Khan echoed Vaid and said no religious gatherings, electioneering, etc should be allowed. “We have to be very careful. Let us be alive first…this is not the time to hold any pilgrimage. Saudi Arabia called off Haj... everybody understood the gravity of the situation. If Haj can be cancelled, why cannot this [Amarnath] pilgrimage.” He called for curbs on gatherings such as weddings.Communist Party of India (Marxist) leader MY Tarigami said the country is in the middle of an unprecedented crisis. “We do not want to politicise the miseries and suffering of the people, but we have to hold accountable those in authority. They have to realise the situation and their blunders. Unfortunately, they do not have an iota of concern for the people, and I feel terribly shocked.”Tarigami hoped the Centre and the local administration will realise the gravity of the situation. “As of now, it may not be as bad as it is in Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, but we have to be prepared for the ongoing crisis, which may take a bad turn. Undoubtedly, [Amarnath] Yatra is pious and provides livelihood to many people in Kashmir, but human life is more important than anything else. Therefore, wisdom should prevail on those in authority,” he said. “...the Yatra should be called off and it will be in the best interest of pilgrims, and all of us.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-final-decision-yet-on-calling-off-amarnath-yatra-101619588317126.html

The active cases in the country stand at 2,978,709, which accounts for 16.34% of the total confirmed cases. A total of 17,23,912 samples were tested for coronavirus disease across the country on Tuesday.The figures come days before the nation is set to launch the third phase of the Covid-19 vaccination drive under which all adults, where all citizens above the age of 18 years will be eligible to take the jab. Some states, including Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Punjab and Rajasthan, however, said they won’t be able to begin the inoculation campaign on May 1 due to ‘shortage’ of vaccines stock.As the nation battles the second wave of Covid-19 pandemic, Prime Minister Narendra Modi chaired a meeting with top officials to review the situation in the country in terms of oxygen availability, medicines, health infrastructure, etc. “The PM instructed the officials to work closely with state governments to start the PSA Oxygen plants at the earliest,” his office said in a statement.Several nations have pledged support to India amid the Covid-19 second wave crisis.

Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that more medical equipment, including 100 oxygen concentrators, will be procured and shipped to India over the next week.The Indian Air Force (IAF) also airlifted nine cryogenic oxygen containers from Dubai and Singapore and has brought them to the Panagarh air base in West Bengal, according to an official statement issued on Wednesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-logs-360-960-new-covid-cases-taking-tally-to-17-99mn-toll-above-200000-101619583728410.html
28-04-2021||India||‘India was headed for a very severe second wave yet there was no action’||India is facing the worst surge of Covid-19 infections as a second wave of the pandemic has pushed the death toll close to 200,000 and starved hospitals of life-saving medical oxygen and beds. Ashish K Jha, Dean, the Brown University School of Public Health, spoke to Sunetra Choudhary about the crisis. Edited excerpts:A few weeks ago, the world was celebrating India as a global vaccine manufacturer and today we are looking for help from other countries. As someone who has been following the Covid scenario in India, did you see this coming?Unfortunately, many of us saw it coming. By mid-February, you could start seeing cases rise and by early March, it was very clear that India was headed for a very severe second wave, and yet there was no action. The rallies continued. There were no real efforts for public health mitigation until the numbers were horrible and that is where we are now. One of the lessons of this pandemic is if we wait too long, we are going to have a much bigger crisis. It is very unfortunate that India could have easily stemmed this by acting a few weeks earlier, but it did not.You saw it coming, can you elaborate on the signs?A lot of it is the numbers and a lot of what was happening. I was looking at pictures of mass rallies, I was looking at cinemas opening up, cricket stadiums, and I just thought the pandemic Is not over. And then in the numbers. Around February 8, the number of cases bottomed to near 10,000 which was very low and two weeks later the cases jumped to 20,000 which was a double increase in just two weeks. For those of us watching, that was a very concerning sign. ...by early March, the numbers started to climb. At that point, alarm bells should have gone off, people and policymakers should have started changing the behaviour. Certainly, by mid to later part of March, I and other people were on TV saying this is a problem and India was heading for a second wave but there was still not enough action.Also Watch | Indian Air Force carrying oxygen tankers between 7 cities amid CovidDuring the first wave, election rallies were held in Bihar. Why was there no visible rise of cases given such huge gatherings? Do you think this encouraged the Election Commission (EC) to take another chance?That probably contributed and that makes sense to me. Look no one piece of information is ever alone. The other factor is that by February- March, you were starting to see a major wave of infections in Europe and Brazil, and other parts of the world. The US and UK too were coming off of major waves, a lot of this being driven by B117, the variant originally found in the UK. So, India should have also had a perspective of this risk as we live in a global economy. You can look at any one piece of information and ignore it. But when you put the whole thing together, by late February, early March, it was starting to become very clear.Do you agree with the Madras high court which held the EC responsible?While I do not want to get into the politics of culpability, I do think policymakers are held to account through the ballot box. But I do believe that policymakers should have acted earlier. That is clear to every expert who has been watching India. What happened with Kumbh Mela was very irresponsible and surely has been a major source of infections across the country. So, there are many contributing factors, not just the political rallies. The bottom line is here we are now, and we have got to find a way to save lives now and reduce suffering as much as possible.Do you think the US is finally responding to the crisis?I think the Biden administration is taking everything happening in India very seriously and there are lots of signs of it... When we have all the major leaders, publicly talking about something that means that the issue has reached the highest level and they are taking it very seriously. I am very happy with the list of the things that they are doing. The thing that I had tried to point out is that allies come to each other’s aid in a moment of crisis and India and America, two major democracies, have a special obligation to each other, as friends and as allies. And therefore, in this moment of crisis, it is essential that America acts, and America does as much as it can. I am hopeful and optimistic that we are going to see some real action from the US government.What kind of help can India expect from America?I have been speaking confidentially to various senior policymakers in India’s health ministry and its states to get an assessment of what does India really needs. It is very clear to me looking at the data that India does not have enough testing capacity for the level of infection that exists. Test positivity rates are way too high, and America has a lot of capacity for testing kits. That is an area where America should absolutely be helping. We have been manufacturing a lot of high-quality masks and PPE kits. Universal masking is a very essential part of the pandemic that needs to happen in India. High-quality masks are an important part, which should be sent. We have talked about vaccines, the raw materials as well as finished vaccines, oxygen, and medicines that hospitals are running out of. Then there is this conversation about field hospitals. India can do that on its own, but the size of the problem is such, that any country would need help from others.Masks like N95 are very expensive and people here cannot afford them. What kind of masks do you suggest that people should be using?N95 masks are essential for health care providers. But there are other high-quality masks like KF94s, which are largely made in South Korea, and I have recommended that for the American public. The US government has been working for many months under the Biden administration for the production of high-quality surgical masks. There are a lot of private companies too which make masks not as good as N95 but very close. I personally do not use N95 mask when I am moving around but high-quality surgical or cloth masks. They are all going to be very useful especially with the very contagious set of variants that are out there right now. So, there are many options as long as they are well fitting and have high filtration capacity.There is a perception in India that since the Modi government was seen to be close to the Trump administration, Biden is cold towards it... I do not agree with that. I have been speaking to people very high up in the administration. The administration understands that these are not issues of Donald Trump or Joe Biden or Narendra Modi. These are long-standing relationships between two countries, two peoples and they have to transcend who the political leaders are at any given moment. That is the attitude that Biden is taking, and Modi too. ...we have to put politics aside and focus on the issue at hand. The issue at hand is not about helping Biden or Modi, but it is helping the Indian people at a moment of crisis, where friends come to each other’s aid, whoever is in charge.Also Read | Covid-19: Registrations for phase 3 of vaccine drive to open at 4pm, says CentreA lot of people here say that the international attention, showing cremation sites, and other visuals are portraying the situation in India incorrectly...India has a lot of capacity. I talk publicly about how it is the manufacturing capital of the world for vaccines. But the bottom line is those cremations, those pictures seen outside the hospitals or those cremations, those are also the reality of India right now. I do not think it is unfair in any way to show any weakness of India. It is a complex and wonderful country. But the idea that everything in India is perfect and nothing negative should be shown is neither helpful nor is it true. In general, the global media have done a good job. They did the same for the US as well when patients here were struggling to find a bed in Los Angeles. The media tends to do that a little, but I think showing the broader picture is important. India has strengths and weaknesses, and we need to see all of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/india-was-headed-for-a-very-severe-second-wave-and-yet-there-was-no-action-101619585196914.html

While senior lawyers Abhishek Manu Singhvi and Parag P Tripathi were engaged in a war of words over toll collection by a company, justice Chandrachud was wanting to get up for his cup of tea. “I don’t know how you all can go on at 4pm without having the urge for a cup of tea? At least, I cannot. I must have my tea. That keeps me going for the rest of the day,” he told the senior lawyers. Justice Chandrachud went on to share an anecdote from Mumbai where he first practised as a lawyer and then became a judge. Also Read | Can’t watch national crisis silently, says Supreme Court“On the first floor of the Bombay high court, there is a courtroom in one corner next to which is the staff canteen. As a lawyer, I would go and have my tea in that canteen. But the problem occurred when I became a judge there and was sitting in the courtroom adjacent to this canteen. At 11 every morning, tea would start brewing in the canteen and I could smell fresh tea in my courtroom. But I was a judge and could not get up before 2pm, before the lunch break. And also, as a judge, I could not simply enter the canteen anymore,” reminisced the judge.Justice Chandrachud added that he has an irresistible craving for tea at 4pm, which is also the time for the Supreme Court to wrap up its proceedings. “Brother, don’t you feel the urge for tea in the evening?” he asked justice MR Shah, who was sharing the bench with him on Tuesday.

28-04-2021||India||Eminent Odia and English writer Manoj Das dead||A Padma awardee and an eminent 20th century Odia and English writer, Manoj Das, died at a nursing home in Puducherry on Tuesday evening following prolonged sickness. He was 87. He was under treatment for old-age related ailments at the nursing home at Sri Aurobindo Ashram in Puducherry, his home for several decades.For his work in Odia, Das is best known for ‘Shesha Basantara Chithi’, ‘Manoj Dasanka Katha o Kahani’, ‘Dhumabha Diganta’, ‘Manojpancabimsati’ (short stories), ‘Tuma Gam o Anyanya Kabita’ (poetry). His notable English works include, The crocodiles lady: A collection of stories, The submerged valley and other stories, Farewell to a ghost: Short stories and a novelette, Cyclones, A tiger at twilight, Mystery of the Missing Cap and other short stories.In 2004, he wrote his memoir Chasing the Rainbow: Growing up in an Indian Village.A number of his short stories were translated into major Indian and foreign languages. He received numerous national awards, including the Padma Bhushan last year. He was also awarded with the Kendriya Sahitya Akademi Award, Odisha Sahitya Akademi Award, Sarala Award, Sahitya Bharati Award, Bharatiya Bhasha Parishad (Kolkata) Award, Sri Aurobindo Puraskar (Kolkata) and BAPASI (Booksellers and Publishers Association of South India) Award as the best writer in English in the South.A prolific bilingual writer, Das was known for his dramatic expression as well as satire. Das’ writings dealt with various social and psychological problems, such as the problems of displaced people, natural calamities such as floods, people’s belief in ghosts and spirits, double dealing politicians, psychological disorders etc. In his writings, he mainly focussed on the rural life.Paying tribute to Das, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Das distinguished himself as a noted educationist, popular columnist and prolific writer. “He made rich contributions to English and Odia literature. He was a leading exponent of Sri Aurobindo’s philosophy. Pained by his demise. Condolences to his family. Om Shanti,” he tweeted.Odisha governor professor Ganeshi Lal said he would continue to inspire generations through his timeless literary works. State chief minister Naveen Patnaik said Das not only left an indelible mark in the field of literature but also a void which may never be filled.Born in sea-side village of Shankari in Balasore district of Odisha, the literary genius of Das was first known when his collection of poetry, Satavdira Artanada was published in 1949, when he was in class 10. His first collection of short stories came out a year later, when he was in class 11. The title story, Samudrara Kshudha (The Hunger of the Sea) is considered a classic in Odia literature for its content and narrative style.He was ideologically a Marxist and played a very important role in students’ movements during his college days, when he also published three books, several collections of short stories and a collection of poems. Later, Das taught English along with his wife, Pratijna Devi, a scion of the Kujang zamindars. In 1963, he joined the Sri Aurobindo Ashram at Puducherry and stayed there permanently.Das started as English writer in 1967 with his first collection of short stories-- A Song for Sunday and Other Stories.Graham Greene, the great British novelist, once said, “I have now read the stories of Manoj Das, with very great pleasure. He will certainly take a place on my shelves beside the stories of Narayan (R K Narayan). I imagine Odisha is far from Malgudi but there is the same quality in his stories with perhaps an added mystery”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/eminent-odia-and-english-writer-manoj-das-dead-101619581296457.html
28-04-2021||India||IAF set to lease A330 mid-air refueller from France for training||The Indian Air Force (IAF) has approached the French government to lease one Airbus A330 multi-role tanker transport aircraft for training purposes as a precursor to lease five more mid-air refuellers for increasing the combat capability and radius of its multi-role fighters.The leasing will be done on government-to-government basis with the IAF already issuing a request for information (RFI) for a single aircraft while a request for proposals route will be used for the additional five refuellers on lease. The issue was discussed during Air Chief Marshal RKS Bhadauria’s visit to France last week.“With IAF looking towards A330 refuellers for its future, it is only natural that its pilots are trained in advance to handle the aircraft as mid-air refuelling is a precision process with zero margin of error and huge stakes,” said an IAF official.The A330 refuellers of France and UAE air force have been used to ferry as many as 17 Rafale omni-role fighters to India from Merignac-Bordeaux air base since July 2020. Another seven fighters are due to arrive in India in May with a batch being deployed at the new Hashimara air base in West Bengal with Ambala being the first base.ALSO READ: 6 Rafale fighters to land in India on April 28, 4 more in MayWhile IAF has six Russian origin IL-78 M mid-air refuellers, the A330 refuellers out-power the existing aircraft in terms of its versatility as the latter can not only carry fuel load but also carry troops and weapon pay-load on roll-on-roll-off basis. In case of IL-78 M, there have been limitations on load carrying as well as taking off with payload from high mountain bases like in Leh and Thoise.The A330 can not only operate with load in thin atmosphere of Ladakh and beyond but also supply fuel to Indian fighters at Himalayan heights with combat radius of 1800 km and 50 tonnes of fuel for four hours. The A330 has a ferry range of 14,800 kilometres.With top-of-the-line Rafale aircraft in its inventory, the IAF needs compatible mdi-air refuellers so that it is ready to counter any move from the north. The IAF has to be in a state of readiness as the Chinese army is reluctant in restoring status quo ante in Gogra-Hot Springs area of Eastern Ladakh while the PLA beefs up all along the Line of Actual Control till Arunachal Pradesh.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-set-to-lease-a-a330-mid-air-refueller-from-france-for-training-101619580441806.html

According to initial reports, buildings in Guwahati and other areas were damaged, however, there were no immediate reports of any casualties.The National Centre for Seismology said the quake, with its epicentre in the state’s Sonitpur district, struck at 7.51am. Two aftershocks, one measuring 4.3 on the Richter scale struck at 7.58 am with its epicentre 30km from Tezpur town, while the second one, measuring 4.4 on Richter scale occurred 8.01am some 39km from Tezpur.Chief minister Sarbananda Sonowal asked citizens to remain alert. "Big earthquake hits Assam. I pray for the well-being of all and urge everyone to stay alert. Taking updates from all districts," he said in a tweet.Pictures and videos from the northeastern state surfaced on social media in which cracks on roads could be seen in the aftermath of the earthquake. In one of the videos, a building in Nagaon, a district close to Sonitpur where tremors were felt, could be seen tilted and leaning against its adjacent building.Prime Minister Narendra Modi spoke to Sonowal and took stock of the damage and has promised all possible assistance. “Spoke to Assam CM Shri @sarbanandsonwal Ji regarding the earthquake in parts of the state. Assured all possible help from the Centre. I pray for the well-being of the people of Assam,” PM Modi wrote on Twitter.Union home minister Amit Shah also enquired about the situation and wished for the well-being of the people in the area. “Have spoken to the Chief Minister of Assam, Shri @sarbanandsonwal ji, to assess the condition in different parts of the state after an earthquake.

28-04-2021||India||India’s Covid-19 death count crosses 200,000||The total number of people who have lost their lives to Covid-19 in India crossed 200,000 on Tuesday, with the number of daily deaths in the country crossing the 3,000 mark for the first time as the country struggled to fight off a devastating second wave of infections that has sent the rate of daily deaths rising at one of the worst-ever recorded rates in the world.On Tuesday, India reported 3,286 new fatalities, taking the total number of deaths in the country since the start of the pandemic to 201,187. The country also set a new record for daily infections, with 362,850 new cases, taking the total number of confirmed cases to 17,988,476.Meanwhile, active cases in the country continued to inch towards the 3 million mark – as on Tuesday night, there are 2,979,642 such cases in the country, the highest-ever recorded since the start of the outbreak in March last year, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.India has thus far been one of the better-performing nations in terms of case fatality rate (CFR) – the proportion of confirmed cases that result in deaths. Of all confirmed cases in the country, 1.1% have resulted in deaths – the second-highest (after Turkey’s CFR of 0.8%) among the world’s 10 worst-hit nations. On average, nearly twice as many (2.1%) of all confirmed Covid-19 cases have died in the world. Brazil and the US – the only two countries with caseloads comparable to India – have CFRs of 2.7% and 1.8%, respectively.However, India’s brutal second wave of infections is threatening to undo much of India’s progress in this aspect. The second wave has sent the rate of daily deaths rising at one of the worst-ever recorded rates in the world, data shows.For the week ending Tuesday, 2,657 people lost their lives in the country every day on average. A week ago, this number was 1,490 – meaning average deaths in the country have increased at 78% in just the last week. Even during the brutal third wave in the US and Brazil, daily deaths never grew at a rate that exceeded 50%. India’s daily deaths have now been increasing above the 50% threshold for four straight weeks.The seven-day average of deaths (2,657) on Tuesday is now more than 2.3 times the worst fatalities trajectory witnessed during India’s first Covid wave, when this number topped out at 1,169 for the week ending September 15, 2020.India’s first Covid-19 death was reported on March 12, 2020, when a 76-year-old man who died in Karnataka’s Kalaburgi tested positive for the virus posthumously.Meanwhile, the number of active cases in India on Tuesday neared the 3 million mark as the mammoth surge of new infections continued to push the overburdened health care system to its limits.Active cases is a crucial metric representing the country’s battle against the viral disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in a region and shows the number of people who are currently carrying the disease. As such, the higher the active cases, the more duress the health care system faces, which may lead to higher daily deaths if the former is not brought under control.The metric is even more crucial in current circumstances because the country’s health care system is being weighed down by regions with high caseloads such as Maharashtra, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat, many of which have been reporting not only shortage of supplies such as oxygen tanks, but are also running out of ICU beds, and even space in morgues and funeral homes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-covid-19-death-count-crosses-200000-101619576871459.html
28-04-2021||India||Phase 3 Covid-19 vaccination registration for all above 18 opens today. How to register||All citizens above the age of 18 years can register themselves for getting vaccinated against the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) starting Wednesday as the government gears up to launch the third phase of the immunisation drive on May 1. Even as the Covid-19 vaccination campaign will be rolled out nationwide, some states may not start inoculating all adults on Saturday amid reports of a shortage of vaccine doses.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereChhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Punjab and Rajasthan previously said that they may not open up the vaccination programme from May 1, but several others, including Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Bengal and Tamil Nadu said they were expecting more doses in order to cater to additional recipients.In this phase of inoculation, the Centre has allowed Covid-19 vaccines manufacturers to provide 50% of their supply in open-market to states and private hospitals. While the Serum Institute of India has priced Covishield vaccine at ₹400 per dose for states and ₹600 per dose for private hospitals, Bharat Biotech has decided to sell its Covaxin at ₹600 per dose to states and ₹1,200 per dose to private hospitals. The Centre, however, has asked the drug makers to lower their prices.The government will continue to provide the vaccines free of cost to citizens but for those availing the service at state government-run or private hospitals, the price will depend on whether the hospitals impose any additional service charge.As things stand, starting May 1, those above the age of 45 will continue to get free doses that are distributed by the Union government to states, while those below 45 will need to either pay for doses at private hospitals (if available) or wait till their state governments acquire and make them available at a price or for free.Like the first and the second phase, registration would be done through the cowin.gov.in website and also through the Aarogya Setu mobile app but there won’t be any walk-in registration in this phase.Here is how you can register for Phase 3 vaccination1.

28-04-2021||India||Indian Covid-19 variant found in at least 17 countries: WHO||The World Health Organization said Tuesday that a variant of Covid-19 feared to be contributing to a surge in coronavirus cases in India has been found in over a dozen countries.The UN health agency said the B.1.617 variant of Covid-19 first found in India had as of Tuesday been detected in over 1,200 sequences uploaded to the GISAID open-access database "from at least 17 countries".Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here "Most sequences were uploaded from India, the United Kingdom, USA and Singapore," the WHO said in its weekly epidemiological update on the pandemic.The WHO recently listed B.1.617 -- which counts several sub-lineages with slightly different mutations and characteristics -- as a "variant of interest".But so far it has stopped short of declaring it a "variant of concern".That label would indicate that it is more dangerous that the original version of the virus by for instance being more transmissible, deadly or able to dodge vaccine protections.India is facing surging new cases and deaths in the pandemic, and fears are rising that the variant could be contributing to the unfolding catastrophe.The explosion in infections in India -- 350,000 new cases were recorded there on Tuesday alone -- has driven a surge in global cases to 147.7 million.The virus has now killed more than 3.1 million people worldwide.The WHO acknowledged that its preliminary modelling based on sequences submitted to GISAID indicates "that B.1.617 has a higher growth rate than other circulating variants in India, suggesting potential increased transmissibility".It stressed that other variants circulating at the same time were also showing increased transmissibility, and that the combination "may be playing a role in the current resurgence in this country.""Indeed, studies have highlighted that the spread of the second wave has been much faster than the first," the WHO said.It highlighted though that "other drivers" could be contributing to the surge, including lax adherence to public health measures as well as mass gatherings."Further investigation is needed to understand the relative contribution of these factors," it said.The UN agency also stressed that "further robust studies" into the characteristics of B.1.617 and other variants, including impacts on transmissibility, severity and the risk of reinfection, were "urgently needed".||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indian-covid-19-variant-found-in-at-least-17-countries-who-101619572922138.html
28-04-2021||India||CEOs of 40 US companies create global task force to help India fight Covid-19||In a show of solidarity, the CEOs of about 40 top American companies have come together to create a first-of-its-kind country-specific global task force to mobilise resources and coordinate efforts to help India fight the battle against Covid-19.A collective initiative of the US-India Business Council of the US Chamber of Commerce, and the US-India Strategic and Partnership Forum and Business Roundtable, the task force during its meeting here on Monday committed to get 20,000 oxygen concentrators to India in the next few weeks, Deloitte CEO Punit Renjen told PTI.The new US public-private partnership to provide India critical medical supplies, vaccines, oxygen and other life-saving assistance amid an unprecedented surge in coronavirus cases is called the 'Global Task Force on Pandemic Response: Mobilising for India'.The first-of-its-kind country-specific global task force to address a public health crisis in another country was addressed by US Secretary of State Tony Blinken.The conversation showed how the United States and India can leverage the expertise and capabilities of the US private sector towards solutions for India's Covid-19 crisis, Blinken said in a tweet."A number of American companies have come together over the weekend. We are focused on doing our very best to help in any way that we possibly can. As the prime minister said, we were very confident, our spirits were up after successfully tackling the first wave, but this storm has shaken the nation. It is up to us to help in any way possible," Renjen said in response to a question.Observing that the first issue is around oxygen and its concentrators, Renjen said they have commitments to get 20,000 oxygen concentrators to India in the next few weeks.The first 1,000 will arrive in the middle of this week, he said, adding that by May 5, they expect another 11,000 oxygen concentrators to reach the country."Our goal is to get 25,000, and maybe even a number higher than that," he added.The second issue is to look at oxygen cylinders with 10-litre and 45-litre capacity and to get other supplies like monitoring kits, Renjen said."I am very pleased with the fact that these companies have come together. We're working with the USISPF, as well as the USIBC … and with the Business Roundtable to coordinate this effort to help India in any way that that is required,” he said.Welcoming the call between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and President Joe Biden and the decision of the US to urgently send supplies to India, the Deloitte CEO reiterated that the two countries are natural allies."I'm very heartened by the fact that the US government is going to step up and do its part," he said.The fight against Covid-19 is personal for Renjen as several family members of Renjen, who comes from Rohtak, Haryana have contracted the disease.Around 2,000 of Deloitte's employees in India have been infected, he said."We are facilitating individuals getting the vaccines. We are providing them medical assistance, home testing kits. This is being consistently done by all entities that have big footprints in India. That is really important to do," Renjen said."We will do everything on our part to take care of our employees, like I believe every one of the multinationals that were on the call with me are committed to doing. But they have really stepped up," he said."This is a real kudos to Indian talent," Renjen said.The task force also comprises representations from retail sector, e-commerce, pharmaceutical, technology industry and large manufacturing entities."This global crisis requires a global response, and the American business community could not be better positioned, or more determined, to help lead the way,” said Suzanne Clark, president and chief executive officer of the US Chamber of Commerce.“It was wonderful to see everybody focused on making sure that they do their part, that they contribute. Out of that discussion, the first step that we came up with was these oxygen concentrators,” Renjen said.“Our point to the US government is to provide assistance (to India), wherever it's requested,” he added.These US companies are coordinating with the Indian ambassador to the US, Taranjit Singh Sandhu.“Earlier in the week, he gave us the list of items that are of critical need,” Renjen said.The list includes oxygen concentrators, oxygen generators, two critical medicines that he wanted to see if the US government can release, monitoring kits, and encouraging the US government to ease supply of critical materials for vaccines.Responding to a question, Renjen exuded confidence that India would overcome this.“This too shall pass. I am very confident in my Indian brothers and sisters; we will overcome this,” he said.“I don't think we need to panic. We listen to the scientists and listen to the people that are managing this in the country. I think we just have to navigate through it. We will have two or three weeks of very difficult times."It is a tragic situation, particularly for people that have COVID or who have lost loved ones. My heart goes out to them, but we are going to do our part,” Renjen said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ceos-of-40-us-companies-create-global-task-force-to-help-india-fight-covid19-101619569669999.html
28-04-2021||India||Can’t watch national crisis silently, says Supreme Court||"We cannot remain a mute spectator in the times of a national crisis”, said the Supreme Court on Tuesday as it sought details of availability of medical oxygen, supply of essential medicines, ramping up of critical medical infrastructure, and the rationale of vaccine pricing from the central government to assess its readiness.“This is a national crisis and the Supreme Court of India, being the national constitutional court, cannot be a silent spectator... the intervention of this court has to be appreciated in proper perspective. The court has jurisdiction under Article 32 towards the protection of fundamental rights. In the face of a national crisis, the court cannot stand silent as a mute spectator,” said a bench, led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, while hearing the matter registered suo motu (on its own).The bench, which included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, also put the record straight that the Supreme Court was concerned about the national issues that are beyond state boundaries while the jurisdictional high courts can continue to issue suitable directives in the cases being heard by them on the resurgence of the pandemic.“By the pendency of these proceedings, the high courts are not restrained from continuing to deal with the issue that they are seized of... High courts are best situated to assess the ground realities in each state and come up with flexible solutions for practical concerns of the citizens. The high courts are in a better position to monitor the territorial situation. At the same time, it is also important for the Supreme Court to intervene to look into the systemic, national issues and ensure the coordination at a national level and between the states, which the high courts may find difficult to deal with,” it said.Fixing the next hearing on Friday, the bench added it wants a “unified national plan” from the central government to serve the needs of citizens of this country. “What have you done till date is one thing but what you plan to do for the future is what we want to know from you...Where do we stand and what have we planned for the future,” the bench told solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre.Mehta replied that the government has filed a detailed affidavit on Tuesday, elucidating how all available resources are being put to their optimum use in assistance with the state governments, and that the Prime Minister was personally looking into the efforts to deal with the sudden surge in the infection.Last week, a controversy ensued after a bench led by then CJI SA Bobde took a suo motu cognisance of the surge in infections the day before his retirement and appointed senior advocate Harish Salve as the amicus curiae to assist the court. This, even as Salve represented Vedanta, which wanted to operate its controversial shuttered plant in Tamil Nadu. Several senior advocates such as Indira Jaising, Vikas Singh, Dushyant Dave and Sanjay Hegde questioned the move, asking if this was an endeavour by the Supreme Court to hold the hands of the high courts that were already supervising these issues in their jurisdiction, keeping the Centre and state governments on their toes.On Friday, justice Bobde had clarified that they had not restrained the high courts from taking up the matters while Salve withdrew as the amicus in the wake of the controversy surrounding his possible conflict of interest.Meanwhile, various senior advocates appearing for different state governments and stakeholders on Tuesday raised issues pertaining to the supply and transit of oxygen, and the differences in prices of the two vaccines – Covishield and Covaxin -- between the Centre and states.Senior advocate Anand Grover, appearing for People’s Health Movement, suggested suspension of intellectual property rights of the companies so that shortage and pricing of essential medicines could be taken care of, while senior counsel Siddharth Dave, appearing for another applicant, said there should be a uniform policy across states for admission in hospitals.Calling them “relevant issues” for consideration by the Centre, the bench also sought to know from the Centre basis and rationale of pricing of the vaccines while pointing out that the Union government apparently has powers under the Drug Price Control Order and the Patents Act to regulate the prices during a national emergency.“If this is not a national emergency, then we fail to understand what is... If you clarify this, a lot of issues would be resolved at the level of the high courts,” observed the bench, asking the Centre to also explain the steps that the Union is taking to ensure everyone above 18 is vaccinated once the new drive begins May 1.In Phase 3 of the vaccination programme, in which everyone above 18 can get the jab from May 1, the manufacturer has fixed the prices for Covaxin at ₹150 for the Centre and ₹600 for the states, while it is ₹1200 for private hospitals. Covishield will cost ₹150 to the Centre, ₹400 for the states, and ₹600 to private hospitals.New Covid-19 cases in India continued to shatter global records on Tuesday, as the country saw 362,850 single-day infections, its highest ever, taking the total number of cases in the country to nearly 18 million, even as new deaths due the disease soared past the 3,000 mark -- also for the first time -- amid a crippling shortage of medical amenities in dozens of states with high caseloads.The top court bench also clarified that by hearing these issues, the top court is not taking over the functioning of the government but will rather play a complementary role by giving valuable suggestions and inputs.“Recrimination won’t save people’s lives. Let us all find solution and that is my appeal to all the members of the Bar. Let this not be adversarial,” the bench told all the counsel.In its order, the court underlined five focus areas. These included projected demand and distribution for oxygen in the country at present and the future and the steps being taken to augment it; enhancement of the critical medical infrastructure such as number of beds, and Covid treatment centres equipped with health care professionals; availability of essential drugs such as remdesivir; the projected requirement of vaccines and the modalities to ensure that any deficit will be catered to apart from rationale of their pricing; and a system of seamless communication from a district-level officer to the Union ministry of health.Adjourning the matter to Friday, the court said that it will go through the affidavits submitted by the Centre and that the S-G may file an additional response to the queries being underscored by the bench.Centre’s affidavitIn its affidavit, the Centre has said that a national disaster management plan is already in place since November 2019 and that this plan specifically deals with “biological and public health emergencies” while providing for a broad framework in terms of the response to be provided in pursuance in case of any disaster.“A national plan does not and cannot contain step by step instructions or specific directions for the day-to-day management by government agencies in the situation of any particular and unforeseen disaster...the decisions taken till date by the central government, as per the national plan, and as per the procedure laid down therein, have been according to the contemporaneous knowledge about the nature, efficacy and the effect of Covid-19 on large populations,” stated the affidavit.About the production of remdesivir, the Centre said that owing to a limited demand for the antiviral drug during the preceding months, the seven licensed manufacturers in India produced 2.7 million vials of remdesivir per month whereas the total installed capacity was 3.88 million vials per month.On medical oxygen, the Centre told the court that the resource cannot be unlimited in any country, and the government was augmenting oxygen supply on a war footing with the active and constant supervision of the Prime Minister.It added that oxygen supplies available at any given time is meant to be distributed to the states, especially those which are critically burdened with high number of active Covid-19 cases, in a balanced manner.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-watch-national-crisis-silently-says-supreme-court-101619562241221.html
28-04-2021||India||Pandemic rages, but farmers defy odds with winter harvest||As a devastating Covid-19 second wave tears through the country, farmers have defied the odds -- even in states with high daily cases -- to nearly complete harvesting of most winter-sown crops, as they prepare for the oncoming kharif, or summer sowing, season.Timely agricultural operations despite surging Covid-19 infections have ensured stable food supplies and farm incomes, although there have been reports of farm markets functioning with lower capacities in states such as Maharashtra, government officials aware of the developments said.According to the second official advance estimates, issued in February 2021, India’s foodgrains production in 2020-21 is estimated to be a record 303.34 million tonne — up from the 297.5 million tonne produced in 2019-20.Farmers have already harvested a total of 82% of wheat, the key winter staple, said an agriculture ministry official who asked not to be named. Wheat had been sown in 31.5 million.Harvesting has reached 99% in Rajasthan, 96% in Madhya Pradesh, 80% in Uttar Pradesh, 65% in Haryana and 60% in Punjab, according to agriculture ministry data.Farmers have also wrapped up sugarcane harvesting in Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Telangana. Chhattisgarh and Karnataka are among states worst hit by the Covid-19 surge.In Madhya Pradesh, Punjab, Maharashtra – which saw one of the deadliest spikes in coronavirus cases this month – farmers have completed harvesting of lentils, such as gram, urad, mung and peas. Harvesting is at its peak in Haryana, Punjab, and UP. “It is likely to be completed by the end of April,” an official said.Experts say the rural India may not have escaped the current Covid-19 surge, which set off once again in urban centres such as Mumbai, and has crippled several cities, including Delhi and Bengaluru, which are experiencing their worst outbreaks.According to a health ministry briefing this week, there were 146 districts across the country where the positivity rate, (positive cases against tests), was more than 15 per cent. Some of the worst-hit states, such as Chhattisgarh, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan, have predominantly rural populations.In Bihar, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Haryana, Madhya Pradesh, Uttarakhand and West Bengal, 92 to 98% harvesting was complete, the data showed.In Uttar Pradesh, 84% harvesting was done.Agriculture forms the backbone of the India economy and is one of its key drivers.Last year, when a strict lockdown crushed the economy, stoking a recession, the agriculture sector, which employs half of all Indians, demonstrated remarkable resilience to register positive growth. Agriculture grew 3.4% in the June 2020 quarter, when the overall economy registered a 24.4% drop.Growth returned to positive territory in the December 2020 quarter, the latest available data, expanding 0.4%. Agriculture grew at 3.9% in the same period, compared to 3% in the previous quarter.Experts say the exemption of the agriculture sector from Covid-19 restrictions has enabled farm operations to continue unhindered.For sugarcane, out of the total sown in 4.8 million hectares (sugar season 2020-21), harvesting has been completed in Chhattisgarh, Karnataka and Telangana. In the oilseeds category, harvesting of rapeseed and mustard sown in around 7 million hectares has fully done in Rajasthan, UP, MP, WB, Jharkhand, Gujarat, Chhattisgarh, Odisha and Assam. It is almost complete in Haryana (99.95%) and also Punjab (77%).Ajit Kesari, principal secretary, Madhya Pradesh farmers welfare and agriculture department, said, “According to the latest data, the harvesting has been completed in MP. We are glad that Covid-19 did not impact harvesting of wheat, lentils and mustard. Now, we have started the procurement process and have procured at least 5.6 million MT wheat till now.”A senior Uttar Pradesh government official also said that harvesting has been completed in India’s most populous state. “Wheat procurement is going on in full swing at procurement centres across the state. Covid-19 had no adverse impact on economic or other activities in villages. Till April 22, a total of 524,000 MT of wheat has been purchased at the procurement centres,” the official, who did not want to be named, said.“I have completed wheat harvests in my 20 acres land through hired equipment. I have not faced any difficulty in selling it through agricultural market committees,” said Amarjeet Pal, a farmer from Punjab’s Hoshiarpur, who is affiliated to the Bharatiya Kisan Union.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pandemic-rages-but-farmers-defy-odds-with-winter-harvest-101619561948324.html
28-04-2021||India||Covid-19 vaccine: All 18+ can sign up from today, but May 1 launch under cloud||All adult Indians will be able to sign up for coronavirus vaccines beginning Wednesday, April 28, but several states and the Union government differed on whether there was a shortage of doses, reinforcing concerns that the May 1 roll-out of the third phase of the drive for everyone above the age of 18 could be patchy and uncertain.Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Punjab and Rajasthan have said previously they are unlikely to open up the vaccination programme from May 1, but several others – Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Bengal and Tamil Nadu — said they were expecting more doses in order to account for the additional number of recipients.The arithmetic is complicated due to the second doses that will be due, even as many open negotiations with the manufacturers or await confirmation of delivery timelines.Punjab was among states that raised fresh concerns over availability on Tuesday. State health minister Balbir Singh Sidhu said that Punjab has roughly 250,000 doses at hand for the 45-plus category and those eligible for the second doses, and, at an average utilisation rate of 90,000 per day, stocks were likely to run out over the next two-to-three days. “Existing doses cannot be used as Centre’s supply has remained very limited,” said Sidhu.Shortage was also reported from Tamil Nadu, where uptake is high and the Greater Chennai Corporation in the state capital opened temporary vaccination centres this week to avoid overcrowding. But the agency later decided that due to a shortage in supply of Covaxin, these centres will administer doses only to those who are up for their second shot.In certain centres, several people have complained of not being able to get a second dose as well.A similar rush and shortage was also reported from Kerala, where people eligible for their second doses are now queuing up at centres.In Thiruvananthapuram, three people collapsed while waiting in long queues and were shifted to a hospital on Monday.The Union government, however, denied that there was a shortage.In a statement, it said at least 15 crore (150 million) Covid-19 vaccines were given to states free of cost since the drive began and at least 10 million are still available with the States. Approximately 8 million doses are in the pipeline to be provided to them in the next 3 days, the government said.“Government of India has so far provided more than 15 crore vaccine doses (156,526,140) to States/UTs Free of Cost. Of this, the total consumption including wastages is 146,478,983 dose,” the statement added.According to detailed figures released, Punjab was scheduled to get 350,000 doses in the pipeline.The figures showed that Uttar Pradesh, with 1.1 million, and Bihar, with 700,000, were scheduled to receive the highest numbers of doses from the pipeline over the next few days.Both these states said they will allow all adults to take doses form May 1, although Bihar was yet to announce if it has placed any direct orders for doses from the manufacturers.UP has placed orders for 5 five million doses each of Serum Institute’s Covishield and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin, and an official said the roll-out of Phase 3 could depend on the supply of these and the pending doses.Beginning May 1, the coronavirus vaccinations will follow two tracks – those above the age of 44 will continue to get free doses that are distributed by the Union government to states, while those below 45 will need to either pay for doses at private hospitals (if available) or wait till their state governments acquire and make them available at a price or for free.From Wednesday, anyone aged 18 or above can use the CoWIN website or the Aarogya Setu application will allow anyone above the age of 18 to register for coronavirus vaccines to register for doses.Officials in several states have raised concerns over lack of clarity from manufacturers for the delivery timeline, while some others said they were yet to open discussions or hear back from the companies.An official in Madhya Pradesh, where the government is otherwise confident of launching the next phase from May 1 itself, said an order of 4.5 million doses of Covishield has been placed but deliveries are only expected by mid-May.Officials in Chhattisgarh said they had placed orders for 5 million doses in an even split between the two manufacturers, but were informally told that deliveries could take till July, according to an official who asked not to be named.These issues with deliveries and an expected rush as is typical whenever new groups of people are made eligible has shrouded the May 1 launch in uncertainty. The problems are complicated by concerns over pricing – both manufacturers said they will offer the lowest doses to the Union government – and calls by experts and states to make it free.In Bengal, which will launch the drive after the election results are out, an official said that private hospitals will not be allowed to use any of the stocks distributed till now, in keeping with the government guidelines.This has, however, raised questions over the options for people who took their first doses at these facilities, since private centres will now need to directly procure doses and administer them at retail prices.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-vaccine-all-18-can-sign-up-from-today-but-may-1-launch-under-cloud-101619561317301.html
28-04-2021||India||A woman with a cat||She lives with Hayati, her cat. This is her parents’ house in Noida’s Sector 19. Both passed away last year.Sitting in the bedroom, Saumya Mallika Mathur, 26, recalls on a WhatsApp video chat that this is the very room “where I slept with my mother, while she fought her third cancer battle.” At this time last year, both were in the hospital hoping “we would make it through this one too”. Her mother died four months ago; her father died early last year after a prolonged illness.“I feel Mummy in this room.”Earlier working in digital marketing, Ms Mathur is on a sabbatical “focusing on grieving and healing while getting used to taking care of myself”.In the morning she wakes to her cat’s “cute meows” when “it hits me that I can’t ask mummy anymore to feed the cat. I put on the TV and play the prayers she used to listen.”Being alone, Ms Mathur often skips her meal hours. “Eating alone isn’t a pleasant experience.” She keeps “microwaveable” food around so that she doesn’t have to spend a lot of time in the kitchen, for being in the kitchen is a reminder to her of her mother’s passing, she says.“I don’t know how the day passes, or when the sun sets. I sleep when my eyes are so tired that they shut by themselves, as even trying to close my eyes voluntarily gives me anxiety attacks.”Ms Mathur does have some friends and relatives but she feels they aren’t emotionally available to her. “Maybe it’s because of Covid that everyone has become so distant.”Some might imagine her to be extraordinarily strong for dealing with such profound losses at such a young age. But she argues that “being strong means no one will be willing to see you break down. I have lost the comfort that I’ll be looked after.”As she gets used to a new life, Ms Mathur hopes to find happiness.On being complemented for her ear danglers, she confirms with a smile that the little things hanging in them indeed are teeny-weeny tea kettles.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/a-woman-with-a-cat-101619556932858.html
28-04-2021||India||Panel to monitor air quality in Delhi-NCR reconstituted||The Union environment ministry has reconstituted the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas after having disbanded it in March, just five months after it was created.On April 13, the Union government promulgated the Commission for Air Quality Management in the National Capital Region and Adjoining Areas Ordinance 2021 and on April 23 issued a notification to constitute the commission.The chairperson of the commission continues to be MM Kutty, former secretary in the ministry of petroleum and natural gas and former chief secretary of Delhi.Mukesh Khare, a full-time technical member (before the previous ordinance lapsed) and IIT Delhi professor, and Ajay Mathur, director general of the International Solar Alliance, who was an independent member from an NGO, are not part of the commission anymore.Ashish Dhawan of the Air Pollution Action Group is the only NGO member, while Ramesh KJ, former secretary, earth sciences, is the only full-time technical member in the commission now.Among the associate members inducted in the commission are Soumita Biswas, joint secretary, agriculture ministry; Amitabh Kumar, joint secretary, commerce and industry; Kailash Chand Gupta, additional secretary, ministry of road transport and highways; Vivek Kumar Dewangan, additional secretary, power ministry; and Navneet Mohan Kothari, joint secretary, ministry of petroleum and natural gas. A member of the commission said these associate members have been inducted to represent views of farmers, industry bodies, and the transport sector.Initially, the Commission for Air Quality Management ordinance was promulgated by the President on October 28, but the bill to replace the ordinance was not passed in the budget session of Parliament, as a result of which the commission ceased to operate from March 12.Since Parliament is not in session, the President has promulgated another ordinance to bring the commission into action.After the previous ordinance lapsed, and the commission was shut down, independent environmental experts criticised the Union environment ministry for not being serious about tackling air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The issue has gained even more importance in recent days with reports of farm fires in certain parts of the northern plains.The newly constituted commission continues to have sweeping powers in controlling air pollution in Delhi-NCR.“It’s good news that we are back in action. Now members from farmers bodies, construction sector and industries have also been included in the commission. A provision has also been made so that serving professionals can be appointed as members. Earlier only retired professionals were to be considered. The Centre had assured farmers’ groups that the clause regarding penalising farmers will be withdrawn. So, it has been withdrawn now,” said a commission member on condition of anonymity.“This new ordinance is as much an opportunity as it is a mirage. While there are powers to take all measures, issue directions and entertain complaints, it is left to what the discretion of commission considers expedient and necessary,” said Kanchi Kohli, legal researcher, Centre for Policy Research.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/panel-to-monitor-air-quality-in-delhi-ncr-reconstituted-101619556473139.html
28-04-2021||India||First batch of Russia’s Sputnik V vaccine to arrive in India by May 1||The Russian Direct Investment Fund (RDIF) on Tuesday said it will export the first batch of Sputnik V vaccine to India from May 1, the day India expands its Covid-19 immunisation drive to cover all adults.“The first doses will be delivered on 1 May,” RDIF chief executive officer Kirill Dmitriev said.However, a spokesperson for the company’s partner in India, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories, said it is not providing a specific date for the launch, adding that while the company had earlier indicated that delivery will start from the end of May, that timeline has now been shifted to anytime in May.“Discussions over pricing and the number of doses are still ongoing between Dr Reddy’s, RDIF and the government,” the spokesperson said.RDIF had last year said that the company will price the vaccine at less than $10 ( ₹750) per dose in international markets. Pricing of the vaccine varies in different countries.Dr Reddy’s management has earlier said that the initial quantity of vaccine that will be supplied in India will be limited as they will primarily be imported from Russia. However, RDIF’s manufacturing partners in India will start producing the jabs locally by July, after which the supplies will be scaled up.RDIF is in partnership with six companies in India— Hetero Biopharma, Gland Pharma, Stelis Biopharma, Panacea Biotec, Virchow Biotech and Shilpa Medicare—to collectively contract manufacture more than 850 million doses of Sputnik V.

Our entire focus should be on how people will recover and how we can provide them relief,” he told reporters in Rohtak on Monday.“And those who have died will not come back by creating a furore over it,” he said at one point, arguing that there was no point in getting into a debate on whether or not the official number of deaths was correct.The opposition Congress was quick to slam his remarks with party general secretary Randeep Singh Surjewala saying, “These can only be the words of a merciless ruler. There is a need to make a noise over every death which is the result of the government’s inefficiency so that the deaf BJP government can hear the echo.”Haryana Congress chief Kumari Selja also slammed Khattar for such an “irresponsible” statement. “The people are suffering from serious disease and waiting for medicines, oxygen supply and ventilators and Haryana chief minister is making irresponsible statements on Covid patients’ deaths. Congress condemns his statement,” she said.Adampur MLA Kuldeep Bishnoi also condemned the CM’s comment. “These remarks are shameful. I strongly condemn the thinking of the chief minister,” the Congress leader tweeted.(With inputs from PTI)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/furore-won-t-bring-back-dead-haryana-cm-khattar-s-remark-sparks-row-101619554644918.html
28-04-2021||India||US’s Gilead to donate 450k remdesivir vials||US pharma company Gilead Sciences on Tuesday announced that it will donate 4,50,000 vials of its injection remdesivir to India, and providing its voluntary licensing partners in the country with technical assistance to rapidly scale up production in the wake of the surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the country and the scramble for the antiviral drug.“The recent surge of Covid-19 cases in India is having a devastating impact on communities and has created unprecedented pressure on health systems,” Johanna Mercier, chief commercial officer, Gilead Sciences said in a statement.“We are committed to doing our part to help tackle this crisis. Our immediate focus is to help address the needs of patients in India who may benefit from remdesivir as quickly as we can by working together with the government, health authorities and our voluntary licensees.”Gilead sciences holds patent for remdesivir that is one of the investigational drugs prescribed under restricted emergency use in treating Covid-19 patients in India. WHO has previously said that there is no evidence that the drug reduces mortality or obviates the need for ventilation in hospitalised patients, although it has been found to help those in early stages of the infection requiring supplemental oxygen.“…the company is providing its voluntary licensing partners with technical assistance, support for the addition of new local manufacturing facilities and the donation of active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to rapidly scale up production of remdesivir. Remdesivir is approved in India for restricted emergency use for the treatment of suspected or laboratory confirmed Covid-19 in adults and children hospitalized with severe disease. In addition to providing support to its licensees to expand their local manufacturing capacity, Gilead will also donate at least 450,000 vials of Veklury (remdesivir) to help address the immediate needs of Indian patients,” the company added in its statement.Gliead sciences has seven licensing partners based in India, and all seven of the licensees have significantly accelerated production of remdesivir by scaling up their batch sizes, adding new manufacturing facilities and/or onboarding local contract manufacturers across the country.The central government has also taken several measures to tide over the problem of remdesivir shortage in India, including extending support to manufacturers.According to the government, production capacity of remdesivir in the country is being ramped up from the current level of 3.8 million vials per month to 7.4 million vials per month, and 20 additional manufacturing sites have also been approved.Many states have channelised remdesivir sales after reports of widespread black-marketing. Companies too, have been trying to work directly with hospitals. The Union ministry of health, in coordination with department of pharmaceuticals, has made an interim allocation of remdesivir for 19 States for the period up to April 30, 2021.Experts say that remdesivir is no magic bullet and needs to be used selectively.“In a US study it was shown that if given to moderate to severe patients there is a chance hospital stay will reduce somewhat. Therefore, stable patients who are in home isolation, with oxygen saturation of 94% and above, they don’t require remdesivir. If mild cases take remdesivir then there is a chance of more harm than good. It is no magic bullet, and should be given only to hospitalized patients,” said Dr Randeep Guleria, director, All India institute of Medical Sciences (AIMS), Delhi.The government on April 11 also banned export of remdesivir that, according to the ministry of chemicals and fertilisers’ statement, diverted approximately 4 lakh vials meant for export to fulfil domestic requirement.Meanwhile, another pharma company Merck & Co.’s Indian subsidiary MSD Pharmaceuticals has announced that it will enter into non-exclusive voluntary licensing agreements for its anti-viral drug, molnupiravir, with five established Indian generic manufacturers.Molnupiravir is an investigational oral antiviral agent currently being studied in a Phase 3 trial for the treatment of non-hospitalized patients with confirmed Covid-19.“MSD has entered into these agreements to accelerate availability of molnupiravir in India and in other low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) following approvals or emergency authorization by local regulatory agencies,” the company said in a statement on Tuesday.The agreements have been signed with CIPLA Limited, Dr Reddy’s Laboratories Limited, Emcure Pharmaceuticals Limited, Hetero Labs Limited and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries Limited.“The scale of human suffering in India at this moment is devastating, and it is clear that more must be done to help alleviate it. These agreements, toward which we have been working as we have been studying molnupiravir, will help to accelerate access to molnupiravir in India and around the world,” Kenneth C. Frazier, chairman and CEO, Merck & Co added in the statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uss-gilead-to-donate-450k-remdesivir-vials-101619550979812.html
28-04-2021||India||Less crowd, but no Covid-19 norms on last shahi snan||The last of the shahi snans (holy dips) of the Mahakumbh was a largely symbolic affair, with only a few tens of thousands of seers and pilgrims participating in the event on account of Covid-19, much lower than the millions that did in the previous shahi snans, although those that did still ignored protocols such as wearing a mask or social distancing.Seers from all the 13 Akhadas (sects) participated in the shahi snan with a major focus on the three Bairagi Akhadas. It was also Lord Hanuman’s birth anniversary on Tuesday -- Hanuman is the deity of the Bairagi Akhadas -- and there was quite a buzz in the Baiaragi camp and Hanuman temples.Prime Minister Modi made a plea on April 17, asking the Akhadas to observe the Kumbh (April 1 to 30) and the last of the shahi snans in spirit only. His plea came amidst the surging second wave of the pandemic , and after the complete breach of all Covid-19 safety protocols in the previous shahi snans. The union government has come under criticism for allowing the mass event to go ahead during the pandemic, and the state government , for not following Covid safety protocols. Infections have claimed the lives of two chief seers during the Kumbh, and many others have been infected. Pilgrims have also carried back infections from the event to other parts of India.On Tuesday, Niranjani and Anand Akhada seers were the first to head towards the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund,Har-Ki-Pauri followed by Juna , Agni and Aahwan Akhada in pre scheduled order set by Kumbh Mela administration in consultation with the Akhada Parishad, the apex body of seers.Maha Nirvani Akhada and Atal Akhada seers were followed by three Bairagi Akhadas, Nirvani, Digambar and Nirmohi.Pilgrims were allowed to take a dip in the Ganga at Har-Ki-Pauri prior to the arrival of the seers at 9 am.Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat, Kumbh Mela Force Inspector general Sanjay Gunjiyal, SSP Mahakumbh Janmejaya Khanduri and ADM Mela Harbeer Singh welcomed the seers at Har-Ki-Pauri and urged them to wear masks and practice social distancing.“ Kumbh Mela Force personnel were themselves in protective gear and also distributed free face masks and sanitizers at Ganga ghats and Akhadas’ processison route,” said Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/less-crowd-but-no-covid-19-norms-on-last-shahi-snan-101619550968801.html
28-04-2021||India||Australia unveils Covid-19 support package for India, suspends flights||Australia on Tuesday unveiled an initial support package for India’s Covid-19 response, including 500 ventilators, even as it suspended all flights between the two countries for two weeks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus.The assistance was announced jointly by foreign minister Marise Payne and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who said more medical equipment, including 100 oxygen concentrators, will be procured and shipped to India over the next week.Though the Australian government had earlier planned to temporarily reduce flights from India by 30% after recording a spike in incoming travellers testing positive for Covid-19, Morrison announced the National Security Committee had decided to pause all direct passenger flights from India until May 15.Australia has joined a growing number of countries rushing medical equipment, supplies and oxygen to India, which recorded 362,850 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday. A total of 3,286 people succumbed to the virus, taking the death toll to 201,187.The initial support package will include 500 non-invasive ventilators, one million surgical masks, 500,000 P2 and N95 masks, 100,000 surgical gowns, 100,000 goggles, 100,000 pairs of gloves and 20,000 face shields.The supply of ventilators will be scaled up 3,000 and the Australian government will procure 100 oxygen concentrators, along with tanks and consumables. All the equipment will be shipped to India over the next week.“I stress this is an initial package, there will be more to follow, of support and to deliver this as soon as possible,” Morrison told the news conference.“We recognise the challenging Covid-19 crisis that India is currently battling and we stand ready to provide more support to our friends in India and Indian Australians during this difficult time,” Morrison and Payne said in a statement.The statement noted that Australia’s Chief Medical Officer had designated India a “high-risk country” for travel arrangements. The suspension of flights will have an immediate impact on two passenger services to Sydney and two repatriation flights to Darwin, affecting around 500 people.When flights from India resume, passengers will be required to have both a negative Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result and a negative rapid antigen test result prior to taking off.Indirect flights from India through the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Malaysia have already been paused by the respective governments.“Once flights restart, the government will prioritise the return of vulnerable Australians. Already almost 20,000 registered Australians have returned from India since the pandemic began,” the statement said. A hardship program and consular support is already in place for Australians in India.Morrison described the situation in India as a “very significant outbreak” and said: “From the scenes we are seeing from India, they are truly heartbreaking. India is a great friend of Australia and a comprehensive strategic partner. We share so much in common as peoples, as democratic nations, and we extend our deepest sympathies and condolences and our support to the nation of India and the people of India and...Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi.”Payne pointed to India’s generosity throughout this pandemic and the export of more than 66 million vaccines, including gifts of doses to Nauru and Fiji. “It has also manufactured vaccine doses for Papua New Guinea, for the Solomon Islands, being delivered though the COVAX facility and we warmly acknowledge that generosity,” she said.There are currently a little more than 9,000 Australians registered in India, including 650 registered as vulnerable, Payne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-unveils-covid-19-support-package-for-india-suspends-flights-101619551082827.html
28-04-2021||India||Supreme Court permits Vedanta to operate Tamil Nadu plant for oxygen||The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government to refrain from “political bickering” while it permitted Vedanta to operate its shuttered copper plant in Thoothukudi only for the production of medical oxygen at a time when there is a shortage of critical supplies amid the second Covid-19 wave in the country.A bench led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud said that the oxygen production unit will function on a stand-alone basis, and that Vedanta will not be allowed to access the copper and power plants in the precinct.Oxygen is a crucial medical intervention against Covid-19, which causes respiratory distress in some cases. The surge in infections has sharply accelerated its demand in several parts of the country.The bench, which also included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, said that Vedanta could operate the oxygen plant under the supervision of a committee, which will also decide the number of personnel allowed to run the unit. It will include Thoothukudi’s district collector, sub-collector, superintendent of police, district environmental engineer, two government officials with technical knowledge of the subject, and two experts to be nominated by those aggrieved by pollution from Vedanta’s copper smelter. The two experts will be picked from three suggested by the Union environment ministry.The court said the committee will be at liberty to involve local residents and members of the local community. It also asked the state to expedite the supply of power and water to Vedanta so that oxygen production could commence as soon as possible.Vedanta’s lawyer, Harish Salve, said the production could start in 10 days once other logistical requirements were fulfilled and the capacity could go up to 200 metric tonne (MT) per day. The court said its order will operate till July 31.Vedanta moved the Supreme Court last week for permission to operate the oxygen producing unit at the Sterlite copper plant, which was shut down in May 2018 by the state government days after 13 protesters were killed in police firing during a protest against pollution caused by the facility in the southern Tamil Nadu district.Tamil Nadu on Monday granted temporary permission to a shuttered plant to reopen for the production of medical oxygen production for four months.The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant. The Supreme Court also rejected Vedanta’s plea to reopen the plant for a trial run in December and January.Responding to Vedanta’s fresh plea, senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan and additional advocate general Balaji Srinivasan, who appeared for Tamil Nadu, said that after an all-party meeting a day ago, the state government was agreeable to let Vedanta temporarily reopen the plant for access to its oxygen production unit.The state also suggested that representatives from the local community, social activists, and NGOs should be included in the committee constituted to oversee the oxygen production to ensure law and order. But Salve opposed it. “We are not opposed to the state government’s oversight in coordination with the Centre, but we cannot let locals enter the plant. There have already been many problems in the past,” said Salve.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, supported Salve and submitted that a state could not say it is dependent on some social activists to maintain law and order.Vaidyanathan said he was surprised that the central government was supporting Vedanta, which was found in breach of the central laws on air and water pollution.The court said: “We do not want political bickering in the court. These are times of crisis. We are here as a national court to protect lives in these times of grave crisis. We are here to ensure lives are protected... Let us keep everything else out. Let us develop these matters in the spirit of dialogue.”The court said it understands the concerns of the local community. “...but we are looking at the national crisis where people are dying for the want of oxygen. There is a national demand. When the nation is facing such a crisis, we will have to balance everything.” The bench decided to replace local social activists with two environmental experts, preferably from Tamil Nadu, in the panel.The court accepted Mehta’s statement that Vedanta will supply the oxygen to the Centre’s pool for an equitable distribution across the country.“Nation stands together in this moment. At present, Tamil Nadu’s oxygen demands are met. In case of any future need, they can approach us for changes in the order.”Small groups of people including families who were affected due to the plant’s pollution protested in different parts of Thoothukudi district following the court’s verdict. “When they conducted the public hearing (last Friday) we had expressed that the smelter should be demolished, and the state government can take over the oxygen plant and run it,” said V Gunaseelan, an anti-Sterlite activist. “For the past 25 years since the plant came to Thoothukudi, we have been suffering and we know of the company’s attempts to somehow gain a backdoor entry. It’s like telling a murder accused- you be good for four months and produce oxygen. How can we believe them? Even if they were to start work, what infrastructure do they have to produce medical oxygen? Hasn’t the state told the Madras high court just yesterday that the plant is designed to produce industrial oxygen? We will continue to protest, and our numbers will increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/supreme-court-permits-vedanta-to-operate-tamil-nadu-plant-for-oxygen-101619552496707.html
28-04-2021||India||In Chennai, people throng govt counter selling Remdesivir for critical patients||After making several distress calls and running around to source six vials of antiviral drug Remdesivir for his 70-year-old father-in-law, who was on a ventilator in a private hospital, his attendant was finally able to buy it directly from the government. “Those who have family and friends can go and buy, we don’t know what senior citizens, who are admitted and have no one, are doing,” he said, requesting anonymity.On Monday, the Tamil Nadu Medical Services Corporation (TNMSC) opened a special counter at Chennai’s government-run Kilpauk Medical College Hospital where it began selling the drug for ₹1,400 plus GST per pack. Doctors have been prescribing Remdesivir drug but with stocks dwindling in several private hospitals, it leaves the onus on a critical patient’s family to source it. This has led to hoarding and black-marketing of the drug with soaring prices.As news spread through word of mouth and social media, attendants and relatives of patients began thronging the counter. After the initial chaos, people began forming long queues and some even waited from early morning. Five documents are required to be produced to buy the drug - a letter or prescription from the treating doctor, a report stating that the patient is on oxygen support, CT chest report, RT-PCR positive report and Aadhaar card. Other than the patients’ kin, hospitals can also purchase the drugs from the TNMSC.“Yesterday the crowd was manageable but today it is out of control,” said state health secretary J Radhakrishnan. “This was done to prevent black marketing, we were told it was being sold from Gujarat to private hospitals here. We got a lot of response since it is being sold at government prescribed prices. We are taking steps to streamline the process. We have sufficient stock of the drug at TNMSC,” he added.The Centre has allotted 59,000 vials of Remdesivir till April 30 To Tamil Nadu against pending orders of the state totalling 2.5 lakh. Four days ago, chief minister Edappadi Palaniswami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi against directions being issued by national and certain state regulators, prioritising supplies by individual manufacturers to certain states and restricting Remdesivir sales only within the state where the drug is being produced. “This would be very damaging to the availability of such valuable life-saving drugs in places of need. At this stage, any restrictive orders by individual states should be strictly barred to ensure easy accessibility of Remdesivir,” he said in his letter.Remdesivir, an antiviral injection used to treat Ebola virus, is being used to treat oxygen-dependent Sars-CoV-2 patients with severely affected lungs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-chennai-people-throng-govt-counter-selling-remdesivir-for-critical-covid-19-patients-101619552612104.html
28-04-2021||India||PLA sets up joint defence units near Indian border||The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) has, for the first time, inducted the army’s air defence units in its air force command chain in a region which borders India to form a combined air defence system.The setting up of the new, joint system is part of the Chinese WTC’s (Western Theatre Command) focus on war preparation and exploring the establishment of a joint air defence system, the PLA’s mouthpiece, PLA Daily reported on Tuesday.The Western Theatre Command is responsible for the border with India, and continues large-scale deployment in the region – despite partial disengagement -- amid the year-long border friction in eastern Ladakh.The mouthpiece called the new formation “a solid step… taken in the joint combat and joint training.”The new system was tried out at a drill in the western theatre, the report said without sharing details about the location.The high-level exercise was a drill for checking the combat readiness of the army’s air defence forces but the orders, during the drill, were given by the PLA’s air force command stationed in the area -- a likely first for PLA.According to a senior officer of the WTC’s Air Force Staff Headquarters, more than 10 army air defence force units have entered the PLA Air Force (PLAAF) command chain in the WTC to share early warning information, to test combat readiness, to participate in major exercises and, overall, to form a “preliminary alliance”.“The integration of air defence across services and arms is a solid step to deepen joint operations,” the PLA Daily article said.The WTC’s air force took the initiative to implement joint operations and organised troops from ground defence, radar and communications to “…work together with army commanders to tackle key problems, unify information interfaces, and formulate relevant standards and specifications.”The formation of the joint command is in line with a military training order issued by President Xi Jinping, also the head of the Central Military Commission (CMC), in January.The order said that military training in 2021 will focus on actual combat training to raise combat readiness, joint command and joint specialised training, new equipment and force training, and operational system of systems integration training.Xi had then said that PLA must be ready to “act at any second” as the armed forces had kicked off the year’s military training and drills in January”.“[PLA must] increase the integration of new equipment, new forces and new combat realms into training and combat systems,” Xi was quoted in reports as saying.Following the formation of the new system, the changes in training modules have enabled the joint combat and joint training at all levels to be launched and improved simultaneously, Tuesday’s PLA Daily article said.In the final analysis, whether an army can win modern wars is determined by the level, level, and effectiveness of joint training, it added.Last week, state media reported that PLA deployed advanced rocket launchers with an artillery brigade stationed above 17,000 feet in the WTC.The front-page article published in the PLA Daily said the brigade is located more than 5,200 metres above sea level in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR) but did not share its exact location.India and China have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the nearly year-long friction along the Line of Actual Control in eastern Ladakh.The 10th meeting of the senior military commanders was held on February 20 after the two sides completed the withdrawal of frontline troops with armoured formations and artillery from the banks of Pangong Lake.However, subsequently, the two sides were unable to make progress on efforts to disengage from other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains.The 11th round of military talks held on April 9 failed to resolve the differences.At the end of the 11th round, Beijing said the Chinese military will maintain diplomatic communication with its Indian counterpart to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the border region.“China hopes the Indian side can cherish the positive trend of de-escalation in the region and uphold the consensus reached by previous meetings, and work together with China to safeguard peace and tranquillity in the area,” senior colonel Long Shaohua, PLA’s WTC was quoted as saying in the Chinese readout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pla-sets-up-joint-defence-units-near-indian-border-101619551258791.html
28-04-2021||India||HC commutes 34-yr-old’s death sentence to life term in 2019 rape case of minor||The Madras high court on Tuesday reduced the death sentence awarded by a lower court to a 34-year-old man to life term for the rape and murder of a seven-year-old girl in Coimbatore on March 25, 2019. The division bench, however, ordered that the life imprisonment should be for at least 25 years of actual imprisonment. “We are satisfied that this case does not come within the category of `rarest of rare cases’ by applying the principles laid down by the Supreme Court,” ruled the bench of justices P N Prakash and V Sivagnanam, while commuting the death sentence. “It has not been demonstrated to us that the appellant (Santosh Kumar) was addicted to crime and that he is a menace to society, thereby ruling out any possibility of reformation. In the facts of this case, we are unable to persuade ourselves to hold that a sentence lesser than the death penalty is completely foreclosed. As life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is the exception, the sentence of death awarded by the trial court is commuted to imprisonment for life with the rider that the appellant will not be entitled to any statutory remission or commutation until he has completed 25 years of actual imprisonment,” the court observed. The bench said it was entitled to say so ‘in law in the light’ citing a Supreme Court judgment in Union of India vs. V. Sriharan @ Murugan and others case in 2016. Since the DNA reports disclosed the involvement of an unidentified male other than the convict in the crime, the bench upheld the order of the trial court directing the Coimbatore superintendent of police to appoint a female investigating officer for further investigation in the case. The bench ordered a compensation of ₹10 lakh awarded by the trial court to the mother of the victim to be paid within three months. The bench then disposed the referred trial by the Thudiyalur police, seeking to confirm the sentence and a criminal appeal from the convict, challenging the order dated 27 December, 2019 of the special POCSO court in Coimbatore.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-commutes-34-yr-old-s-death-sentence-to-life-term-in-2019-rape-case-of-minor-101619551772097.html
28-04-2021||India||HC seeks Centre, TN govt’s replies on PIL urging aid amid job loss||The Madras high court on Tuesday directed the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government to consider representation on a public interest litigation (PIL) seeking constitution of a high-level committee to sanction an economic stimulus package for employees who lost their jobs or faced pay cuts due to the Covid-19 lockdown. The petitioner, S Kalimuthu Mylavan, an advocate, sought the package for employees belonging to the private and unorganised sector, private industrial establishments, private educational institutions and teachers among others. The petitioner argued that the losses suffered during the 2020 lockdown continued this year and has created more uncertainty amid the raging pandemic in the second wave. The first bench comprising chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy admitted the plea and recorded the submissions of the petitioner. The bench, after hearing the arguments, sought the responses of the Ministry of health and family welfare and Tamil Nadu government on Mylavan’s representation made on April 16 within 12 weeks and disposed off the petition.The petitioner had sent this representation to the state and Centre on April 16. Since there was no response, he approached the high court. In his plea, Mylavan argued that the monetary loss incurred by each person in the unorganised sector should make the state government, as well as the central government, constitute a high-level committee to distribute an economic stimulus to (such) persons, similar to ones in developing countries. He also quoted efforts of the US in introducing the Employee Retention Credit and America Rescue Plan which offered financial stimulus. In his affidavit, the petitioner alleged a 70% increase in the number of people suffering from depression amid fears of contracting the infection along with prolonged uncertainty over finances and employment. “The financial crisis is continuing in the lives of the citizens as the pandemic is on its second wave,” he said. “Government of various states started implementation of partial lockdown and Tamil Nadu is also on a daily basis announcing stricter lockdown procedures and Standard Operating Procedures, and thus made the private employers in peril in running their factories or schools etc., which in turn have direct implication and effect on the salary of the workforce engaged by the private employers in the state of Tamil Nadu and in the country,” the PIL read.Stating that the right to livelihood is guaranteed under the Constitution, the petitioner said the state and central governments must compile a list from Employees’ Provident Fund Organization and on war footing, compensate those who incurred monetary losses. As of April 27, Tamil Nadu reported 15,771 new cases with an active caseload of 1,08,855 -- which is twice more than what the state registered during its peak in 2020. While no lockdown has been announced as of now, strict restrictions are in place such as night curfew and complete shutdown on Sundays to contain the surge. On Monday, the Madras high court had suggested the government consider imposing a lockdown on May 1 and 2 to ensure the counting of votes for the assembly elections didn’t lead to crowding and a spurt in cases. The court, however, asked the state to take a call by April 28 to ensure people get ample time to plan. Fearing a repeat of last year’s lockdown, several migrants have been queueing at railway stations across the state to return home. Last year, the government had provided free ration and cash assistance to ration card holders during the lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hc-seeks-centre-tn-govt-s-replies-on-pil-urging-aid-amid-job-loss-101619551712627.html
28-04-2021||India||Covid spike due to rapid spread of mutant variants: Kerala CM||In its biggest single-day spike ever since the outbreak began, Kerala on Tuesday recorded 32,819 coronavirus cases with a test positivity rate of 23.34 per cent, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan said. The state also reported 32 deaths, taking the overall toll to 5,170.Addressing newsmen in the state capital, the chief minister attributed the surge to the rapid spread of mutant variants and urged citizens not to lower their guard against the infection at this critical juncture. “In the last two weeks, there has been a 250 per cent hike in cases. Mutant variants of the virus are triggering such a spread. All hospitals have been asked to increase beds and ensure uninterrupted supply of oxygen. The situation remains critical,” Vijayan said, adding that studies confirmed the intense spread of variants in the state. The chief minister added that risk assessment studies of three variants (UK, South African and double mutants) revealed that these strains carried multiplying effects andcan increase the death rate in proportion to the mounting infection rate. Medical experts believe that the B.1.1.7 variant, which was first detected in the UK, is 45% to 90% more contagious than the original virus and that the state will have to observe utmost caution as this variant was detected in 40% of the samples tested“True, the situation is really serious. But still, people can contain the surge by observing basic precautions like double masking, physical distancing and hand hygiene,” public health expert Dr T S Aneesh said, adding that going by the present surge, cases may drastically increase inthe next two weeks. Echoing similar sentiments, several experts said the next two weeks were critical for the state. According to data released by the state health ministry, as many as 141,199 tests were conducted out of which 32,819 tested positive on Tuesday.The active caseload is nearing the 250,000 mark. Among those infected on Tuesday were 96 health workers. Kozhikode (north Kerala) topped the list (daily cases) with 5,025 cases followed by Ernakulam district with 4,270 cases on Tuesday.The only silver lining is the state’s fatality rate which is still the lowest in the country, below 0.4 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-spike-due-to-rapid-spread-of-mutant-variants-kerala-cm-101619551652692.html
28-04-2021||India||Army chief Gen Naravane visits eastern Ladakh||Army chief General Manoj Mukund Naravane on Tuesday reviewed the army’s operational readiness in eastern Ladakh, where India and China have been locked in a standoff for nearly a year and are currently negotiating a withdrawal of frontline troops and weapons from friction points on the contested border, a senior official familiar with development said on.This is his first visit to eastern Ladakh after the Indian and Chinese armies wrapped up the disengagement process in the Pangong Tso sector in February, with both sides pulling back forward-deployed troops, tanks, infantry, combat vehicles, and artillery guns from strategic heights where rival soldiers last year fired shots for the first time at the Line of Actual Control (LAC) after 45 years.The disengagement process between the two armies has hit a wall at other friction points as a result of the Chinese People’s Liberation Army’s (PLA) unexpected reluctance to pull back its forward deployed troops from Hot Springs, Gogra, and Depsang.The army chief will visit forward areas, including the Daulat Beg Oldie (DBO) sector, near the LAC on Wednesday, he said. The army chief also visited Siachen Glacier, where two soldiers were killed in an avalanche on April 25.Naravane’s visit to India’s farthest frontiers comes at a time when the country is reeling under the Covid crisis and the military is at the forefront of providing relief.“Gen Naravane interacted with the troops and complimented them for their steadfastness and high morale, while being deployed in some of the harshest terrain, altitude and weather conditions,” the army said in a statement. Lieutenant General PGK Menon, commander of the Leh-based 14 Corps and the man leading the military dialogue with China, briefed the army chief on the prevailing security situation in the sensitive sector.“As far as internal Covid situation is concerned, it should not affect the territorial integrity of the country for which the armed forces have to remain prepared all throughout. It warrants that the army chief reviews operational plans on ground and also boosts the morale of the troops,” said former Northern Army commander Lieutenant General BS Jaswal (retd).The swift pace of disengagement in the Pangong Tso area in February -- it began and ended in less than 10 days -- raised hopes of positive outcomes at the remaining flashpoints on the LAC.But the initial optimism appears to have waned after the latest 11th round of military talks on April 9, during which the PLA demonstrated a lack of commitment to restore the status quo of April 2020.Disengagement of frontline troops on the LAC is the first crucial step to restore peace and tranquillity in eastern Ladakh. Until that happens, there is no question of de-escalation of the border conflict and the eventual de-induction of rival soldiers in the sensitive theatre.Days after the mutual withdrawal of frontline troops and weapons from the Pangong Tso heights in February, Naravane cautioned that the disengagement process with China would be a long-drawn one.He described disengagement as a “win-win situation” for both sides but added that de-escalation of conflict and de-induction of rival forces was “still a long way to go”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/army-chief-gen-naravane-visits-eastern-ladakh-101619551269765.html
28-04-2021||India||SC panel against rail expansion project in Goa||PANAJI: In a big win for environmental activists in Goa the Central Empowered Committee constituted by the Supreme Court has said that there is “no justification” for undertaking the doubling of the existing single line railway track between Tinaighat in North Karnataka and the port town of Vasco da Gama in Goa -- that cuts across the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats-- and recommended that the permissions granted to the project be revoked. In its report, which was submitted to the Supreme Court , with a copy given to the Goa Foundation, the environmental group that filed the petition, CEC also recommended that the Goa-Tamnar 440KV power line be set up along the alignment of the existing powerline so that fresh forest areas are not intruded into. The four-laning of the existing highway has however, been given the go ahead with additional recommendations that it be constructed as an elevated corridor so that it does not cause harm to wildlife. The trio of projects was opposed by civil society and environmental activists in Goa who feared that if allowed to go ahead, the projects would irreversibly damage the sensitive and biodiverse ecosystems of the region recognized as one of the world’s top biodiversity hotspots. “CEC does not find any justification for undertaking a project of this nature which will destroy the fragile ecosystem of the Western Ghats which is an internationally recognised Biodiversity hotspot and also one of the most important wildlife corridors of the Country. Moreover this doubling project will only be marginally enhancing the capacity of the most inefficient section of the Railway Network passing through ecologically sensitive and biodiversity rich tiger Reserve, two Wildlife Sanctuaries and a National Park,” the Central Empowered Committee headed by P V Jayakrishnan, said. “In these circumstances it is recommended… to revoke the permission granted by the Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife (SC NBWL) for doubling of the railway track,” the CEC said. The Standing Committee of National Board for Wildlife (SC NBWL) in April last year, in a meeting chaired by Union Minister of Forests Prakash Javadekar, granted its approval for the three projects sparking an uproar in Goa. The railway line passes through the ecologically sensitive Western Ghats from Tinaighat-Castlerock in Karnataka to Kulem in Goa involving 120.875 ha. of land from the Bhagwan Mahaveer Wildlife Sanctuary (BMWLS) in the State of Goa and 10.45 ha. in the State of Karnataka. CEC in its findings, recorded that the “doubling of the existing rail line will not have any positive impact on the gradient and curvature of the new line and it will operate at the same inefficient level as the existing line and will be operating with all the existing severe limitations on running of trains as that of the existing line railway line that was laid in 1890s when there was no other rail connectivity available to Goa”. CEC also observed that the railway line cuts across the most important animal corridor in the Western Ghat landscape between Karnataka and Maharashtra through the state of Goa and will be a serious impediment for movement of long ranging animals such as tigers and elephants. “At present the Konkan railway line gives excellent connectivity to Northern and Southern parts of India the connectivity between Goa and Karnataka is being strengthened/improved by way of four-laning of NH-4A along the same route and by development of a new airport,” CEC said. The report will now be filed before the Supreme Court which will then decide whether to accept or reject the recommendations. The Goa Foundation has welcomed the findings of the CEC, but said that it will deliberate with other environmental activist groups on what the final stance will be when the matter comes up before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-panel-against-rail-expansion-project-in-goa-101619550992598.html
28-04-2021||India||Covid-19 aid to India: What’s being provided by countries, private organisations||The record-breaking second wave of the Coronavirus disease pandemic has led to support pouring in from around the world for the country’s Covid-19 response, including massive oxygen generation plants and other equipment aimed at plugging crucial gaps in the supply chain.

28-04-2021||India||Had to use influence to secure bed for Covid +ve relative: Siddaramaiah||BengaluruFormer chief minister and senior Congress leader Siddaramaiah on Tuesday said he had to use “influence” to secure a bed for his brother-in-law, who was tested positive for Covid-19, as there was an acute shortage of medical facilities in the state to deal with the raging second wave of the pandemic.“My brother-in-law was admitted in a hospital (in Mysuru), Pristine, they were not good and he got discharged. There were three people in a ward and were not taking care very well. I had to call (MR) Seetharam and got a bed in MS Ramaiah (hospital in Bengaluru) by using influence,” Siddaramaiah told reporters in Bengaluru on Tuesday.Seetharam is a former minister in the Siddaramaiah-led government between 2013 and 2018, and is part of MS Ramaiah groups of medical and other educational institutions.Bengaluru is fast running out of hospital beds due to the sharp spike in cases, leaving relatives and others running from one place to another in search of critical medical care for their loved ones, said health experts.The statement came when Karnataka reported 31,830 new Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the total number of active infections in the state to 301,899. Bengaluru accounted for 17,550 new infections, taking the city’s total cases so far to 475,525, of which 206,223 are active. A total of 180 deaths were reported from the state, including 97 in Bengaluru, taking the death toll in Karnataka and its capital to 14,807 and 6,002, respectively, according to the health department’s daily bulletin. Positivity rate was at 18.71%, according to the government.According to an expert, Siddaramaiah’s story also highlighted the inaction by chief minister BS Yediyurappa-led state government in dealing with the second wave of the surge despite warnings from the technical advisory committee (TAC) in November last year.The Congress in Karnataka, as well as nationally, has attacked both the state and Centre over its “glaring inefficiency” in handling the Covid-19 crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/had-to-use-influence-to-secure-bed-for-covid-ve-relative-siddaramaiah-101619550871423.html
28-04-2021||India||Govt yet to take call on financial aid for workers||Bengaluru As Karnataka goes into a two-week curfew on Tuesday, a minister in BS Yediyurappa-led state cabinet said it was unlikely that the government will extend any financial assistance to residents who are facing the brunt of a surging second wave of Covid-19 pandemic. “We are giving free vaccines. Free rice is being given. We are giving everything. All of us have to take collective responsibility. This is some form of sacrifice. There will be losses but that is how this pandemic is,” K Sudhakar, Karnataka’s health, family welfare and medical education minister told Hindustan Times. The statement comes even as the opposition Congress in the state has demanded compensation for daily wage earners. “The Congress party had demanded that ₹25,000 be debited to the accounts of those hardest hit by the lockdown. These are people who depend on daily wages for livelihoods like carpenters, garment workers, plumbers, those working in gyms and other places. We thought that the government would at least debit ₹10,000 or ₹15,000, but nothing so far,” said Ramalinga Reddy, working president of the Congress in Karnataka. Chief minister Yediyurappa on Monday announced a 14-day closed down, in which all businesses that are not listed as essential will remain closed, and movement of people will be restricted. The government has allowed shops dealing in essential commodities to operate for four hours from 6 am to 10 am. Soon after the announcement, several industry bodies, including those representing the garment sector, requested the government to allow businesses to operate with the reduced workforce while the curfew is in force. “In the two months of lockdown last year, all garment workers had to forgo their wages and even lost jobs. Workers are yet to recover from the impact, now all of a sudden only the garment industry has been asked to close down and this is an assault on women workers,” Prathiba R, the president of the Garments and Textile Workers Union (GATWU) wrote to the chief minister on Tuesday. The union also said they were yet to hear from the government on compensation for the loss of wages of people working in garment sector. “There are over 500,000 workers dependent on this profession for their livelihood. Of these, 85% are women and nearly 50% of them single-handedly have the responsibilities of their families,” the letter read. Bengaluru Chamber of Industry and Commerce (BCIC) has also requested the state government to allow the garment companies to operate. “We understand the decision of not allowing garment-making industries to function since the density of the workforce is high and it is very difficult to follow the Covid protocols. We suggest that the garment companies can be allowed to work with a reduced workforce between 30% and 50% and adequate social distancing and appropriate COVID protocols…,” BCIC said in a release soon after the government announced 14-day restrictions in the state on Monday. BCIC president TR Parasuraman said the industry was fully prepared in adhering to Covid protocol with the appropriate behaviour of people. “Strict enforcement of Covid appropriate behaviour is a must and law breakers should be strictly dealt with,” said Parasuraman. “BCIC feels that it is very important that the operating workforce across the nation should be vaccinated on priority to ensure industries are working without any interruption compared to the people working from home to ensure that the economy is not affected due to loss of production,” Parasuraman added. The lockdown, which the state government prefers to call guidelines to “break the chain of Covid-19 transmission in the state”, has come at a time when Karnataka and its capital Bengaluru in particular have reported a record surge in the number of infections over the last two weeks, indicating the deteriorating health crisis in the state. Karnataka reported 31830 fresh Covid-19 cases on Tuesday, taking the total number of active infections in the state to 301899. Bengaluru accounted for 17550 new infections, taking the city’s total cases so far to 475525, of which 206223 are active. A total of 180 deaths were reported from the state, including 97 in Bengaluru, taking the death toll in Karnataka and its capital to 14807 and 6002, respectively, according to the health department’s daily bulletin. Positivity rate was at 18.71%, according to the government.Several other cities, including Delhi, have enforced lockdown to contain the unprecedented surge of Covid-19 cases. The restrictions have come down hard on the pandemic-hit residents of Bengaluru and other parts of Karnataka, who, experts said, were paying the price of the lack of preparedness by the state government that was warned in November last year by the technical advisory committee (TAC) of an imminent and more infectious second wave of Covid-19 infections in February or March. A member of the TAC said they had made no specific reference to financial assistance as it was a policy matter. While employees of most multinational corporations (MNCs) and other corporate organisations have been directed to work from home, the same cannot be followed by those employed in sectors like manufacturing and other small units. The Yediyurappa government has been accused of refraining from using the word ‘lockdown’ to avoid giving any compensation to the workers, an expert said, requesting anonymity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-yet-to-take-call-on-financial-aid-for-workers-101619550811433.html
28-04-2021||India||IMA scam: CBI names former minister Roshan Baig in supplementary charge sheet||Bengaluru: The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) on Tuesday filed a supplementary charge sheet against former Karnataka minister Roshan Baig in connection with I-Monetary Advisor (IMA) ponzi scam case. Baig was the minister for urban development in the Congress-led state government between 2014 and 2018. In the charge sheet filed before a special CBI court in Bengaluru, the central agency has also named the then MD of IMA Group, Mansoor Khan, the company, Baig’s company Daanish Publications and others. “It was alleged that the accused former minister received several crores of rupees from IMA funds for election expenditure. It was further alleged that the accused was also utilising the said funds for day-to-day expenditure, including salaries of employees of his firm. It was also alleged that the accused has spent the funds for various social and cultural activities in his constituency to increase his popularity,” read a statement from CBI. IMA was an investment banking company run by Mahommed Mansoor Khan, who claimed it was a sharia-compliant operation run on Islamic principles and which took huge deposits primarily from members of the Muslim community. When IMA stopped paying dividends in March 2019, investors lodged complaints with the police and in June 2019, the Karnataka government set up an SIT to investigate the more than 51,500 complaints that had been filed by investors. On 30 August 2019, the case was transferred to CBI, which after a probe, sought permission of the state government to prosecute Hemant Nimbalkar, who was then IGP, CID and Ajay Hilori, who was the Deputy Commissioner East under Section 197 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) and Section 170 of the Karnataka Police Act, 1963, for extending favours and protecting interests of the IMA promoters. The central agency, which had registered four cases in connection with the scam, has filed three charge sheets and three supplementary charge sheets against 33 accused, including Khan, company directors, several revenue and police officials. “It was alleged that the said Group had raised unauthorised deposits & cheated the public by failing to repay the principal and as well as the promised returns. These funds were allegedly diverted for acquiring properties, paying bribe amounts, etc. Several properties, including moveable & immovable, were identified and attached under KPIDFE (Karnataka Protection of Interest of Depositors in Financial Establishments) Act, 2004 by the competent authority,” the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ima-scam-cbi-names-former-minister-roshan-baig-in-supplementary-charge-sheet-101619550751418.html
28-04-2021||India||HC raps Karnataka govt over Covid crisis, calls B’luru situation ‘alarming’||BengaluruThe Karnataka High Court on Tuesday rapped the state government over the surging cases of coronavirus and observed that marginal increase in availability of hospital beds might not be enough to cope with the rising number of Covid-19 infections in Bengaluru, calling the situation in the city “alarming”, according to two persons aware of the developments.The court was hearing a matter related to the Covid-19 situation in Karnataka and Bengaluru in particular.“Going by facts on record we find that situation is fairly alarming,” the court observed.“At 11.15 am today only 74 HDU beds (are) available in city, ICU and ICU+ ventilator 20 and 14. This is (an) alarming situation,” said an advocate, who appeared in the matter, attributing it to the observations made by chief justice Abhay Shreeniwas Oka and Justice Arvind Kumar.The court also asked the government to check if Command Hospital meant for armed forces could reserve some beds for civilians as well as it could mitigate some of the shortage.“State government will place on record the availability of beds in state and in those districts where there are more than 5,000 Covid-19 cases as of today,” the lawyer cited above said, requesting not to be named. “The other serious issue is availability of oxygen in the state, which needs 1,471 MT per day. We direct the Government of India to make allocation. If allocation is not made as on April 30, going by the projected figures of the state a shortfall of more than 600 MT will be there,” the advocate said, attributing it to the court.The court’s observations have come at a time when Bengaluru and other 29 districts of Karnataka have been reeling under the unprecedented surge of Covid-19 cases.The sharp spike in cases since March this year has led to an acute shortage of beds in Bengaluru, with relatives of Covid-19 patients running from hospital-to-hospital in search of beds and other medical care.Bengaluru recorded 17,550 new infections on Tuesday, taking the active case count to 206,223. The city also accounted for 97 of the 180 fatalities reported across the state on Tuesday, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Venkatesh Dalwai, the advocate appearing for Private Hospitals and Nursing Homes Association (PHANA), said that its earlier request for oxygen supply has still not been complied with.He said that PHANA had written to the state government on April 17, stating that they were not getting any oxygen supplies and the hospital shall not be held liable if any patient loses their life due to it.Stating that the court issued three directions on Tuesday, Dalwai said the list of demands by PHANA should be shared with the war room of the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP). He added that the court directed the government to publish the details of availability of remdesivir, a drug used for critically ill Covid-19 patients, and even contacts of manufacturers as it will save relatives and others from running around to find the medicine during the lockdown.“From tomorrow lockdown will start in state, so if relatives are told to get Remdesivir it will be difficult for them to get it. This is (an) area where (the) state should step in immediately,” the court observed.The order came hours before Karnataka goes into a 14-day closed down, in what appears to be a last-ditch attempt to contain the growing surge of cases in Bengaluru and other parts of the state. The court has asked the state government to respond on April 29, when the matter will be heard next.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hcraps-karnataka-govt-over-covid-crisis-calls-b-luru-situation-alarming-101619550691380.html
28-04-2021||India||Bengal: 75 times spike in daily cases after poll announcement||Daily coronavirus infections have zoomed 75 times in West Bengal since the Election Commission of India (ECI) announced assembly elections on February 26, prompting health experts to link the surge in cases to maskless political rallies that violated Covid protocol. On Tuesday, the state registered 16,403 new cases, up from 216 on February 26. The positivity rate - the proportion of people testing positive to those tested – has also shot up from 1% to nearly 30% during the same period. This means that almost every third person tested has been found infected with the coronavirus. The number of active cases in the state also crossed 100,000 on Tuesday. It was 3,343 on February 26. The number of deaths on Tuesday was 73, a record, pushing the toll to 11,082. Health experts blamed the exponential rise of Covid-19 cases on the mass gatherings at election rallies. “All safety protocols had taken a back seat at the election campaigns resulting in a faster spread of the virus in the state. The ECI should have wrapped up the poll process at the earliest. The lengthier the election process the higher would be the toll. We need all hands on deck to fight the crisis,” said Manas Gumta, general secretary of Association of Health Service Doctors in the state. On Monday, the Madras high court observed that ECI was responsible for the second wave in the country. Last week, the Calcutta high court, too, had expressed dissatisfaction over measures taken by the poll panel to enforce Covid-19 safety norms in campaigning. On April 16, ECI banned political campaigns at night and increased the silent period from 48 hours to 72 hours. On April 22, it banned roadshows and limited rallies to 500 people. Campaigning for the eight-phase election ended on Monday. Kolkata reported the highest number of cases, 3708, and the state capital along with three adjoining districts of North 24 Parganas, South 24 Parganas and Howrah accounted for more than 50% of the new cases reported WHEN. Kolkata reported 3708 cases on Tuesday. On Tuesday 55,287 samples were tested, which was up from 20,084 tested on February 26.“We need to ramp up testing. Cases have shot up alarmingly, but we have not been able to ramp up the testing proportionately. When cases had dropped, we did little to augment the infrastructure knowing well that the second wave would come,” said Pratip Kumar Kundu, former head of the School of Tropical Medicine. Hospital beds in Kolkata’s state-run and private hospitals are fast dwindling. Less than 1500 beds were vacant in Kolkata’s private and state-run hospitals on Monday, according to data available with the state health department. “The rush in Kolkata is more than the districts. While state run-hospitals are 80% occupied, across the state the occupancy rate is around 55%. We are augmenting the infrastructure not only in state run hospitals but also in private hospitals,” said a senior state health department official. With beds running out fast, oxygen resources depleting and medicines scarce, the state has recently published guidelines for strict rationing. “Due to the high case load, we need to decongest the hospitals and more importantly the CCU and HDU beds. For this detailed guideline have been brought on which patients could be kept in HDU and CCU beds and who could be referred to isolation centres from hospitals depending on the severity. Also guidelines have been brought out in use of oxygen and Remdesivir,” said another official of the health department.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-75-times-spike-in-daily-cases-after-poll-announcement-101619549911319.html
28-04-2021||India||Kappan has not been chained to hospital bed: U.P. Govt to top court||The Uttar Pradesh government on Tuesday refuted a contention in the Supreme Court that journalist Siddique Kappan, who has been jailed under the terror charges, was chained to a hospital bed in Mathura where he was being treated for Covid-19. “He isn’t chained...there are no chains in the hospital,” claimed solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the state government before a bench led by Chief Justice of India NV Ramana. The law officer was responding to a claim by the Kerala Union of Working Journalists (KUWJ) that Kappan was chained to a hospital bed in Mathura’s KM Medical College after he collapsed in a bathroom at the Mathura jail and later tested positive for COVID-19. Kappan, secretary of the Delhi unit of KUWJ, was arrested on October 5 last year while on his way to Hathras in UP after the alleged gangrape of a 19-year-old woman who died in hospital of injuries she suffered in the sexual assault. KUWJ subsequently filed a petition in the apex court, calling Kappan’s arrest illegal and an attempt to silence the media. On April 25, Kappan’s wife wrote to the CJI complaining that the scribe was “chained like an animal” to a hospital bed in Mathura and sought his release from the hospital. On Tuesday, advocate Wills Mathew, representing KUWJ, sought transfer of Kappan from the UP hospital to the All India Institute of Medical Sciences in Delhi, citing his medical conditions and ill-treatment. However, Mehta told the bench, which also included justices Surya Kant and AS Bopanna, that this plea could not be entertained since the habeas corpus petition by KUWJ was itself not maintainable. “This person has been in jail after a valid order of a trial court. All his co-accused approached the trial court for a regular bail but here we have one organisation asking for his release. An order of detention by a magistrate cannot be said to be illegal,” said Mehta. The hearing could not proceed because of technical snags in the video-conferencing facility of the top court and the matter was adjourned to Wednesday. The bench has also asked the state government to file Kappan’s medical report. In its affidavit before the court in December, the UP government sought to highlight Kappan’s alleged association with the now-banned Students Islamic Movement of India (SIMI) and the Popular Front of India, besides discrediting KUWJ. It maintained that Kappan was not a journalist nor was KUWJ a credible organisation while citing the former’s alleged links with the (SIMI) and PFI. The latter is not a banned outfit under the law. The affidavit contended that the Union filed its petition at the behest of SIMI and the PFI.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kappan-has-not-been-chained-to-hospital-bed-u-p-govt-to-top-court-101619549731289.html
28-04-2021||India||Less crowd, but no Covid norms on last shahi snan||Haridwar: The last of the shahi snans (holy dips) of the Mahakumbh was a largely symbolic affair, with only a few tens of thousands of seers and pilgrims participating in the event on account of Covid-19, much lower than the millions that did in the previous shahi snans, although those that did still ignored protocols such as wearing a mask or social distancing. Seers from all the 13 Akhadas (sects) participated in the shahi snan with a major focus on the three Bairagi Akhadas . It was also Lord Hanuman’s birth anniversary on Tuesday -- Hanuman is the deity of the Bairagi Akhadas -- and there was quite a buzz in the Baiaragi camp and Hanuman temples. Prime Minister Modi made a plea on April 17, asking the Akhadas to observe the Kumbh (April 1 to 30) ans the last of the shahi snans in spirit only. His plea came amidst the surging second wave of the pandemic , and after the complete breach of all Covid-19 safety protocols in the previous shahi snans. The union government has come under criticism for allowing the mass event to go ahead during the pandemic, and the state government , for not following Covid safety protocols. Infections have claimed the lives of two chief seers during the Kumbh, and many others have been infected. Pilgrims have also carried back infections from the event to other parts of India. On Tuesday, Niranjani and Anand Akhada seers were the first to head towards the sanctum sanctorum of Brahamkund,Har-Ki-Pauri followed by Juna , Agni and Aahwan Akhada in pre scheduled order set by Kumbh Mela administration in consultation with the Akhada Parishad, the apex body of seers. Maha Nirvani Akhada and Atal Akhada seers were followed by three Bairagi Akhadas, Nirvani, Digambar and Nirmohi. Pilgrims were allowed to take a dip in the Ganga at Har-Ki-Pauri prior to the arrival of the seers at 9 am. Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat, Kumbh Mela Force Inspector general Sanjay Gunjiyal, SSP Mahakumbh Janmejaya Khanduri and ADM Mela Harbeer Singh welcomed the seers at Har-Ki-Pauri and urged them to wear masks and practice social distancing. “ Kumbh Mela Force personnel were themselves in protective gear and also distributed free face masks and sanitizers at Ganga ghats and Akhadas’ processison route,” said Kumbh Mela officer Deepak Rawat.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/less-crowd-but-no-covid-norms-on-last-shahi-snan-101619549673683.html
28-04-2021||India||Australia unveils Covid support package for India, suspends flights||New Delhi Australia on Tuesday unveiled an initial support package for India’s Covid-19 response, including 500 ventilators, even as it suspended all flights between the two countries for two weeks to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The assistance was announced jointly by foreign minister Marise Payne and Prime Minister Scott Morrison, who said more medical equipment, including 100 oxygen concentrators, will be procured and shipped to India over the next week. Though the Australian government had earlier planned to temporarily reduce flights from India by 30% after recording a spike in incoming travellers testing positive for Covid-19, Morrison announced the National Security Committee had decided to pause all direct passenger flights from India until May 15. Australia has joined a growing number of countries rushing medical equipment, supplies and oxygen to India, which recorded 362,850 new coronavirus infections on Tuesday. A total of 3,286 people succumbed to the virus, taking the death toll to 201,187. The initial support package will include 500 non-invasive ventilators, one million surgical masks, 500,000 P2 and N95 masks, 100,000 surgical gowns, 100,000 goggles, 100,000 pairs of gloves and 20,000 face shields. The supply of ventilators will be scaled up 3,000 and the Australian government will procure 100 oxygen concentrators, along with tanks and consumables. All the equipment will be shipped to India over the next week. “I stress this is an initial package, there will be more to follow, of support and to deliver this as soon as possible,” Morrison told the news conference. “We recognise the challenging Covid-19 crisis that India is currently battling and we stand ready to provide more support to our friends in India and Indian Australians during this difficult time,” Morrison and Payne said in a statement. The statement noted that Australia’s Chief Medical Officer had designated India a “high-risk country” for travel arrangements. The suspension of flights will have an immediate impact on two passenger services to Sydney and two repatriation flights to Darwin, affecting around 500 people. When flights from India resume, passengers will be required to have both a negative Covid-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result and a negative rapid antigen test result prior to taking off. Indirect flights from India through the United Arab Emirates, Singapore and Malaysia have already been paused by the respective governments. “Once flights restart, the government will prioritise the return of vulnerable Australians. Already almost 20,000 registered Australians have returned from India since the pandemic began,” the statement said. A hardship program and consular support is already in place for Australians in India. Morrison described the situation in India as a “very significant outbreak” and said: “From the scenes we are seeing from India, they are truly heartbreaking. India is a great friend of Australia and a comprehensive strategic partner. We share so much in common as peoples, as democratic nations, and we extend our deepest sympathies and condolences and our support to the nation of India and the people of India and...Prime Minister [Narendra] Modi.” Payne pointed to India’s generosity throughout this pandemic and the export of more than 66 million vaccines, including gifts of doses to Nauru and Fiji. “It has also manufactured vaccine doses for Papua New Guinea, for the Solomon Islands, being delivered though the COVAX facility and we warmly acknowledge that generosity,” she said. There are currently a little more than 9,000 Australians registered in India, including 650 registered as vulnerable, Payne said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/australia-unveils-covid-support-package-for-india-suspends-flights-101619549012369.html
28-04-2021||India||As relief material comes in, India sets up procedures for prompt delivery of equipment||As relief materials for India’s Covid-19 response began pouring in from countries such as the UK and Ireland, the government on Tuesday established procedures to ensure the supplies, especially oxygen and related equipment, promptly reach the worst-hit areas.The UK and members of the European Union (EU), which activated its Civil Protection Mechanism for emergencies on Sunday, were among the first to respond to India’s pressing needs for oxygen and medical equipment as the country grapples with a devastating second wave of the pandemic that has seen six straight days of more than 300,000 infections.People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that a high-level inter-ministerial group has established procedures for immediate clearance of the materials from abroad. “The material would be dispatched promptly to recipient institutions in various parts of the country in coordination with different government agencies,” said one of the people cited above.A total of 100 ventilators and 95 oxygen concentrators arrived from the UK on Tuesday, part of a package of 495 oxygen concentrators and 140 ventilators pledged by London, while France is sending eight large oxygen generating plants that can each meet the needs of a 250-bed hospital and five containers of liquid oxygen that can cater to the needs of 10,000 patients a day.Germany is sending a mobile oxygen production plant that will be available for three months, 120 ventilators and more than 80 million KN95 masks. Other EU members have pledged more oxygen-related equipment, ranging from 700 oxygen concentrators being sent by Ireland on Wednesday to smaller batches of ventilators and oxygen concentrators from countries such as Romania, Luxembourg and Sweden. Belgium is sending 9,000 doses of Remdesivir while Portugal will provide more than 5,500 vials of the antiviral medicine and 20,000 litres of oxygen per week.Following discussions between India and American officials, the US is finalising a support package that is expected to include oxygen generation systems, both small and large-scale, and components for the oxygen supply chain such as concentrators, ventilators, cylinders and transport. The aid could include oxygen generation systems for field hospitals that cater for 50 to 100 beds. The US will also provide therapeutics, personal protective equipment and rapid diagnostic test kits, and approve the supply of vaccine raw materials such as filters needed to manufacture the Covishield vaccine in line with pledges made by President Joe Biden during his conversation with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday. The two sides are holding technical discussions to ensure that the equipment supplied by the US can connect to devices in India, and the American side will provide training for using all the equipment and help with their transportation.“US commercial suppliers of Remdesivir that are immediately available have been identified. Rapid diagnostic test supplies and PPEs that can be transferred to India immediately have also been identified. Besides, the US will facilitate India’s access to supplies from US-based sources,” said a second person.India is also expected to benefit as and when the US begins donating up to 60 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine from its stockpile after the shot clears federal safety approvals.Besides the donations, India has secured medical supplies through private and commercial channels. These include 500 BiPAPs, 250 oxygen concentrators and four cryogenic oxygen containers sourced from Singapore, 80 tonnes of liquid oxygen being shipped via sea from Saudi Arabia, 800 oxygen concentrators from Hong Kong, four cryogenic oxygen tanks from Thailand, six cryogenic containers from the United Arab Emirates, and 23 mobile oxygen generation plants being imported from Germany by the Armed Forces Medical Services.Officially, India has issued no appeal for international aid in keeping with the government’s stated policy. However, Janez Lenarčič, the EU commissioner for crisis management, noted on Sunday that the support is being provided in response to an Indian request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/as-relief-material-comes-in-india-sets-up-procedures-for-prompt-delivery-of-equipment-101619549011916.html
28-04-2021||India||‘India’s medical oxygen production up by nearly 60% since August 2020’: Officials tell PM Modi||India has increased its Liquid Medical Oxygen (LMO) production by nearly 60% since last year and has increased the share of oxygen for various states, prime minister Narendra Modi was informed by officials during a top-level Covid-19 review meeting on Tuesday.While the PM received an overview on the situation related to oxygen availability, medicines and health infrastructure, he was also “briefed about the functioning of the Oxygen Express Railways Service as well as the domestic sorties and international sorties undertaken by IAF to transport oxygen tankers,” a press release said. At the meeting, the officials informed that LMO production went up from 5700 MT/day in August 2020 to 8922 MT on April 25, 2021, adding that the domestic production is expected to cross 9250 MT/day by the end of April.The PM told the officials to work closely with state governments to start the PSA (Pressure Swing Adsorption) oxygen plants at the earliest. Last year, the central government decided to install 162 PSA oxygen plants across various states. During Tuesday’s meeting, increasing the share of oxygen to the states was also discussed. Senior officers told PM Modi that they are encouraging states to set up PSA oxygen plants. “The Empowered Group working on medical infrastructure and Covid management briefed the PM on efforts being undertaken to ramp up availability of beds and ICUs. They informed the PM of efforts being taken to break the chain of transmission. PM stressed the need to ensure that specific guidelines and strategies evolved regarding Covid management needs to be properly implemented by the relevant agencies in the states,” the release added. The Empowered Group working on communication, headed by information and broadcasting secretary Amit Khare, spoke about the efforts undertaken to improve awareness among people on Covid-related behaviour.While the government claimed that the money was allotted for these oxygen plants from PM-Cares, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said that his government didn’t receive any fund for the 10 allotted plants for Delhi. The meeting was attended by cabinet secretary Rajiv Gauba, PM’s principal secretary PK Mishra, Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla, Niti Aayog member Dr VK Paul, and other top officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/indias-medical-oxygen-production-up-by-nearly-60-since-august-2020-officials-tell-pm-modi-101619548651795.html
28-04-2021||India||T cell response to Covid may remain potent after vaccination: Study||Some of the concerning variants of the Sars-Cov-2, such as those first found in the UK, South Africa, Brazil and California, appear to have little resistance to the last line of the body’s immune defences trained by a vaccine or a past infection, according to a study by a group of US-based researchers.The authors say that the findings suggest that even if a variant is successful in infecting a person after they have been vaccinated or infected by the Sars-Cov-2 once before, the immune system’s T cell response is likely to be potent enough in order to reduce the severity. The team was led by researchers from California’s La Jolla Institute for Immunology.T cells are what are loosely considered the third line of the body’s defence, along with B cells. There are two types of T cells, helper (CD4) and killer (CD8). Helper cells aid in drawing the attention of the other components of the immune response (such as B cells), while killer T cells destroy any infected human cells.Scientists believe protection from re-infection may be dependent on the volume and nature of antibodies, which are a manifestation of B cells. They, however, taper in volume once an infection is over but the body can quickly churn out large numbers again since memory T cells and memory B cells retain a blueprint of the virus.The study found that this blueprint retains large details of the virus in general, and the mutations are not too significant to make this memory redundant.“Overall, reactivity to the peptide pools spanning the variant genomes was found to be similar to that against the ancestral Wuhan strain. When the sum total of reactivity throughout the genome was considered, no differences or decreases in reactivity compared to the ancestral were noted for the variant pools ,” the authors said, when they analysed the four variants with that of the T cell responses created by those who recovered from the a previous bout of Covid-19.This may be of significant for India since one of these variants is the one first seen in California with the L452R mutation, which has been found in the B.1.617 that has arisen in several Indian states.The authors found such similarities in people who received the mRNA vaccines by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, except for a slight decrease in reactivity in the case of the South African variant B.1.351.The authors see their findings as positive news in light of the concern over the impact of variants. “Undoubtedly, several of the variants are associated with increased transmissibility, and also have been associated with decreased susceptibility to neutralizing antibodies from infected or vaccinated individuals. In contrast, the data presented here suggests that T cell responses are largely unaffected by the variants,” the paper added.“A booster vaccine against those VOCs (variants of concern) makes sense, and is likely to be highly effective, and those efforts are hurtling forwards,” said Shane Crotty of La Jolla Institute in a tweet in reference to the study.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/t-cell-response-to-covid-may-remain-potent-after-vaccination-study-101619547090946.html
28-04-2021||India||SC permits Vedanta to operate TN plant for O2||New Delhi: The Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the Centre and the Tamil Nadu government to refrain from “political bickering” while it permitted Vedanta to operate its shuttered copper plant in Thoothukudi only for the production of medical oxygen at a time when there is a shortage of critical supplies amid the second Covid-19 wave in the country.A bench led by justice Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud said that the oxygen production unit will function on a stand-alone basis, and that Vedanta will not be allowed to access the copper and power plants in the precinct.Oxygen is a crucial medical intervention against Covid-19, which causes respiratory distress in some cases. The surge in infections has sharply accelerated its demand in several parts of the country.The bench, which also included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, said that Vedanta could operate the oxygen plant under the supervision of a committee, which will also decide the number of personnel allowed to run the unit. It will include Thoothukudi’s district collector, sub-collector, superintendent of police, district environmental engineer, two government officials with technical knowledge of the subject, and two experts to be nominated by those aggrieved by pollution from Vedanta’s copper smelter. The two experts will be picked from three suggested by the Union environment ministry.The court said the committee will be at liberty to involve local residents and members of the local community. It also asked the state to expedite the supply of power and water to Vedanta so that oxygen production could commence as soon as possible. Vedanta’s lawyer, Harish Salve, said the production could start in 10 days once other logistical requirements were fulfilled and the capacity could go up to 200 metric tonne (MT) per day. The court said its order will operate till July 31.Vedanta moved the Supreme Court last week for permission to operate the oxygen producing unit at the Sterlite copper plant, which was shut down in May 2018 by the state government days after 13 protesters were killed in police firing during a protest against pollution caused by the facility in the southern Tamil Nadu district.Tamil Nadu on Monday granted temporary permission to a shuttered plant to reopen for the production of medical oxygen production for four months. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant. The Supreme Court also rejected Vedanta’s plea to reopen the plant for a trial run in December and January.Responding to Vedanta’s fresh plea, senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan and additional advocate general Balaji Srinivasan, who appeared for Tamil Nadu, said that after an all-party meeting a day ago, the state government was agreeable to let Vedanta temporarily reopen the plant for access to its oxygen production unit.The state also suggested that representatives from the local community, social activists, and NGOs should be included in the committee constituted to oversee the oxygen production to ensure law and order. But Salve opposed it. “We are not opposed to the state government’s oversight in coordination with the Centre, but we cannot let locals enter the plant. There have already been many problems in the past,” said Salve.Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, who appeared for the Centre, supported Salve and submitted that a state could not say it is dependent on some social activists to maintain law and order.Vaidyanathan said he was surprised that the central government was supporting Vedanta, which was found in breach of the central laws on air and water pollution.The court said: “We do not want political bickering in the court. These are times of crisis. We are here as a national court to protect lives in these times of grave crisis. We are here to ensure lives are protected... Let us keep everything else out. Let us develop these matters in the spirit of dialogue.”The court said it understands the concerns of the local community. “...but we are looking at the national crisis where people are dying for the want of oxygen. There is a national demand. When the nation is facing such a crisis, we will have to balance everything.” The bench decided to replace local social activists with two environmental experts, preferably from Tamil Nadu, in the panel.The court accepted Mehta’s statement that Vedanta will supply the oxygen to the Centre’s pool for an equitable distribution across the country.“Nation stands together in this moment. At present, Tamil Nadu’s oxygen demands are met. In case of any future need, they can approach us for changes in the order.”Small groups of people including families who were affected due to the plant’s pollution protested in different parts of Thoothukudi district following the court’s verdict. “When they conducted the public hearing (last Friday) we had expressed that the smelter should be demolished, and the state government can take over the oxygen plant and run it,” said V Gunaseelan, an anti-Sterlite activist. “For the past 25 years since the plant came to Thoothukudi, we have been suffering and we know of the company’s attempts to somehow gain a backdoor entry. It’s like telling a murder accused- you be good for four months and produce oxygen. How can we believe them? Even if they were to start work, what infrastructure do they have to produce medical oxygen? Hasn’t the state told the Madras high court just yesterday that the plant is designed to produce industrial oxygen? We will continue to protest, and our numbers will increase.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sc-permits-vedanta-to-operate-oxygen-plant-in-thoothukudi-101619523808497.html

28-04-2021||Today's||Vaccine Maitri is a pragmatic response to the pandemic||It is heartening to see the massive global response to a critical moment in India’s fight against Covid-19. India’s friends and partners have stepped up to the challenge of managing the second wave hitting India. Singapore has donated cryogenic oxygen tanks and Australia is shipping oxygen, ventilators and personal protective equipment (PPE) kits. Thailand has pitched in, and so has Israel. Saudi Arabia is shipping liquid oxygen to India while the United Arab Emirates is airlifting high-capacity oxygen tankers.In Europe, France, Germany, the United Kingdom (UK) and the European Union have all reached out. The UK is shipping over “600 pieces of vital medical equipment” which will include 495 oxygen concentrators, 120 non-invasive ventilators, and 20 manual ventilators. Russian aid is aimed at helping India with the shortages of remdesivir as well as providing oxygen concentrators and generators. Though China too offered its help, in a curious twist the largest cargo flight operator from China to India, the Chinese State-owned Sichuan Airlines, has suspended its services to India for two weeks.The US response has also been strong though it came late as compared to the others and despite repeated efforts by India to get the ban lifted on raw materials need for vaccine manufacturing. After what seemed like an unusually prolonged silence from the top echelons of the Biden administration, finally Washington responded at multiple levels. While providing material help, it is also trying to identify “sources of specific raw material urgently required for Indian manufacture of the Covishield vaccine that will immediately be made available for India.”This show of support from around the world is a morale booster for a nation facing an unprecedented crisis. But it also underscores the role that India has played over the last year in keeping the global supply chains open. There has been questioning of India’s Vaccine Maitri initiative in some quarters as the crisis at home has unfolded in the past few week. Reasonable questions can be asked about the need for India to supply vaccines and other products to the world at large when there was a crisis at home. In some ways, the answer to this can be relatively simple: That this is rooted in India’s civilisational ethos. While it might be commonplace for some nations to suggest that it is in the interest of the wider world to focus exclusively on their citizens, it’s not a narrative that India can uphold at any level. At a time when the Indian situation looked stable, it was morally right for India to support other parts of the world that were in greater pain. But it is important to recognise that global support for India is also a reciprocal appreciation of New Delhi’s efforts over the last few months. From supplying hydroxychloroquine to more than 100 nations to providing 64 million doses of vaccines to more than 80 nations, India’s imprint on global health has been substantive. And as the Gulf nations got hit hard as a result of several nations banning food exports and declining oil demand, India ensured uninterrupted supply of food and essential items. Where some of the richest and most powerful nations in the world turned inwards and erected barriers, India opened its heart and purse strings as a responsible member of the world community. International relations is a ruthless space. Nations worry, first and foremost, about their own security and survival. But when the question is of global survival, the lines between national and global inevitably get blurred. India’s Vaccine Maitri initiative remains a pragmatic response to an unprecedented challenge facing humanity. The debate about India’s response to Covid-19 will and should continue with the aim of enhancing India’s ability to tide over a similar crisis. For India’s response represents a unique convergence of idealism and realism in strategic thinking. Where the idealists can point to this as a response to the better angels of our nature, for the realists this is a way of India saving itself by trying to save the world.
