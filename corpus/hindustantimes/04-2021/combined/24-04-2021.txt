She alleged that the lawyer lured her to reside with him and raped her after promising marriage, and subsequently, started beating and illegally confining her and her son from the first marriage. She said she managed flee from the illegal confinement and approached police.However, later they settled the dispute amicably, and the lawyer moved HC in December 2020 for quashing of the rape case on that grounds. It was argued on behalf of the lawyer that the petitioner and the complainant thereafter got married and had a girl child. The woman, too, filed an affidavit supporting the lawyer’s claim for quashing the rape case.HC, however, refused to accept the marital tie as a valid settlement, noticing that both of them — the lawyer and the complainant — had performed the second marriage though their earlier marriages were subsisting.“In the instant case, the petitioner, alleged rapist, and the informant still have subsisting first marriages, and therefore, we cannot recognise the alleged second marriage between the petitioner and the informant,” said the bench while rejecting the petition.It added, “We find it quite serious that the petitioner, being an advocate and representing the informant in her divorce petition, claims that the informant is his legally wedded second wife.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/bombay-hc-refuses-to-quash-rape-case-calls-marriage-illegal-101619288941293.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Source of 12,511 cases in slums could not be traced: Mumbai civic body data||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation’s (BMC) contact-tracing in slums has revealed that 12,511 Covid cases in slums are not among high-risk contacts of other positive cases. The source of infection in the case of such patients has not yet been traced. This is as per data between June 3, 2020, and March 14, 2021, reveals BMC’s Covid-19 dashboard. In slums, BMC traced an average of 13 high-risk contacts per positive patient. The norm set by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal last year is tracing up to 15 high-risk contacts per positive patient and moving them to institutional quarantine facilities, to break the chain of the spread of Covid-19. So far, BMC has moved 1,61,830 high-risk contacts from slums to quarantine facilities between June and March 14. A senior official from the health department said, “These are patients who tested positive for Covid-19 but were not high-risk contacts of positive patients. Effectively, it only means they would have come in contact with a Covid-19 positive patient, but were not identified as a high-risk contact during BMC’s enquiries and contact tracing efforts, as they were probably not immediate family or neighbours.” The highest number of positive cases in slums who are not high-risk contacts of positive patients are 1,668 cases from the K/West ward of Andheri (West), followed by 1,551 in the L ward of Kurla, and 1,511 of G/North ward, which has Dharavi under its jurisdiction. The K/West ward has traced a total of 23,412 high-risk contacts of cases in slums so far to send to institutional quarantine facilities, L ward has traced and quarantined 28,179 high-risk contacts of cases in slums, and G/North ward has traced and quarantined 20,462 high-risk contacts in slums.Until Friday, 5,740,196 Mumbaiites have completed quarantine, of which, 658,385 have completed home quarantine. Presently, 984 are in institutional quarantine centres. Mumbai has 122 containment zones and 1,211 sealed buildings. On Saturday, Mumbai reported 5,867 Covid cases, the lowest since March 31, 2021, when Mumbai reported 5,399 cases. On Saturday, Mumbai reported 71 deaths. This has taken the tally to 622,146, and the toll to 12,726. There are 78,226 active cases in Mumbai at present. The highest number of cases reported in Mumbai in a single day so far was 11,206 cases on April 4.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/source-of-12-511-cases-in-slums-could-not-be-traced-mumbai-civic-body-data-101619288881203.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Oxygen Express reaches Navi Mumbai; tankers sent to plants||The Oxygen Express carrying tankers of liquid oxygen reached Nashik in Maharashtra on Saturday morning. Four oxygen tankers were offloaded from the Roll-on Roll-off (RORO) and then transported to oxygen plants via road.The freight train carrying seven oxygen tankers had left Navi Mumbai on April 19 and returned to Nagpur on Friday 8pm after filling the tankers with oxygen at Vishakhapatnam. Three of the tankers were downloaded at Nagpur while the remaining were delivered to Nashik around 10am on Saturday. Ruling Shiv Sena has said the train took much more time (to reach Nashik) when the state needed the oxygen on urgent basis for Covid-19 patients. Central Railway (CR) which ran the train, however, clarified that the shortest route possible could not be availed due to technical problems. CR said the route of the RORO service — in which goods vehicles are put on freight train — had to be planned considering various constraints like ghat sections, road overbridges (ROB), tunnels, curves, platform canopies and over-head equipment (OHE).“Height is an important aspect in this movement. Railways mapped the route via Vasai. The distance between Kalamboli and Vizag is more than 1,850 kms, which was completed by these tankers only in about 50 hours. Transportation of oxygen through trains is faster for long distances than road transport. Trains can run 24 hours in a day but truck drivers need to take halts etc. The green corridor is created for faster movement of these tankers, and monitoring of movement was done at the apex level,” said a statement from CR. The Oxygen Express reached Nagpur in Maharashtra with seven liquid medical oxygen tankers on Friday evening. Three tankers were unloaded at Nagpur railway station. Of the three tankers, two headed for Nagpur city and one headed to Amaravati.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/oxygen-express-reaches-navi-mumbai-tankers-sent-to-plants-101619288761284.html

His family is busy making calls to close relatives informing them about the change of venue as the invitation cards had already been distributed.Despite this, Naresh was lucky as he belongs to a village and could change the venue swiftly. Hundreds others cannot shift the venue and are spending sleepless nights trying to get permission for their functions as now the government has limited the number of guests to 50 from 200, for all programmes.Haryana chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar, during a press conference on Saturday, said that people can defer their programmes. But people raised objection as they said weddings are not fixed in a week and their preparations begin more than a month before.Khattar added that all powers have been given to deputy commissioners for any further restrictions.“I have already paid for marriage palace, decoration, DJ, movie maker, catering and cooks as we were expecting a gathering of around 1,200 people at my son’s marriage. How can we reschedule it now?” asked Chanderbhan, of Kurukshetra, whose son’s marriage is fixed for Monday.The new restrictions have increased worries for people who cannot defer the marriages and are now making rounds to offices of the district administrations for permissions.As per authorities at the Karnal SDM office, over 150 applications seeking permission for marriages have been received since the restrictions were imposed.Karnal SDM Ayush Sinha said as per guidelines, permissions are only being granted for a day’s function. Duty magistrate and local police will visit the venue on the wedding day to ensure that Covid guidelines are followed and strict action is taken against violators as per law.Officials in Kaithal SDM office said over 50 applications for permission are coming in every day.Moreover, the restrictions, especially night curfew, has cost the owners of marriage palaces heavily as they most marriages were fixed for night and have now been cancelled or shifted to villages due to fresh guidelines and night curfew.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid-restrictions-hamper-wedding-plans-in-haryana-people-shifting-venue-to-villages-101619286001691.html

Although private hospitals managed to get supply later in the day, patients in home isolation were the worst hit as a tanker ferrying oxygen to Gurugram was diverted to Rewari.Residents who had gone to get cylinders refilled at a Manesar facility said they returned empty-handed. “We waited for the whole day for gas cylinders to be refilled. The truck did not arrive and we did not get anything,” said Surender Kumar, who had gone to Star Gases Limited, which provides oxygen supply.Long queues were witnessed even at 9pm as people refused to leave without the gas, according to the IMT industrial association.Sunil Jakhar, partner, Star Gases Limited, said that police stopped the tanker at Kasola in Bawal and took it over for supply in Rewari on the directions of the subdivisional magistrate of Bawal. “There were hundreds of people at the factory who were waiting but could not be supplied oxygen. We are filling cylinders free of cost and despite our repeated pleas, the truck was not released,” said Jakhar.Jakhar said that the company hired a truck later in the evening and managed to get oxygen to the factory around 8pm. “Around 400 people with cylinders and ambulances are waiting for gas. We will fill it free of cost till we can afford to do so,” he said.Sanjeev Kumar, SDM, Bawal, said that the truck was not seized but requisitioned by the Rewari administration. “The tanker was not seized but it was taken after discussion with nodal officer. This tanker will supply oxygen in Rewari. Gurugram has enough tankers to supply the gas and the authorities were duly informed,” said Kumar.The Gurugram district administration, meanwhile, said that the trucks are being requisitioned to augment oxygen supply as per the revised allocation plan. “The district administration supplied 31 metric tonnes of oxygen on Saturday and most of the hospitals that raised concerns were supplied oxygen. Also, it has been decided to double the supply to Gurugram and 20 metric tonnes (MT) will now come from Bhiwadi while 15 MT will come from Panipat. Around 10 MT additional supply will remain at the disposal of district administration,” said a spokesperson for the district administration.Earlier in the day, Max Hospital tweeted around 11am that it was led with only two hours of oxygen supply and that 70 critical patients Mayom Hospital in South City-1 tweeted around 11.45am that it would be “a losing battle, if we don’t get supply”.Dr Vikram Aryan, managing director, Aryan Hospital on Railway Road said that they were facing an acute shortage of oxygen. “We have 30 critical patients who won’t survive without oxygen.

On Friday night, there were no oxygen, ICU or ventilator beds available in Gurugram in any of its 41 Covid-19 hospitals, as per the Gurugram Covid Combat Companion (GC3), a real-time portal managed by the district administration.During the meeting, deputy commissioner Dr Yash Garg also suggested that by taking over ESI Hospital in Manesar, including the community hall adjoining it, around 150 additional beds can be added.Garg also said that the administration has discussed building hospitals for Covid-19 patients with a few big companies and NGOs of Gurugram.Sudhir Rajpal, chief executive officer (CEO), GMDA, who is also in charge of managing beds for Covid-19 patients in Gurugram, said that better management and data analysis of available bed numbers is needed and the existing infrastructure will be increased, as per the requirement.Oxygen supplyDuring the meeting, Gupta reiterated that there was no shortage of oxygen in Haryana and it only needed to be managed on the ground. He said that earlier, Gurugram was getting 20 to 22 metric tonnes (MT) of liquid medical oxygen, which was sufficient and with an increase in the requirement, 31 MT of liquid oxygen were supplied on Friday.The administration said that during Saturday’s review, there was a talk of increasing the supply of oxygen, to 35 MT. Apart from this, 10 tonnes of liquid oxygen will be kept at the disposal of the district administration for emergency purposes.Gupta said that the oxygen plan of the district has been prepared by taking the data of consumption and supply of oxygen in hospitals in the district. Gurugram district will get the supply from Bhiwadi in Rajasthan and Panipat.He said that there is no need for panic about the oxygen supply, as companies have also been asked to help out in case of a crisis.Beds reservationDuring the meeting, the administration apprised Gupta that 60% of all hospital beds have been reserved for Covid-19 patients, with 75% reservation of ICU and ventilator beds, leading to an additional 1,000 beds, following which Gupta directed all executive magistrates and nodal officers deputed at each Covid-19 hospital to strictly enforce the reservations.Requests from patientsThe district administration received 525 applications on the covidggn.com portal since the option was introduced last week, of which 80 patients were deemed to be eligible for admission by a team of doctors.Additional deputy commissioner Prashant Pawar said that such patients were admitted on a “first come first served” basis.He said that those applying on the portal need are allowed to choose three hospitals and if beds are not available in any of these, patients would be informed of availability in other hospitals and given the option of being admitted there.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/200-beds-to-be-added-within-three-days-800-more-in-the-works-101619285883156.html

Taking into account the unabated spike, the Haryana government on Saturday night imposed fresh restrictions.As per an order issued for Gurugram, Faridabad, Sonepat, Panchkula, Hisar and Karnal districts, by the state disaster management authority, the deputy commissioners were asked to impose prohibitory orders under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to ban gatherings of more than four persons. All information technology (IT), IT-enabled services units and corporate offices in these districts shall operate their offices from home till May 3, as per the order.Further, gatherings across the state have been capped to 30 persons indoors, 50 persons outdoors and 20 for funerals. For all other events, organisers will have to take permission from the deputy commissioners. “The public should be advised to conduct weddings and other functions during the daytime to avoid rush and traffic inconvenience at the time of imposition of night curfew,” the order said.On Saturday, Gurugram also recorded 8 Covid-19 deaths, taking the toll to 418. The positivity rate in the district stands at 25%, said Dr Virender Yadav, who said that strict enforcement of mask and other social distancing measures are being done. “The city residents must follow safeguards strictly and wear masks and avoid social or other gatherings. We are trying hard to augment facilities but the pressure is high and prevention is the best policy right now,” said Yadav.At present, the total number of active cases is 23,046, with the health department expecting the number to rise. The district administration on Saturday held a review meeting in which it was decided to increase beds, create more facilities and also enforce safeguards strictly.Tensions also ran high due to limited medical facilities as people were seen having arguments over getting tested and vaccinated at the Palam Vihar public health centre.As many as 12,171 samples were collected on Saturday for testing. Dr Yadav said that testing has been increased significantly to isolate local spreads. “We are increasing containment zones and isolating spread and this will help in curbing infection,” he said, adding that work from home in offices will also help.Officials said that 852 Covid-19 patients recovered on Saturday, taking the total recoveries to 76510. The rate of recovery in the city stands around 84%.As per the data, 22,015 patients are in home isolation, while 95 patients were sent to institutional quarantine on Saturday. The health department said that 7,952 people got vaccinated at session sites on the day. “Plan is being made to increase vaccination outreach as people over the age of 18 years will become eligible for vaccination,” said Yadav.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/caseload-nears-100-000-stricter-curbs-announced-101619285881601.html

24-04-2021||Lucknow||Current Covid-19 wave 30 times more intense than last one: Yogi||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said the current Covid-19 wave was 30 times more intense than the one witnessed last year. “This is calamity, pandemic. We should not dismiss it as mere viral fever. I, too, got infected and (am) following isolation and all protocols since April 13,” he said in an interaction with editors and senior journalists of various publications and media outlets.At the same time, he said in the last three days, the number of recoveries each day had been higher in Lucknow than the number of fresh Covid-19 positive cases. Yogi Adityanath also said that there was no shortage of drugs like Remdesivir. “When the demand increased, we sent the state plane to Ahmedabad, directly procured it from a pharma company, and brought the consignment to Lucknow the same day. Like oxygen, not all patients need Remdesivir,” he said.He also underscored, “There will be no dearth of beds, and the bed situation is being monitored and reviewed each day.” The chief minister said to the senior journalists: “When the first case surfaced in UP last year, we did not have any resources. We had one lab that started with 72 tests in March 2020. Now, we are doing 2.25 lakh tests per day and will escalate it. UP is the only state to have done nearly four crore tests. Last year, 36 districts that did not have even a single ventilator. Today, all districts have ventilators.”The chief minister alleged there were some vested interests who were engaged in spreading rumours and panic. There had been instances when the same fake distress message was relayed from different social media accounts, he said. There was a need to identify such people and act against them, he added.Dwelling more on the government’s efforts, he said: “Recently, when the Delhi government announced lockdown, nearly 1.5 lakh migrants arrived in UP. We promptly arranged buses, tests, and quarantine.”Regarding Covid vaccination, he said that UP was the first state to announce free vaccination for all. The state had nearly 8,000 vaccination centres ready where vaccines will be given to people about 18 years of age from May 1. At a Covid-19 review meeting earlier in the day, the chief minister aid stress on proper preparations for the new phase of the vaccination drive. Till now, those above 45 years of age were getting inoculated.The chief minister asked for extensive sanitisation during the corona curfew.In the last 24 hours, more than 23,000 Covid-19 positive patients had recovered, he noted.He also asked for promptness in ambulance services for Covid-19 patients, effective implementation of norms in containment zones, providing Covid kit to home isolation patients, and smooth operations in wheat purchase across the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/current-covid-19-wave-30-times-more-intense-than-last-one-yogi-101619285521027.html
24-04-2021||Other||UP to do oxygen audit with help from top institutes||Chief minister Yogi Adityanath on Saturday said the state government will conduct oxygen audit with the assistance of IIT- Kanpur, IIM-Lucknow and IIT-Banaras Hindu University. He also said the state will soon have 32 new oxygen plants of which 18 will be based on DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) technology. Reacting to the move on oxygen audit, a spokesperson for Indian Institute of Technology-Kanpur (IIT-K) said, “We are more than happy to assist the UP government in any way we can in these times of crisis. A team will be formed and assigned this task once an official communication in this regard is received by us.” The Indian Institute of Management-Lucknow (IIM-L) also assured full cooperation in the oxygen audit. “We are yet to receive an official communication from the state government,” its spokesperson said. IIT-BHU director Prof PK Jain said, “A team of experts will be constituted for the oxygen audit as soon as we receive any communication from the government in this regard.” The chief minister announced the oxygen audit a day after launching a digital platform for monitoring oxygen supply. For his part, he asked officials to strike a balance between demand and supply of oxygen. He also asked officials to “distribute oxygen in a transparent manner.” He also said the Covid-19 hospitals being set up by DRDO (Defence Research and Development Organisation) in Lucknow and Varanasi will soon be ready and functional, said a state government statement quoting the chief minister. He noted that medical oxygen supply to Uttar Pradesh was being augmented not only from Bokaro (Jharkhand) but also from Modinagar (UP), Kashipur and Roorkee (Uttarakhand) and Panipat (Haryana). “Ensure oxygen supply to small districts such as Bahraich, Firozabad from their district headquarters. Oxygen is being transported to various districts such as Gorakhpur and Bareilly through tankers. Ensure GPS (global position system) tracking of the tankers and make security arrangements for them. No patient should suffer because of a lack of oxygen. Keep an eye on all small or big hospitals in the state,” he added. “Provide oxygen even to those who require it in home isolation. The state government will ensure oxygen sufficiency everywhere in the state,” he said. Yogi said oxygen will be given to anyone who has doctor’s prescription for it. The chief minister said oxygen refilling and oxygen-producing MSME units should be connected directly with the hospitals for smoother supply. “There is no crisis of oxygen in the government and private hospitals. Hoarding and black marketeering has led to the shortage. Some of the hospitals announced that they were facing oxygen shortage. When the state government teams checked the premises, enough oxygen was found in the stock. Due to the fear being created by such hospitals, the panicked people are trying to get an oxygen cylinder,” he said later in the day. Additional chief secretary (Home) Awasthi said the oxygen monitoring system had started functioning. In a video conference on Saturday, the Uttar Pradesh authorities apprised the central government about the new monitoring system launched by the state. The central government appreciated the UP initiative, he said, adding that the representatives of Bihar, Punjab, Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra showed interest in the monitoring system launched by UP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-to-do-oxygen-audit-with-help-from-top-institutes-101619285342959.html

The tankers with refills will return to the state on trains later. The state government also said that it may use the Bakshi Ka Talab air base in Lucknow and Gorakhpur air base for airlifting empty oxygen tankers. “The first two tankers were scheduled to be airlifted from Hindon airbase in Ghaziabad today (Saturday). We believe the tankers have reached Bokaro, Jamshedpur,” said a state government official. The development follows chief minister Yogi Adityanath’s virtual meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday where Yogi requested the central government to deploy air force planes for oxygen supply. At the Team-11 meeting on Saturday, the chief minister said: “Even the Indian Air Force is cooperating from various centres across the country for oxygen supply. Two tankers will be airlifted on an air force plane to Bokaro. From there, after refilling, the tankers will reach Lucknow on a train.” The state government official said that the plane would take only empty tankers and won’t transport refilled tankers as that’s dangerous from the aviation point of view. Once filled with liquid oxygen, the tankers would reach their destinations in UP on trains. Airlifting empty tankers to the filling centres drastically cuts the total time of transportation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/iaf-starts-transporting-empty-oxygen-tankers-from-up-101619285161009.html
24-04-2021||Kolkata||Panel asks Bengal private hospitals to earmark 60% of beds for Covid-19 patients||As surging Covid-19 cases in West Bengal lead to a crisis of beds in hospitals, a regulatory body for private hospitals on Saturday asked the clinical establishments of the state to earmark 60 per cent of their total bed strength for treating coronavirus patients.The remaining 40 per cent of the beds will be dedicated as "Day Care beds, Emergency triage and for emergency non-Covid treatment like dialysis and emergency surgeries," the West Bengal Clinical Establishment Regulatory Commission (WBCERC) said.In the emergency department, "triage" refers to the methods used to assess patients' severity of injury or illness within a short time after their arrival, assign priorities, and transfer each patient to the appropriate place for treatment."Clinical Establishments (CEs) have taken measures to enhance the bed capacity but the present capacity is unsatisfactory and failing to fulfill the requirements."Now, it is apprehended that many lives may be lost if Covid beds are not enhanced. Sixty per cent of the sanctioned beds in the CEs must be dedicated for Covid treatment," the advisory read.The hospitals which have already designated 60 per cent of their bed strength to treat coronavirus patients should not reduce them, the WBCERC said."The advisory, however, will not be applicable to CEs wherein government requisitioned Covid beds or CEs serving as charitable organisation," the advisory stated.The CEs were asked to submit a report to the WBCERC on steps in accordance with the order.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/panel-asks-bengal-private-hospitals-to-earmark-60-of-beds-for-covid-19-patients-101619284390275.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Random forays: Laughter is still the best medicine||A few decades ago, spiritual thinker Dada Vaswani propounded his ‘therapy of laughter’, but few people took him seriously! The theory that even critically ill patients could benefit by healthy doses of laughter was pooh-poohed by most experts. The jury is still out on this one, though thousands of patients have recovered to the prime of health after having risen from the ashes, as it were, with focused treatment of the holistic kind, which includes medical treatment along with therapies like Vaswani’s.Several leading doctors often vouch for the veracity of meditation, prayer, faith, cheerfulness and laughter, as holistic methods of healing which can supplement modern day scientific methodologies. Patients of the still dreaded disease, cancer, have also shown remarkable results when their minds have been convinced of the need for positive thinking and cheerfulness. I personally know of a couple of patients of advanced carcinoma who have miraculously recovered beyond the expectations of doctors by sheer dint of their never say die spirit.The currently raging tsunamic surge of pandemic numbers is looming large upon us and it may seem preposterous to prescribe laughter as a balm for any sort of healing. Seriously ill patients afflicted by the venomous virus require hospitalisation, oxygen and medication. However, those with few or no symptoms, and those who are hale but nervous to bits at the prospect of falling sick, need such therapies more than ever before.Reader’s Digest, the venerable family publication, first appeared in 1922 and regularly carried a couple of pages of lighter anecdotes, under the title, Laughter- The Best Medicine. While growing up, I would flip the pages quickly to devour that section, as also ‘Humour in Uniform’ and “Life’s like That!’ which were an integral part of a periodical that has been a favourite of many generations.Life is full of interactions between human beings. The lighter and peppier conversations which ignore “doomsday cometh” sorts of suggestions, is a truly healthy conversation. Imagine the mood of a household which has not smiled all day long without any valid reason. The collective sullenness that society is experiencing these days due to the sheer burden of the news floating around them, is best combated by being sensible and staying safe, but also by focusing on just the opposite.Watching gruesome murder mysteries on Netflix won’t help (unless one is utterly impervious to such deleterious influences!). A deliberate effort will have to be made to pull oneself away from all form of despair and gloom. Comedies and lighthearted shows are just what the busy doctor would order in this scenario. Family games and musical evenings must become the norm rather than the exception for those who do not have convalescing patients to nurse at home.A Jewish proverb happily goes like this: “As soap is to the body, so laughter is to the soul.” And we all know how important soap is these days! Everyone does not have the knack of making others laugh, of course. A write up that once appeared in the Reader’s Digest, dealt with types of joke tellers. There are those who keep forgetting their own jokes, and get muddled up, midway. There are also those who relate brilliant jokes without bringing even a smile to anyone’s face, since their punchline lacks the much-needed punch. But the ones who take the cake are those who keep on laughing while enunciating a joke, leading to general mirth for the wrong reasons! A WhatsApp forward wins my award for the most innovative and telling comment on our shaky times. It carries a group picture of some elderly persons, and advises all friends to stay safe so that they can collectively pose for similar ‘80-plus pics’ one day! The joke industry of India is in hyper mode these days, with several jokes not even worthy of mention. Yet, one would any day prefer to subscribe to it than to the messengers of gloom.‘Trouble knocked at the door, but on hearing laughter, it hurried away!’ said Benjamin Franklin once.

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wild Buzz: Parched dam||As temperatures rise and natural water sources dwindle, thirsty garden birds can be observed hovering around water taps turned ever so tightly. Photographers have captured these poignant avian moments emanating from a dry, scorching heat. Perhaps, the most disturbing photograph that mirrored the vivid and expressive emotions displayed by parched birds emerged from the Perch Check Dam in the Shivalik foothills behind the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education & Research (PGIMER). The visual was of a checkered keelback (Asiatic water snake) suffering from dehydration and prey scarcity due to its aquatic habitat being virtually annihilated overnight. Unlike an evolving drought situation that entails water resources drying out slowly, warning wild species and allowing them a chance to adapt and migrate, the dam emptied out in 48 hours after a mechanical failure in the sluice gates. The keelback species shelters within rocks and niche spaces besides the dam’s water and preys on frogs and fish by swimming out. Like other wild species dying in the empty dam, keelbacks were accustomed to a perennial source of water for 27 years, ever since the dam’s inception.The keelback had left the dry dam’s immediate vicinity in a fruitless search for water and prey and was photographed by Amardeep Singh, a bird photographer and chassis design section head at Maruti Suzuki India’s plant in Gurgaon. “I was taken aback by the snake’s behaviour. It did not move away or put up an aggressive posture when we got close to it. The tongue was not flickering. It slowly raised its head once and then lowered it to conserve energy. It was displaying an inert and listless disposition due to the catastrophic loss of its water habitat,” Singh told this writer. Pyaas ke phoolIndia’s diverse traditions exalt the creed of compassion for creatures in distress, especially during water shortages. There are anecdotal remembrances from pre-Partition Punjab of black bucks entering villages in droughts and villagers provisioning water and shikaris putting away their weapons under the sway of the community’s empathetic reach out. The Bishnois excel in community ‘sewa’ of wild creatures and their women rise to the occasion by breast feeding orphaned fawns. Indian art forms, especially miniature paintings, have revelled in ethereal feminine beauty indulging in a divine-like compassion for creatures, such as cranes, swans, does and black bucks.One of the simplest ways to provide a seamless continuity to such traditions is to put out a bowl of water in gardens or balconies. But please ensure that the placement is in the open and away from hiding places that a feral cat can use to ambush birds habituated to the assured water. It will allow birds to bathe and enhance feather maintenance. Dampening feathers loosens dirt and facilitates preening. Bees, insects and butterflies also avail of water bowls.Watching birds bathe and quench their thirst is certain to provide householders with unlimited happiness, a very proximate connect to nature and render their children more rounded and empathetic personalities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wild-buzz-parched-dam-101619284023308.html

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Guest column: Of idols and their myriad obsessions||Haven’t we all idolised somebody? I too have had idols at most stages of life and strange as it would seem, each one of them was in turn obsessed with something or the other. My first idol, as far as I can remember, was the Bollywood actor Sunil Dutt. His iconic film, Mother India, had deeply moved me and after he rescued his co-star Nargis and won her heart and hand, his place was cemented as my idol. Over the years, my idols ranged from an English teacher who was a stickler for correct pronunciation and spellings, a cricket coach who would make us run at least 5km before a game as warm up, to a drill instructor at the Indian Military Academy who would reach the barracks even on a rainy day (presumably a non-drill day) and pace through the corridor with his trademarked one liners, invariably beginning with “GC (gentleman cadet) fauj mein koi chutti nahin hoti.” Having hung up my spurs, I now have two constant idols — my daughter-in-law, whom I try to emulate in soft skills, courage, and stress-free living and my wife whose emotional intelligence has always impressed me. Ironically, they too are not free of obsessions. The former is obsessed with her son and the latter is on an unending quest to improve her husband.  The one who abhorred obsessions Being impulsive, fickle and self-obsessed, I fall for contrary qualities in people around me. One such person has been a friend for around four decades. Cool as a cucumber, he has unending reserves of patience, soft skills, ability to tolerate ambiguity and suffer fools, which makes him a favourite among the community at large. However, it was his abhorrence to obsessions, which cliched his place as my idol ... or so I thought. Recently, we met at a golf course, which is close to his house. Hoping for a fun-filled and tough game, we teed off for an engrossing five-hour duel. However, I immediately realised that his body language seemed abnormal. He seemed restless and fidgety, which was unlike him. He kept looking over his shoulder and kept groping his pockets. “All fine Rajeev?” I asked him and received the proverbial thumbs up. He was not his usual relaxed self and it manifested in his game, which gradually progressed from bad to worse . After the front nine, it was time for a snack break. However, my hero was reeling under an embarrassing score, an unusual happening! Turning the tide “ You go ahead with snacks while I finish an errand,” he told me. Though he is not one to miss a sumptuous omelet, he left in a flurry even before I could fathom what had happened. It was a while before he was back with a spring in his step and a cellphone to his ear. The back nine round turned out to be a game changer with him turning the tide. It was after I handed over the day’s winnings to him that I realised the reason for the turnaround. My friend had forgotten his mobile phone at home and insecurity at being cut off from the world had taken its toll in the first half. Surprised by this extreme obsession, which had by now diluted my sense of idolisation for him , I asked him, “Did you miss anything when the gizmo was not with you?” Though sheepish, he was quick to retort , “There were some important WhatsApp updates regarding the second wave of Covid. You know we can’t afford to miss them in these times.” Dejected and crestfallen, I am now looking to fulfil my obsession to search for a new idol! avnishrms59@gmail.comThe writer is a Chandigarh-based freelance contributor||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/guest-column-of-idols-and-their-myriad-obsessions-101619283541475.html

There is a need to identify more areas with high infection rate at the district level," Chouhan said at a meeting of a core group formed to tackle the coronavirus situation in the state.He said his government was developing a mechanism to control infection at the micro-level by declaring containment zones.A total of 11,000 people had recovered from the infection during the day, he said, adding that ensuring supply of liquid medical oxygen as per demand amid a surge in cases was his government's top priority.The CM said he had spoken to Railway Minister Piyush Goyal who had assured that an oxygen express, a train carrying tankers with liquid medical oxygen, would reach state capital Bhopal from Bokaro via Ranchi in Jharkhand.Chouhan said the possibility of converting nitrogen tankers into oxygen ones and ferrying them by trains was also being considered.Speaking about the ramping up of health infrastructure in the state, he said 9,041 isolation beds have been arranged in 155 Covid care centres, and 618 beds with oxygen facilities have been set up in 32 centres statewide.The core group was also informed that 100 ICU beds will be increased in AIIMS, Bhopal.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bhopal-news/shivraj-singh-chouhan-says-corona-curfew-helping-stabilise-covid-19-case-positivity-rate-in-madhya-pradesh-101619282537007.html
24-04-2021||Ranchi||Only 8% people in state vaccinated||Jharkhand, in last three and a half months, has vaccinated only 8% of its population with the first dose of Covid-19 vaccine, considered as the only way to slow down the growth of infection, according to the state health department’s bulletin released on Saturday.The state till Saturday evening vaccinated over 2.54 million citizens against its total population of 32.96 million. These beneficiaries were a part of preferred groups comprising health care workers (HCW), frontline workers (FLW) and citizens above the age of 45 years.At a time when the state is badly hit by the second wave of the pandemic, all eyes are now set at the pace of vaccination and its coverage, that need to be amplified further to save precious lives.Considering the importance of vaccination in the ongoing fight against the virus, the Centre recently allowed inoculation of all citizens above the age of 18 years from May 1.The state government too responded quickly to this development and announced to provide free vaccination to all its eligible citizens.According to an estimate of the state health department, there are around 16 million people between 18-44 years of age in Jharkhand, for which it requires 32 million doses of the vaccine.However, health mandarins in the state are sceptical about timely availability of such a huge number of vaccine doses. This apart, they also find the current pace of vaccination coverage unsatisfactory.A senior official of the health department said, “The department has been continuously monitoring the entire vaccination programme and issuing directions/advisories to districts to augment the pace of vaccination. Districts with low coverage have been nudged regularly. Special camps were organised at panchayat levels also to augment the coverage percentage. On Saturday, around 1,500 Covid-19 vaccination centres (CVC) were functioning across the state. The number of CVCs may be increased from May 1.”According to sources, the state has, at present, six lakh doses of both Covishield and Covaxin. It is also planning to purchase around 50 lakh doses for the launch of mass vaccination campaign from May 1.According to a department official, “The Serum Institute of India, Pune, that manufactures Covishield vaccine, has fixed ₹400 and ₹600 prices per dose for government and private sectors, respectively.”Health experts feel that vaccination is the key to contain the spread of the infection. “Achieving herd immunity at the earliest is key to effectively control the disastrous pandemic. How quickly can we reach the magic herd immunity number across the country depends on a number of factors, including infectivity of the virus,” said Dr RK Jha, former professor and head, department of medicine of RIMS, Ranchi.He added, “More the infectiousness of the virus, bigger the percentage of people to be vaccinated. For instances, herd immunity for measles is achieved by vaccinating almost 100% population because its basic reproduction number R0 ( R nought) is extremely high, 12-18 suggesting infectiousness, whereas, for whooping cough (pertussis) it’s 5-6, requiring only 70% of population to be vaccinated.It’s quite likely that newer variants of coronavirus, that are more infectious, now require almost 100% of population to be vaccinated, Jha said.“Vaccinating a large population swiftly requires huge manpower and other infrastructure. Health emergency should be promulgated in order to effectively use national resources. Vaccine availability, right from production to storage and distribution, should be streamlined and perfectly tuned with the help of computer applications. Media have a greater role to play in creating awareness,” he said, adding, “Wearing mask as a national dress and duty can buy time for vaccination. The state should do everything possible to ensure that people are made to use mask and maintain social distancing.”According to the health department’s April 24 bulletin, of the total 2,548,045 beneficiaries, who received the first jab, 2,088,413 were above 45 years of age, 264,281 were FLWs and 195,351 were HCWs. A total of 414,035 beneficiaries have taken both the doses.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/only-8-people-in-state-vaccinated-101619282760878.html
24-04-2021||Ranchi||State starts Covid-19 circuit to relieve load of major districts||In order to decongest hospitals in major cities like Ranchi and Jamshedpur and provide oxygen beds to struggling patients, the state government on Saturday started ‘Covid-19 circuit’ through which patients will be shifted to hospitals in nearby districts where oxygen beds were lying vacant, officials said.The circuit was inaugurated online by chief minister Hemant Soren, along with symbolically flagging off ambulances from his residence that will transport patients to nearby districts free of cost as and when required. “It is being observed that while there is lot of pressure on hospitals in Ranchi and Jamshedpur, several beds in nearby district hospitals are lying vacant. We need to use these beds optimally. Patients who are in need of oxygenated beds can dial emergency number and they can get admitted in nearby districts which are part of the two major districts. If needed, government vans will transport them to these facilities from Ranchi and Jamshedpur,” said Soren, while inaugurating the circuit. The move comes a day after the chief minister said there was no shortage of oxygen or oxygen supported beds in the state.Ramgarh, Khunti, Humla, Siddha, Lohardaga and Latehar districts are part of the Ranchi circuit, while Jamshedpur, Chaibasa and Saraikela-Kharsawan districts are part of the Jamshedpur (East Singhbhum) circuit. According to the chief minister, hundreds of oxygenated beds were available in these districts. “In Ranchi circuit, out of the total 2,000 beds, nearly 450 are vacant. In Jamshedpur circuit, out of 1,200, around 500 are still available,” Soren said. He further said oxygen beds in the state were increased to 10,000 from 2,500 in last 20 days, while work was also on to increase the number of oxygen supported beds across the state.Besides, in a bid avoid problems arising due to lack of information, the state government issued a toll-free number, the chief minister said. Infected patients or families, who wish to be admitted to nearby district hospitals, can call central control room at 104 or Ranchi centre at 0651-2411144 and Jamshedpur centre at 0657-244011, and 8987510050. This service is being provided for free.Earlier on Friday, Soren said there was no shortage of oxygen or oxygen supported beds in the state. “There is no need to panic. All of us will win this battle against Covid-19 by keeping restraint. Doctors in the state, including paramedical staff, and other Covid-19 warriors are working day and night for us. We all have to be together in this fight. Arrangements are improving with every passing day. Our patience can be an important link in this fight,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/state-starts-covid-19-circuit-to-relieve-load-of-major-districts-101619282700944.html

Bihar Legislative Council member and president of the Bihar Secondary Teachers’ Association, Kedar Nath Pandey, has written to education minister Vijay Kumar Choudhary to look into the matter in view of practical difficulties, viz over 15% teachers staying at least 50-150 kms from the school in villages, 35% women appointed as teachers and lack of any hostel or stay facilities in schools. “Over two dozen school teachers have also died due to Covid-19 and it is hard to identify who is infected and who is not due to difficulty in getting RTPCR tests done and if that is somehow managed, one has to endlessly wait for reports. In this situation, asking teachers to attend school is fraught with risk and against the government’s efforts to break the chain. Many teachers have reported symptoms,” Pandey wrote. The Federation of University Teachers’ Association (FUTAB) has also written to the Raj Bhawan to avoid calling teachers to the colleges and universities every day without ensuring proper sanitization and cleanliness at a time when Covid-19 situation in the state was fast spiraling out of control. “If the services or teachers are meaningfully required, there is no issue in calling them daily or alternate day. When exams and admissions have been postponed and there are reports of over a dozen college teachers, including young ones, dying due to Covid in the last couple of weeks , there is no point exposing them to further risk when the government hospitals are themselves gasping for breath and basic infrastructure is crumbling,” FUTAB working president KB Sinha and general secretary Sanjay Kumar, MLC, wrote to the principal secretary to the Chancellor of Universities. The association said the list of teachers who succumbed to Covid-19 include Iqbal Ahmad and Dilip Choudhary of Veer Kuer Singh University (Ara), Parvez Ahmad, CL Khatri and Baliram Kumar of Pataliputra University (Patna), Patna University teacher Govind Kumar , Prof Ashish and Prof Akhilesh of TM Bhagalpur University. The FUTAB letter is in response to the letter from the department of education’s principal secretary Sanjay Kumar to all the district magistrates and district education officers, which said all associate professors, professors and officers equivalent or above the rank will be present daily, while one-third of those in the rank of assistant professor or below will attend alternatively. In schools also, 33% teachers and employees have been asked to be present, while the headmaster and in-charge headmaster of middle, secondary and higher secondary schools will be present every day. Patna University vice-chancellor Girish Kumar Choudhary is himself suffering from Covid-19 and has proceeded on medical leave. Raj Bhawan has given additional charge of VC to Pro-VC Prof Ajay Kumar Singh to discharge the routine work till CHoudhary recovers. “In the universities and colleges, the government should first try to ensure sanitization before issuing orders. When even sweepers are not available, one can well imagine the chances of adhering to Covid safety guidelines,” the FUTAB letter said, urging the Chancellor’s office to intervene in the matter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/spare-us-of-attending-schools-colleges-teachers-urge-govt-101619282582014.html

Darbhanga civil surgeon (CS) Sanjiv Kumar Sinha said on Saturday that samples collected at primary health centres were being sent to Darbhanga Medical College and Hospital (DMCH) for RTPCR test and the delay in test results was due to huge rush as neighbouring district hospitals were also sending samples.

The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by the CM.Bihar Health Services Association (BHSA) general secretary Dr Ranjeet Kumar said 30-40% of the posts in the state, both of doctors and paramedical staff, were lying vacant. “The state has a sanctioned strength of 13,500 doctors (approximately) and is facing acute shortage of paramedical staff like OT assistants, laboratory assistants, nurses, X-ray technicians, ultrasound technicians, ventilator assistants and data operators in 700-odd hospitals of the state,” said Dr Kumar. Sources said there are 4,133 ANM (auxillary nurse midwife) vacancies against sanctioned posts of 9,130 in Bihar and there is also a shortage of 2,000-odd medical members against 4,000 sanctioned posts.With Covid cases increasing at an alarming pace, the state is in dire need of doctors as more than 500 doctors and health workers of the two leading hospitals in Patna, AIIMS and Patna Medical College and Hospital (PMCH), have been infected with the coronavirus during the ongoing second wave, according to agency reports. “The situation is the same in medical colleges, which are functioning on half the teaching strength. Out of the 4,000 teaching posts, nearly 50% are vacant,” said Dr Ajay Kumar, senior vice-president of the Indian Medical Association, Bihar chapter.In fact, the IMA had written a letter to chief minister on Friday asking him to appoint doctors as an emergency measure. “There is a provision of quick appointment of doctors and others in times of an epidemic. All such people who are ready to join can be recruited on contract under epidemic provisions,” said Dr Kumar.He said that doctors and health care workers have been working continuously for the last 14 months without any leave. “They are exhausted and need some rest on intervals. More than 15% of them are infected. Many have died. It is the demand of time in public interest,” said Kumar.Meanwhile, the total number of active cases in the state climbed to 81960. “Seven districts, including Patna, Gaya, Bhagalpur, Aurangabad, Saran, Nalanda and Begusarai, reported more than 500 positive cases on Friday,” said Manoj Kumar, executive director, State Health Society.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bodies-pile-up-nitish-orders-walk-in-interviews-for-docs-101619282580856.html

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Roundabout: Alchemy of war - national interest or pride, prejudice||War has always intrigued writers as has peace. Stalwart American writer Ernest Hemingway, who was witness to both world wars — first as a volunteer ambulance driver, then as a reporter — in his classic A Farewell To Arms (1929), says World War I was “the most colossal, murderous, mismanaged butchery that has ever taken place on earth. Any writer who said otherwise lied, so the writers either wrote propaganda, shut up, or fought.”Recounting the Great War, as it is called, Chandigarh-based writer Mandeep Rai, in his action-packed novel The Wheel of Destiny highlights the utter futility of war. “Apart from the feeling of dread and horror, what stands out in the end is the piercing realisation that there are no victors, friends lose and so do enemies,” says Rai. A fictional character in the book sums it up: “Entire mankind is the victim, but ultimately God is the victim.”The Great War novel, published by Ferntree Publishing, follows Rai’s In The Shadow Of The Pines, No Friends, No Enemies and When The Vulture Descends. Rai says, “World War I has continued to inspire and intrigue me as in it lies the genesis of World War II and the state of affairs in the present world. I have delved deep into the mysteries and causes of the war with its share of misguided patriotism and chauvinistic fervour. The 19th century philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche aptly said, ‘war is the destiny of man’ and sadly the Great War proved him right!”Khushwant’s wonderBorn in 1949 in Sherwani Kot near Malerkotla, Rai’s father Colonel Amar Singh was a commissioned officer in the British Indian Army serving in the Army Service Core. It was the princely Yadavindra Public School, Patiala, a prestigious institution for the children of the Jat elite that his skill with words as well as the English language was honed. Years on, glancing through his book ‘In The Shade Of The Pines’ celebrated writer Khushwant Singh, a child of the Raj, looked up in admiration and asked, “Angrezi kithon sikhi ?”(Where did you learn English from?), “YPS Patiala ton!” (From YPS), came the pat response.The idea of the book first came to Rai when he was posted in Shimla. “It was inspired by Lord Dalhousie who changed the face of colonial India by bringing many reforms and introducing railways, the electric telegraph and laying the foundations of the modern education system. As a visionary governor-general, he consolidated the East India Company’s rule by strengthening the administrative system. India owes a lot to him, and it was ironic indeed that many in Britain denounced him for not seeing the seeds of Indian rebellion of 1857, which we remember in Independent India as the first war of independence.”“In The Shade Of The Pines’ did exceedingly well in circulation as well as reviews, including a generous one by Khushwant himself, whose one regret was that it should have been brought out internationally.From words to numbersOne wonders how a young man with a love for writing and a great interest in literature found himself in the Indian Revenue Service, he smiles and replies: “The problem was that I was good at too many things. I was known in school for my soulful essays, debates and declamation. Interestingly, when I passed out, the boys of a junior class snatched the notebook, in which I wrote my essays. As boys pulled at it, the notebook was torn into three. Word reached the faculty and the principal. He announced that if any boys were found copying my essays, they would be given a big zero.”Rai was equally good at numbers, a topper and an all-rounder. Dismissing the idea of humanities, his father wanted him to go for engineering in an IIT. So, off he went to IIT Bombay to study chemical engineering, which he left after doing well for two years to pursue a bachelor’s course in English in Government College, Chandigarh. But his persuasive father made him take the competitive examinations and there he landed in the revenue service, which is the destiny of many a bright student, boy or girl.A columnist once wrote about him, saying: “How important are figures to a writer of historical fiction? For Mandeep Rai, the six-feet-tall sardar in a red turban, here are the ones that spring to mind: 50 years, four books and 111 rejections the first time round; eight, six and five years poured into the second, third and latest novel respectively; 3,000 copies of his first book sold; and, oh yes, this little note of encouragement from his father, now 80, “If you want to be a writer, it’ll take you 20 years to get published.” It took Rai 30.”Well Rai was never afraid of numbers or words and with the novel on The Great War in the hands of the readers, he is already contemplating his next novel.

A senior consultant who was part of the Pune Metro project lost his life due to Covid-19 in his hometown in Karnataka, causing a sense of fear among workers. As compared to last year, the spread and infection rate of Covid-19 is high, however, the Maharashtra Metro Railway Corporation Limited (Maha-Metro) has taken care of workers in terms of food, stay and vaccinations. Despite better arrangements for food and stay, workers are returning back to their hometowns. Till date, more than 2,000 workers have gone back to their hometowns and the trend is on an upward rise. Last year, of 6,500 workers, only 800 were on duty after the government made arrangements for trains in the month of June 2020. This year, there are no restrictions on traveling and trains are also available to workers to return to their hometowns. Pune Metro had decided to take a trial run on the Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor using coaches belonging to the Nagpur Metro. They brought three coaches from Nagpur in the first week of March 2021 for a trial run. The Metro had decided to start a trial run on the Vanaz-Ramwadi corridor on one kilometre stretch from Vanaz depot to Anand Nagar by the month of May. According to officials, the trial run was scheduled in the period from March to May but, now it is not possible due to the shortage of manpower. The work has been disturbed, and a similar situation is reported from the PCMC –Swargate corridor. After conducting a six kilometre trial run between PCMC to Phugewadi in the first week of January, Maha-Metro had decided to start commercial operation on this stretch in the period of May or June before civic polls. Now, it looks difficult to complete the work as per the set deadline. Hemant Sonwane, general manager of Maha-Metro said, “Till date more than 2,000 workers have returned to their hometowns. We have more than 6,000 workers. At present, there are 35- 40 workers undergoing treatment. We are providing medical facilities, food and medical advance. “ He further added, “The metro project work will get affected in this situation and we will have to revise our work schedule. Last year, labours went in June and they returned in the Diwali festival season. We had made arrangements for private buses. Now, we are hoping, the second wave will not last long and labourers will come back after the situation normalises in the city.” Consultant dies due to Covid-19 A 54-year-old senior level officer died to Covid-19 infection in his hometown in Karnataka while taking treatment at a private hospital. He was a consultant in the Pune Metro project. As many as 121 workers have tested positive for Covid-19, however, some of them recovered. Sonawane said,” The consultant was not paid for the Pune metro project. Metro has outsourced different works, he was one of them. We didn’t know whether he was infected at work or not. He had taken leave and gone to his hometown.” “There are no casualties recorded in the first and second wave so far. All workers above 45 years of age have been vaccinated. From May 1, as the new norms come into effect, we will start vaccinating all above 18 years of age,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/labour-shortage-hits-pune-metro-again-won-t-meet-deadline-101619279400753.html

24-04-2021||Delhi||‘Delhi got more oxygen than they asked, up to AAP govt to rationalise’: Harsh Vardhan||Union health minister Harsh Vardhan on Saturday claimed Delhi has been issued more oxygen than the Arvind Kejriwal government asked for to treat the seriously-ill Covid-19 patents in the city and asserted it’s up to the state government to use it wisely. “Delhi has been allotted more than the (oxygen) quota they had asked for, and Delhi CM even thanked PM for that yesterday... Now to rationalise the quota in a timely manner and the responsibility to finely plan it lies with state government,” Harsh Vardhan was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here The Union minister’s statement comes at a time when CM Arvind Kejriwal has been repeatedly flagging the shortage of oxygen for the last few days and the Centre has claimed it has been supplying the key element for the treatment of critical Covid-19 patients. Earlier in the day, 20 patients at a hospital in Delhi died due to a shortage of oxygen.Harsh Vardhan also said the Centre has assisted the Delhi government with the transportation of oxygen. "Earlier, the CM said they are having problem in the transportation of oxygen after which central government assured they will ensure unhindered transportation. The government also assured that strict action will be taken against those who try to create hindrance in transportation," the Union minister told ANI.Earlier in the day, the Delhi High Court also hit out at the Delhi government over its management of the crisis and told it to arrange tankers for the transportation of liquid oxygen. "It's not that you will just write and keep waiting. What is the nodal office doing? You had to speak to the suppliers in the last three days. You knew where the supply was coming from. Get in touch with the suppliers. We cannot help you at every moment," the court told the Delhi government.Meanwhile, Arvind Kejriwal also wrote to the chief ministers of all states and Union territories seeking support in meeting the oxygen demand in the city. “I am writing to all CMs requesting them to provide oxygen to Delhi if they have spare. Though Central govt. is also helping us, the severity of corona is such that all available resources are proving inadequate,” Kejriwal tweeted.Arvind Kejriwal pointed to the unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases in the last few days and told states that the city does not produce any oxygen, following which many hospitals in the city are facing an acute shortage. “Daily supplies of oxygen to Delhi are woefully short of our requirements,” he said in the letter, according to his office.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-given-more-oxygen-than-they-asked-upto-aap-govt-to-rationalise-harsh-vardhan-101619278415820.html

The stock would be allocated as per the functional beds in the hospitals.Officials of Sable Hospital located in Bhosari said they did not receive any such message about collecting the drug.Sandeep Pisal, administrator at the hospital, said, “We have a system through which we get daily messages regarding oxygen availability, Remdesivir and bed availability. We got one stock on April 19 and then another one is coming on Sunday.” The hospital had 16 injections allocated on April 20.Ayush Prasad, Zilla Parishad chief executive officer (CEO), has asked all the concerned officers to seek a written reply from all these hospitals. He said, “I have passed the list of such hospitals to the officers and asked them to look into the issue. These hospitals have not procured their Remdesivir vials to date.”“I have asked them to check whether these hospitals are functioning or not. If those are working then they should be directed to collect the stock from the concerned distributor/stockist,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/31-hospitals-in-pune-district-fail-to-procure-allotted-remdesivir-vials-101619278860643.html
24-04-2021||Pune||Pune police introduce e-passes for inter-district travel, commuters caught unaware||On Friday, the Pune police reintroduced the e-pass system, which was in existence last year during lockdown for travel outside the district limits. Despite the mechanism available for digital passes for inter-district travel in Maharashtra, many commuters were caught unaware of the fresh norms on the first-day. The police stopped a large number of commuters without passes on Friday. The Pune police set up the ‘digital pass cell’ at the police commissioner’s office for smooth and genuine travel outside Pune district. Commuters who wish to travel out of district can apply for a digital pass on Maharashtra police’s website: covid19.mhpolice.in “I didn’t know that Pune police have started an e-pass system. I only knew there are restrictions and those wanting to travel for emergency purpose are allowed. When I started travel, I was stopped by police on Ahmednagar Road and they explained to me the new rule,” said Bhavesh Jain, a resident of Kharadi, who was planning to visit Aurangabad by road. There was another passenger Ravindra Tidke planning to visit Kolhapur by road when he was stopped by police at Katraj exit point and asked about e-pass. “We have deployed one police inspector, two assistant police inspectors and 20 police constables at the cell. Today until 6 pm, a total of 2,077 people have applied for the passes of which 286 citizens have been issued digital passes. 375 citizens have been denied due to lack of required documents,” informed Amitabh Gupta, commissioner of police. Things to remember: 1) Citizens involved in essential services, facilities and goods do not need a digital pass. They can travel by showing their official identity card at the checkpoints. 2) People can get digital pass if they are going to attend funeral or serious illness of a close person (mother / father / brother / sister / cousin / cousin / mother-in-law / sister-in-law), marriage, hospitalisation. It is mandatory to submit the required documents online. 3) Officers and employees working in essential services should carry their official identity card with them. 4) E-pass or digital passes will be given to the bride and groom, their parents, brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts for the wedding ceremony. But for this, it is necessary to attach the wedding card. 5) Permission will not be granted for business reasons. 6) Digital passes will be issued to citizens traveling by air.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-police-introduce-e-passes-for-inter-district-travel-commuters-caught-unaware-101619278440590.html

24-04-2021||Pune||Your Space: Vax for all above age of 18||The Prime Minister Narendra Modi government has decided to bring all above the age of 18 under the vaccination drive, from May 1. What steps should the administration take in such short span of time to put in place adequate manpower and machinery to cover the record population? It is a welcome step The Centre’s move to make Covid-19 vaccination available for all above the age of 18 is a commendable step. It drive will benefit the young generation and middle-aged. The central government should decentralise the campaign so that everyone get the jab. The spaces that are currently empty, such as schools, colleges and corporate offices can be utilised for setting up vaccination booths. Decentralisation will ease the pressure on hospitals, dispensaries, labs and government spaces. The authorities can utilise the data of students and ask them to visit their college with ID to get vaccinated. Since schools are closed, the middle-aged can visit a nearby school with their ID for inoculation. Those who have returned to their hometown can register for vaccination at the nearest available centre. Public awareness campaigns will also encourage beneficiaries to get registered for vaccination. Owners of schools/colleges/corporate offices can be motivated to make their spaces available for vaccination. The government can develop an app/website for registration and allotting preferred/nearby centres for beneficiaries.Rajas Pathak Use workplaces as vax centresI think the government should have taken the decision earlier. The steps that the administration can now take for speedy vaccination are instead of asking people to come to the vaccination centre, the authorities can launch a doorstep inoculation campaign at workplace to avoid crowd and maintain discipline. Teachers will get vaccine at their school, engineers at their work floor and company campus. Secondly, hold awareness campaigns using social media, digital influencers or rickshaws (with speakers) to instil public confidence in vaccination. Design strong and user-friendly web portal for booking slots, for any queries regarding vaccine, and regular communication regarding second dose by SMS or email.Abhijeet EkadEnsure adequate supply of vaccineI feel that the vaccination drive is going quite well, but the only problem that needs to be solved is communication gap. Most of the time, the vaccines are not coming and authorities don’t know when it will arrive (that’s what they claim). They aren’t sure whether the vaccines will be delivered the day after or not. It should be clear so that they can plan accordingly and reduce problems that people face. And talking about the public’s response, I feel college students like me should take a back seat and let the older population in their 30s and 40s take the vaccine first. As they have families to care, many being the breadwinner, and the age factor. Moreover, not all senior citizens have yet taken the vaccines or their second dose and inconsistent supply of vaccines is adding to the problem.Nisarg PawadeEfficient administration, portal mustWe are facing a shortage of healthcare staff skilled for vaccination. So, to utilise them with minimum stress, we need an efficient administration and proper use of Co-WIN portal. A person needing a vaccine will apply on the portal and he/she will get an appointment. At the vaccination centre, after confirming the identity, the person should get vaccine promptly to avoid delay and possible crowd. Later, the beneficiary should get timely information about the post-vaccination precautions. The vaccination centre should function in a way that the Covid precaution measures are strictly followed, including keeping entry and exit different. Dhruv Dhakane Clear misconceptions about vaccinesMany misconceptions are making rounds regarding the vaccination even now, especially in rural areas. The central and state governments need to address the misinformation and can rope in social groups and NGOs. Door-to-door vaccination drive can be carried out in rural parts as less manpower is needed because of the thin population in villages. Maruti Gaikwad State machinery adept to vax allI think most state governments have the machinery to implement vaccination programme. For example, Maharashtra is already supplying four lakh doses a day, which means the Centre must at this stage ensure adequate vaccine doses are provided to states and the formula of such allotment of doses to states must be in a transparent manner. The central government must also allow state governments to conduct door-to-door vaccination drive to meet the ambitious target. And, the authorities must also provide logistical and administrative support for such doorstep campaigns.Bhargav Bhamidipati||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/your-space-vax-for-all-above-age-of-18-101619275500484.html

After loading four containers of cryogenic oxygen tanks, it will depart Singapore and land at Panagarh air base in West Bengal and offload these containers by this evening,” stated PIB press release.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/oxygen-express-reaches-nashik-iaf-ferries-empty-containers-from-pune-to-jamnagar-for-refill-101619272680292.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||With declining bed availability, fear looms over J&K hospitals||As states across India witness a surge in Covid cases, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has maintained that there is enough oxygen available in case of a potential health emergency in the Union Territory. “No one shall die of oxygen unavailability here and there is absolutely no need for people to panic,” Rajan Prakash Thakur, the principal secretary, industries and commerce, said on April 20. However, on the ground, even records of the J&K government don’t seem to agree with the not-to-panic message.Also read: Weekend curfew in Jammu and Kashmir from tonight 8pm to Monday 6amWith incremental increase in Covid patient admissions to Jammu and Kashmir hospitals, the healthcare infrastructure of the erstwhile state is still the same as it was six months earlier when the country was struggling with the first wave. While the J&K government’s daily media bulletin claims to have 244 ICU beds available, a five-month-old similar media bulletin of November 21, 2020, shows 284 ICU beds being available, which is 40 more than what is available at present. All this depicts that there has not been much of an addition in making more ICU beds available in the UT. Rising cases, declining bed availability Following the trend of the country, there has been a daily exponential rise of cases from 991 on April 12 to 1,965 on April 22. The rise in cases is, therefore, showing an impact on the limited bed availability and an analysis of the data provided by the government is alarming. A look at the inflow and bed occupancy at J&K hospitals shows a rapidly declining figure of bed availability in Kashmir. On April 17, the total available beds were 1,979 out of 2,620 Covid-dedicated beds, which means 75% of the beds were unoccupied. On April 22, this availability figure receded to 1,592. This time, the bed availability fell to 62.8%, meaning a 12.2% decrease in just five days. So, with a total of 387 beds getting occupied over five days, meaning more than 70 beds a day, at such continuing trend it would not take more than 20 to 23 days for the UT to run out of beds. Increase beds on a war-footing The president of the doctor’s association in Kashmir, Dr Suhail Naik, says. “We are still left with more than 60% beds but considering the number of patients getting hospitalised, the situation is critical. We got a boost in healthcare infrastructure last year and it’s because of that alone that we are surviving such a rush. Considering the situation today, it’s imperative for the UT administration to increase beds. We are heading towards a catastrophe and people are unaware of it,” Naik said, advocating an increase in oxygen bed availability on a war-footing. “Oxygen is the only drug of choice that Covid demands,” he said, adding that the administration was lax on enforcing the protocol. “When the country was gasping for oxygen, the administration was busy conducting tourist events instead of imposing the protocol,” he added. Tourists contributing to spike Naik said people need to behave responsibly given the fragile health system that can’t take the brunt Delhi is facing. “If the spike does not decrease in the UT, we will be left with no beds in a few weeks,” he said, seeking a ban on tourist gatherings. With the onset of the second wave, 1,050 of the 4,519 people who tested positive in March were travellers. This means 23% of Covid cases in J&K were travellers. In April, of the 21,482 positive cases so far, 4,390 were travellers. The inflow of tourists has been rising in the UT despite contributing more than 20% to Covid cases for two months. Recovery rate not more than 70% Dr Naveed Nazir Shah, the head of the department of Kashmir’s Chest Disease Hospital, said that the situation in the Valley is fragile. The hospital, which is the top Covid facility in J&K, is struggling with the rush of patients with more than 90% of its beds occupied. “If the spike comes to a halt, we may get a breather to plan things. Right now, the statistic recovery rate is not more than 70% unlike 98% in the past, given the huge detection of cases,” he said. Vaccination should be ramped up and people should follow Covid-appropriate behaviour strictly. “The recovery rate is lesser this time because there is a huge rush of admissions, and few are getting discharged as compared to it. If the rise of cases stops, we will have a better recovery rate. We will have more beds available. Our infrastructure is not feasible for the potential load that it may face in the coming days,” Dr Nazir said. “We definitely need more beds and this needs to be initiated from this moment,” he added. The director of health services, Kashmir, did not respond to repeated calls for a comment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/with-declining-bed-availability-fear-looms-over-j-k-hospitals-101619271720783.html

And for those poor people who can't afford it, the government will do it for them,” Ajit Pawar said, according to news agency ANI.“Remdesivir and vaccine supply will be streamlined only when the Centre allows import from outside. We are of the opinion that when vaccination starts we will try to purchase vaccines from India as much as possible but if the Centre allows and helps to import, it will be helpful. We will pay,” he added.Also read | Getting vaccinated in Thane. Check list of vaccination centresThe state has 57.1 million people in the 18-44 age group and will be vaccinated next in the country’s drive to battle the second, deadly wave of the pandemic. Officials have said Maharashtra will need more than 110 million vaccine doses for those under this age group and the government will have to procure them. They are apprehensive about the availability of doses and also about the high rates ascertained for the vaccines.Maharashtra’s health minister Rajesh Tope said on Friday that they demanded One Nation One Rate of the vaccine during the meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi “so we could easily implement the vaccination drive aggressively.” “Not only Maharashtra's, but most chief ministers who attended the video conference have also demanded this. The state has its own financial constraints, although we will bear the cost of inoculation for the poor. The reduction in rates will help us vaccinate more people for free, otherwise, we will have to restrict free inoculation to the poor. In that case, we will try and rope in corporate houses and the private sector,” Rajesh Tope added.Also read | Maharashtra expects hiccups in its 18+ vaccination driveThe state may not be able to achieve its target of aggressive inoculation in the absence of availability of stock, Tope also said. “The Serum Institute of India has expressed inability to supply the stock until May 24.

The decision over implementation of the third phase of inoculation and free vaccination for the poor based on the financial burden will be taken in the cabinet meeting,” he said.Also read | Steel plants in Maharashtra should divert oxygen for Covid patients: HCMaharashtra has said it has been facing a shortage of Covid-19 vaccines, which has put a brake on its aim of inoculating more than 600,000 people daily and has forced many centres in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and other parts of the state to shut down. The daily average of inoculation dropped to 291,961 over the last week, from 370,058 in the first week of the month. The state has so far received, 14,416,780 doses from the Centre till April 20, against which 13,980,023 doses have been administered to 12.17 million people till 5pm on Friday.As the western state, which is the worst hit in the country, has also been battling a shortage of oxygen, deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar said plants that were closed in Maharashtra have been restarted. “So far we used to get 240-250 MT of oxygen but now we got the information that it has been reduced to 125 MT. We request them (the Centre) to not reduce our 250 MT quota from Jamnagar,” he was quoted as saying by ANI.Maharashtra’s caseload rose to 41,61,676 and its death toll reached 63,252 on Friday as the state reported 66,836 cases of the coronavirus disease and 773 fatalities.

Officials of the premier hospital confirmed “admissions are open and [the] emergency department is functional” after some users on Twitter said that new admissions were not being allowed.Admissions were earlier restricted due to the oxygen pipelines being reorganised in the emergency department, according to the officials. “The admissions in the emergency were restricted for an hour as the oxygen pipelines were being reorganised due to increased requirement of oxygen for COVID-19 patients. Currently, around 100 coronavirus infected patients are already receiving treatment at the Emergency. This is in addition to more than 800 patients who are already admitted at various centres of AIIMS,” an official said.Also read | After PM Modi’s high-level meet, Centre waives off basic customs duty, health cess on oxygen, Covid-19 vaccines“#Breaking : AIIMS emergency closed due to low supply of Oxygen in Delhi,” one user tweeted on Saturday afternoon. Few other users of the social media platform also tweeted on similar lines, claiming that new restrictions were not being accepted in the hospital.Many hospitals in the country, including those in the national capital, have complained of a shortage of medical-grade oxygen due to the rising number of infections of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19). The second wave of the pandemic has caused a rapid increase in the number of active cases in the country which have burdened the hospitals, causing the demand for oxygen to swell.Watch | ‘Can’t let Covid enter villages’: PM Modi on vaccination drive in villagesEarlier in the day, Saroj Hospital in Delhi also announced it was not admitting new patients due to a shortage in oxygen, news agency ANI reported. “We are closing the admissions because of an oxygen shortage.

We have 70 patients who are in critical condition and need oxygen. If we do not get oxygen supply there could be a big disaster. We have started discharging patients.”Amid the ongoing crisis, the Centre on Saturday waived off the customs duty and health cess on the import of Covid-19 vaccines and medical grade oxygen for a period of three months effective immediately. The Centre’s decision followed a meeting convened by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the pandemic situation in the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/aiims-delhi-reopens-admissions-to-emergency-ward-after-halting-it-for-an-hour-101619271212580.html
24-04-2021||Delhi||Arvind Kejriwal writes to all CMs, requests them to send oxygen to Delhi ‘if they have spare’||Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Saturday wrote to his counterparts in other states and Union territories requesting them to send the surplus of oxygen they may have to the Capital as the city faces acute shortage to treat critically ill Covid-19 patients. “I am writing to all CMs requesting them to provide oxygen to Delhi, if they have spare. Though Central govt. is also helping us, the severity of corona is such that all available resources are proving inadequate,” he wrote on Twitter.I am writing to all CMs requesting them to provide oxygen to Delhi, if they have spare. Though Central govt. is also helping us, the severity of corona is such that all available resources are proving inadequate.The Delhi chief minister asked his counterparts from other states and UTs if they could provide the national capital with any oxygen, along with tankers, from their state or any organisation in their state, his office said in a statement. “He also wrote that due to the severe rise in COVID cases in the last few days, many Delhi hospitals had run out of oxygen,” it added.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here He informed the states that Delhi does not produce any oxygen and due to the unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases in the last few days, many hospitals in the city have run out of the critical element. “Daily supplies of oxygen to Delhi are woefully short of our requirements,” he claimed.Arvind Kejriwal’s plea comes on a day when as many as 20 patients at a hospital in Delhi’s Rohini died due to a shortage of oxygen and several others approved the high court informing about similar challenges.“We lost 20 patients almost all of whom were in critical care unit and on a high flow of oxygen. Our liquid medical oxygen was over by about 10 pm and then we switched over to the oxygen cylinders attached to the main gas pipeline. There was a drop in pressure and the patients could not survive,” said Dr Deep Baluja, medical director of the Jaipur Golden Hospital in Rohini.As hospitals reached the high court seeking its immediate intervention to save the lives of Covid-19 patients as their oxygen stock would last for 30 minutes to a couple of hours, the bench headed by justice Vipin Sanghi and justice Rekha Palli rapped the Delhi government for lacking action in arranging tankers for the transportation of liquid oxygen. "The problem is you think allocation is done so everything will be served at your doorstep but that's not how it works. After allocation have you made any effort for the tankers to collect oxygen?” the court asked.Kejriwal has already broached the issue of oxygen shortage with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who met the chief ministers of 11 worst-affected states and UTs on Friday. Kejriwal told PM Modi that the shortage of oxygen could lead to a “big tragedy”, and requested him to order states to not obstruct the passage of tankers. He, however, was criticised by Modi for publicly broadcasting the closed-door meeting.Delhi has been reporting an extreme shortage of oxygen for patients with scores of citizens and city hospitals taking to social media platforms seeking oxygen cylinders for Covid-19 positive patients both in hospitals as well as home isolation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/arvind-kejriwal-writes-to-all-cms-requests-them-to-send-oxygen-to-delhi-if-they-have-spare-101619269913300.html

The industrial district that shares its borders with Punjab and Haryana sees heavy movement of migrant labour daily. In the past week alone, Solan reported 1,437 cases. Also read: LIVE: Weekend curfew in Jammu and Kashmir from tonight 8pm to Monday 6am to curb Covid-19 spreadShimla is second with a positivity rate of 14.42% followed by Hamirpur at 13.22% and Sirmaur at 12.99%. Kangra, which is the worst hit district in terms of the number of Covid cases, has a positivity rate of 12.74%. The most populous district in the state has reported more than 2,000 Covid cases in just a week. The sudden spike has resulted in hospitals in the district being full to capacity. The district authorities are now working to ramp up the bed capacity by opening a new Covid Care Centre and seeking the help of private hospitals. Next on the list is the tribal district of Lahaul-Spiti with a positivity rate of 12.39%. The remote district witnessed a spike in cases this week. The infections were first noticed among migrant labourers and later spread to the local population who came in their contact. Last year, the district had seen a spurt in cases after the opening of Atal Tunnel. Other districts on the list of high positivity are Shimla at 12.1% and Kullu at 11.6%. Bilaspur, Kinnaur and Chamba are the only three districts with the positivity rate below 10%. Bilaspur has a positivity rate of 9.12%, Kinnaur 7.92% and Chamba 4.39%. Highest death rate in Shimla Shimla district has the highest case fatality ratio (CFR) of 2.4%. The district has recorded 315 deaths since the outbreak last March. Of them, 20 deaths have been reported in Shimla in the past week alone. More than 222 people have tested positive for Covid-19 since Friday evening. Sanjauli, New Shimla and Panthaghat are the new hotspots. The maximum of 19 cases were reported from New Shimla, 10 from Panthaghatti, eight from Sanjauli and nine from Chotta Shimla. Indira Gandhi Medical College and Hospital is full to capacity, while only 10 of the 90 beds are unoccupied at Deen Dayal Upadhyay Hospital in Shimla. “The rush of patients is increasing by the day. We are now taking over private hospitals and the government-run Ayurveda Hospital in Chotta Shimla to accommodate more cases,” Shimla chief medical officer Surekha Chopra said. Kangra, the biggest district in terms of population, has a CFR of 2.09%. The district has recorded 295 Covid deaths in all. The health authorities say the high death rate in Shimla and Kangra is because only these two districts have tertiary care centres: Indira Gandhi Medical College, Shimla, and Dr Rajendra Prasad Government Medical College, Tanda. Since critical patients are referred to these two health institutions from other districts, the toll remains high. Kullu, where a total of 90 people have died of Covid till date, has a CFR of 1.6%. Una has seen 94 fatalities and has a CFR of 1.5%. Mandi has recorded 154 deaths and has a CFR of 1.23%. 1,500 more beds, three oxygen plants coming up After reviewing the Covid situation, chief minister Jai Ram Thakur said that an additional 1,500 beds will be made available for Covid patients. Liquid oxygen plants will soon be functional in all three major medical colleges of the state, namely IGMC, Dr Rajendra Prasad Medical College, Tanda and the medical college at Nerchowk in Mandi district. He said people of the state coming from different parts of the country must stay in home isolation for at least a week to rule out any possibility of spreading the virus, in case they are infected.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/nine-of-12-districts-in-himachal-have-positivity-rate-above-10-101619266500563.html

24-04-2021||Delhi||‘This isn’t a wave, it’s a tsunami’: HC pulls up Delhi over Covid preparedness||The Delhi high court on Saturday asked the Centre and the Delhi government about their preparedness to deal with the peak of the second Covid wave expected by mid-May, terming the mounting cases a “tsunami” and warning that it will “hang any person” who tries to obstruct oxygen supplies to hospitals.Talking tough, a bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said this during a special three-hour hearing on the escalating crisis in city hospitals on a day when 20 patients died at Delhi’s Jaipur Golden Hospital for lack of oxygen. The bench asked both the Centre and the Delhi government to “interact and co-ordinate” with each other for ensuring adequate supply of oxygen.The Centre called the Delhi government a “cry baby” before the court and said it was the latter’s “incompetence” that led to the deaths of people. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, representing the Centre, asked the Delhi government to manage the procurement and distributions of oxygen on their own and not depend on the Centre for everything.Mehta said the state governments were responsible for the transportation of the oxygen from various sources and the Delhi government had to do it on its own.“So far we have ensured that nobody in the country was left without oxygen. States and Union territories which do not have industries have also arranged for tanks but the Delhi government has yet not coordinated with the suppliers,” Mehta said.The bench questioned the Delhi government over its citing of the shortage of cryogenic tankers to procure oxygen from Durgapur, Rourkela and Kalinganagar.“We make it clear that the efforts the GNCTD (government of the national capital territory of Delhi) has to make in this regard cannot be trivialised, and they should not leave it entirely to the central government to act in this regard,” the court recorded in its order while directing the Delhi government to arrange tankers and other logistics for timely procurement of oxygen.“Citizens cannot be allowed to die like this… In case cryogenic tanks are less in supply, we are hopeful that the Centre may work this out in coordination with the GNCTD, who cannot leave it completely on the Centre,” it said.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, said the city government did not have enough cryogenic tankers because Delhi is not an industrial state.“We got 309 metric tonnes yesterday as against the 480 MT allocated by the Centre. It’s a chaotic situation with disorderly function. Some incidents are bound to happen. We fear we will lose many people... human lives are being lost every day,” Mehra said.During the proceedings, four city hospitals — including Jaipur Golden, where the tragedy took place a few hours ago — complained that there was nobody to coordinate with them on oxygen and essential medicine supplies.“We have already lost 20 lives. We are literally gasping for breath and pleading. The cases are slipping out of our hand. We are trying to ask every authority but to no avail,” senior advocate Sachin Datta for Jaipur Golden said.The bench expressed concern over this as Mehra informed the court that the Delhi government had constituted a team of officers to coordinate with hospitals. As Mehra said the government was not getting information about the quantity of oxygen supplied from suppliers and re-fillers, the court directed the suppliers and re-fillers to give all such information to the city government.During the hearing, the court also directed the Centre and the Delhi government to submit their plans on preparedness after it cited a report by IIT Kanpur predicting that the peak of cases would be hit in mid-May.Mehta told the court that this was being considered and the country had to be prepared for the worst. He said steps had been taken to streamline the passage of oxygen and a strong message had been given to the suppliers in this regard by the top leadership.The court also suggested providing Delhi Police security to hospitals as patients were being discharged from there due to the lack of oxygen supply.“Let’s face the reality. If admissions aren’t being made, we know how people react. We don’t want a law-and-order situation. If riots break out at hospitals, what will happen? There are deaths taking place,” it said.The matter will now be heard on Monday, April 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/this-isn-t-a-wave-it-s-a-tsunami-hc-pulls-up-delhi-over-covid-preparedness-101619263626242.html

Photos and videos of the party at Three Palm Resorts, 6km from Bathinda on the highway to Amritsar, are being shared widely on social media. They show the Congress leaders, including senior deputy mayor Ashok Pradhan set to dine together.

He confirmed that the photos were of Friday’s event. “It was a social meeting of a small group of Congress councillors to celebrate party leaders joining top offices of the Bathinda municipal corporation. You should contact Sandeep for details,” he said. Denying that he hosted the event, Sandeep said Covid guidelines were followed by the attendees. The photos show that the attendees were neither wearing masks nor maintaining social distancing. “I briefly stayed at the resort and there was no party. No women, including my wife, was present at the casual get-together,” he said. Sandeep, a liquor contractor of the city, is known for his proximity with local Congress legislator and finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal.

Different rules for different people Taking prompt action, the local police arrested eight people for hosting a pre-wedding function at Bathinda’s elite Civil Lines Club on Wednesday. But when 40 cars and motorcycles were reported at the resort on Friday, the police chose to overlook the information. Gates were closed from inside and lights of the sprawling lawns and the reception areas were shut off after journalists gathered outside the resort. Following queries of journalists, the police sent a raiding party but it left without initiating any action. Bathinda range inspector general of police (IGP) Jaskaran Singh and senior superintendent of police (SSP) BS Virk did not respond to the phone calls. An attempt to reach the chief minister, chief secretary, director general police and state police administration via their official Twitter handles did not elicit any response.

24-04-2021||Kolkata||Kolkata civic body urges RWAs to set up safe homes for Covid-19 patients||The Kolkata Municipal Corporation (KMC) has urged resident welfare associations of large complexes and high-rise societies in the city to set up their own safe homes to isolate Covid-19 positive patients.“High-rises societies and large housing complexes have been asked to turn their community halls into safe homes with an adequate number of beds, requisite supply of oxygen and other paraphernalia in line with Covid-19 protocols,” said a senior official of the civic body. While West Bengal reported 12,876 new Covid-19 cases on Friday, at least one out of every four patients was registered in Kolkata. The city has nearly 19,000 active cases. “When the first wave of Covid-19 hit in 2020, a significant portion of the cases came from large housing complexes. This time too we apprehend that they could become hotspots of Covid-19 and hence such advisories have been sent out,” said another official. The state government came up with the concept of safe homes with beds, oxygen facility and telemedicine facilities in 2020 to free up hospital beds. There are around 200 state-run safe homes in West Bengal, concentrated mostly in Kolkata, with more than 11,000 beds where non-critical patients, who need treatment, could be kept in isolation. The KMC has also started procuring oxygen concentrators to meet the shortage of medical oxygen. “I have already advised the KMC to immediately place the order for 100 oxygen concentrators. We would procure up to 500 as the demand rises,” said Firhad Hakim, state urban development minister. On Friday West Bengal chief minister Mamata Banerjee alleged that the Union government was diverting the state’s quota of medical oxygen to Uttar Pradesh. “As per the current patient load and rising trend of infections, it is expected that the consumption level of oxygen in the state will radically rise to roughly 450 MT per day in the next couple of weeks. Hence present allocation of liquid oxygen to outside West Bengal will jeopardize the treatment of Covid-19 patients. The state government has accordingly requested the centre to consider the need of the state and not to divert the medical oxygen available in the state to elsewhere,” said a statement released by the state government on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/kolkata-news/kolkata-civic-body-urges-rwas-to-set-up-safe-homes-for-covid-19-patients-101619261220367.html
24-04-2021||Pune||Startup mantra: Preventive care for the brain, AI-driven||Rajesh Kumar Purushottam and Dr Latha Poonamallee, the founders of InMed Prognostics, developed NeuroShield, an artificial intelligence (AI) software which can diagnose as well as predict the onset of neurological disorders. The cloud- based clinical decision support tool helps neuro-radiologists, neuro-physicians, psychiatrists and general physicians better understand the brain effects of different conditions by utilising 3D MRI images to their fullest, extracting data and providing volumetric analysis for the brain and its various structures.Rajesh Kumar Purushottam hails from Goa and has done his BE in Industrial Engineering and an MBA. He started his career as a shop-floor engineer after he joined Thermax in Pune as a trainee in 1993. Thereafter he has worked in several multinational companies like KPIT Infosystems, Motorola, GE Capital International Services, Motorola India, John Deere India and Vedanta group. Latha Poonamallee did her BA and MA from University of Madras and MBA from Pondicherry University. She did her PhD from Case Wetern Reserve University in Ohio. She joined the university as a senior lecturer and is presently working at the New School in New York as an associate professor. Dinner table conversation has a startup idea as its entreePurushottam founded a health informatics company Statim Healthcare in 2013, which provided teleradiology services to hospitals. Although Purushottam is in the process of exiting the startup, that exposure led him to the particular area of artificial intelligence in radiology. Says Purushottam: “I met Latha and her husband, Dr Al Curran, in 2017 in the US. A dinner table conversation was converted into an idea for a startup.”Recalling the early days, Poonamallee says, “We have been friends for over 20 years. A few years back, Rajesh helped me arrange some meetings in Bengaluru for my university students. While we were chatting then, I told Rajesh that the services business is value capturing. Why don’t do you do something in value creation like a product business? After that, when Rajesh was visiting me in the US with his family, he came up with this idea and proposed to start InMed Prognostics.”Why neurological disorders?Says Poonamallee, “When you are looking at the product market and product creation in radiology, the brain is the final frontier. One of our goals is to bring the brain into the preventative space. We undergo tests for heart ailments, blood pressure or diabetes, but there is nothing to do for brain. Also, there are no existing comparable tools to that we have outside of the white people’s population. We wanted to bring state-of-the-art tools that are affordable, accessible and reliable, and evidence-based to other populations also. We call it design justice. There is stigma associated with and also a lack of awareness about these disorders being preventative. We have done research and presented in Europe about our tools and predictive models predicting early dementia even in the 30s.”Early adoptersSays Purushottam, “A few years back there was misunderstanding that AI can replace radiologists, but we don’t frame it like that at all. We only support clinical decision making. We don’t provide diagnosis. We only provide additional and accurate information that saves times for the physician, radiologist, neurologists and neurosurgeon, to be more effective.”“Our earliest adopters and supporters were neurologist Dr Rahul Kulkarni from the Deenanath Mangeshkar Hospital and paediatric neurologist Dr Deepa Divekar from Sahyadri Hospital. They helped me understand the local market and what they are really struggling with. We are also working with Dr Deepak Agarwal and the All-India Institute Medical sciences (AIIMS). He is on our scientific advisory board. Dr Ram Mohan Vadapalli from Vijaya Diagnostics in Hyderabad, one of renowned radiologists in the country, is also associated with us. Hospitals are buying our product. Our adoption rate is increasing partly because we have worked a lot with these physicians,” Purushottam claims.Data securityExplaining the data security measures, Poonamallee said, “Our tool extracts the data, images from the client-side server to our cloud but completely strips all identifiable information. With 3D MRI it is easy to reconstruct the persons face and hence, we remove the identifiable information in a way that the face cannot be reconstructed. Along with the report we also provide a lot of data visualisation to the physician if they want to look at segmented portions.”MVP and approvalsInMed Prognostics has got Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) approval which is very important for using software as a medical device. Says Poonamallee, “We have the minimum viable product (MVP) ready registered on the Government E-marketplace (GeM). We are in discussion with a government hospital in Goa which will be our first government sector client.”Accuracy and challenges in adoptionSays Purushottam, “AI in healthcare is not very common and that is the biggest challenge we have in adoption. We have done about 1,200 healthy controls and we got a DST funding for that from Birac, basically to create what we call as an Indian brain template. We are at a 90 per cent accuracy level. We use the convolutional neural network which is a very advanced way of deep learning so that as your healthy control data improves the predictive accuracy keeps increasing.”“With the help of AI, we can co-relate a lot of researches already based on it. To aid that kind of a decision support framework, the decision tree actually mimics the decision making of a clinician. For that we have to capture the inter-operator variability. Evidence creates transparency and accountability, so we also map the clinical setting and then look at the contextual evidence so that it can lead to a certain outcome. We have a customer success team which is always monitoring the product performance,” Purushottam explains.Tie-ups and adoption strategyInMed Prognostics has a pan-India presence with tie-ups with almost all major hospitals in the states like Delhi, Goa, Kerala, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh. Elaborating on their strategy, Purushottam says, “We go to the oldest diagnostic centre in the state capital which becomes a reference point and they refer us to the neurophysician or neurologist – the point of prescription and further a point of sale. We developed and trademarked Neuroshield as a brand which made it easy for doctors to recall it. It is in written in the prescription so that specific sequence or setting is taken at the time when the patient shows the requisition at the diagnostics centre and the charges are also collected. This way we also justify an additional payout for the customer in the range of ₹2,500 to Rs3000 at the diagnostic centre.”Funding Says Poonamallee, “Birac gave us a ₹50 lakh grant and offered a ₹1 crore investment that didn’t come to pass for multiple reasons. From friends and family, we have raised ₹3.5 crores so far. Currently we are in process of doing another ₹3.5 crore seed round with institutional investors.”Role of GE healthcare accelerator and venture centre incubatorInMed Prognostics was incubated at the Venture Centre at the NCL Innovation Park in Pune. “Venture Centre has been extremely instrumental in providing us a great ecosystem. They helped us get the Birac grant in terms of providing us legitimacy, good feedback on the market locally and understanding the system. Dr V Premnath has been very instrumental in helping us to strategically think through the technical challenges, how we make sure we get right sample, standardisation of data etc. GE Edison Healthcare platform is extraordinary gift and source of strength and technical expertise for us. We had amazing technical and business mentoring and integration with GE platforms and console. Our product is fairly OEM agnostic. They are going to be our sales channel partner in South Asia,” the founders explain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/startup-mantra-preventive-care-for-the-brain-aidriven-101619260982640.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police rolls back order on colour-coding of vehicles||Mumbai Police has withdrawn its decision of compulsory colour-coding for the vehicles plying in the city during the lockdown. As per people aware of the matter, the decision caused confusion and it did not serve the intended purpose, therefore the move was cancelled on Friday night.On Thursday alone the police had booked at least 57 motorists for flouting colour-code norms. Deputy commissioner of police (operation) Chaitanya Siriprolu on Friday night issued an order to all police stations in-charges across Mumbai, regional controls rooms, zonal police and other police units, declaring that the “colour code” order was cancelled. He instructed all police units not to take action against motorists for plying without colour-coded stickers. Director-General of Police, Sanjay Pandey, was also not happy with the mandatory colour-coding of vehicles for plying in Mumbai, the people cited above said.On April 17, Mumbai Police chief Hemant Nagrale introduced the new requirement of colour-coding of vehicles to keep a check on motorists coming out on roads for casual or trivial reasons and causing traffic jams amid the statewide lockdown.He issued the order after the entry-exit points at Dahisar, Mulund and Vashi, and some other parts of the city on severe traffic jams during the morning rush hour on April 17. The traffic jam had interrupted movements of ambulances and other essential service vehicles. Hence, to impose stricter restrictions on the movement of non-essential vehicles Nagrale introduced colour-coding.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-rolls-back-order-on-colour-coding-of-vehicles-101619260800302.html
24-04-2021||Dehradun||Chamoli avalanche: Army rescues 384 people working with BRO, 8 bodies recovered||Following the avalanche incident in the Niti Valley area of Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district near the India-China border on Friday, the Indian Army has rescued 384 people working with Border Roads Organisation (BRO) in its ongoing search and rescue operation. The army also and recovered at least eight bodies so far till Saturday noon.Informing about the ongoing rescue operation, the Army’s Central Command tweeted, “384 BRO persons or have been moved to safety while eight bodies trapped under the snow have been recovered from the two BRO camps in Sumna. Six critically injured have been evacuated for the required treatment. Air sorties are being attempted to assist medical evacuation.”As soon as the incident was reported to the army base in the area, it initiated the search and rescue operation braving extreme weather conditions till late night at 1.30.“Till 1.30 am, 291 BRO persons were brought to safety. The rescue operation had to be halted at night due to weather conditions,” stated the Army Central Command on Twitter.According to the BRO, the avalanche occurred on Friday at around 4 pm and had hit one of its camp in the Sumna area in the very remote area near the India-China border at an altitude of over 11,000 ft. Most of the trapped people were the labourers working under it for the construction of roads there.Earlier in the day, chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat conducted an aerial inspection of the avalanche-hit area to monitor the situation.Rawat said, “As per the information received from the BRO, about 400 people got trapped in the avalanche in remote Sumna area. So far about 385 have been rescued by the army which is carrying out the rescue operation with all their efforts in the difficult conditions.”“Some casualties have also been reported from there. Meanwhile, to assist the Army in the rescue operation, teams from the National Disaster Response Force (NDRF), State Disaster Response Force (SDRF) and the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP) are also reaching there to speed up the rescue operation,” he said, adding that the Chamoli district administration is also providing all possible help in it.Meanwhile, informing more about the area of the incident, prominent geologist and director of Uttarakhand Space Application Centre, MPS Bisht said, “According to the satellite images, the incident happened in the upper Sumna area near Rimkhim Nala due to heavy snowfall in the past few days.”“The place is approximately 25 kms upstream from Malari village in the tributary of Girthi Ganga river there,” said Bisht adding that, “In 1991-92 also an avalanche took place in Sumna area which had hit the ITBP camp there. At that time, 11 ITBP jawans had died.”The BRO, through its official Twitter handle, informed, “The Malari-Sumna road in the area has been extensively damaged due to multiple landslides. BRO teams have swung into action at different locations to clear the debris with dozers and blasting efforts.”Earlier on Friday night after receiving information about the incident, CM Rawat had “given the order to stop the work during the night in NTPC and other projects so that no untoward incident occurs”. Niti Valley is a remote valley near the India-China border located at a height of over 11, 800 ft. The Niti Valley Pass had been an ancient trade route between India and Tibet but the same was sealed after the 1962 Sino-Indian War. This is the second such incident in Chamoli district after February 7 when breakage of a glacier in Tapovan area led to flash floods and wreaked havoc downstream. Of the initial 204 people missing in the Chamoli disaster, search and rescue workers have so far recovered 79 bodies while 125 are still missing. The glacier breakage, snow avalanche and rockfall caused flash floods damaging two under-construction hydel power projects - Rishi Ganga and NTPC’s Tapovan. Water flowed over the dams with muck and debris, also entering dam tunnels. In Uttarakhand, there are around 1,000 to 1,400 glaciers. Coupled with extreme local weather events and changes in terrain, these glaciers can lead to lake outbursts or lake formation due to the rockfall or landslides in the valleys or on slopes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/chamoli-avalanche-army-rescues-384-people-working-with-bro-8-bodies-recovered-101619260380303.html

24-04-2021||Mumbai||'Nobody above law': NCP, Shiv Sena on CBI action against Anil Deshmukh||With the CBI conducting searches at the premises of former Maharashtra minister Anil Deshmukh, the NCP on Saturday said nobody was above the law, but added that the truth behind the "political conspiracy" against him and the state government would come out through the high court-ordered probe.Talking to reporters, NCP spokesperson and Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik said, "Nobody is above the law. Anil Deshmukh is cooperating with the agencies."He said he was not aware if any FIR has been registered against Deshmukh.The National Investigation Agency (NIA) is yet to reveal for whom suspended police officer Sachin Waze was working when he planted explosives outside industrialist Mukesh Ambani's residence, Malik said."What was the role of former Mumbai police commissioner (Param Bir Singh) in the case. All these actions are taking place based on the ex-commissioner's letter," he alleged."This is nothing but misuse of power to malign the state government and Anil Deshmukh. We have full faith in the judiciary and know that the truth behind the political conspiracy will be exposed through the probe," he said.The CBI on Saturday conducted searches at Deshmukh's premises in Mumbai and his hometown Nagpur after registering a case against him in connection with allegations of corruption levelled against him by Param Bir Singh.Deshmukh, an NCP leader, had resigned as a minister earlier this month after the high court asked the CBI to probe the allegations against him.Meanwhile, Shiv Sena leader Sanjay Raut also said that nobody was above the law."It is not correct to comment on CBI's action. Anil Deshmukh had already given his statement in the case. CBI is doing its work, similarly high court and the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government are doing their own work," he said."If there is a political agenda in the case against Anil Deshmukh, then the MVA government will take a stand. Hope the action against Deshmukh is restricted to directives of the high court," he said.On March 25, Param Bir Singh had filed a criminal public interest litigation seeking a CBI probe against Deshmukh, who, he claimed, had asked police officers, including suspended cop Sachin Waze, to extort ₹100 crore from bars and restaurants.The Shiv Sena, NCP and Congress share power in Maharashtra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/nobody-above-law-ncp-shiv-sena-on-cbi-action-against-anil-deshmukh-101619255441588.html

An IPS officer will head each shift.IPS officers Jainarayan, Anshuman Bhomia, Dr Ravi, Satyendra Singh are among the 20 officers who will run the control room, the spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/jaipur-news/rajasthan-govt-s-24x7-control-room-set-up-to-tackle-covid-19-crisis-101619255589601.html
24-04-2021||Bangalore||Karnataka asked to impose stringent restrictions by Covid advisory panel||With Bengaluru recording 1.5 lakh active coronavirus cases, the highest for any city in the country, the Karnataka Task Advisory Committee on COVID- 19 has asked the state government to impose stringent restrictions, including lockdown for 14 days to break the chain. The members of the panel have also recommended to the government to increase the number of beds to tide over the crisis. The TAC members also foresee the third wave COVID in October-November and have, accordingly, insisted that the government should complete the vaccination of vulnerable age groups before the next wave hits. Professor and Head of Lifecourse Epidemiology, Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), Giridhar Babu told PTI: "I have on record said that there are two main strategies. Firstly, we need to reduce the number of cases and that will happen only by a stringent lockdown for at least 14 days. Secondly, we should expand the bed capacity by taking as much as possible beds from all the private medical colleges, nursing homes and hospitals." According to him, the 14 days lockdown will reduce the number of infections. The TAC member said the state may witness the peak of the second wave by the May end or the first week of June. Eminent cardiologist and director of the Sri Jayadeva Institute of Cardiovascular Sciences and Research, C N Manjunath said he had in November 2020 predicted the arrival of the second wave of COVID in March or April based on the pattern of spread and resurgence in Europe. While the COVID cases may come down by May end or the first week of June, people's behaviour for the next six to nine months will hold the key. "The most important is when the cases come down, guards should not be let down. Facemask wearing and physical distancing should continue while most importantly congregation should be banned," he told PTI. The health experts were of the opinion that the healthcare system is totally suffocated. "In the first phase, the cases were coming in a staggered manner. So the daily rise in a particular state was 200 to 300 cases. Now it's in thousands," the cardiologist said. Giridhar Babu too concurred with him. "The BBMP (Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike) has informed the high court that there are no more ICU beds. So, the court has also said the situation is very scary. That will summarise the current status," Babu explained. Both were unanimous that the vaccination drive should be completed by October before the possible third wave hits the nation. "Vaccination should go on. By October- November the entire country should be vaccinated. Otherwise, we are in for a rude shock again," Manjunath said. Meanwhile, the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike Chief Commissioner Gaurav Gupta said the officials at the civic agency's COVID war room are working over time. On the shortage of oxygen and essential drugs such as Remdesivir, the Chief Commissioner told the news agency that the whole country was grappling with it and the Centre and the state are dealing with it in an effective manner. To a query on the need for more ICU beds, he said already a few have been arranged and more have to be procured very soon. With 26,962 infections on Friday, the state touched the highest single-day spike in COVID cases. There were 190 deaths too. More alarming was that the active cases in the state crossed two lakh mark of which 1.5 lakh are in Bengaluru alone. Chief Minister B S Yediyurappa had during a video conference told the PM that the state needs about 1,500 tonnes of oxygen and two lakh vials of Remdesivir. To contain the alarming rise in COVID cases, the state has imposed night curfew and weekend curfews while ordering closure of many shops and business establishments.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/karnataka-asked-to-impose-stringent-restrictions-by-covid-advisory-panel-101619255331837.html

The team took over and escorted the tanker through the shortest possible route.The tanker finally reached GTBH within an hour of dispatch through a green corridor.The hospital administration thanked DCP Shahdara and his team profusely for timely help which saved 700 lives at stake, said police in a media release.Over the last few days, several hospitals have repeatedly flagging acute shortages in oxygen supply.The highest single-day death toll was recorded on Friday in Delhi, with 348 deaths and 24,331 fresh cases.There are now 92029 active Covid-19 cases in the city while the death toll has mounted to 13,541.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/covid19-speedy-transportation-of-oxygen-by-delhi-police-saves-lives-in-gtb-hospital-101619253832630.html
24-04-2021||Other||Maoists kill Chhattisgarh Police sub-inspector in captivity on kangaroo court’s orders||Maoists have killed a police sub-inspector known for his role in anti-Maoist operations on a kangaroo court’s orders days after abducting him while he was on his way to meet his ailing mother in Chhattisgarh’s Bijapur district on Wednesday, an officer said on Saturday, amid a spike in violence in the Left-wing insurgency-hit state this month.Bijapur police superintendent Kamlochan Kashyap said a Maoist janadalat (kangaroo court) ordered Murli Tati’s killing even as a search was on to rescue him. “The Maoists dumped Murli’s body near a village at Gangalur in Bijapur district along with a note that Tati was ‘executed as decided by a people’s court’,” said Kashyap. He called Tati one of the most important fighters in anti-Maoist operations in the Bijapur district. “We have launched a hunt for the Maoists and a combing operation in a jungle is going on.”Tati was abducted a day after Maoist commander Kosa Handa, who carried a reward of ₹five lakh on his head, was killed in a five-hour firefight with security forces in Chhattisgarh’s Dantewada. Handa had been an active Maoist for 15 years and was their Malangir area committee member and “military intelligence” in charge. He faced at least 15 cases and a 9 mm pistol, a country-made gun, three kg improvised explosive device, medicines, and items of daily use were recovered from the gunbattle scene.Around a dozen Maoists earlier abducted two people, including a 15-year-old boy, and murdered them with sharp-edged weapons after branding them as police informers in the neighbouring Sukma district. Maoists dragged out the two from their homes and took them to a nearby forest, where their bodies were later recovered. A pamphlet recovered along with the bodies claimed the two worked as police informers and were “hence punished”. The brother of one of the two joined the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) a year back. The father of the other left his job as an assistant police constable after the Maoists threatened him last year, police said.Twenty-two police and paramilitary personnel were killed and at least two dozen others injured in a gunfight with Maoists in Chhattisgarh’s Bastar region on April 3. The Maoists ambushed the forces after possibly luring them to an area near the Bijapur-Sukma border.A commando of the CRPF taken captive after the April 3 gunfight was released days later.The toll from the April 3 gunbattle was the worst for security forces battling Maoists since 2017 when 25 jawans were killed in an attack. Seventeen personnel from a commando patrol were killed in an attack by more than 300 armed Maoists in Chhattisgarh in March last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maoists-kill-chhattisgarh-police-sub-inspector-in-captivity-on-kangaroo-court-s-orders-101619253419850.html

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Six patients die at Amritsar private hospital due to shortage of oxygen||Six critically ill patients died at a private hospital in Punjab’s Amritsar due to a shortage of oxygen on Saturday morning. The hospital authorities blamed the district administration for the first such incident in Punjab, saying they prioritised government hospitals in ensuring oxygen supply, amid the second Covid-19 wave that has led to a surge in infections and overwhelmed hospitals.The wave has sparked a shortage of critical supplies such as oxygen and medicines. Oxygen is a critical medical intervention against Covid-19, which causes respiratory distress in some cases. The pandemic has accelerated the global demand for it.“The district administration bought oxygen cylinders from suppliers for government hospitals. It is responsible for the [oxygen] shortage in private hospitals,” said Sunil Devgan, the managing director of Neelkanth Hospital, where the six died. He added they had informed the families of the patients about the limited stock of oxygen. “We urged them to shift their patients to another hospital, but they declined the option.”Amritsar deputy commissioner Gurpreet Singh Khaira said they held a meeting with owners of private hospitals on Friday about the oxygen supply and that is when the Neelkanth authorities informed them about the shortage. “We told private hospitals not to admit any critical patient or those who need oxygen if they have shortage as we could arrange only a few cylinders for GMCH [Government Medical College Hospital], where more patients are admitted. Private hospitals are responsible for arranging the required number of [oxygen] cylinders. If Neelkanth Hospital was short of supply, they should have referred the patients to other hospitals,” he said.“Due to the shortage of [oxygen] cylinders in the district [Amritsar], oxygen supply at Neelkanth Hospital dried up this morning, resulting in the death of six patients on the spot. Of the dead, two were from Gurdaspur district, one from Tarn Taran, and three from Amritsar district. All six patients were in a critical condition when they were admitted to the hospital on Thursday.”Amritsar civil surgeon Charanjit Singh promised an inquiry and said they will ensure no such incident happens in the future.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-patients-die-at-amritsar-private-hospital-due-to-shortage-of-oxygen-101619249399821.html

Election authorities found D’Silva, who is a candidate for the municipal polls in Margao in South Goa, was found moving around, campaigning, soliciting votes. When he was stopped and questioned about his moving around despite being Covid-positive he “left from the scene.”A case has now been registered against D’Silva who is not associated with any of the panels sponsored by the political parties and has contested as an independent cadidate. Voting was held on Friday in five municipal councils in Goa. Amid the raging pandemic, 66.70% of people came out to vote in the five municipal elections. The five municipal councils -- Mapusa, Margao, Mormugao, Quepem and Sanguem -- were to witness elections along with the other eleven councils in the state that went to the polls in March but the polls were delayed after the Bombay High Court at Goa asked the Goa government to ‘re do’ the reservations for failing to reserve the minimum number of seats for various groups like women, scheduled castes and others. “Reports from all five municipalities indicate @BJP4Goa supported Panel Candidates defeat is certain. Change has begun,” Leader of Opposition, Digambar Kamat tweeted. Besides the D’Silva case, the elections went smoothly with Covid-19 positive patients allowed to vote in the final hour of voting. The voting process has been overshadowed by the growing number of Covid-19 cases in the state which has now broken several records. Counting for the polls will be held on Monday April 26. The opposition sponsored candidates are hoping to better than the first rounds of councils where the BJP-backed candidates claimed victory in five of the six councils that went to the polls. However, the opposition is hoping for a better show this time around with the councils being represented by legislators from the opposition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/covid19-positive-candidate-in-goa-goes-on-campaign-spree-booked-101619248259853.html

Efforts were underway to rescue the third employee abducted from a rig site at a tea estate in Assam’s Sivasagar district on Wednesday, he added. “So far security forces have been able to rescue two of the total three victims from near the India-Myanmar border in Mon district, Nagaland. The rescued two are Alakesh Saikia and Mohini Mohan Gogoi. Efforts are going on to rescue the third victim,” Mahanta tweeted. Mahanta thanked the army’s 57 Mountain Division and the Nagaland police for their help and coordination in the rescue operation. “Without your kind cooperation and timely intervention of security forces on our input and continuous coordination, the rescue operation would not have been possible.” Further details about the two and whether there was an exchange of fire during the rescue were immediately unavailable. Ritul Saikia, the third abducted employee, and Gogoi worked as junior engineer assistants at the ONGC site while Alakesh Saikia as a junior technician. All three belong to Assam. Police said five armed persons abducted the three at gunpoint in an ONGC ambulance, which was later recovered close to the Assam-Nagaland border, around 11 km away. On Friday, the Assam police confirmed that ULFA-I was behind the abductions, and the outfit’s self-styled Major Ganesh Lahon carried them out along with four others. The police have arrested 14 persons on suspicion of their involvement in the abductions. In December, ULFA-I abducted two employees of a private company from a drilling location in Changlang district of Arunachal Pradesh. Both of them were released earlier this month after over 100 days in captivity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/2-ongc-employees-abducted-by-ulfa-i-rescued-in-nagaland-search-on-for-3rd-101619246279673.html
24-04-2021||Patna||Bihar presents action plan before High Court to boost oxygen supply||The Patna High Court on Friday said that there is a deficiency in the supply of medical oxygen for treating Covid-19 patients in Bihar and directed the shortfall to be met through proper coordination between the state and the Centre at the earliest so that no patient was denied admission in hospitals due to shortage of oxygen.Additional solicitor general KN Singh said that the Centre has allocated 194 mt of medical oxygen to the state, which the state would require to lift. “However, so far the state was getting less supply, maybe, due to logistics problems,” he added. Presenting its action plan before the court, including status of oxygen supply, Bihar government’s senior counsel Ranjit Kumar on Friday told the bench of Justice Chakradhari Sharan Singh and Justice Mohit Kumar Shah that adequate oxygen was available as per the requirement of existing oxygenated beds, while it is striving for more in view of the increased demand due to spike in Covid-19 cases. Kumar said the state was also planning to boost oxygen availability by taking measures such as installing a pressure swing absorption (PSA) oxygen plant. A proposal for the same has already been sent to the Centre, he said. Earlier, the state government had demanded 300 mt from the Centre. “At present, PMCH and NMCH plants produce oxygen at the rate of 300 litres per minute, while Darbhanga, Muzaffarpur, Bettiah and Madhepura medical college and hospitals have a capacity of 280 litres per minute. Besides, Pawapuri hospital will have its functional from May 1, while those at Gaya and Bhagalpur will get operational from May 21. Together, the capacity will go up to 2620 litres per minute,” he added. The bench, however, told the state counsel to let the people know what the state has and what it does not have in the public domain through portal and newspaper advertisements. The bench, however, countered why the state suffered a shortage in mid-April when it claims no shortage today. Earlier, the court sought to know the state’s action plan, including availability and the mode and manner in which the state government planned to supply oxygen to different dedicated Covid hospitals and dedicated Covid healthcare centres, as also private hospitals. The shortage of oxygen was also corroborated by the report of the registrar general of the HC into the death of Gagan Mishra, an HC officer, reportedly, because of the unavailability of oxygen in various hospitals in the city of Patna. The court had asked for a report. “On April 16, Mishra’s condition deteriorated and there was acute scarcity of oxygen cylinders in the hospital. On request of Mishra’s family members, one cylinder (jumbo size) containing 40 litres of oxygen was provided to the hospital for Mishra’s care. That day, in the Covid Ward of the hospital, there were 20 patients in the critical care unit. On April 17, for the care of 20 admitted patients in the critical care ward, the hospital needed 100 cylinders of jumbo size but the hospital received only 10 cylinders of oxygen. Later, Mishra was advised to shift to a higher centre for further management. Till April 21, the hospital was not admitting new critical patients,” the report submitted before the HC stated. Taking serious note of the facts mentioned in the report regarding the paucity of oxygen in the state, the bench requested Ranjit Kumar to seek detailed instructions from the state of Bihar in respect of the effective steps which have been taken and are proposed to be taken to tide over the situation arising out of reported acute shortage of medicinal oxygen in Bihar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-presents-action-plan-before-high-court-to-boost-oxygen-supply-101619243339487.html

Our liquid medical oxygen was over by about 10 pm and then we switched over to the oxygen cylinders attached to the main gas pipeline. There was a drop in pressure and the patients could not survive,” said Dr Deep Baluja, medical director of the hospital. The hospital was to receive its quota of oxygen at 05:30 pm but the supply did not reach it till midnight. Even then, the hospital just received 40% of its allocated quota and is again in a situation of crisis. “We are again in a situation of crisis, 200 lives are on the line. Last night we were at least able to save most patients. We will not be able to do that today. We have exhausted our backup,” said Dr Baluja. The hospital has probably another 30 minutes of supply left.

Of the three trucks, one was offloaded in Varanasi while two were brought to Lucknow. Each truck is of 15,000 litres capacity,” said Awanish Kumar Awasthi, additional chief secretary (Home), who was supervising the operation.Watch: Oxygen Express train with 30,000 litres of liquid medical oxygen reaches UP﻿﻿Government officials said the train is expected to bring much-needed relief to the state capital and other oxygen-starved districts of Uttar Pradesh that witnessed a sudden increase in demand for oxygen for Covid 19 patients.The train, which is said to be the first-of-its-kind rail operation in history, left Bokaro, Jharkhand, loaded with three truckloads of LMO at around 2 pm on Friday.Awasthi said the quantity of oxygen that has reached Lucknow is enough to meet half of the total oxygen demand in the state capital. “Things will surely improve in Lucknow. The total amount of oxygen arrived would be enough to meet half of the total demand here,” added Awasthi.On Friday, Lucknow reported 5,862 fresh cases and 14 fatalities. The total number of active cases under treatment in Lucknow is around 53,475. The death toll in Lucknow has gone up to 1,598.Besides, he also said that UP has rushed another Oxygen Express train on Saturday morning to fetch oxygen from Bokaro to meet the increased oxygen demand of other districts following the rise in the Covid 19 cases.Sanjay Trupathi, divisional railway manager (DRM) Northern Railway (NR) Lucknow, who was part of the operation said, “The operation was successful. It’s was perhaps the first of its kind train operation. We have sent another train, loaded with 4 empty oxygen tankers to Bokaro. The train is expected to reach UP on Monday,” said Sanjay Tripathi, DRM NR.He said such operations would be a boon in curbing the ‘oxygen crisis’ that has emerged following the sudden spike in its demand.The transport department has roped in around 40 oxygen-carrying tankers from across the state, for the purpose.The initiative is a part of the UP government’s move under which it had approached the Railways to help them out in bringing in LMO from Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha to meet the increased demand in the state, especially in districts like Lucknow, Varanasi and Faizabad.Government officials said that traditional oxygen tankers would take nearly 5 to 6 days to bring in oxygen from Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha and transporting it by Railways is two times faster.

The agency invoked the Prevention of Corruption Act and 120 B (criminal conspiracy) in filing the FIR and also raided his residence along with three other places in Mumbai in connection with the case.The former minister was summoned by the probe agency for questioning into the matter on April 14 after Param Bir Singh, in a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, accused him of directing his subordinates to collect money from bars, restaurants and hotels in Mumbai.Watch: CBI files FIR against ex-Maha minister Anil Deshmukh over corruption allegation﻿﻿According to Singh, Deshmukh told police officer Sachin Vaze, now suspended and arrested in connection with Mukesh Ambani security threat case, to collect Rs100 crore a month from these sources.As part of its preliminary enquiry, the CBI also questioned Anil Deshmukh’s personal assistants Sanjeev Palande and Kundan Shinde, former cop Sachin Vaze’s two drivers, bar owners, Mumbai Police officers, and people close to the former minister in connection with the alleged corruption case.The investigation was taken up by the CBI after the High Court of Bombay directed it on April 5 to conduct a preliminary investigation into the case within 15 days. On April 8, the Supreme Court ruled 8 that the allegations levelled against the former minister were "serious" and needed probe by the central agency."Allegations are serious, the home minister and police commissioner are involved. They're closely working together till they fall apart, and both are holding a particular position. Should the CBI not probe?

"The SC has now taken cognisance of the Covid situation in the country.

After hundreds of people were seen flouting Covid-19 norms in such rallies, the Election Commission of India (ECI) banned roadshows and vehicle rallies for the remaining phases of the West Bengal elections on Thursday. No public meeting having more than 500 people will be allowed, the poll body said.Following the order, PM Modi, Amit Shah and West Bengal chief minister and Trinamool Congress supremo Mamata Banerjee were among the top leaders to cancel their rallies in the state. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi had suspended all his rallies in West Bengal on April 18 and had urged other leaders to follow suit. "In view of the Covid situation, I am suspending all my public rallies in West Bengal. I would advise all political leaders to think deeply about the consequences of holding large public rallies under the current circumstances," he tweeted.Meanwhile, the Kumbh Mela, underway in Uttarakhand' Haridwar, saw thousands of people who had assembled to take a holy dip on the occasion of shahi snan (royal bath). However, after PM Modi appealed to Swami Avdheshanand Giri last week to turn Kumbh Mela into a "symbolic" event in view of the rapidly spreading virus and key ‘akhadas’ of seers began pulling out of the Maha Kumbh, crowds in Haridwar thinned down "drastically", according to PTI.India on Friday registered  332,730 fresh cases of Covid-19.

Uttarakhand earlier in February witnessed loss of lives and devastation due to a glacier burst in the same region which led to floods in Chamoli.“A glacier burst in Uttarakhand's Joshimath near the India-China border,” Colonel Manish Kapil, a commander of the Border Road Task Force. Uttarakhand chief minister said Union home minister Amit Shah has taken note of the incident and assured his support to the Uttarakhand government and advised the ITBP to remain alert.“Home minister Amit Shah took immediate cognisance of the glacier burst in Niti Valley’s Sumna. He assured he will help us while instructing the ITBP to remain vigilant,” Uttarakhand chief minister Tirath Singh Rawat was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.Uttarakhand on February 7 witnessed loss of lives, disappearances and devastation of property due to a glacial burst at Joshimath in Uttarakhand’s Chamoli district which triggered floods that destroyed two hydropower projects near the Naina Devi National Park. The incident claimed 74 lives and more than 100 people have disappeared. Several workers who were trapped in a tunnel near the Tapovan-Vishnugad hydel project were rescued but many workers died whose bodies were found days later. Experts have suggested that the construction of hydel power projects could have led to the disaster in February. Stone quarrying, blasting of mountains and digging of tunnels in the base of a mountain system could have led to this disaster, according to a report by HT. The 135 missing persons in the Chamoli disaster were declared dead by the Uttarakhand health department in February. Following the disaster, joint study teams have been formed to study the glaciers in the region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/dehradun-news/another-glacier-burst-at-uttarakhand-s-joshimath-puts-authorities-on-alert-101619232291665.html

But thorough checks will continue and all non-essential and non-emergency movement will be restricted as before.Mumbai Police earlier introduced three colour-coded stickers to allow the movement of private cars during the curfew.Dear Mumbaikars.The red, yellow, green #EmergencyStickers categorisation is being discontinued. However, thorough checks shall continue & we hope you will stand by us in #TakingOnCorona & avoid all non-essential / non-emergency movement outside home #StayHomeStaySafeUnder this colour-coded sticker scheme, vehicles belonging to doctors, medical staff, ambulances and those engaged in supplying medical equipment were required to sport red stickers on the road, while cars transporting food, vegetables, fruits, groceries, dairy products, etc., were supposed to use green stickers.Employees falling in other essential categories apart from these two, such as municipal officials, electricity department staff, bank staff, advocates, telephone and press departments were asked to stick yellow stickers on their vehicles.The Mumbai Police authorities urged people to make such stickers on their own before getting out of their homes. The police also distributed such stickers at certain junctions.The restriction created some confusion among Mumbaikars as to which stickers to be used for which category of people, though Mumbai Police on its Twitter handle guided people regarding the colour of the stickers.The number of daily Covid-19 infections in Mumbai has been settled around 7,000. On Friday, the city reported 7,199 new cases and 72 fatalities, taking the case tally to 6,16,279 and the toll to 12,655.As the health infrastructure of the city is coming under stress, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation has decided to first examine symptomatic Covid-19 patients at home and then admit them in hospitals, if required. The home visits to examine symptomatic patients will take place between 7am and 11pm, while those needing attention urgently in hours other than these can approach the jumbo Covid centres, the BMC release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/colourcoded-stickers-not-required-anymore-but-checks-will-be-on-mumbai-police-101619228123897.html
24-04-2021||Delhi||Distress calls every few hours: Hospital’s plight sums up mess||Delhi’s Sir Ganga Ram Hospital raised alarm on Friday morning about depleting oxygen levels and its ventilators not working properly, marking the fourth consecutive day the premier institution was facing critical shortages.The hospital received supplies in the morning, but by evening, again, medical authorities were making frantic calls to ensure they receive oxygen on time, mirroring a similar crisis in facilities. At the time of going to print, the hospital had enough oxygen to last till 1am. The hospital sent out an SOS message at 8.16am that said 25 “sickest” Covid-19 patients had died and oxygen would last for another two hours only. “Major crisis likely. Lives of another 60 sickest patients in peril,” a message from the hospital’s medical director, Dr (Brig) S Katoch, said.The hospital later clarified that the 25 deaths were not connected with the oxygen shortage and were natural deaths of patients who were in a very serious condition.“But the oxygen situation is such that we did have to switch to manual ventilation in the ICU [intensive care unit] day before when our oxygen supply was depleting because the pressure was less. There is an acute shortage of oxygen across the city but for now, the crisis has been averted,” said DS Rana, the hospital’s board of management chairman, in a statement.At 8.16am when the hospital sent out an SOS message, an oxygen tanker sent by the supplier was stuck in Rohini in north Delhi and the driver did not know the route to the hospital. Meanwhile, doctors were preparing to lower the pressure of the main oxygen tank to conserve oxygen.“Fortunately, we did not have to do that today. When the oxygen pressure is reduced, the ventilators and non-invasive machines like Bipap do not work effectively. So, doctors have to manually ventilate the patients to ensure proper breathing,” said a hospital personnel.At 9.20am, the hospital received 2,000 cubic metres of oxygen that the hospital said would last till Friday evening. The next tanker arrived at 10.30pm, when supply had run to less than 800 cubic metres.“Tanker has brought half tonne oxygen which will last for only 1.5 hours. Hopefully by that time Inox tanker should come . Long night,” the hospital PRO said after the 10.30pm refill..The hospital has 675 beds of which 519 are earmarked for Covid-19.

In comparison, one of Delhi’s worst Dengue outbreaks in 2015 killed 60 people in the entire year.At least 400 cases of the UK variant, and 76 of the so-called “double mutation” variant were detected in Delhi.“In Delhi we are finding a different type of scenario: we do find the UK variant and B.1.617 variant, but the scenario is still unfolding. We have seen a rise of the UK variant from 28% in the second week of March to 50% in the last week of March. And if we just try to correlate the surge which we have been observing in Delhi, it directly coincides with the type of variant,” said Dr Sujeet Kumar Singh, director National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC), which is the nodal lab for Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG).Dr Singh was speaking during a webinar on genome sequencing organised by the department of biotechnology (DBT) that was responsible for putting together the network of 10 nationally advanced laboratories in December last year, for the purpose of augmenting genome sequencing of positive Sars-Cov-2 samples.In Punjab too, the UK variant was found to be behind the surge in cases.In Maharashtra, the B.1.617 variant, also known as the double mutant, was found in proportions of over 50% in many cities, the INSACOG analysis shows.Of the total 1,770 samples sequenced, 64 were of the UK variant, six of the South African one (B.1.351), one of the Brazilian (P.1) variant. The “double mutation” variant, or B.1.617, was found in 427 cases.So far INSACOG has sequenced 15,133 sars-cov-2 genomes from Covid-19 international travellers as well as from the community.Of the all samples sequenced, 2,000 were of travellers.Meanwhile, experts say the sharp increase in deaths in the Capital can be attributed to the unprecedented rise in the number of cases and the collapsing health infrastructure.“There is an unprecedented increase in the number of cases; we have never seen anything like this. All the hospitals are running full and patients are running from here and there, this is adding to the mortality. We receive several patients who are brought dead to our hospital after going to several other hospitals. There has to be centralised system and ambulances have to be placed at all major hospitals to transport patients to where the beds are,” said a senior doctor from one of city’s private hospitals.However, the city has almost run out of beds. There were just 22 ICU beds available across the city as on Friday night and 1,855 normal beds, according to the Delhi Corona app.The city has reported over 20,000 cases for seven days now, with the highest number of cases (28,395) being reported on April 20. Although the absolute number of cases has gone down since, it is largely because of fewer tests conducted over the last three days.Just over 75,000 tests were conducted on average over the last three days in comparison to over 93,000 tests conducted each day on average over the last seven days.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/uk-variant-cause-of-capital-surge-says-official-348-more-die-in-city-101619213247374.html

24-04-2021||Delhi||Delhiwale: A tale of two years||Year 2019, winter, a few months before the coronavirus pandemic hit the country.Rajinder had moved up in life, he would say (the photo is from that optimistic time). With the help of a generous bank loan, he had bought a gleaming new auto rickshaw costing ₹3 lakh. Earlier he was a beldar, a labourer, and “I used to be covered in dust”, but as an auto driver it was no longer like that.Rajinder’s ambition was to eventually move to driving a cab, which he had calculated would take him about two years. He would first have to pay back the bank loan in monthly instalments. Since he earned about the same amount of money that he used to make as a labourer—about ₹12,000 a month—he and his wife have had to make severe cuts to their household budget, including a total ban on eating outside, and curtailing the buying of new clothes. They also moved from their comfy room in Gurugram’s Raj Nagar (monthly rent: ₹4,000) to a smaller one in Gandhi Nagar ( ₹2,600). There were challenges but the family looked forward to happier days. They even hoped of buying a plot of land in the Millennium City to build their own house.Year 2021, late April.Because it was difficult to find passengers in the pandemic, Rajinder explains on phone that he couldn’t keep up with the instalments to the bank. Last month his auto was taken back by the lenders, he says. Rajinder has again become a beldar, doing “labour work” all day long. “I leave for work at 8 in the morning and usually come back home by 7... sometimes I work on the road and sometimes on the building sites. Now I again get covered with dust by the day’s end.”Rajinder reasons that the months of the pandemic and its recent surge has forced his life to move back to where it was some years ago, when he had first moved to Delhi from his village in Bihar. “It has become worse than before,” he clarifies, before expressing satisfaction that he continues to earn enough to keep his wife and two kids well-fed. “But our dreams are over,” he says. “We don’t complain about our fate... we just want to survive.” As if in consolation, he notes thoughtfully that “everyone’s luck is failing.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiwale-a-tale-of-two-years-101619211243739.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana police chief extends ban on unauthorised use of ‘VIP’ tags on vehicles||Commissioner of police Rakesh Agrawal has extended the ban on pasting “police”, “army” and similar “VIP” tags on vehicles without authorisation.Anti-social elements and criminals can take advantage of such tags and threaten law and order, he said.Under Section 144 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), the police chief also issued orders to shopkeepers to keep a record of buyers of military uniforms or camouflage clothing, as these could be misused to commit crimes.Shopkeepers have been directed to keep a picture, identification proof and phone number of buyers of these uniforms, and maintain a record of stock and submit it with the police stations concerned.Ban on using loading vehicles to ferry peopleThe police chief banned ferrying people on vehicles meant for loading material, as this posed risk to lives. Agrawal also prohibited carrying sand in uncovered vehicles.Ownership of second-hand vehiclesThe commissioner said ownership of second-hand vehicles should be transferred to the new buyer within 30 days of purchase. Miscreants often bought old vehicles to use them for criminal activities, he said, while also banning pasting of black films on windows of vehicles.For the safety of motorists, Agrawal banned the sale of sub-standard helmets in the city, allowing only those with ISI mark.‘Keep record of guests’He also ordered all owners of hotels, guest houses and other service apartments to maintain a record of visitors.He said Ludhiana, being an industrial hub of Punjab, daily saw arrival of thousands of businessmen, who stayed in such premises, but their owners usually did not maintain a record of guests.Sale, storage of plastic kite stringTerming it dangerous for humans as well as animals, the top cop banned the storage and sale of plastic kite string under Section 144 of the CrPC.In his order, Agrawal also stated that no person can use footpaths to set up carts and makeshift stalls, or place goods outside shops.

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ludhiana gyms once again face uphill battle to survive||With the Punjab government directing all gyms in the state to stay closed till April 30, it’s a tough road ahead for hundreds of gym owners in the city, who are not only staring at losses but also fear that they might have to close shop.Even last year, a large number of small and medium scale gyms were forced to close down, as the owners found it difficult to pay fixed costs. The gym owners are now recalling the damage on the sector due to the five-month lockdown (March 20 to August 5, 2020) imposed last year. Accusing the state government of discriminating against the sector, the gym owners rued that markets, factories and transport sector have been allowed to open, but only the gyms have been asked to stay closed.No relief from govt yetAs per figures, there are over 800 gyms in Ludhiana, of which 80% are being run on rented properties. With no income amid the shutdown, they will face difficulty in paying rent, power bills, salaries, bank instalments and other fixed charges. Further, it will also lead to unemployment, as no relief or support being extended by the government towards the sector. Thousands of people including the trainers, cleaning staff and suppliers of health supplements are involved with the sector, directly or indirectly. President of Punjab Gym Welfare Society and owner of Aura Gym, Navneet Singh said, “This is peak season for the gym industry as a large number of people join in April for to lose weight during summers. Even last year, the gyms were closed at this time and now, the government has announced a lockdown irrationally again. Many of the gym owners pay rent in lakhs. Even if the rent is ₹20,000, it will be a herculean task to pay up without any income.” Members of the society including president of Jalandhar Gym society, Kanwardeep Singh and Sandeep Narula from Sri Muktsar Sahib conducted a meeting in this regard on Wednesday. The owners rued that they are still struggling to recover from the losses suffered last year and the government has further added to the woes by announcing a lockdown.Director of Gym Ekta Welfare Association, Ramesh Bangar said, “Business had slowly come back on track, but the footfall was reduced to 70% as we had to follow Covid protocol and avoid rush. We are ready to follow all the protocols, but the government is adamant in pushing the sector towards closure. These restrictions will inculcate fear among the customers. Gyms promote health, but the government is defaming the sector by giving the impression that the disease spreads at gyms even when we follow all the protocols.” Secretary of Punjab Gym Welfare Society, Pardeep Appu said, “The chain of transmission of the virus cannot be broken by closing down a few sectors like ours, which have remained a soft target for the government If the government wants to curb the Covid spread, then a complete lockdown should be imposed. Over 50 gym owners were forced to shut down last year, and the number will rise this year, as many owners will not even be able to pay bank instalments. This will also lead to large scale unemployment, for which the government will be responsible.”Owner of Body Engineers Health Club in BRS Nagar, Sunny Ghai said, “Clients are seeking extension in memberships in lieu of lockdown and we also have to pay salaries and power bills. The closure announcement has inculcated fear among the gym owners and our staff as uncertainty prevails over the sector once again.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ludhiana-gyms-once-again-face-uphill-battle-to-survive-101619211299046.html
24-04-2021||Other||Ludhiana police caution against fraud through Whatsapp links||Having received multiple complaints, the cyber cell has cautioned residents against clicking on Whatsapp links shared by unknown numbers.According to the police, fraudsters were sending links via the mobile messaging app to gain access to the users’ contact list and further contact their friends and relatives with messages of urgent requirement of money.These links could be about anything from offers of lucrative home-based jobs or heavy discounts for gadgets.In one such case, a city resident reported that after he clicked on one such link, fraudsters duped his relative of ₹4 lakh by asking for money on the pretext of an emergency. They also shared details of a bank account for online transfer of money.“Using similar modus operandi, fraudsters took ₹1 lakh from the relatives of another resident. People can avoid such scams by simply not clicking on untrusted links,” said inspector Pawan Kumar, in-charge of the Ludhiana police cyber cell.“For added security, users should enable two-step verification in Whatsapp. Through this, a unique PIN is created, which is required to register the account on a new device, if hackers try to gain access. Besides a reset link is sent to the user’s email address if there is an attempt to change the PIN,” he advised.Assistant commissioner of police (ACP, cyber cell) Vaibhav Sehgal said fraudsters had now turned to WhatsApp, a commonly used mobile app, after duping people through fake accounts on Facebook, matrimonial sites, online market places and dating apps.He cautioned users against sharing any PIN, OTP or bank details with unknown callers to avoid falling prey to scams.The cyber cell is currently dealing with at least 1,950 complaints. Most of these, at 830, are with regards to ATM frauds, such as debit card swapping. As many as 450 complaints are regarding online payments, 250 about hacking Facebook and WhatsApp, 300 of fraud via online market places and another 150 about data theft.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-police-caution-against-fraud-through-whatsapp-links-101619211237863.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Press in Air Force to transport O2 tankers: Maha CM||Maharashtra chief minister Uddhav Thackeray, in his interaction with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, raised the demand to press in the Air Force to reduce travel time for transporting oxygen tankers. The CM sought adequate supply of oxygen, vaccinations and Remdesivir from the Centre. The state, which requires 1,250 metric tonnes of oxygen daily, is facing a severe shortage of oxygen supply. It is procuring around 300 metric tonnes from other states and industries. In a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO), Thackeray said the state would need an additional 250-300 metric tonnes of oxygen, looking at the increasing number of patients in hospital that require oxygen supply. The CM said the Air Force could airlift empty tankers to oxygen plants, which can be brought back by other mode of transport to save travel time.“If it is not possible to airlift oxygen, the empty tankers could be sent to the oxygen plants by Air Force, to save time, and it can be brought by other modes of transport…,” Thackeray said according to a statement. “We tried to bring oxygen by train, but considering the travel time taken and distance, the Air Force and National Disaster Management Authority need to be pressed in.” He further added, “There are more than 60,000 patients on oxygen supply in the state, while there are 76,300 oxygen beds in the state… Instead of distant states, if the oxygen supply could be arranged from neighbouring states, it would be available early.” Maharashtra has also sought 13,000 jumbo oxygen cylinders and 1,100 ventilators from the Centre. With a week to go for vaccination of all adults to start across the country, Thackeray also sought clarity from the Centre on the extent of the vaccine supply to the state. As per the announcement by the Centre, the state government has to purchase vaccine stock from manufacturers for inoculation of citizens between 18 and 44 years. The CM also sought clarity if the states can import the foreign vaccine to increase the pace of vaccination, given the limited manufacturing capacity of the two Indian companies. “The large-scale vaccinations in Britain have prevented the virus from spreading further. With the limited capacity of our vaccine manufacturers, we need guidance on whether we can increase vaccination by importing vaccines from other countries,” the CM said. Maharashtra, according to senior government officials, require around 120 million vaccine doses for the two rounds of jab for its 57 million population in the 18-44 age bracket. Thackeray said that there needs to be more clarity on the extent of vaccine supply to the states. “If the state asks permission to import vaccines, it should be granted,” the CM said, adding, “We will require 12 crore (120 million) doses to vaccinate this group. Our vaccine manufacturers will not be able to produce the required doses in a short time. The corporate sector should also be given permission to purchase vaccines through their Corporate Social Responsibility initiative.” Health minister Rajesh Tope, who was a part of the meeting, said all chief ministers also sought one price for vaccine provided to the state and the union government. A row erupted after Serum Institute of India announced the open market private of its vaccine against Covid-19, Covishield, with several political parties claiming different price for the Centre and state. The state, according to the Pune-headquartered company, will have to pay ₹400 per dose of vaccine, while the Centre was earlier supplied the stock for ₹150. But the company had clarified that the rate for Centre was an old contract which was fixed without knowing if the vaccine will work. “From May 1, the state government can procure vaccine for inoculation of 18-44 age group. All chief ministers, in the meeting, demanded there should be ‘one nation, one rate’ for the vaccination. We want to aggressively implement vaccination because countries such as Israel and the UK have become either Covid-free or have extremely few cases because of vaccination,” said Tope after the meeting. The chief minister said the supply of vaccines by the Centre for inoculation of people over the age of 45 is moving at a “very slow pace”. He said, “As of now, the state only had a stock of 500,000 doses. Maharashtra has been the top performer in vaccinating citizens. So, the state must get an adequate supply of vaccine doses to keep the same pace of vaccinating the people.” Stating that Remdesivir reduces patient time in hospital and frees up beds, Thackeray said adequate supply of the drug must be provided to Maharashtra, looking at the number of patients. According to the CM, the state needs 70,000 vials per day, while the Centre supplies only 27,000 vials. “It is not possible to say how useful Remdesivir is, but it is definitely reducing the hospital stay of the patients. So, the state should get an adequate supply, considering the number of patients in the state. Maharashtra needs 70,000 vials of Remdesivir every day, but is getting only 27,000. The state should be allowed to import Remdesivir,” Thackeray demanded in the meeting. Thackeray, during the meeting, also justified the lockdown imposed in the state, saying the situation demanded such stringent steps. Earlier this week, the state has further restricted movement of people in public transport including trains, metros, buses, etc. “PM said the lockdown was the last resort to break the chain of Covid. The situation in the state needed restrictions, but we are ensuring the economy does not suffer,” Thackeray said. .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/press-in-air-force-to-transport-o2-tankers-maha-cm-101619211120768.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||At 26°C, Ludhiana records coldest April day in five decades||After 6mm rain, the city’s maximum temperature dropped to 26°C on Friday, which was the coldest April day over the past 50 years, as per data available with the Punjab Agricultural University. According to Prabhjyot Kaur Sidhu, head, department of climate change and agricultural meteorology, PAU, this was the first time that the city recorded such a fall in mercury in April since the meteorological observatory was set up in 1970.The last low, at 30°C, was seen on April 23, 1994, and since then the maximum temperature in the month remained higher.At 15.4°C, the minimum temperature on Friday was also the lowest since April 23, 1992.Just nine days ago, the temperature had shot up to 38.2°C on April 14 and dropped by over 12 notches to settle at 26°C on Friday, Sidhu said.While the rising temperature had forced residents to switch on the air conditioners, the sudden change in weather had them pulling out their warm clothes again. Sidhu attributed the drop in temperature to a fresh western disturbance, which brought along rain and cold winds in the region.She said as per the forecast, the weather was expected to remain clear from Saturday onwards and the mercury was likely to return to the upward trend common in summer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/at-26-c-ludhiana-records-coldest-april-day-in-five-decades-101619210938178.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||HC verdict a wake-up call for Cong govt, says Sunil Jakhar||Nine months before Punjab goes to assembly polls early next year, the Capt Amarinder Singh-led Congress government finds itself in a corner over the emotive sacrilege issue following the Punjab and Haryana high court order, quashing the special investigation team (SIT) report in the 2015 Kotkapura firing case. The legal setback has not only lent artillery to the opposition in its concerted campaign to amplify anti-incumbency ire, it has fired up the Congress detractors. Upping the ante, former minister Navjot Singh Sidhu and Rajya Sabha MP Partap Singh Bajwa have resurrected their shrill anti-Amarinder tirade, signalling that all is not well in the ruling party. At the helm of state Congress for last four years, Sunil Jakhar, 67, is acutely conscious of the growing anxieties in the party rank and file in an election year. He was at his candid best during an in-person interview on Friday during which he spoke about the political fallout of the high court verdict, blame-game within the state Congress, the role of political strategist Prashant Kishor, and impact of farmers’ agitation on the state assembly polls. Excerpts: With nine months to go for the state polls, how do you rate the performance of the Amarinder government? Given the challenges that it faced, the government has done fairly well. We have achieved a lot in spite of all the impediments — be it the financial crunch, pandemic and economic meltdown. The government waived off loans of 5-lakh farmers and expanded the Ayushman Bharat health scheme to cover 46-lakh families, which is our biggest achievement. There is also the transformation in school education, enhancement of money under the Shagun Scheme and establishment of the rule of law. People had huge expectations from the CM and he has been up to it. A lot more needs to be done, though. Your government is on the back foot on the emotive issue of sacrilege cases. Sidhu and Bajwa are repeatedly harping after the HC quashed the SIT report. How serious a setback is this? The HC verdict has come as a jolt. Nobody expected it. We are on a weak wicket and it is a wake-up call. We were all very smug that investigation is going on well and all the culprits will be brought to book. People are not interested in complexities of jurisprudence. They want action. It is a setback, but has given us time and opportunity to plug the loopholes and shortcomings in investigation. If this judgment had come two months later, I am not sure what we could have done. We had picked up (then IG) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, one of the best officers for this probe. As per his statement, the CM gave him a free hand, placing his complete faith in SIT. I am absolutely clear we have to bring the culprits to book and failure to ensure that is not an option. What went wrong? I think, too many cooks spoiled the broth. Secondly, it was a fait accompli. After Justice Ranjit Singh commission’s report, everything was clear. He had done a thorough job and all that was needed was to tie these knots, not just join the dots. Captain saab had left it to professionals, but political supervision was important because the buck stops at our doorsteps. It was as much the party’s responsibility as that of the government. Congress leaders and Kunwar Vijay are all faulting the legal team, claiming that they didn’t defend it properly and that this was flagged to the CM. I would not get into technicalities, but there are glaring things like double FIRs. The high court normally does not intervene after the challans have been submitted and this is something unprecedented. But then filing of two FIRs is also unprecedented. This was known all along. We are answerable for being complacent. These people you named complained about everything else, but no one raised this issue. If Sidhu felt something was amiss, he met CM twice and would have definitely raised it there. But everyone believed that Kunwar Vijay was doing the right job. Overconfidence and not having political supervision has put us in a spot. Punjabis are seeking vengeance. Heads will roll. It is for us to see whether heads are of the culprits or ours. Somebody will have to pay the price. For us, it is a wake-up call. Time is running out. Yes, time is of the essence. We are waiting for the copy of the court order. I have spoken to party MLAs, ministers and leaders. We will meet the CM immediately on it. Are you for a fresh SIT or challenging the verdict in the Supreme Court? I am not bothered about it. I want the results. We have to book the culprits by any means. Drugs are another issue where your party leaders are saying that drug mafia is very active and has not been finished. The government has achieved success in breaking the backbone of drug cartels and the supply line has been cut. But they keep trying alternative routes. The US is also facing this problem. As long as there is addiction, drugs will find their way. Administration had done its bit and achieved success, but people are not satisfied. People will not be satisfied till the ‘magarmach’ (crocodile) is brought to book even if half of Punjab is put in jail under the NDPS Act. Why you could not do this? It was the connivance of the central government. They were allies. They were being protected. ED keeps conducting raids all over India, but they conveniently forgot this (drug issue). I believe this is their (Centre’s) secret weapon and will be the last resort of the BJP to seek some semblance of credibility in Punjab. They bring it at the last moment. Your government is also drawing flak, even from Congress leaders, for failing to rein in sand, liquor and transport mafia. I would give more credence to what people say. The existence of some of our leaders depends upon these things. The easiest way is to criticise your own government. People expected more from the government which should have handled these things with a firm hand. Sidhu is getting increasingly belligerent and has now publicly taken on CM Amarinder Singh. How does it reflect on the discipline in the party? There is a ‘Lakshman rekha’. He is a MLA but enjoys a very privileged status. He deals directly with the high command. He has earned himself repute among the people and within the higher echelons of the party. It is incumbent on him to sort out these issues at the appropriate level. What role do you see for Sidhu in the party or the government? (AlCC general secretary in-charge of Punjab Harish) Rawat had said that his role will be decided between the high command, Capt and him. These (Sidhu’s) allegations are only trying to amplify what the opposition is saying. If I try to say now that not Sunil Jakhar, but ABC, AG or IG has done it, I cannot wash my hands off. There is collective responsibility. Where was I all these four-and-a-half years? Another perennial grouse of party MLAs and leaders is that bureaucracy is calling the shots. Has that perception changed? What happened in sacrilege case is a result of too much control to bureaucracy. It needed political supervision. I think, the CM was too lenient and generous and some of them exploited it. Were you consulted before poll strategist Prashant Kishor’s appointment? Every government appointment in the CM’s office is not discussed with me. His appointment must have been cleared with the AICC. The CM has so many advisers and Kishor is another adviser attached with him. What role do you see for him? I have not seen anyone with more sharp political acumen than Capt saab. The CM must be having his reasons. He has worked with Kishor earlier. He has been delivering consistently. And, nothing succeeds like success. As for his role, the polls have changed in the country and technical expertise has to be brought in because it is no longer man-to-man, door-to-door. Most of electioneering is now done on social media. The organisational revamp of Punjab Congress is in limbo for more than a year. What is holding it up? We submitted the list last year, but things got mixed up and it got lost due to the pandemic and some other issues. There are vacancies and we need to fill these. It is high time a decision is taken. I am confident that the high command is finished with the elections in Kerala and Assam and will constitute it. You said that Amarinder will be the party’s chief ministerial face in 2022 but seem to be now walking back this statement. I said that he will lead us in the state polls and the slogan was Capt for 2022. He is the captain. Who will become the CM is to be decided after the polls. For that, you have to get a majority. He has won election after election since 2017. You don’t change a winning horse. Political parties are being kept at arm’s length by farmers. Is there a disconnect between the political class and farmers’ stir? It is a people’s movement, but the farmers know that this agitation would not have come to this position had there been another CM and a non-Congress government in Punjab. It is a kranti (revolution) now and hats off to them for keeping it going so well. Will it have a bearing on Punjab elections? The BJP and the SAD will be at the receiving end. The BJP is trying to provoke a confrontation and discredit the agitation. Akalis cannot wash their hands off because they were advocating these laws for three months. They will also pay a price. (Parkash Singh) Badal was a farmer and worked in the fields, but Sukhbir (Badal) is a blue-blooded corporate guy. Who will gain politically from this agitation? This is yet to be seen. It will on whether farmer bodies will put up their own candidates or join hands with somebody. There are a lot of permutations and combinations. Also, the BJP will try to muddy the waters by communal polarisation which is the last thing Punjab needs.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/hc-verdict-a-wake-up-call-for-cong-govt-says-sunil-jakhar-101619210580614.html

The helplines – 0161-242-1091 and 7837-018-500 – were launched specifically to help hospitals with oxygen supply on payment basis. However, over two dozen residents, having relatives in home isolation, frantically dialled the numbers, even though they neither immediately needed oxygen nor had a doctor’s prescription.The high rate of calls prompted the deputy commissioner (DC) to issue a statement that there was no need to panic. He specified that the helpline numbers were only for hospitals and doctors treating Covid patients. “If any patient feels that their blood oxygen level is low, they should approach the nearest hospital,” DC Varinder Kumar Sharma. He cautioned that self-medication or self-oxygenation, without expert medical supervision, not only put unnecessary strain on scarce resources, but may also lead to complications and even mortality.Joint commissioner of police (headquarters) J Elanchezian assured that the city had sufficient stock of oxygen, and had even supplied 150 and 100 cylinders to Jalandhar and Amritsar, respectively, in the last two days. “Cylinders were provided to at least six hospitals in Ludhiana after they contacted the helpline since Thursday evening,” the JCP added. Oxygen plants inspectedOn Friday, deputy director local government (DDLG) Amit Bambi, along with his team of drug inspectors, inspected oxygen generation and bottling plants in Ludhiana. Bambi said the district administration had tied up with two oxygen suppliers, Vardhman Special Steels Limited and Weltech Equipment and Infrastructure Limited, besides five bottling plants. “These plants are running at full capacity and generating oxygen for up to 2,000 D-type cylinders daily. The civil hospital also has its own plant, which is generating 115 cylinders daily,” he added. DC Sharma said clear directions had been issued for stern action against people hoarding oxygen, and for removal of all obstructions in smooth and regular supply of oxygen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/ludhiana-admn-s-oxygen-helpline-for-hospitals-flooded-with-calls-by-panicky-residents-101619210397694.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Gunny bag shortage hampers wheat procurement in Punjab||The shortage of gunny bags, locally called bardana, continues to hamper purchase and lifting of wheat in the grain markets across Punjab even as it has been two weeks since the procurement of the crop started in the state. Heaps of grains lying in the open were drenched by spells of rain in the last couple of days in most of the districts, adding to the worries of the farmers who will find it difficult to get a good price for their produce with a high level of moisture and that too on time. In Bathinda district, 4.32 lakh metric tonne wheat was procured and 2.14 lakh MT lifted of the 4.8 lakh MT arrival in the grain markets till Friday. With farmers complaining of a tardy wheat purchase in mandis, state finance minister Manpreet Singh Badal, who was in Bathinda on Friday, acknowledged the problem, saying the grain markets will have enough supplies of jute bags in a week’s time. “Coordinated efforts are being made to streamline the availability of packaging material. Nearly 60% of the arrival has been purchased,” he told mediapersons.In Mansa district, 3.61 lakh MT wheat was purchased and 2 lakh MT lifted against the arrival of 4.2 lakh MT. In Amritsar district, 90,00 lakh MT wheat has been procured and only 25% of it was lifted against the total arrival of 1 lakh MT grain so far, officials said. Amandeep Singh Chhina, president of the arhtiya association of the Bhagwanwala grain market, the largest in the district, said, “We are still facing problems due to shortage of gunny bags. Today, we had a meeting with the deputy commissioner on the issue. He has assured to resolve the matter in a day or two.” The situation is nearly similar elsewhere in the Majha region that comprises Tarn Taran, Gurdaspur and Pathankot districts besides Amritsar. Kanwaljit Singh of Bathinda’s Dialpura Mirza village said he has been waiting at the village purchase centre for the last six days. “Officials and arthiyas say there is a poor supply of gunny bags,” he complained. Bathinda district food and supplies controller Jaspreet Singh Kahlon said heavy and an early arrival of wheat are the main reasons behind the slow purchase. In the grain markets of Sangrur district , farmers alleged harassment at the hands of the procurement agencies even as the administration claimed that 7.87 lakh MT of the 8.19 lakh MT wheat that has arrived in mandis was purchased. District food and supplies controller TS Chopra denied any shortage of gunny bags in the district saying there was a regular supply of bardana in all mandis. In Patiala district, 6.99 lakh MT wheat has arrived in the grain markets, of which, 6.77 lakh MT (90%) was procured. District mandi officer Ajaypal Singh said the shortage of gunny bags was overcome due to low arrival of wheat during inclement weather conditions. In Jalandhar district, of the 3.2 lakh MT crop that has arrived in the grain markets, 3.19 lakh MT was purchased. The district administration in Kapurthala said nearly 60% of the total arrival of 2.22 lakh MT was purchased. In Ludhiana district, 6.19 lakh MT wheat was procured and 2.98 lakh MT lifted of a total arrival of 6.34 lakh MT.

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||IG Kunwar Vijay may have acted to fulfil his political ambitions: HC on Kotkapura firing challan||Setting aside the chargesheets submitted by the Punjab Police’s special investigation team (SIT) in the 2015 Kotkapura firing case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court questioned the impartiality of inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. The court not only picked holes in the challans but also questioned the manner in which the officer, who resigned from Indian Police Service (IPS) recently, carried out the investigation. “Seeing this conduct of the respondent (Kunwar Vijay), one may harbour an idea that he may be indulging in theatrics to fulfil his own post-retirement political ambitions as several officers have done after demitting office,” the bench of Justice Rajbir Sehrawat observed. There appears a close nexus between political leaders and the IGP while carrying out the investigation, it said. “He has gone to the heights of his fantasy when he brought in film actor Akshay Kumar into the picture claiming him a part of a conspiracy citing a film ‘Singh is Bling’ that he produced and tried to exhibit it in Punjab,” the bench said. The court also questioned the manner in which the IGP wrote a letter to the district and sessions judge, Faridkot, “on administrative side” demanding that no case pertaining to sacrilege and police firing be listed in future before a chief judicial magistrate who he claimed had close family ties with former chief minister Parkash Singh Badal. “But no details of alleged link were mentioned in the letter. He could have moved an application on “judicial side” in any court as permitted by the law during investigation and not on ‘administrative side’, making a complaint against the chief judicial magistrate,” the court pointed out. The bench also took note of a case in which the high court had reprimanded the IGP. “The documents amply show that the respondent has a tendency to misuse his official position while performing his duty,” it said, pointing to a case in which he converted cases purely civil in nature into criminal matter in three instances to pressurise the victims. The bench has also come down heavily on the IGP’s interviews to the media during the 2019 general elections when he named the Badals and questioned their role in the 2015 violence. “He named certain political rivals to the ruling dispensation in the state. Allegations about their role in the sacrilege and police firing incidents were highlighted by the respondentknowing fully well that such interviews at such a juncture will enhance the electoral prospects for a political party at the cost of the other,” the judge added. Kunwar Vijay even tried to browbeat the petitioners’ lawyer and made absurd comments against the senior counsel, he said. “Hence, the court is of the view that the respondent indulges in misuse of his official position to further his designs; makes attempt to overawe the processes. The petitioners are right in arguing that he cannot be trusted to be impartial and unbiased as a probe officer,” the bench said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/igkunwar-vijay-may-have-acted-to-fulfil-his-political-ambitions-hc-on-kotkapura-firing-challan-101619209077729.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||2015 Kotkapura firing: Fairness of probe stands vitiated, report based on assumptions, says HC||Terming the matter a rare case where the court is under duty to step-in, the Punjab and Haryana high court, while quashing the charge sheets filed by Punjab Police in Kotkapura firing case of 2015, said that fairness of investigation stands vitiated. “…What could have been a simple investigation of a crime committed either by the protesters or by the police or by both, have been made to fester and convert itself to a quagmire wherein every person concerned finds himself entrapped,” the bench of justice Rajbir Sehrawat said in his 89-page judgment. The judgment was pronounced on April 9, and made available on Friday. The government has been asked to constitute a three-member special investigation team (SIT) but not to include IPS officer Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh, who has since taken voluntarily retirement, as member. The SIT has been told not to report to any state executive or police authority and file probe reports before the magistrate concerned. The report submitted preferably within six months of constitution has also to be signed by all members. The SIT has also been barred from talking to media. The high court order came on the 2019 plea of Gurdeep Singh Pandher, a former Punjab Police sub-inspector and then Kotkapura SHO, being probed in these FIRs, who had approached the high court, levelling allegations against IGP Singh and seeking his ouster from the SIT. Another applicant was a head constable (retd) Rashpal Singh. “His personal malice and malafide functioning by totally usurping the powers of SIT constituted in the first instance, has been duly demonstrated on record,” the court said on the role of IGP Singh, adding that it was demonstrated before the court that he has gone to the extent of manufacturing the statements of witnesses to suit his “designs”. “…(IGP Singh) has conducted the investigation in a perfunctory manner. The report under Section 173 CrPC (challans) filed by him is more in the nature of a hypothesis proposed ….based on his assumptions and fantasies than being based on material or evidence,” the bench recorded. Claiming role of Badals, he relied upon the call details between then DGP, then chief minister Parkash Singh Badal and his son and then deputy CM Sukhbir Badal, but that would not be sufficient in the times of a situation where the law and order is disturbed, the court said. “Had the then chief minister not been in contact with the district administration and the DGP in such a critical situation, then he would have run the risk of being branded as another Nero who played fiddle when the Rome was burning,” the court said, adding that it would rather show that he was alive to the situation. The court also said claims against the Badals were made in 2019 but till date there is no charge sheet. The court also observed that there are selective omissions in statements of witnesses to save the protesters, which demolishes the integrity of the investigation. It said allegations of police officers who got injured in the firing were not probed. The police officers acted on the order from civil administration but none of the civil authorities or the SDM has been made an accused in this case. “…The political interest of the current dispensation in the state qua the investigation; and the political theatrics of respondent No. 3 by going to media and by repeatedly highlighting allegations against the outgoing politicians without filing challan against them intended to create a narrative in favour of one political party and against the other party during the election process, which has duly been established as per the record,” the bench said on his act of giving interviews while making claims against Badals in 2019 elections, which resulted in Election Commission of India transferring him out of his assignment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2015-kotkapura-firing-fairness-of-probe-stands-vitiated-report-based-on-assumptions-says-hc-101619208897686.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Faridkot Youth Cong chief’s murder: Court issues fresh production warrant against Lawrance Bishnoi for April 27||Terming gangster Lawrance Bishnoi’s apprehension that he could be killed in a fake encounter baseless, a Faridkot court dismissed his application seeking to recall the production warrant issued against him earlier. The court of chief judicial magistrate Sanjeev Kundi on Friday issued a fresh production warrant against Bishnoi, who is lodged in high-security jail in Ajmer, for April 27 in connection with the murder of Faridkot youth Congress president Gurlal Singh Pehalwan.Earlier, the Faridkot court had issued the production warrant against Bishnoi on March 16 but it returned undelivered following an error in the address of the jail. In its application, the police wrongly mentioned Bishnoi’s location as the Central Jail, Ajmer, while he was in the High Security Jail, Ajmer. On April 6, the court again ordered to issue fresh production warrant but was stayed following an application filed by Bishnoi to recall the production warrant against him fearing a fake encounter. The plea was based on the Supreme Court’s order staying Punjab and Haryana high court orders permitting custody of Bishnoi to Chandigarh for questioning with regards to the four cases pending against him.“The SC order does not operate as the FIR was registered much after passing of the apex court’s order, so fresh production warrant be issued against the accused. Apprehensions of Bishnoi that he may be killed in a fake encounter are baseless,” the court said. On February 18, two unidentified men shot dead 34-year-old Pehalwan near Jubilee Chowk in Faridkot. A few hours after the murder, a post on a purported Facebook page of Bishnoi linked the crime with the death of Bishnoi’s aide Gurlal Brar, a former state president of the Students Organisation of Panjab University (SOPU). Brar was killed outside a mall in Industrial Area, Chandigarh, in October 2020. On February 21, Delhi Police arrested three men and claimed the murder was the fallout of a gang rivalry and it was orchestrated by Goldy Brar, with the help of Bishnoi, to avenge the murder of his cousin Gurlal Brar. The police have nominated 13 persons, including Bishnoi and Goldy for Pehalwan’s murder. The police have already arrested nine persons in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/faridkot-youth-cong-chief-s-murder-court-issues-fresh-production-warrant-against-lawrance-bishnoi-for-april-27-101619207577525.html

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Six Punjabis repatriated from Dubai||As many as six people from Punjab, including two women, who were allegedly duped by travel agents and were stranded in Dubai, have been repatriated and reunited with their families on Friday.Dr SP Singh Oberoi, a Dubai businessman who runs an NGO, Sarbat Da Bhala Charitable Trust, facilitated repatriation of the people and arranged their immigration, stay and airfare.Giving details, Oberoi said, “These people were from economically weaker families and they had suffered many setbacks after being cheated in Dubai. They were so emotional during their repatriation and cried at Sri Guru Ram Dass International Airport in Amritsar.”“Due to financial constraints, many parents in Punjab and other states fall prey to greedy agents and send their innocent daughters and sons for jobs in Arab countries. Unfortunately, boys fall prey to fake or defaulting companies and most of the girls are sold to landlords or other businessmen. As a result, the health of many girls deteriorates but it becomes very difficult for them to get out of that trap. We receive many phone calls daily from children who are stranded in Arab countries after being deceived by travel agents”, Oberoi added.Oberoi said the four men Jobanjit Singh, Kulwinder Singh, Baljit Singh and Avtar Singh, who arrived on Friday, belong to Sankarpur village in Gurdaspur district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/six-punjabis-repatriated-from-dubai-101619207097510.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Capt seeks central funding for Covid vaccination drive||Chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Friday termed the vaccination policy for 18+ unfair towards states and demanded central funding for it.The CM also sought parity in rates of the vaccine to be given to the states and the Centre, besides calling for urgent steps to ensure adequate oxygen supply. In a virtual meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss the Covid situation with chief ministers of the worst-hit states, Amarinder said while his government has adopted all measures to minimise demand for oxygen, given the criticality of it as the most essential drug for treatment of serious Covid patients, the Government of India must ensure that all commitments as per the allocation are complied with by liquid oxygen manufacturers in other states. “This is not happening at present. Punjab’s supplies come from Haryana, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, and there are reports of supplies being hijacked,” he said. On the vaccination front, the CM said at the rates declared by one manufacturer, the cost to the Punjab government will be over ₹1,000 crore. He sought central government funding for vaccination, with permission to make the cost a fit charge on SDRF funds in the interim. Regular vaccine supply must be ensured to maintain the supply chain to the last vaccination booth, Amarinder said, adding that due to supply shortage, the vaccination in last one week has been slightly low, i.e. around 80,000 per day. While Punjab received fresh supplies on Thursday, the current stocks can last only three days as demand for vaccine is increasing, he said. Amarinder also expressed concern over lack of clarity on the quantity of vaccine to be made available by Centre after May 1, and how the manufacturers will regulate supplies to different States and private purchasers. The state government, on its part, has constituted an Expert Group under virologist Dr. Gagandeep Kang to advise on our vaccination strategy for 18-45 years, which states have been allowed to vaccinate at their cost, he disclosed. The CM also pointed to the shortage and black-marketing of medicines like Remdesivir and Toci, which he said was creating great panic in the media and general public. Though the Central Government was making efforts to increase their supply, a clearer messaging was required to inform the public that they are not magic wands, and also about available substitutes, he stressed. Pointing to the shortage of anti-viral Remdesivir Injections and zero availability of Toci injections in the state, he said hospitals were, however, following treatment protocol for critical patients and using alternate medicines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/capt-seeks-central-funding-for-covid-vaccination-drive-101619206797641.html

24-04-2021||Delhi||Amid surge, nursing staff in Delhi rue lack of respite, say they are exhausted||The avalanche of Covid-19 patients reaching hospitals, the strain of family members and colleagues falling sick, and the crippling shortage of beds, oxygen and other medical essentials across hospitals in Delhi have left nursing staff in the city “drained” and “emotionally strained”.The second wave of Covid-19 across the country — and the fourth wave in Delhi — has turned out to be deadliest one yet with hundreds of thousands testing positive for the virus and over 2,000 succumbing to the infection every day. The virus has not spared health care workers — many have tested positive and are in need of oxygen support themselves.A senior nursing officer at Ram Manohar Lohia (RML) Hospital, asking not to be named, said around 120 of her colleagues are currently infected. “What we saw last year is nothing compared to what we are witnessing now. The number of patients we are getting is unprecedented and with many of our colleagues testing positive for Covid-19, the whole situation has become more difficult,” she said.She said emotional breakdowns among nurses have become more frequent in Covid wards these days.“We feel absolutely helpless when people beg us for beds and oxygen for their loved ones and we have to say no. Three days ago, a 24-year-old patient succumbed to the infection. Several nurses, who have children about the same age, started weeping. It’s so difficult to see young people die. Last year, at least young people were not getting affected like this,” she said.When Covid first struck in 2020, health care workers used to work for 14 days at a stretch and then quarantine themselves for another 14. There is no such guideline this time and medical professionals say they are currently working without a break.Akhilesh Sharma, a nursing officer at Guru Teg Bahadur (GTB) Hospital, said he feels overwhelmed by the long queues of waiting patients, requesting beds every day.“It’s so difficult to say no to a person in that state. The situation is so dire that even if any staff member tests positive for Covid-19 today, they won’t be able to get a bed. I have been on Covid duty since March last year, and I’m exhausted. It is emotionally draining to see your patients, with whom you have worked so hard, dying in front of your eyes,” he said.A nursing officer at Lok Nayak Hospital, who wished not to be named, said, “I have seen many patients die while waiting for a bed outside the hospital in the past few days. I feel helpless. Many of our doctors and nursing staff sometimes come out to attend to these people, but how can we take care of so many?”Several nursing staff also have Covid positive family members. Babita Rani, a senior nursing officer at the Covid maternity ward at the Employees’ State Insurance Model Hospital in Basaidarapur, said her husband is Covid positive at present. “I, my husband and our 15-year-old son are currently living in three different rooms without seeing each other. It has become so difficult to juggle my husband’s care and my nursing duties. It’s like I am doing the same thing 24x7 -- taking care of Covid patients at the hospital and home,” she said.Rani said nurses are facing another dilemma -- to communicate to others nurses the condition of their loved ones receiving Covid treatment. “Nurses know the survival chances of patients with severe infection. Yet, we are placed in a challenging situation where we have to console our own colleagues and give them assurances about their loved ones even when they, and we, know that the chances are grim,” she said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/amid-surge-nursing-staff-in-delhi-rue-lack-of-respite-say-they-are-exhausted-emotionally-drained-101619206016848.html
24-04-2021||Delhi||Four held for black marketing Remdesivir, 81 vials recovered||Cracking down on persons allegedly hoarding and black marketing Covid-related life saving drugs, Delhi Police on Friday said it arrested four men belonging to two separate interstate gangs over the past three days and recovered from them 81 vials of Remdesivir injection. Further searches are being conducted in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi by teams of the crime branch to nab other members of the two gangs and make more recoveries, police said.“The racketeers were well aware of the scarcity of Remdesivir and other drugs used in Covid treatment across the country. They started hoarding these drugs and sold them in the black market at exorbitant rates. They have a set network of persons who supply the injections on demand. They were selling Remdesivir injections for ₹25,000 to ₹40,000 per vial. The key players are still absconding,” said deputy commissioner of police (crime) Monika Bhardwaj.Bhardwaj said the crime branch had been receiving information that some gangs were hoarding Remdesivir and other life saving drugs as the demand for these medicines rose manifold due to the sharp increase in Covid cases. The crime branch teams -- tasked to identify and crackdown on these racketeers -- used dummy customers to strike deals with the racketeers and catch them red-handed. One such customer contacted a person who assured delivery of one vial of Remdesivir injection for ₹25,000 at Parmanand Chowk near GTB Nagar in north Delhi.On April 21, the team caught Talwinder Singh alias Sajan, belonging to Amritsar in Punjab, and recovered from him three vials of Remdesivir injections. Questioning revealed that members of his gang were supplying injections across India using a courier company in Chandni Chowk. Police searched the company’s office and arrested Jitendra Kumar, who charged ₹2,000 as commission for delivering each Remdesivir injection. Their questioning led to the recovery of 68 more vials.“The duo revealed a network of persons involved in hoarding and supplying these drugs. They charge the customers according to their financial status. Even when in our custody, Singh received a request from a person who was ready to pay ₹50 lakh as several members of his family were Covid positive,” said a senior police officer, who did not want to be identified.In the second operation, another team arrested Shaoib and Mohan with 10 vials of Remdesivir injection from outside Batra hospital in south Delhi. They belong to a different gang that also procured such drugs from Punjab and Haryana.“Questioning of the four arrested persons have led to the recovery of 81 vials of Remdesivir. We feel that the arrest and interrogation of the key players of these syndicates may lead us to any pharma company from where these drugs are illegally re-routed to these people,” the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/four-held-for-black-marketing-remdesivir-81-vials-recovered-101619205957469.html
24-04-2021||Other||After oxygen cylinders,concentrators and BiPap machines go out of stock in Delhi||The crippling surge in Covid-19 cases in the city has led not just to an alarming shortage of medical oxygen, but also a severe scarcity of domestic oxygen concentrators and BiPap machines, with additional stocks unlikely to arrive before three weeks, said several vendors in the Capital.“The situation is so dire that we want the government to intervene and distribute oxygen concentrators to Covid-19 patients with moderate symptoms so that they can be treated at home and the load is taken off from hospitals. Just like the Delhi government distributed pulse oximeters, they should also procure oxygen concentrators on a war-footing and distribute them at subsidised rates, if not for free. This will prevent black-marketing, hoarding and overpricing,” said Manan Sethi of MediExpress, one of the seven major distributors of oxygen concentrators and BiPap machines in north India.He said such a move would mean losses for companies like their’s, but he added that there is no other alternative left. “When Covid-19 cases ebbed in Delhi around February, we used to receive only around 10-15 calls a day. But now, we get at least 300 calls every day. Till a few days ago, the demand for oxygen cylinders was very high. Now, the demand for oxygen concentrators at home has gone through the roof. We do not have a single piece left. The story is going to be similar for bipap machines soon,” Sethi said.An oxygen concentrator pulls in air, compresses it, and removes impurities through its filters. A BiPap (Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure) machine, meanwhile, is a device used to administer non-invasive ventilation in a patient.Vendors in Old Delhi’s Bhagirath Palace, a hub for medical equipment in the city, said they have placed fresh orders, but consignments are unlikely to arrive before May 14.“Most of these machines are imported from China, Taiwan and the USA. The two biggest manufacturers of domestic-use oxygen concentrators in the country — BPL Medical Technologies and Philips — said they are out of stock. Manufacturing fresh batches will also take time since a lot of the raw material also comes from the US and China,” said a store manager at Jullundur Surgical store, one of the biggest stores in the market.An oxygen concentrator costs between ₹30,000- ₹70,000.But vendors acknowledged that prices have now doubled. “We are not raising the cost to increase our profit margin. The companies in China, especially those we mostly procure from have doubled their rates. Earlier due to lack of demand, our orders used to come by road. Now we are even using trains, for which we have to pay the companies separately,” said another distributor, who asked not to be named.Dr SP Byotra, chairman of the department of internal medicine at Sir Ganga Ram Hospital said scores of Covid-19 patients could have been treated at home if the governments had prepared in advance and arranged enough oxygen concentrators when cases dropped.“Covid-19 patients whose viral load is not very high, or those whose oxygen saturation drops off and on, or the elderly can definitely be put on oxygen concentrators at home. But there are none available in Delhi. Patients come to us asking for it, but we are also unable to give them leads now,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/after-oxygen-cylinders-concentrators-and-bipap-machines-go-out-of-stock-in-delhi-101619205956887.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Covid patients from Delhi looking for beds in Mohali hospitals||Twenty-five Covid-19 patients from Delhi and Gurugram have been admitted to Gian Sagar Hospital in Banur. With National Capital Region reeling under a shortage of beds as well as oxygen, the kin of Covid-19 patients have been making enquiries at private hospitals in Mohali in order to shift them here. Some people are even making frantic calls to government hospitals for beds.Dr SPS Goraya, medical superintendent of Gian Sagar Hospital, said all 25 patients are confirmed cases and have been shifted here as they failed to get beds in Delhi and Gurugram. “We have 25 ICU beds and 45 beds for L-2 (moderate) cases. We are not refusing admission to anyone,” he said . Mohali, which has emerged as a medical tourism hub, has around 30 private hospitals with state-of-the-art facilities.Dr Ankush Mehta, general manager, Max Hospital, said: “We are daily getting around 10 calls of Covid patients from the national capital. But we are helpless, as we have a limited number of beds and are giving preference to patients from the region.”Dr Mehta said he even got a call from Lucknow and the family was ready to airlift the patient, but “we could not help them”. “We are not only getting calls from Delhi, but from other states as well,” said Dr Abhijit Singh, zonal director, Fortis Hospital, while adding that the hospital has sufficient beds and oxygen for patients from this region.Dr Adarshpal Kaur, civil surgeon, “Even though we don’t have Level-3 facilities (for critical cases) in our government hospitals, people from Delhi and nearby areas are calling for ICU beds.” Pvt hospital occupancy close to 95%The two government hospitals for Covid-19 patients (civil hospitals in Phase 6 and Dhakoli) have around 100 beds, but only for Level-2 cases. As many as 35 of these are occupied. Meanwhile, private hospitals have around 600 Level-2 beds and 215 Level-3 beds, and their overall occupancy is close to 95%.Sandeep Singla, a Delhi resident, said: “We have not been able to get a hospital bed in Delhi for my father-in-law, who is 82-year-old and suffering from Covid-19. I have even tried calling all private hospitals in Mohali, but they have refused to help.”Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said: “We have directed the private hospitals to give preference to patients of our district, and outsiders should be admitted only in case of a major medical emergency.”Dayalan said that there is a lot of pressure on the health infrastructure as more than 80% Covid beds are occupied. “But constant vigil is being maintained, so that critical patients face no hassle in admission to a suitable health facility,” he said, during his visit to the Dera Bassi subdivisional hospital on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/covid-patients-from-delhi-looking-for-beds-in-mohali-hospitals-101619205898803.html
24-04-2021||Other||Approach Delhi’s nodal officer to meet oxygen requirement: High court||The Delhi high court on Friday asked all the hospitals and nursing homes in Delhi facing shortage of oxygen to first approach the nodal officer of the city to meet the requirement of medical oxygen.A bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli, while hearing fresh pleas by two hospitals facing shortage of oxygen, was informed by the Centre that it has set up a control room to coordinate with the nodal officers of state governments for management of oxygen supply.“We would expect all hospitals in the NCT of Delhi to approach the nodal officer Mr. Udit Prakash and such other officers... in the first instance for the purpose of meeting their requirement of oxygen,” the court said. The bench said if the requirements are not met even after contacting the nodal officer, the hospitals shall contact senior advocate Rahul Mehra and lawyer Satyakam, before approaching the court.During the hearing, the court also asked the Centre to consider the request of the Delhi government to allocate its medical oxygen from plants located in nearby states in contrast to the far off places like West Bengal and Orissa.Senior advocate Rahul Mehra, appearing for the Delhi government, told the court that the problem of shortage of oxygen can be solved if the oxygen comes from the state of Uttar Pradesh instead of far off places like West Bengal and Orissa. He requested the court if this allocation can be reworked so that they can get oxygen from nearby states.He also told the court that the city has received 380 metric tonnes of medical oxygen out of the 480 metric tonnes allocated by the Centre, contending that the deficiency of 100 tonnes will take time to be met, as the supply is coming from two eastern states.The court noted that though there has been some improvement in oxygen supply in the last few days, there is still a shortfall of about 100 metric tonnes, adding that the Centre had earlier assured the court that 480 metric tonnes will reach Delhi, but even after three days, it has not. “Whatever was allocated should be there,” the court observed.It said that the matter of allocation has been done by the Centre considering several factors. However, the Empowered Group can explore the suggestion of relocation to reduce the distance from the point of production to the point of supply. “However, in case the Empowered Group is of the view that the allocation needs to remain unchanged, it may at least consider making interim arrangements till the Railways are in a position to transport from the aforesaid three plants,” said the court.“The same would make the process of transportation to and fro more efficient since shorter trips mean that the same cryogenic tankers would make repeated trips if necessary for making supplies during the day,” said the court.It asked chief secretary of Delhi to examine the allocation plan and make suggestions to be placed before the central government and its Empowered Group on Friday itself. It further ordered the Empowered Group to examine the suggestion at the earliest.Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Centre, informed the court that a control room, comprising of secretary-level officers of the Government of India, will be a part of the process, with whom the nodal officers can get in touch. He said that this is being done so that the Centre can intervene whenever there is any obstruction of oxygen transportation by local authorities.He said that the central virtual control room set up last year has been further strengthened in the wake of the raging pandemic.The court, taking note of the submission, told the hospitals to contact the nodal officer(special secretary Udit Prakash for Delhi), who in turn will directly co-ordinate with the officers in the control room for smooth and continuous supply of oxygen.Mehra, along with additional standing counsel advocate Satyakam, told the court that it has circulated a list of oxygen refilling units with the contact of the nodal officers for small hospitals. Both the lawyers also volunteered to assist the hospitals and nursing homes, in case the problems still persisted.The bench also asked as to whether CNG cylinders could be used for the storage of gaseous oxygen. “It takes long for transportation and then there is lack of tankers. Please see if CNG cylinders can be used,” said the bench.“If that could be done, the storage capacity which is presently in use for the storage of CNG, particularly that which is mobile, could be utilised for transportation of medical oxygen and providing the same to hospitals on immediate basis,” it said.The bench also sought to know from the Delhi government the progress of the eight Pressure Swing Absorption (PSA) oxygen plants planned for Delhi, after it was informed by the Centre on Tuesday that only one of them is operational in Burari.Eight PSA oxygen plants are being installed in Delhi with the support of PM CARES Fund to enhance capacity by 14.4 metric tonnes, the Centre said. It also told the court that clearances have been given for six sites and work of installation is going on in one of the places.The matter will now be heard on Monday, April 26.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/approach-delhi-s-nodal-officer-to-meet-oxygen-requirement-high-court-101619205896899.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Chandigarh hospitals see record Covid deaths in April||The second wave of Covid-19 in the region is proving to be deadlier with the number of deaths due to the virus in city hospitals seeing a massive spike, data suggests.In the tertiary care hospitals of the city, which include Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER) and Government Medical College and Hospital (GMCH), Sector 32, Covid fatalities till April this year have broken all previous records.For instance, PGIMER’s official tracker suggests that of the 808 deaths recorded since March 2020 last year, 189 were logged in the month of April 2021, which is around 23% of the fatalities since the onset of the pandemic. Moreover, the April fatalities account for over 71% of the total 264 virus deaths reported so far this year.Similarly, at GMCH-32, which saw 168 virus deaths in the 10 months of pandemic last year, the fatalities have already crossed the mark this. Out of the 174 deaths at the hospital this year, 38.5% were reported in the month of April so far. All the above figures are as per the official records up to April 22, 2021.Experts attribute the spike in Covid deaths to the record number of infections being reported this year. However, the role of new variants in the deaths is not established.PGIMER director Dr Jagat Ram said they usually receive patients in highly critical condition and as many of them turn out to be comorbid, their oxygen levels see sudden decline. Most of them come from the neighbouring states.“Sometimes, patients brought for emergency surgery also turn out to be infected. No doubt the second wave is causing more absolute deaths,” he said.Former head of community medicine and school of public health, Dr Rajesh Kumar said, “One of the main reasons for the record number of deaths is the severity of the second wave. However, the fatality ratio has not seen a major variation, which suggests that the role of mutant or late reporting is not the case here.”Around 70% of the samples sent from PGIMER to the National Centre for Diseases Control had tested positive for the UK variant of Covid-19, while 20% showed presence of the 681 H mutant.Prof PVM Lakshmi, senior epidemiologist at PGIMER, said that during the last peak, the cases were seeing a gradual rise and so was the trend with the fatalities, but the spike this time has been sudden which was reflected in the higher number of deaths reported this year.“A record number of infections are being reported in April and the rise is steep which results in more deaths in less time period,” said Prof Lakshmi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/chandigarh-hospitals-see-record-covid-deaths-in-april-101619205838127.html
24-04-2021||Delhi||Rush forces Ghazipur crematorium staff to hold mass funeral in parking lot||Until three days ago, the vacant plot adjacent the Ghazipur crematorium in east Delhi was where visitors used to park their vehicles. On Thursday night, when Hindustan Times visited the spot, it no longer housed vehicles, but funeral pyres -- about 40 of them -- most of which continued to burn till late night.With Covid-19 bodies arriving at the crematorium without a break — at least 85 Covid-19 bodies were brought there on Thursday, said officials — the crematorium staff said they started setting up pyres on the parking lot next to the road, with no more than a three-foot gap between bodies.The designated funeral platforms are about 400 metres from the parking space and can dispose of only 36 bodies at a time, facility staff said. With the ceaseless arrival of dead bodies on Thursday, crematorium staff said they had to burn bodies round-the-clock at every available space.Civic body officials said that 100 at least bodies were brought to the crematorium on Friday. “We stopped counting after that,” said an official.Before the outbreak of the pandemic in March last year, the crematorium would handle a maximum of 25 bodies a day, and around 10-15 on average.“We cannot follow protocol anymore because of the rush. We are left with no option but to burn Covid and non- Covid bodies in the same space. Had we not used this space, people would have to wait for days to complete the last rites of their loved ones. Two days ago, several grieving families had to be told to take bodies back as the pyre platforms were full and people were already in queue. That is when we decided to use the parking space,” said one of the officials at the crematorium, who identified himself by his first name Manoj.Around 11.50pm on Thursday, there were at least 40 bodies burning side by side on the parking lot. There were at least five more families waiting outside the crematorium with bodies of loved ones, the staff member said.Another official at the crematorium said on condition of anonymity, “ We hardly got 15 bodies a day in January and February and now the number has suddenly risen to 80 a day. The mortuaries are not storing the bodies of Covid-19 patients and families cannot take them home. Although the Hindu faith does not advise burning bodies after sunset, the situation is different now. We work even past midnight these days. People do not mind even if the bodies are burnt on the ground instead of the raised platforms.”The analysis of the Covid-19 fatality data in Delhi, as recorded in the state government’s daily health bulletin, shows a steady increase in death count from April 1. As per the state bulletin, in January, 10 persons, on average, died of Covid-19 daily while in February, the number dropped to two a day, before increasing to four in March.It was in April, when the fourth wave of the infection swept through Delhi, that the numbers shot up exponentially. At least 98 persons, on average, started dying of Covid every day (April 1 to April 22 ). Delhi has reported 1,838 Covid-19 deaths in the past 10 days alone.As deaths started increasing, the East Delhi Municipal Corporation (EDMC), which runs the Ghazipur crematorium, on April 16 ordered that the facility remain open 24x7. But even that did not suffice in the days that followed. Two CNG furnaces, which were announced by the east civic body to cater to Covid-19 deaths and minimise the rush, are yet to open.East Delhi mayor Nirmal Jain confirmed they had set up pyres at the parking lot.“We also created 10 pyre platforms to meet the demand, over and above the 36 platforms that were in place already. The CNG furnace will be operational by the first week of May.”At midnight, while the bodies burned at the parking site, another group of labourers were at work to start the two electric crematoriums. “ It will take us another 10 days to complete the work. Looking at the present situation, even if the government installs 10 CNG furnaces, they may not be enough,” one of the workers said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/rush-forces-ghazipur-crematorium-staff-to-hold-mass-funeral-in-parking-lot-101619205778436.html
24-04-2021||Chandigarh||Vaccine for 18+: Chandigarh awaits common policy on rates||As everyone above 18 years of age will be eligible to get vaccinated against Covid-19 from May 1, Chandigarh is waiting for a common pricing policy for union territories from the central government.Chandigarh adviser Manoj Parida said they have sought directions from the Centre on the manner in which the doses will be supplied to the UT, and subsequently, pricing will be done based on the government’s policy.“We are in touch with the central government on the pricing of vaccines. Most likely there will be a common policy on jab rates for the union territories. We will get it before May 1,” said Parida.Serum Institute of India will be selling Covishield to the state governments at ₹400 per dose and to private hospitals at ₹600 per dose. This came after the Centre said that vaccine makers will be able to sell half of what they produce at a price of their choosing in the open market and to state governments. The remainder is to be supplied to the Centre for the state-sponsored component of the vaccination programme, which remains limited to the 45-and-over age group only.The Punjab government has said that vaccination in the age group of 18-44 years across the state would start from May 1, and it will ensure that every needy person receives the vaccine free of cost. Similarly, the Himachal Pradesh cabinet has decided that free doses will be administered in government health institutions.Chandigarh has so far administered 1,66,035 doses to beneficiaries, out of which around 60,000 were above 60 years of age, while around 50,000 doses were given people in the age group of 45 to 60. The remaining jabs were administered to health and frontline workers.1 lakh Covishield doses alloted for 45+ groupThe UT administration on Friday said that the central government has allotted 1 lakh doses of Covishield vaccine meant to be administered to the population above 45 years of age. Earlier, Chandigarh had received around 1,90,000 doses, out of which 1,66,035 were used, while the wastage was around 4.5%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/vaccine-for-18-chandigarh-awaits-common-policy-on-rates-101619205777963.html
24-04-2021||Delhi||Can allot space if any organisation willing to set up Covid care centre on campus: DU||Amid a surge in cases of coronavirus in the capital, Delhi University officials on Friday said the varsity is ready to allot space if any organisation is willing to set up a Covid care facility for students and staff on the campus. Registrar Vikas Gupta said the university did not have the infrastructure to maintain these Covid care centres and pointed out that there were a lot of specialised requirements to put in place. “Our medical colleges are attached to hospitals so it will not be feasible to use their services for the centre. We have been holding deliberations and are open to offering university space to organisations that may be willing to run it. We can give our grounds and stadiums for this purpose,” he said.So far, the university has run vaccination camps in north and south campus for its teachers and officials.On Thursday, a group of DU teachers had written to the administration asking them to set up Covid care facilities in the wake of increasing cases. “We are facing far worse situation [than last time] and hundreds of teachers and employees are running from pillar to post for a single bed in hospitals. Some of them have lost their precious lives and many of them are struggling. In such a situation, the university should extend help to students, teachers and employees,” said former executive council member Rajesh Jha, a professor at Rajdhani College.Teachers’ group Academics for Action and Development, of which Jha is a member, said it had written to the university administration on the matter last year. “In our earlier emails, we have suggested attaching the university guest houses to World University Services (WUS) health centre and develop the facilities for Covid-infected university employees. Efforts should be made to develop some beds with Level-3 facility, if not more than that. For this purpose, we can seek help from our own medical and nursing colleges,” the teachers’ group said in its letter to the university administration.Several other teachers also said they had pointed out the lack of medical facilities on campus earlier. Pankaj Garg, convener of the Indian National Teachers’ Congress (INTEC), said he had to try for three days to get an RT-PCR test done by a private lab.“A testing centre can be established at least using existing resources so that teachers don’t have to run from pillar to post to get tested. A Covid care centre can be set up because we already have at least 15 doctors at the university’s health centre. These doctors can be used to set up a temporary centre. Mild to moderate cases can be monitored there,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/can-allot-space-if-any-organisation-willing-to-set-up-covid-care-centre-on-campusdu-101619205776810.html

24-04-2021||Delhi||Battle against O2 shortages rages on as hospitals take drastic steps||Hospitals across the city continued to battle an acute shortage of liquid medical oxygen for the fourth consecutive day on Friday, with one facility reducing at least 150 beds from its capacity, another moving court, some others asking patients to leave, and several more sending distress messages to the city’s new control room to handle oxygen supply logistics.According to officials, at least 24 hospitals reached out to the control room set up by the Delhi Disaster Management Authority, which began functioning on Friday to coordinate urgent oxygen supply delivery and routing. The problem, which first began on Tuesday, has remained acute despite the Union government announcing enhancements in the city’s daily oxygen dispatches on Wednesday.The Delhi government-run Rajiv Gandhi Superspeciality hospital in Tahirpur, which faced supply problems for the past two days, on Friday reduced the number of beds from 500 to 350. The DDMA control room had allocated the hospital a quota of 6,000 cubic metres of oxygen. With almost all its beds full, the hospital was using up 8,000-9,000 cubic metres of oxygen.“For the last two days, the oxygen reached us just minutes before we would have dipped into our reserves. Now, the government has allocated us a quota of 6,000 cubic metres which will not be enough to manage all the 500 beds because all are beds are like ICU and use up a lot of oxygen. So, we have reduced the number of beds,” said a senior doctor from the hospital, asking not to be named.A second doctor confirmed the situation, saying: “Over the last two days we stopped new admissions and have been discharging stable patients to reduce the numbers.”In addition to reaching out to the DDMA control room, several hospitals sent SOS messages to government officials, health minister and on Twitter.Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal raised the issue in his meeting with the PM. “People in major pain due to oxygen shortage. We fear a big tragedy may happen due to oxygen shortage and we will never be able to forgive ourselves. Despite being a CM, I am not able to help the people of Delhi. I request you with folded hands to direct all CMs to ensure smooth movement of oxygen tankers coming to Delhi,” he said during the meeting.In the morning, an official at Sir Ganga Ram said 25 of the “sickest” Covid-19 patients had died in the last 24 hours, and the lives of another 60 were at risk due to the oxygen supply, before the head of the hospital issued a statement to say the fatalities were not due to the shortage.“The staff strength of the control room is 10 for an eight-hour shift. The control room has been entrusted with ensuring the quickest supply from sources within the city. Till 6pm, we received 24 calls from hospitals in the city which told us that their oxygen stock would not last for two hours. All distress calls were resolved,” said a senior government official who did not wish to be identified.In Max and Max Smart hospitals in Saket, officials said Friday was a tense day with stocks running precariously low at least thrice, with emergency replenishments arriving in the nick of time.The hospital raised the first SOS around the same time as Sir Ganga Ram hospital in the morning. While Sir Ganga Ram Hospital received 2,000 cubic metres of oxygen, both the Max hospitals together received 2,000 cubic metres. The hospitals had over 700 patients, of which 550 were Covid-19 patients.Both Max hospitals and Sir Ganga Ram ran short of oxygen again at night, before receiving replenishments with minutes to spare.“The hospitals started running low on oxygen and the doctors were on the edge again in the afternoon. And, then again now,” said a Sir Ganga Ram hospital staffer at around 9 pm. The hospital in the morning had decided to stop admissions across its centres in Delhi-NCR, but then rescinded the order.Batra hospital in Tughlakabad Institutional Area too reported a tense day, and approached the Delhi high court in the morning. After an SOS message, the hospital received an emergency supply of 700 litres of oxygen as their tanks were about to run dry at 02:30 pm. One-and-a-half hours later, the hospital received another tanker of oxygen, which was first meant to deliver oxygen at 10pm the previous night.“They were supposed to give us 4,000 litres of oxygen but they gave us only 1,700 litres. We need around 7,000 litres of oxygen a day. And, in the last 30 hours we have received only received 1,000 litres of oxygen,” said Dr SCL Gupta, medical director of the hospital. “We had to cancel all non-emergency surgeries. A patient had travelled here from Kashmir for a heart surgery that is extremely important; we had to send him back,” he said.By night, the hospital was again running low on stock. The Delhi HC asked hospitals and nursing homes to first approach the nodal officer at the control room.Holy Family hospital, which had to raise an alarm on Thursday, sought help on Friday morning as well after which it received an emergency 500 litre of oxygen. “All our staff was waiting in the ICU with bated breaths looking at the oxygen monitor to see whether the levels were running low, whether they had to take over. We had also put the oxygen cylinders in the manifold room so that it could take over if the oxygen ran out. But, with the unprecedented use of oxygen, we did not know how long these could run,” said Dr Sumit Ray, medical superintendent of the hospital.For the second day in a row, Aakash hospital too had to raise an alarm. The hospital received 14-hours of supply 2.5 hours after they ran out. “We have been managing with cylinders we have; getting them refilled and using them again,” the hospital spokesperson said.The situation was more serious for Indian Spinal Injury Centre, which has at least 100 beds on oxygen cylinders, which they ran out of. “We managed to get 18 cylinders through our contacts. Now, we are moving more of our patients to the central gas pipeline run by the liquid medical oxygen where we have stock till morning,” said Jasleen Kaur, the hospital’s head of marketing and communications.Late on Friday, Jaipur Golden hospital issued an SOS on social media saying it had run out of oxygen and switched to oxygen cylinders that the hospital estimated would last for 30 minutes. The hospital has received news that a tanker was being diverted from BSA hospital.After receiving almost no oxygen in 24 hours, officials at Metro hospital in Preet Vihar said they were thinking of discharging patients. “We have been running using refilled cylinder so far. We are waiting to hear from our oxygen supplier, if we do not hear from them soon we will have to ask the patients to look for beds elsewhere,” said a senior official from the hospital, asking not to be named.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/battle-against-o2-shortages-rages-on-as-hospitals-take-drastic-steps-101619205656866.html

24-04-2021||Chandigarh||No weekend lockdown in Chandigarh; night curfew from 9pm||Amid a series of flip-flops this week, the Chandigarh administration on Friday decided against imposing weekend lockdown in the city. Also, the timings of the night curfew were changed yet again. It will now be imposed from 9pm to 5am. No gathering or non-essential travel will be allowed during this period.The administration had imposed curfew in the city last weekend after a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases. This Tuesday, while announcing a one-day lockdown on Ram Navami, the administration also decided to continue with the weekend curfew and extended the night curfew timings by two hours (8pm to 5am). The latter decision was rolled back on Thursday (10pm to 5am), only to be revised once again on Friday, when the administration was also to take up a proposal for a longer lockdown in the city.The latest developments come after the business and industrial community expressed strong resentment to the fresh curbs. The Chandigarh Beopar Mandal has been organising a chain of protests in prominent markets. A delegation had also met the UT adviser on Thursday to register its opposition.Even Prime Minister Narendra Modi in his address to the nation on Tuesday had stressed that there was a need to prevent the country from entering another lockdown. “I urge states to use lockdown only as a last resort,” he had said. Indicating a change in the administration’s strategy, UT adviser Manoj Parida said on Friday: “We are balancing between lives and livelihood. Lockdown will be always the last option. Corona crisis may not end soon; so trade and industry must be given some window for operation. Infection containment is difficult since it seems the virus is airborne. Vaccination of 80% population to create herd immunity is the only answer.”Other decisionsThe decisions were taken in the Covid review meeting chaired by UT administrator VP Singh Badnore.It was also decided that Sukhna Lake will remain closed at weekends, which was already notified days before the weekend curfew was imposed last Friday. Museums, libraries, gyms and spas will also continue to remain closed, as already ordered.The estate office, sub-registrar office and Registration and Licensing Authority, where several Covid-19 cases have been detected, will remain closed for a week (till April 30).Keeping in view the risk of spread of infection in hostels, the administration has directed all educational institutes to ensure that only those students are allowed to stay whose need is “essential and unavoidable”. The heads of institutes must ensure that the students are properly tested and their claims verified, said a senior official.Industries will be allowed to operate at night, but have to follow necessary Covid protocol within their campuses. The management will be responsible if any violation is reported.During the meeting, Badnore also stressed on intensifying patrolling to challan violators, creating more awareness among people, beefing up testing and vaccination drives, and ensuring availability of life-saving drugs in the city by preventing black marketing.Meanwhile, the Chandigarh Congress criticised the administration for its failure to take political parties on board while deciding on lockdowns. “The administration seems confused over the matter and is passing contrary orders every other day, making people more confused,” said party chief Subhash Chawla.

The education department had asked schools to submit the data required for UDISE by April 26. Teachers have, however, requested the department to grant them an extension to fill the details. With a state-wide lockdown in effect, teachers said they are not able to travel to their respective schools amid Covid-19 travel restrictions. Teachers said that while they can fill and enter the data from home, they do not have access to the documents required for the purpose. “We cannot travel in the current situation. A lot of material that is required to collect and collate data, including service books and student records, are in the school. We thus hope to get an extension,” said Anil Bornare from the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) teachers’ cell. “We do not want to risk our lives going to school at the moment,” said another teacher. Officials from the education department said that an extension can be given in case it is required. “We will look into the issue and see what can be done,” said an official from the department. While schools and colleges remain closed across the state, teachers are occasionally being called to school for work as per some teachers. Teachers now hope that the department announces summer break so that they can prepare for the upcoming semester.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-teachers-request-extension-to-file-data-for-centre-s-school-portal-101619205116780.html
24-04-2021||Other||Vijayan asks PM for free doses of vaccine||Thiruvananthapuram As Kerala reported its highest single-day spike, clocking 28,447 Covid-19 cases in the last 24 hours, chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to tweak the proposed vaccine policy and ensure free doses to the overburdened state.Talking to reporters in the state capital, the CM said in the virtual meeting chaired by the PM, he appraised him about the shortage of vaccine and told him that the new policy will put extra burden on the state, which is already reeling under the impact of the pandemic. He expressed hope the Union government will take a proactive decision on the issue.“In India, major vaccines were distributed free of cost. When the country is going through a difficult situation, it is not proper to impose a fee on vaccine. Three-level price mechanism is really intriguing. Hope the PM will realise this and will have a rethink,” the CM said, adding that most of the states expressed similar view in the meeting. Vijayan said the state will need ₹1,300 crore to meet the vaccine bill, if the Centre insists for fee.He said the state cannot wait interminably for doses and it will chalk out a plan to buy directly from the market. “For herd immunity, vaccination is important. We want to carry it out as quickly as possible to contain the surge. In the state, only 11% people were exposed to the virus, so we have to act fast,” the CM said, adding that despite mounting cases, the state maintained the lowest case fatality rate of 0.39% in the country.The state reported 28,477 new cases on Friday, taking the active caseload in Kerala to 178,983, according to health department data. The test positivity rate in state was reported at 21.78%. With 27 fatalities, death toll in Kerala climbed up to 5,055. Ernakulam district topped the list with 4,548 cases. Vijayan also lauded people for contributing to the CM’s relief fund to foot expenses of the vaccine. “It is really heart-warming. On Friday also, we received more than ₹1 crore towards this. This shows spirit of the people. We will make a separate fund for this and use it only for vaccine,” he said.Stating that the second wave in Kerala was critical, the CM said the government will do everything possible to save lives. “It is more than what we expected. There is no short cut but people will have to go by the restrictions. If we work in unison we can overcome this like last year,” Vijayan said, adding the weekend restrictions will be on the lines of lockdown. The government has also called an all-party meet on Monday. He said decision on further restrictions will be decided after the meeting.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/vijayan-asks-pm-for-free-doses-of-vaccine-101619205057430.html

Unlike the usual pomp and thunderous cheers of spectators -- who enjoy the ensemble of percussion instruments and parade of 80-odd, caparisoned elephants -- this time, Pooram was restricted to mere rituals. The entry was restricted to only artists, temple board members, mahouts and others involved in the rituals of the festival. Earlier, the temple body and many Hindu outfits had insisted for a regular festival, citing the just- concluded assembly elections, but after several rounds of discussion, all agreed to limit the festival to mere rituals. The lack of spectators, however, failed to dampen the grandeur of the visual spectacle. The Pandi Melam led by maestro Peruvanam Kuttan Marar enthralled the festival, which was live streamed by many channels. Thiruvambadi temple only paraded only one elephant, but Paramekavu Devi temple brought 15 jumbos and Kudamattom, the change of colourful parasols in quick succession, added to the grandeur. “We are forced to limit festivities in view of the pandemic situation. But many artists complained that spectators are real fuel for them. We hope these dark clouds will vanish by next year,” said G Rajesh, secretary of the Paramekavu, one of the lead temples participating in the Pooram.The largest cultural pageant of the state, Pooram was started in the late 18th century by erstwhile King of Kochi, Sakthan Thamburan. Every year, the festival is held at Vadukunathan temple in Thrissur. But last year, it was not held in view of the pandemic situation. Usually, more than two million devotees take part in the 10-day celebration, which culminates with a musical ensemble and grand fireworks. It is also a major tourist attraction of the state. But over the last two years, pandemic has taken sheen out of the festival.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/thirrsur-pooram-celebrated-without-pomp-amid-covid-101619204936850.html

The Centre has distributed only 300 tonnes to the state. If the same continues, we will be in a situation to close down several health centres,” according to a statement by the chief minister’s office (CMO). PM Modi on Friday held a review meeting with several Covid-19 impacted states in the country, including Karnataka that has seen a sharp spike in cases on account of the surge in Bengaluru. Karnataka has over 2 lakh active cases, with Bengaluru accounting for more than half of these, according to government data. Both the state and its capital have registered record numbers in the past week and the surge is expected to peak in the first week of May, according to experts. An analysis by the Hindustan Times estimates that if the same growth rate continues, Bengaluru will soon start reporting around 25,000 new infections every day, further stretching the already overworked and inadequate healthcare infrastructure in the city. The growing number of cases in Bengluru has led to chaos across the city, with families of Covid-19 patients, who required hospitalistaion, running from hospital-to-hospital to get their loved ones admitted. Several people have died on the footsteps of hospitals after being denied admission and several others continue to wait outside these private and public medical facilities in the hope that they will be attended at some point, experts pointed out. Though the fatalitiy rate remains under 0.5%, the higher number of infections means that a higher number of people require hopsitalisation, experts said. Meanwhile, Bengaluru is rapidly running out hospital beds. According to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP), there are just 1,496 hospital beds available in the city. Of these, only 21 beds with intensive care units (ICU) or those with ventilators, as on 5.10 pm on Friday, according to BBMP’s central bed management system. With only 2 ICU-V beds remaining in government hospitals, they saw an occupancy of 97.14%, as pet BBMP data. The occupancy rates in private medical colleges for ICU and ICU-V were at 99.03% and 94.92%, respectively, while the same were 94.77% and 97.41% in private hospitals, according to BBMP data. The chief minister has requested the Centre for supply of 1,471 tonne of oxygen per day and 200,000 doses of remdesivir for the next 10 days, according to the CMO. He, however, told the PM that Karnataka had adequate number of hospitals beds but were only running out of oxygen and critical life-saving drugs. “Karnataka has got adequate beds to manage Covid patients. At this rate we will face problems in the coming days to manage serious cases. We have permitted opening of step-down hospitals to decrease the load on hospitals. We are also considering setting up Field Hospitals with ICU facilities,” according to the CMO statement. “The hospital bed situation is dynamic, and more beds are being added every day. So, this should not be a problem,” a member of the technical advisory committee (TAC) on Covid-19 in the state said, requesting not to be named. The opposition parties and general public, however, have hit out at the lack of preparedness by the Yediyurappa government despite being warned in November last year by the TAC of an imminent second wave in Bengaluru and Karnataka. “It is increasingly becoming difficult to answer phone calls calling for help with beds, oxygen & remdesivir. Helplessness is creeping in, but one must keep trying. Govt has just given up on citizens & is manipulating data & headlines. If this continues, “Ab ki baar, Antim Sanskar”,” Priyank Kharge, the Congress legislator from Kalaburagi, posted on Twitter.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-shortage-will-force-many-health-centres-to-shut-karnataka-cm-to-pm-modi-101619204757509.html
24-04-2021||Other||Bombay HC rejects pre-arrest bail of 6 army men accused of colleague’s murder||The Bombay high court (HC) recently rejected the anticipatory bail application (ABA) of six army personnel booked for the alleged murder of their colleague. The case was registered by the victim’s wife as she doubted the claims of the colleagues that the man had died by drowning while they were at a picnic. The court held that as the circumstances surrounding the death of the man needed to be ascertained and the custodial interrogation of the six accused was necessary, their ABA cannot be granted. The single bench of justice Sarang Kotwal, while hearing the bail applications filed by the six personnel working in the army, was informed by advocate Gaurav Parkar that they were the friends of army man Ganesh Thokal and that there was no animosity among them. Parkar submitted that Thokal died during a picnic, and if there was any dispute among them, he would not have accompanied the accused. According to the first information report (FIR) filed by Thokal’s wife Rupali, her husband had joined the army in 2003 and retired in July 2020, following which the couple started living in Ahmednagar district’s Kamargaon. When the friends had visited the couple, Thokal asked one of the accused, Bhagwan Yadav, to return the ₹1 lakh which the latter owed the victim. A dispute arose between them as Yadav was allegedly not returning the amount. Last September, Yadav called Thokal to Pune and the accused and the victim went to picnic at Murud-Kashid. In her complaint, Rupali stated that she spoke to Thokal over the phone twice, but he did not respond to a third call on the next day. The day after that, Thokal’s body was brought home in an ambulance, and Rupali was told that her husband had drowned while swimming. However, a black mark on Thokal’s eye and neck prompted Rupali to doubt the reason stated behind her husband’s death and she lodged a murder complaint against the six men. When the ABA came up for hearing, the bench sought the opinion of the medical officer on the injury marks. The medical officer submitted that when Thokal’s body was brought out of the water, it did not have the marks and that it did not occur due to post-mortem procedure. “These bruises appear after sustaining injury by blunt force application. Sometimes ecchymosis [bruise] may not appear until after death. Sometimes, they are delayed by one or two days. When a contusion has been caused a few hours or a day before death, they do not occur due to post-mortem violence,” said the report. Based on the opinion of the medical officer, justice Kotwal observed that the injury near the eye was as a result of blunt force and needed to be investigated. As there was a dispute between the victim and one of the accused over money, the reason and circumstances leading to Thokal’s death would require custodial interrogation and hence, their ABA was being rejected. The court also vacated the interim protection from arrest considering the seriousness of the incident and the urgent need for custodial interrogation, and disposed of the applications.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bombay-hc-rejects-pre-arrest-bail-of-6-army-men-accused-of-colleague-s-murder-101619204756893.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra’s worry: How to get 110 million vaccine doses for all?||With 57.1 million people from the 18-44 age group added to the existing list of 33.8 million Covid vaccine beneficiaries, the biggest worry for the state government is procuring the stock to put the drive on fast track. The state will need more than 110 million vaccine doses for inoculation of the age group, the onus of procurement of which is on the government. The authorities, after tapping the possibilities of procurement from two vaccine manufacturing companies, are apprehensive about the availability of doses. The state authorities are also wary about the high rates ascertained for the vaccines. “During our meeting with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday, we have demanded One Nation One Rate of the vaccine, so we could easily implement the vaccination drive aggressively. Not only Maharashtra, most chief ministers who attended the video conference have demanded this. The state has its own financial constraints, although we will bear the cost of inoculation for the poor. The reduction in rates will help us vaccinate more people for free, otherwise we will have to restrict free inoculation to the poor. In that case, we will try and rope in corporate houses and private sector,” said state health minister Rajesh Tope. Tope said in the absence of availability of stock, the state may not be able to achieve its target of aggressive inoculation. “The Serum Institute of India has expressed inability to supply the stock until May 24. We have been talking to Bharat Biotech. The decision over implementation of the third phase of inoculation and free vaccination for the poor based on the financial burden will be taken in the cabinet meeting,” he said. Congress leader and public works department minister Ashok Chavan has demanded the same rate of vaccine for states and Centre. He said that if the states are forced to buy the vaccines at ₹400 a dose, the burden on the state exchequer will be more than ₹4,000 crore. According to the officials from the public health department, the decision over the cover of free vaccination will depend on the rates finalised after discussions with manufacturers. “Covishield will cost ₹400 a dose, if the negotiations fail, but the rates for Covaxin are not known as yet. Similarly, we will have to check the burden of imported doses too. If the Centre does not help us on negotiation of rates, we will have to cover a limited number of families in low-income groups. The cabinet will take a call on whether to cover only 2.5 million families in Antyoday scheme under the National Food Security Act for free vaccination or extend it to more families. In that scenario, we will rope in private sector to a large extent to reduce the burden, but it will hamper our target of aggressive vaccination,” the official said. The official said the state expects the Centre to bear the cost of inoculation of all above 45 years and health care as well as frontline workers from all age groups. Tope said the Maharashtra government has already demanded permission from the Centre for import of vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Sputnik to tide over the shortage of the ones in domestic markets. According to officials, the import of the vaccines may take a few more months as manufacturers have orders lined up from other countries. Maharashtra has been facing a shortage of the vaccines, hindering its aim of inoculating more than 600,000 people every day. Amid the shortage, the inoculation rate in the state has dwindled. From 2,590,405 doses administered in the first week of the month (April 2-8), the number dropped to 2,053,123 (April 9-15) and further to 2,043,725 over the last one week (April 16-22). This means, the daily average of inoculation dropped to 291,961 over last week, from 370,058 in the first week of the month. The shortage has resulted in shutting down of many centres in Mumbai, Navi Mumbai and other parts of the state. The state has so far received, 14,416,780 doses from the Centre till April 20, against which 13,980,023 doses have been administered to 12.17 million people till 5pm on Friday. The officials said the infrastructure for vaccination would not be a problem for the government. “We have a robust network of inoculation centres which can be ramped up to 9,000 from the existing 4,200 by converting the sub-centres to full-fledged centres. We have sub-centres at every four villages, with trained community health officers and Auxiliary Nurse Midwives,” said the official. He said the modalities about the charges at public and private facilities for inoculation and the ratio of the supply of vaccines between these two are yet to be finalised. Tope said the state has a daily capacity of inoculation of 8 lakh against which they are restricted to less than 3 lakh doses a day, due to unavailability.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtras-worry-how-to-get-110-million-vaccine-doses-for-all-101619204636829.html

Karnataka health minister on Friday retreated that the government has written to the central government on Wednesday putting for their demand. Talking about the situation in the state, the minister said there is a need for even though the state has been allotted 300 tonnes, the current requirement has doubled to 600 tonnes. “We are requesting for 1,500 tonnes since we think the requirement for oxygen will increase in May,” he said. Adding that the Karnataka government also set up a control room to monitor the supply of oxygen cylinders, he said there is no shortage of oxygen in the state and proactive measures are being taken by the state. “We have deployed 26 officials to operate the control room and a call centre with a mobile number (89517-55722) for the supply of oxygen and Remdesivir to hospitals. The process is now streamlined,” he said. Meanwhile, Dr HM Prasanna, president of Private Hospitals and Nursing Home Associations (PHANA), said that he had submitted a list of 56 hospital facing a severe shortage of oxygen. “There are hospitals from Bengaluru, Kalaburagi, Ballari and other places in this list. We feel there is an issue with oxygen supply not reaching the vendors who refill oxygen,” he said. On Saturday, Bangalore Institute of Gastroenterology (BIG) in Jayanagar had to transfer out three of the eight COVID-19 patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) of the hospital after their oxygen supply ran out. On the same day, St. Philomena Hospital in Vivek Nagar also reported a shortage of oxygen supply, however, they were able to replenish the stock by evening. However, minister Sudhakar said that there is no shortage of oxygen in the state and there was a problem with storage, especially at the smaller hospitals. “Many hospitals, especially the smaller ones, don’t have enough storage facilities. They are mostly storing oxygen in small cylinders, and they have a requirement to refill multiple times in a day, this is leading a shortage,” said Sudhakar. He added that JSW has agreed to give 400 tonnes of oxygen for Karnataka and the state is procuring 5,000 cylinders to cater for the oxygen needs. Talking about the black market in the state, he added that The Health Department on Wednesday initiated action against Assistant Drugs Controller BR Venkatesh and placed him under suspension for creating artificial scarcity of the vital drug. On Friday, Bengaluru reported 16, 662 new Covid-19 cases, taking the total active cases to 1,49,624.

The chief minister also said the vaccination drive from May 1 for those above 18 years of age would be free of cost and the committee under the UP finance minister would make a detailed plan for the campaign from May 1. “The committee will establish a dialogue with vaccine companies to make the vaccination drive successful,” he said at a Covid-19 review meeting. He asked the officers concerned to act sternly against such people who were engaged in black-marketeering of oxygen and medicines, spreading rumours, and trying to vitiate the atmosphere. “Invoke the Gangsters Act, the National Security Act and even attach their properties,” Yogi Adityanath said. “It is heartening that in the last 24 hours, 22,000 patients have recovered from the disease and if we stick to the Covid appropriate behaviour and follow the mantra of test, trace, and treat, then we will attain victory over the virus,” he added. There should not be any discrimination in the distribution of Remdesivir and other lifesaving Covid drugs, he added. He also said the medicine distribution system required improvement. He asked officers concerned that people should not be overcharged for Covid-19 tests and treatment.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/vaccination-to-continue-during-weekend-corona-curfew-yogi-101619204516779.html

Earlier this week, the state government had declared night (9 pm to 6 am) and weekend curfews (9 pm on Friday to 6 am on Monday) in the state from April 21. On Friday, the restrictions in the city and other parts of Karnataka were turned into a partial lockdown after shops and establishments that are not listed in the government’s Thursday order as ‘essential services’ were asked to shut down operations. “The weekend curfew will be similar to that of last year’s lockdown imposed across the state. Barricades would be erected on main roads, sub-main roads and ward roads, and unnecessary movement of people would be strictly restricted,” Bommai said. As per the fresh guidelines issued on Friday, essential services such as sale of groceries, milk and meat will be allowed between 6 am and 10 am on weekends. Only takeaways will be allowed at restaurants. During the weekdays, government offices and industries dealing with essential and emergency services will be allowed to function and their employees will be required to carry valid ID cards to commute within the city. Patients, their attendants and those wanting to take the vaccine will also be allowed to travel both during the weekend and weekdays till May 4. The remaining industries that were earlier allowed during the weekdays, will now remain shut till May 4. The government, which had earlier banned all constructions, on Friday clarified that constructions within an enclosed site will be allowed during this period. The Bangalore Metro Rail Corporation Limited (BMRCL) announced that metro services will remain shut on Saturdays and Sundays. Modifying the timings for weekdays, it said that the service will begin as usual at 7 am but the last train from terminal stations — Nagasandra, Silk Institute, Mysuru Road and Baiyappanahalli — will leave at 7.30 pm. Long-distance travel in trains, buses and flights, taxis and private vehicles to and from these transport hubs will be allowed to ply on the production of valid travel documents till May 4. Marriages with an upper limit of 50 guests and funerals with a maximum gathering of 20 individuals will be allowed during this period. Several shopkeepers across the city expressed dissatisfaction over the latest guidelines. “We understand the need for a lockdown but it cannot be implemented like this. There was no warning. The government has said that there will be no lockdown but abruptly closed down shops,” Mahantesh R, member of the shop owners’ association in Avenue Road in Bengaluru, said.“People have taken orders and purchased raw materials for it as well. When a lockdown is announced like this, we will suffer losses. The government could have given us time to prepare, considering so many meetings were held,” he added. Taking a u-turn on his earlier statement, chief minister B S Yediyurappa last week ruled out the possibility of a lockdown. “There is no question of a lockdown,” he told reporters in Bidar, a day after he said that a complete shutdown could be enforced if required. Despite his final statement, the fear of a final lockdown continued to loom over several businesses. “We are hearing that there could be a full lockdown after May 4. Even though the chief minister had said there won’t be a lockdown, looking at the government’s actions, we are concerned,” Peter Antony, a shopkeeper in Bengaluru’s SP road, said. The state on Friday registered 26,296 cases, taking the overall tally to 1046,554. With 190 deaths in a single day, the overall figure rose to 14,075.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/restrictions-across-state-to-continue-till-may-4-karnataka-home-minister-101619204456758.html

In nine districts of Meerut and Saharanpur divisions, a total of 4817 persons were tested positive on Thursday. The rising number of Covid cases in different districts of the region are increasing at an alarming rate. Currently, the Meerut district is witnessing the maximum number of positive cases, as per the health department records.For the first time, as many as 1634 persons out of 6635 were tested positive for Covid-19, as per the health department statistics. This shows the gravity of infection in the district as every 4th person is now infected with the virus. The health department daily bulletin shares that 3718 persons are under home isolation and so far 435 persons succumbed. Despite that, the number of cremations at Surajkund cremation ground here shows disparity with the number of deaths declared by the health department. Dinesh Jain, secretary of Ganga Motor Committee, caretaker of the cremation ground, claimed that 57 dead bodies were cremated at Surajkund on Wednesday out of which 35 were cremated with Covid protocol. “The cremation ground is overloaded,” he said. On contrary to this, the health department bulletins mentioned only 2 deaths by Covid on Wednesday. The assistant municipal commissioner Brijpal Singh said that deaths in Meerut are more because the critical patients referred from neighbouring districts in LLRM Medical college also get cremated here, after they succumb to coronavirus. Singh said that Nagar Nigam has now deputed its staff at the cremation ground to segregate hospital-wise deaths. “It would help us in keeping a separate database of deaths occurred in the district and outside districts,” said Singh.Meanwhile, the chief medical officer (CMO) of Meerut Akhilesh Mohan has released a list of 30 hospitals and 2952 beds available for the treatment of corona patients in these hospitals. The list also carries names of nodal officers in respective hospitals with their contact numbers. The situation in other districts is also alarming where the numbers of positive cases are on the rise. In Muzaffarnagar 432 persons were tested positive, 286 in Saharanpur, 249 in Shamli, 190 in Bagpat, 299 in Bulandshahar, 174 in Hapur, 1023 in Ghaziabad and 530 in Noida. Dr Anil Nausran, a senior pathologist and former secretary of IMA said that it is now clear that coronavirus is now spreading in the community as cases have also started coming from villages. “We were passing through a tough time,” said Dr Nausran who suggested that government should immediately allow all qualified doctors for the treatment of Covid patients. “Qualified doctors know how to save lives of people therefore they should be allowed to treat patients,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/with-1634-new-cases-meerut-records-highest-one-day-spike-101619204396736.html
24-04-2021||Other||Maharashtra: Nagpur hospitals grapple with oxygen shortage||Nagpur’s beleaguered healthcare infrastructure is grappling with multiple challenges, from a steady rise in coronavirus patients to a shortage of oxygen, hospital beds and anti-viral drug Remdesivir. Nagpur needs 180 metric tonnes (MT) of medical grade oxygen; at present it’s only able to generate 146 MT, and was able to procure some from other sources, including a supplier in Bhilai. However, a Central ministry order dated April 18 cut down the supply from the Bhilai supplier, Prax Air, from 110MT to 60MT following which the Vidarbha region – which requires at least 266.5MT of oxygen --- was facing a shortfall of at least 100 MT. This even prompted the Nagpur bench of Bombay high court (HC) to pull up the state and Centre for the prevailing mess, particularly on oxygen and Remdesivir shortage. This has hit urban centres like Nagpur hard: the district has the state’s second-highest case fatality rate (CFR; percentage of deaths per 100 cases) at 0.95% and the highest test positivity rate (TPR; number of positive cases per 100 tests) at 34%. On April 20, two private hospitals asked relatives to shift patients over oxygen shortage. However, district collector Ravindra Thakare stepped in an assured oxygen supply following which the families did not have to scramble for new beds. Viveka Hospital had 47 patients on oxygen with 10 in the ICU while Nucleus Mother and Child Super Speciality Hospital on Wardha Road had 62 patients on oxygen.“The current stock will suffice for one and half hour from now (20.00 hours). We are forced to evacuate patients as our oxygen supply has been reduced to 120 cylinders only. We will be informing patients’ relatives shortly to make appropriate arrangements for shifting their patients. This is for your kind information and attention as we are too helpless,” said Priyanka Pawar, manager administration, Viveka Hospital, Nagpur in a social media group of doctors and officials of district administration. This led the district collector to take prompt action and the hospital got oxygen cylinders next morning. Dr Prashant Jagtap of Viveka Multispecialty Hospital in west Nagpur said the management was planning to discharge about 100 patients (60 on Covid beds and 40 on non-Covid) because of shortage of oxygen. “Oxygen was short in supply, but the issue was later resolved with the intervention of the collector and officials of Nagpur Municipal Corporation,” he said. “Now we are managing it somehow,” Jagtap said. Dr Anup Marar, convenor of the Vidarbha Hospital Association, said the oxygen shortage has reached alarming levels in Nagpur. “Without oxygen, we are clueless how to continue treatment of patients who are currently admitted,” he said. Dr Marar, who is also the director of Orange City Hospital, said that it is getting increasingly difficult to run the hospital without adequate oxygen. “We have 81 Covid beds along with 10 ventilator supports. But we have no backup of oxygen cylinders. Without extra cylinders, how can we save the patients if the supply is not replenished in time?” he asked. Nagpur is able to generate about 146MT of oxygen daily, but its requirement is around 166.5MT, the collector Ravindra Thakare informed the HC. Thus, even government facilities are not much better off. Dr Sudhir Gupta, dean of government medical college said that they are just about able to manage the 900-odd Covid beds in the facility. “Yes, we are facing shortage of oxygen. But our prime problem is to provide beds to needy and here we are unable to do it in time because of our limitations,” he pointed out. Retired state electricity board employee Shivshankar Walundare (71) succumbed to Covid-19 early Thursday morning after he was unable to find an oxygen bed for the last five days. His son Kunal (39), a real estate broker said that his father tested positive eight days ago. “As his oxygen level was below 80, we were frantically looking for a hospital bed with oxygen. But we got none either in a government or a private hospital,” he said. All members of his family, including his mother, sister and himself, were also infected with the virus. Krishna Maske, a friend of the family who is also Covid positive, learnt about the availability of a bed with oxygen at in a private hospital Bhandara, 65 km from Nagpur, on April 20 evening. “We immediately arranged an ambulance with an oxygen cylinder and headed to Bhandara,” he said. There, the hospital denied admitting Walundare, because his O2 level was now 75, Maske said. By this time, Walundare’s condition had worsened, and he was in dire need of an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) bed with a ventilator; but he was only able to get an oxygen bed in municipality-run Covid centre at Umred on Wednesday evening, and that too with the help of a local politician. “It was too late and Shivshankar breathed his last early this morning,” Maske said. Another hospital at Chhatrapati Square on Wardha Road, Nucleus Mother and Child Superspeciality Hospital, reportedly put a notice on April 20 evening, requesting family members of those patients on oxygen support, to shift them to another facility. The notice was widely shared on social media. A doctor from the hospital, who wished to remain anonymous said, 62 patients were on oxygen beds. “We had a stock of only 40 jumbo cylinders since morning. We requested the collector and many others for additional stock but in vain. After our request, relatives of three patients took them to other hospitals. Now, the collector has assured of supply. Treatment will continue provided we get the supply,” he said. As the plight of the common man continues, the guardian minister for Nagpur district, Nitin Raut, claimed that they are trying their level best with various sources to meet the demand. The district collector, Ravindra Thakare said that the situation of Nagpur is slowing under control. “We are hopeful that the shortage of oxygen and other Covid medicines would be resolved within a day or two,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-nagpur-hospitals-grapple-with-oxygen-shortage-101619204337783.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body’s new protocol: Covid bed only after check-up at home||In order to ensure effective bed management, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday decided to allocate symptomatic Covid-19 patients a bed only after examination by its medical staff at the patient’s home. For this, BMC issued a new protocol to be followed on admitting Covid-19 patients at hospitals.According to BMC officials, all 24 wards have been directed to form a team of 10 medical staff including doctors who will visit patients’ houses and check their parameters in order to understand the type of bed required for admission.In a statement issued on Friday, BMC said, “From Sunday onwards, all symptomatic Covid patients will be allotted beds only after medical examination, which will be carried out by civic doctors and officials who will visit the patient’s home. The new protocol for Covid patient’s hospital admission was issued by municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal.”The statement added, “The coordination for the visit of doctors to Covid patient’s home will be done by the respective ward war room. The team of 10 medical staff in each ward will also be provided with a separate ambulance. The visit will be done between 7am and 11pm. However, for the period of 11pm to 7am, the patient will be brought to the nearest jumbo Covid-19 centre and will be tested and admitted, accordingly.”According to BMC officials, this way, patients will be allotted beds as per their need and medical condition, and not just based on their explanation or narration of their medical condition.A BMC official said, “In the past few days, the number of Covid-19 patients has increased and there are reports that patients are having difficulty getting a bed. The BMC helpline number 1916 was earlier getting around 2,500 calls daily, but that has now gone up to around 5,000 calls a day. This step will help in ensuring effective bed allocation.”According to BMC’s dashboard, of the total 21,331 beds in dedicated Covid centres and hospitals, 3,812 are available. In terms of occupancy ratio, the occupancy rate for ICU beds is 98.51%, ventilators is 98.55% and oxygenated beds is 92%.However, doctors claim that the process of allocating a bed only after a medical check-up might not be feasible in case of emergencies. Dr Siddarth Paliwal, city-based physician, said around 240 staff will have to visit every symptomatic patient which is around 1,000 patients daily. In this case, if the patient is facing an emergency situation, we might be losing crucial time in making him wait at his or her home. The BMC will have to make exceptions in case of emergency for those who need urgent stabilisation process.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-s-new-protocol-covid-bed-only-after-check-up-at-home-101619204216673.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||At 773, Maharashtra sees highest one-day Covid-19 death toll||The state on Friday recorded 66,836 new Covid-19 cases and 773 deaths — the highest one-day toll since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the state last year. Meanwhile, in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases and the recent oxygen leakages and fires in hospitals, the state government has ordered fire and oxygen audit for all the hospitals across the state.In addition, the state government has also given oxygen tankers the status of an ambulance, to facilitate faster movement of oxygen.The decision for audit was taken due to two major incidents, oxygen leakage at a Nashik hospital which claimed 24 lives and the Vasai fire incident where 13 patients were found dead.Maharashtra chief secretary Sitaram Kunte in a meeting on Friday ordered all hospitals to undertake fire audit and immediately rectify all the defects pointed in the audit. In addition, he also ordered an oxygen audit to ensure that leakages are plugged and that there is a proper upkeep of all the parts of the equipment. He has also mandated police security for all vehicles transporting oxygen cylinders and prohibited officials from diverting them.The shortage of hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen as well as Remdesivir, an antiviral drug, continued to hassle Covid-19 patients.At Buldhana, a farmer family took the Covid-19 patient in an ambulance to the zilla parishad office after failing to get a hospital bed in that region. They went through seven such hospitals but to no avail. The act of taking the ambulance at the office sent shockwaves and the patient was finally able to secure a bed in a local hospital.There was a virtual fight for oxygen tanker as both Satara and Kolhapur staked claim for it. The tanker which was stationed at Satara border saw verbal duet between officials of both the cities.Currently, there are 691,851 active patients across the state; of which Pune tops with 116,602 patients followed by Mumbai with 81,174 active patients. The death toll has now reached 63,252 with Mumbai leading with 12,655 deaths followed by Pune 8928.The state government has imposed a total lockdown from Thursday night to contain the surge in Covid-19 cases and deaths.Dr Ameet Mandot, director of Gut Clinic at Parel, said lockdown will only serve to give breathing space to the administration. “The lockdown will serve to put a break on the surge and allow the government to beef up their medical infrastructure. However, this lockdown needs to be implemented stringently along with a crackdown on violations,” said Mandot.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/at-773-maharashtra-sees-highest-one-day-covid-19-death-toll-101619204157363.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai civic body prepares to avoid oxygen emergencies||The Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) on Friday issued a standard operating procedure (SOP) for hospitals to follow to prevent emergencies due to shortage in oxygen availability. BMC also said that oxygen is available in all hospitals in Mumbai, but asked hospitals to use it efficiently.The current demand of oxygen in Mumbai is between 240 metric tonnes and 250 metric tonnes a day. Oxygen storage in city hospitals is replenished every day from two suppliers — Inox and Linde. While municipal hospitals have their own large or mega storage facilities where oxygen is replenished every day or twice a day, depending on demand, private hospitals purchase it directly from suppliers in the market, or can approach BMC from time-to-time in case of emergency.BMC, in its SOP, has asked chief engineers of mechanical and electrical department to prepare a ward-wise data chart of private hospitals, their oxygen suppliers, and quantity of available dura, jumbo and small oxygen cylinders at the hospital. This list will be shared with BMC’s ward war rooms and Food and Drug Administration’s (FDA) Covid control room.Each hospital has to inform their oxygen supplier of the demand 24 hours in advance, or as per their agreement (whichever is earlier). If the supplier does not delivered oxygen within next 16 hours, hospitals have to inform the BMC control room, following which BMC will try to contact the supplier and make oxygen available to the hospital. If it cannot be done within two hours, BMC will inform the FDA control room, which will try to get oxygen delivered from the supplier to the hospital. If this cannot happen in two more hours, FDA will inform the divisional coordinating officer to make oxygen available to the private hospital.Municipal commissioner Iqbal Singh Chahal told HT, “I had informed all hospitals last week itself to conduct an audit of oxygen supply system, oxygen storage and other related things.”On April 21, HJ Doshi Ghatkopar Hindu Mahasabha Hospital in Ghatkopar informed BMC around 5pm that it had oxygen left to last only till 6.30pm. At the time, all 61 patients were on oxygen support. BMC’s N ward delivered 15 jumbo oxygen cylinders and S ward delivered nine jumbo oxygen cylinders to the hospital by 6.15pm, restoring its supply and backup. Meanwhile, the private supplier associated with the hospital also provided four oxygen cylinders. BMC also had ambulances on stand-by in case patients needed to be shifted from the hospital.The next day, BMC officials from N ward held an emergency meeting with the hospital administration and chalked out a plan for setting up oxygen storage facility in its premises, to ensure such a situation does not arise again.Dr Mohan Joshi, dean of Sion hospital, told HT, “Sion hospital has an oxygen storage facility with an original capacity of 15 MT. We doubled this capacity during the pandemic. Oxygen storage is replenished every day or twice a day, as need arises. But we have do not ever exhaust our full storage capacity. In fact, our buffer storage can ensure we will have enough supply to last all patients even if supply is not filled for a day.”P Velarasu, additional municipal commissioner (projects) who created the SOP, said, “Even for suppliers to augment supply to BMC, we are looking for new sources of oxygen procurement.”A spokesperson from LH Hiranandani Hospital said, “We procure our own oxygen from the market.”Dr Bhavik Patel, assistant manager medical operations, Bhatia Hospital in Grant Road, said, “In such a crisis, supply of oxygen is challenging and we formed a strategy to combat it. We, along with our supply vendor, started to monitor the levels on an hourly basis, which helped us avoid shortage as we have enough buffer time in placing orders and getting delivery. We also kept a manifold system which gives back up for six hours. Also, we changed focus on reducing oxygen consumption in our hospital. This was done by us as we are postponing elective surgeries and elective diagnostic procedures which contributed sustainably in daily oxygen consumption.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-prepares-to-avoid-oxygen-emergencies-101619204037395.html

The cell then had to conduct a third-party audit to recheck information shared by students at the time of registration, leading to further delay. After three online rounds, the final institutional rounds concluded in the second week of April.In a press statement, Samant stated that the government has taken into consideration the delay in conducting admissions for law courses, and will give them extra time to complete their curriculum and exam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/maharashtra-cet-cell-to-hold-additional-admission-rounds-for-3-year-llb-course-101619203857088.html

After completing his training from Nashik Police Training Academy in 1996, he was first posted at Oshiwara police station as a sub-inspector. Two years later, he was posted in Mumbai crime branch’s unit 8 at Dharavi. In 2001, he was transferred to the crime intelligence unit (CIU). Mane was placed under suspension for two years in early 2000s after the anti-corruption bureau (ACB), Mumbai, registered a case against him in a bribery case. He was later reinstated and posted in the local arms division and then in 2005, transferred to the anti-terrorism squad’s (ATS) unit in Juhu. During his posting at the unit, he completed his LLB from a Vile Parle-based college. Mane was promoted as assistant police inspector in 2008 and became came to limelight in January 2009, after arresting senior IPS (Indian Police Service) officer Saji Mohan in a drugs case.

Hiran is linked to the explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence Antilia on February 25, an incident that ballooned into a huge political controversy, eventually resulting in the exit of the state’s home minister.An NIA officer who asked not to be named said the agency summoned Mane for interrogation in connection with the Antilia and murder cases on Thursday and placed him under arrest on Friday.He was produced before special judge Rahul R Bhosle. Advocate Prakash Shetty, appearing for NIA said the federal agency requested Mane’s custody to recover his phone and other personal devices and also to obtain his call data records. The agency claimed Mane was a part of the conspiracy to kill Hiran and had confessed to his role in the murder.Mane’s counsel advocate Aditya Gore opposed the remand, claiming that his client was not involved in the murder and that the agency has no evidence against him, except his purpoted confession.The special court accepted Shetty’s contention and remanded Mane to NIA custody.The court also extended the judicial custody of two other accused, suspended police officer Sachin Vaze and his colleague at crime branch’s criminal intelligence unit (CIU) Riyazuddin Kazi, till May 5.Mane was in charge of unit 11 of the crime branch till recently. He was transferred as a part of the clean-up drive undertaken by police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, after Vaze was arrested by NIA in the cases and posted at the local arms branch.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the explosives case, but removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV, and reported it stolen on February 17, 2021. Hiran himself was found dead in a creek on March 5. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car in November and returned it in early February.NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and the murder case on March 24. Vaze was named the main accused in both.To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred police commissioner Param Bir Singh for his management of his case. The police officer subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that home minister Anil Deshmukh instructed Vaze to extort Rs100 crore from restaurants and bars, and when no action was forthcoming approached the courts.The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation.According to NIA officers, Mane was under suspicion from the beginning, and a team from the agency visited the Kandivli unit of the crime branch where he was posted. The team inspected several vehicles parked at the office. The agency investigations, the officers said, already revealed that the person who made the last call Hiran received before he went missing, at 8.30pm on March 4, identified himself as a crime branch officer from Kandivli and drew the victim out of his Thane home on the pretext of a meeting along Ghodbunder Road. The following day, Hiran’s body was found in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf.NIA officers claimed that Mane was involved in the murder conspiracy. According to Shetty, he was placed under arrest after thoroughly verifying his role.The NIA officers said that Mane was present at CIU on March 3, when Vaze tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden SUV near Antilia. According to NIA, Vaze assured Hiran that he would be out on bail soon. The plan to eliminate Hiran was allegedly hatched after he refused to take the blame, the officers added.The NIA officer who asked not to be named said that at least two witnesses, a hotelier who visited CIU on March 3 and a deputy commissioner of police, also questioned by NIA , have corroborated that Mane was with Vaze at CIU office that day. The officer added that Mane was also present at the meeting attended by Vaze, arrested former constable Vinayak Shinde and another former officer before the murder at Chakala in Andheri.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/hiran-murder-mumbai-cop-sunil-mane-sent-to-nia-custody-till-april-28-101619203256609.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||Steel plants in Maharashtra should divert oxygen for Covid patients: HC||Nagpur bench of the Bombay high court (HC) on Friday directed Nagpur divisional commissioner to requisition all the liquid oxygen, being produced by four steel plants in Maharashtra, for catering to the needs of Covid-19 patients across the state. The directors of the four plants at Bhandara, Thane, Pune and Dolvi in the Raigad district have been requested to agree to the arrangement to avoid compulsory requisitioning.The court also directed requisitioning of cylinders to bottle the oxygen being brought through the railway route in tankers. The court further directed the state to place a request before the central-level committee to fulfil the requirement of Remdesivir and posted a hearing of the suo motu (on its own) public interest litigation (PIL) on April 27. The division bench of justices Sunil Shukre and SM Modak, while hearing the suo motu PIL and two other PILs, was informed by advocate MG Bhangde for the state and other state authorities that as per the order of the bench, the data on the distribution of Remdesivir in Nagpur district showed that there was no shortage of the drug. He, however, added that the indiscriminate use of the drug should be avoided. The court observed that while it had received information about Nagpur, there was none about Amravati, and hence directed the addition of the divisional commissioner Amravati and its joint commissioner of FDA as respondents. The officials were asked to file affidavits with data on the present position of continuous supply of life-saving drugs such as Remdesivir, Favipiravir, Tocilizumab, Ivermectin and also the supply of oxygen throughout Covid care centres in their division. The court then sought information on oxygen supply in Nagpur and asked advocate Aditya Goel, who filed an interim application, informing the court that the Lloyd steel plant and other steel plants had their oxygen-producing units and they could also be asked to divert the oxygen for overcoming the short supply. The court accepted the suggestion and directed the divisional commissioner of Nagpur to place a request before the directors of the plants. “We request him to consider suggestions made by advocate Goel and examine if, under section 36 of Disaster Management Act, it can be requisitioned or not.” The court then observed, “In fact, we have full faith in the directors of this company that given the receipt of a humble request from the divisional commissioner of Nagpur, they would readily agree to submit the oxygen plant of their company and would not let any situation of compulsory requisitioning in any manner.” When informed of the problem of bottling the oxygen coming on railway tankers from various parts of the country including Visakhapatnam due to a shortage of empty cylinders. The bench was informed that while the 11 oxygen distributors had 20,000 cylinders in circulation, there were manufacturing units and smaller plants that also used oxygen cylinders and around 3,400 additional cylinders could be easily requisitioned for bottling and distributing the oxygen coming from outside Maharashtra. The court directed the Nagpur divisional commissioner to requisition the cylinders and said, “If required, form a team of officers who would be personally visiting units, and empty cylinders available can be taken with help of police and state reserve police force (SRPF). Needless to say, appropriate rent would have to be paid for owners of cylinders requisitioned in the public interest.” With regards to the supply of Remdesivir, the bench was informed by the Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO) that the Central government through the central level committee had asked all manufacturers to ramp up production of the drug to 2.69 lakh vials per day. The court then said, “We direct the state of Maharashtra to review the provisions regarding requirement of Remdesivir vials in state and if it is found more vials are required than those allotted, appropriate request with proper justification be made to the central level committee.” The court while warning against the indiscriminate use of Remdesivir by doctors by not following Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) laid down by the State Covid Task Force the court said, “As long as no such instances of manifest misuse of the drug are brought to the notice of nodal officers and unless they seem to be completely in violation of mandatory SOP, the state machinery would not be in a position to take any action against medical experts who are wrongly prescribing a drug, this is the area which remains largely in the discretion of experts in the medical field and as such we would request all doctors treating Covid patients to try to scrupulously follow SOP unless, in their opinion, departure is necessary to save the life of patients.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/steel-plants-in-maharashtra-should-divert-oxygen-for-covid-patients-hc-101619203196648.html
24-04-2021||Mumbai||IITs ease exam, online class stress for students as cases surge||With Covid-19 cases on the rise across the country, the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) are doing their best to ease the burden of students, especially those whose family members have tested positive for the virus.IIT-Bombay on Thursday announced that students, whose close family members have been infected, will be allowed to take the end semester exams at a later date. The semester exams will be held online and kick off on Monday. All undergraduate courses are being held online and around 3,000 postdoctoral and research fellows are currently on campus. “The health and wellbeing of all students are more important than the exams they write. In the senate meeting held Thursday, it was decided that no student should suffer from exam-related stress during this extremely difficult time of the pandemic in the country,” said Subhasis Chaudhuri, director, IIT-Bombay.The senate has decided that any student, who falls sick or whose family member falls sick, will be given the chance to take the end-sem exams at a later date. On Wednesday, the IIT-Delhi administration sent an email, reviewed by HT, to all its students announcing similar measures. The institute is allowing students to withdraw from a course or examination for the course for any ‘situation created because of Covid’ such as their health or that of family members.The institute has a provision for an ‘I grade’ wherein students can choose to defer or withdraw from the exams for the said course. Among other interim measures announced by Shantanu Roy, dean, academics, IIT Delhi, the institute has relaxed its mandate for attending online classes till the end of April.“We have our senate meeting coming up next week and some more measures will also be discussed in there,” said V Ramgopal Rao, director, IIT Delhi.While IIT Madras always allows make-up exams to students, who are unable to write exams on the scheduled date, the institute is also permitting the students absent in online classes to download and view the recorded lectures. Even if the student views the recorded lecture (at any time /day) attendance is granted.IIT Mandi, too, has removed the mandatory attendance criteria for online courses. “The majority of courses are taught in a live mode online, and subsequently, the video recordings, lecture transcripts, and notes are made available to the students to ensure that they have full access to the course material. This also ensures that course offerings cater to students with different internet bandwidth accessibilities,” said Srikant Srinivasan, associate dean, courses, IIT Mandi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/iits-ease-exam-online-class-stress-for-students-as-cases-surge-101619203137275.html

24-04-2021||Lucknow||Two Oxygen Exp trains on track for destination Lucknow||Two Oxygen Express trains that aim at ending the oxygen crisis in Uttar Pradesh are expected to reach Lucknow on Saturday and Sunday morning respectively. The first special train will have three oxygen tankers of 20,000 litres each. One tanker will be unloaded in Varanasi en route. The remaining two will be brought to the state capital. Additional chief secretary (Home) Awanish Kumar Awasthi confirmed one train would arrive on Saturday and said, “Of the three loaded containers, one would unload at Varanasi and two in Lucknow. Of these two, one will be sent to Kanpur and the other will be used in Lucknow itself.” The first train left Bokaro, Jharkhand, on Friday noon. The railways rushed the second train loaded with empty oxygen tankers to fetch another consignment from Bokaro. “The load is ready, it is all set to leave Bokaro for Lucknow,” said Dhaneshwar Mohanta, additional divisional railway manager of the Adra division of South Eastern Railway (SER). Mohanta was overseeing the entire train operation in Bokaro. The officials with Northern Railway (NR) said the (second) train is expected to reach state capital on Sunday morning. “The Oxygen Express that aims at ensuring the supply of oxygen to UP has left Bokaro Steel Plant. We have also created a green corridor to minimise the total journeying time. Railway is making spontaneous efforts to ensure fast and regular supply of oxygen in states,” reads a tweet by railway minister Piyush Goyal soon after the (first) train left Bokaro on Friday. Sanjay Tripathi, divisional railway manager (DRM) of Northern Railway, Lucknow, said the train was moving at an average speed of 63km per hour and it was expected to reach Lucknow on Saturday morning. The NR DRM also said the other Oxygen Express train was rushed to Bokaro to bring in more LMO in order to meet the crisis situation. Officials with Northern Railway (NR) said they were expecting more such trains in the near future that would be a boon in curbing the “oxygen crisis-like situation” that has emerged following the sudden spike in the demand of LMO that plays a key role in giving relief to Covid-19 patients. The UP government had approached the railways to help it in bringing in LMO from Jharkhand, Bengal and Odisha in order to meet the increased demand in the state, especially in Lucknow, Varanasi and Ayodhya (Faizabad) districts.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/two-oxygen-exp-trains-on-track-for-destination-lucknow-101619200256578.html
24-04-2021||Ranchi||12-hour road journey brings oxygen for Kashi hospitals||An oxygen tanker from Bokaro in Jharkhand reached an oxygen plant in Chandauli district’s Ramnagar industrial area in eastern Uttar Pradesh by road around 3am on Friday, covering the distance in “12 hours” instead of the usual 14 hours as a green corridor was created, officials said. The driver Suresh Kumar, a resident of Pratapgarh, drove non-stop. The arrival of the tanker with 20 tonnes (20,000 litres) of oxygen held the promise of easing the shortage in Varanasi somewhat amid the Covid-19 crisis. Soon after arriving at Ramnagar, the liquid medical oxygen in the tanker was unloaded at the MedTech plant there. The plant then started preparing medical oxygen, which was filled in cylinders. The oxygen cylinders were supplied to hospitals, Varanasi district magistrate Kaushal Raj Sharma said. Oxygen supply became somewhat normal by Friday noon. “I wanted the oxygen tanker to reach the plant as early as it could. Therefore, I spoke to the tanker driver Suresh Kumar and apprised him of the oxygen crisis in Varanasi. I motivated him and said if the tanker reached two-three hours before the usual time, it will be a great help. I am thankful to the driver Suresh Kumar. On our request, he has brought it non-stop from Bokaro. He started around 2.30pm on Thursday and reached the MedTech plant, Ramnagar, at around 3am to save the lives of patients.” Usually, it takes more than 14 hours to cover the distance from Bokaro to the oxygen plant in Ramnagar by road. Varanasi commissioner of police A Satish Ganesh sent a police escort vehicle which met the tanker beyond Dehri-on-Sone in Bihar and escorted it to the Ramnagar plant. “It was one of the most satisfying operations of my career,” Ganesh said. The district magistrate said the MedTech plant earlier got shut around 11am on Thursday when its liquid oxygen stock ran out. As a result of the heavy pressure on oxygen supply on Thursday, new admissions in hospitals had to stop temporarily and a few patients were shifted from the hospitals that were left with little oxygen. Sharma said there were six oxygen plants in the industrial area of Chandauli. Four of them make oxygen from air and two produce it from liquid medical oxygen. Among these four plants, one has the capacity to produce 150 cylinders of oxygen every day and three others about 100 to 150 cylinders daily. The two other plants, which use liquid medical oxygen to produce oxygen gas, have the capacity to produce 800 cylinders each in 24 hours. The district magistrate said there were 43 hospitals listed as Covid-19 care facilities, including six government hospitals and 37 private ones. The oxygen cylinders were being supplied to them as per their quota and need daily, he said, adding that the oxygen cylinders were supplied to the hospitals today (Friday). At the same time, oxygen cylinders are also being supplied to non-Covid hospitals. Sharma said Varanasi will also get an oxygen tanker from the Oxygen Express, which is likely to reach the city at around Friday midnight. At present, 3800 oxygen cylinders were being filled daily at oxygen plants in the industrial area of Chandauli. Varanasi is getting around 3400 cylinders every day against its daily need of around 6,000 cylinders. An oxygen plant ,with the help of a local philanthropist, will be set up at the Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay government district hospital. It is likely to function from the first week of May. Likewise, a proposal has been sent for setting up another oxygen plant at the divisional hospital. Meanwhile, there are 1900 beds in Varanasi hospitals, 1600 of them with oxygen facility. All the beds with oxygen facility are occupied.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/12hour-road-journey-brings-oxygen-for-kashi-hospitals-101619198756449.html
24-04-2021||Pune||Arun Nigavekar, former UGC chairman, no more||Arun Nigavekar, former chairman of the University Grants Commission (UGC) and former vice-chancellor of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), passed away in Pune on Friday afternoon. He was 79-year-old and passed away due to a prolonged illness. Nigavekar was an eminent physicist. From 1998 to 2000 he worked as vice-chancellor at SPPU, then Pune University. After that he went to become vice-chairman, and then chairman, of UGC between 2000 and 2005. His significant contributions have been on the use of technology to improve higher education and the internationalisation of higher education. His path-breaking contribution was the initiation of the concept of quality in higher education, for which he was aptly called the father of the quality movement in higher education in India, by former President of India, the late Dr APJ Abdul Kalam. He was awarded numerous fellowships for his outstanding performance in academics. Talking about his demise, SPPU vice-chancellor Prof Nitin Karmalkar said, “He was initially professor of Physics and then he became HOD of the department in Pune university. He worked as vice-chancellor for around 2.5 years and then went to Delhi to become chiarman of UGC. Indian Science Congress was formed during his tenure and leadership. He was a good teacher, administrator and a soft-spoken person. He always helped me during my work as vice-chancellor and his demise is a big loss to the academic sector.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/arun-nigavekar-former-ugc-chairman-no-more-101619193056171.html
24-04-2021||Pune||300 oxygen beds lying vacant, due to lack of O2||The term “oxygen bed” has come to represent a misnomer in the city, as the supply of oxygen has continued to remain choked. “Oxygen beds” were meant to imply bed spaces that had oxygen lines as part of its immediate set-up for the occupant. With no oxygen, it is a bed, of which there is another worry that space may be running out. Three hundred such beds are ready in the city, but, no access to oxygen. The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), along with several organisations over the past one month, has ensured that the number of beds has increased. However, oxygen supply to these beds is now another matter. With most Covid-19 patients home isolating, those that do need a hospital or Covid care centre bed, are generally in need of oxygen as well. The city’s Ganesh Kala auditorium was converted into a Covid care centre and claimed to have “100 oxygen beds”.Congress leader Aba Bagul said, “The hospital at Ganesh Kala Krida Manch is ready. Even doctors and other staff are ready, but we are not able to start operations because of a lack of oxygen supply.” Bagul added, “This facility is for poor people. We are trying to source oxygen from private suppliers.” PMC’s opposition leaders, Deepali Dhumal and Shiv Sena’s Prithviraj Sutar, on Friday, met divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao and demanded oxygen for the new infrastructure. Rao made no promises on oxygen supply for new facilities.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/300-oxygen-beds-lying-vacant-due-to-lack-of-o2-101619190898068.html

Every engineer will upload information on the pre-monsoon work done on a day-to-day basis.The city’s 15 ward offices and the drainage department has started pre-monsoon work like cleaning storm water drains. Jagdish Khanore, superintendent engineer of the drainage department said, “At present, we have started minor work like cleaning the storm-water drains. The major pre-monsoon work includes cleaning of nallahs and repairing or replacing drainage lines. The tender for these works is in its final stage and it will start next week.”“The corporation has floated 22 tenders for the cleaning of nallahs, each around ₹65 lakh. Besides this, the PMC floated 15 tenders, ward-wise, each of ₹15 lakh. Despite the labour shortage, we will complete the work before the deadline as most of the work is done by machinery,” Khanore added.Vilas Phad, executive engineer of the drainage department, said, “The city has 236 major and small nallahs covering a total of 362kms. There is an addition of 166km of nallahs due to the merger of 11 villages in PMC limits. In the city, there is around 200km of storm- water drain lines and 40,000 chambers across the city. There are 500 culverts in the city.”Dinkar Gojare, superintendent engineer of the road department said, “We have identified chronic spots where frequent water logging occurs.

24-04-2021||Pune||Pune varsity students can now register complaints related to marks within 72 hours||Students appearing for online exams of the Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU), must register any complaint about marks given, within 72 hours of receiving the result. Complaints about technical errors regarding raising issues with marks given caused the SPPU’s board of examination and evaluation to take this decision. Mahesh Kakade, SPPU’s director of the board of examination and evaluation said, “Some technical errors had come into the login system, which is now resolved by our team. Students can now register their complaint regarding marks within 72 hours.”“When we appear for the exams online and then get our marks, sometimes they are not given properly. When we login to register the complaint, it shows a technical error,” said Kedar Mande, a second-year law student. The first semester examination of SPPU started from April 10 in online mode for all courses. Each paper is of 50 marks, with multiple-choice questions (MCQ). The university’s Edutech Foundation is conducting the exam.Once a student appears for the exams, he/she gets access to their marks via their personal login. “As the system was slow and had technial errors it was not possible for students to register a complaint within 48 hours. This resulted in panic and so it was demanded that the time to register a complaint online be increased,” said Kamlakar Shete, an SPPU student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sppu-students-can-now-register-complaints-related-to-marks-within-72-hours-101619187535935.html
24-04-2021||Delhi||Oxygen shortage hits Delhi govt’s plan to boost capacity of Covid care centre||The severe shortage of oxygen in Delhi has adversely affected the government’s plan to bolster the capacity of Covid-19 care facilities, especially the major centres in Chhatarpur, Commonwealth Games Village and Yamuna Sports Complex – during the ongoing six-day lockdown.On Thursday, these three facilities collectively had 1,390 total beds – of which 400 beds were equipped with oxygen. As per the government’s augmentation plan, these three centres should have had 1,875 oxygen beds by Tuesday (April 20), said a senior government official.The centre set up at the Radhasoami Satsang Beas’s Chhatarpur campus is vacant right now, despite being reopened on April 20 with 250 beds. In an April 20 order, the Delhi government said the Chhatarpur facility will be attached with Madan Mohan Malviya hospital, which will provide the centre with doctors, nurses, paramedics and at least 10 dedicated ambulances.“The district administration has not been able to provide the facility with oxygen beds. We plan to reopen the centre again by Saturday with 500 oxygen beds. Oxygen supply is likely to be normalised by then,” said a senior revenue department official.Similarly, plans to run temporary care facilities at the CWG village and Yamuna complex — that collectively have 1,140 beds, of which 400 are oxygen-equipped — have also been interrupted by the shortage, which chief minister Arvind Kejriwal, his deputy Manish Sisodia, and health minister Satyendar Jain have flagged repeatedly over the past few days.These two shelters should have had 1,375 beds – all with oxygen facilities – by April 20, said the first government official.The care centre in the CWG village was opened on Wednesday with 460 beds, of which 200 have oxygen facilities. Similarly, the centre in Yamuna Sports Complex was also opened on Wednesday, with 680 beds, of which 200 have oxygen facilities.“All oxygen beds are occupied in the two centres, and we are also facing a major shortage of oxygen. There is little scope of increasing the number of oxygen beds unless the shortage is resolved,” said a senior official in the district administration of east Delhi, where the two centres are located.As Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced the lockdown on Monday, he said the curbs would help the state government augment the city’s health care infrastructure, which has been brought to the brink by the alarming rise in Covid-19 cases and deaths. Delhi on Thursday added 26,169 cases and 306 deaths. Of the 20,448 Covid-19 beds in the city, 18,282 were occupied as of 7pm, the Delhi Corona app showed. Alarmingly, only 18 of the 4,684 intensive care unit beds were vacant, the portal showed.Delhi’s demand for medical oxygen has nearly tripled due to the devastating surge, with hospitals forced to send out distress calls to authorities, which have pitted the Capital’s government against the administrations in neighbouring Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, forcing the Centre to intervene.The Centre on Thursday meanwhile ordered that there should be no restrictions on the movement of medical oxygen between states, and that transport authorities shall be instructed to accordingly allow free inter-state movement of vehicles carrying oxygen.However, state officials said they cannot add oxygen beds at Covid care centres till supply bottlenecks are overcome.A Delhi government spokesperson said: “We have the required infrastructure to augment beds in Covid-19 facilities. The problem is the supply of oxygen. The augmentation plan will face no difficulties if they supply of oxygen is stable. Supply of oxygen across the country is regulated by the central government and every state has an allocated quota. Delhi has been facing a major shortage of medical oxygen. While the central government has increased the state’s allocation to 480 MT (from 378 MT) per day, the city’s current demand is more than 700 MT per day. Secondly, Delhi is also not getting the allocated oxygen because authorities in neighbouring states such as Haryana and Uttar Pradesh are stopping oxygen tankers, interrupting the supply. We have urged the central government to immediately intervene in this regard. Yesterday, Delhi received only 178 MT oxygen against the old quota of 378 MT.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/oxygen-shortage-hits-delhi-government-s-plan-to-boost-capacity-of-covid-care-centre-101619117211764.html

More than a third of the infections occurred in India, which announced 332,730 new cases on Friday and another 346,786 on Saturday, also a record for a single country since the start of the pandemic.Over the course of a week, more than 5.5 million cases were recorded worldwide.Other countries trailing India with the most new infections are the US (490,000 cases in one week), Brazil (459,000) and Turkey (404,000).Nepal royals hospitalisedNepal’s former King Gyanendra Shah, Queen Komal Shah and their daughter Prerana Shah have been admitted to Norvic International Hospital in Kathmandu at around 1pm local time on Saturday, days after testing positive for Covid-19.“As per the doctors involved in their treatment, condition of the trio is stable and normal,” the hospital said.The former royals tested positive for the virus on April 20 soon after their return from India after participating in the Maha Kumbh at Haridwar.NZ pauses travel bubbleNew Zealand on Friday paused arrivals from Western Australia, temporarily excluding the state’s travellers from a quarantine-free bubble between the countries due to a Covid-19 outbreak.Earlier on Friday, the Perth and Peel regions were sent into a three-day lockdown after Western Australia recorded its first community transmission of the virus in 12 months. New Zealand and Australia had opened their quarantine-free travel bubble on April 18.US resumes J&J vaccineJohnson & Johnson Covid vaccinations can restart, US health regulators said on Friday, after the shots’ rollout was paused due to worries over blood clotting. “We have concluded that the known and potential benefits of the Janssen Covid-19 vaccine outweigh its known and potential risks in individuals 18 years of age and older,” said Janet Woodcock, head of Food and Drug Administration in a joint statement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Pfizer to update jabUS pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer is planning a new version of its coronavirus vaccine that can be stored in a standard freezer and comes diluted and ready for use, its CEO told AFP on Friday.The current version must be stored at minus 70°C, limiting its distribution to specially equipped vaccination centres.But Pfizer’s chief executive Albert Bourla told AFP in an interview that a new version is in the pipeline and that he was optimistic the vaccine will also prove effective against new virus variants.Swiss report India strainA first case of the Covid-19 variant contributing to the exploding outbreak in India has been detected in Switzerland, the public health authority said Saturday.“The first case of the Indian variant of Covid-19 has been discovered in Switzerland,” Switzerland’s federal office of public health said in a tweet.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/daily-covid-cases-hit-record-high-globally-101619286667511.html
24-04-2021||World||UK Covid-19 vaccination: Over half the population receives first dose of vaccine||The UK has given half of its population a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, a key milestone in Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s efforts to revive an economy that was among the worst-hit in the early months of the pandemic.The government has given first doses to 33.5 million people, health authorities said today. That’s more more than half the Office for National Statistics’ most recent population estimate of 66.8 million. More than 12 million people have been given second doses.Reaching the 50% point sets the UK apart from most its peers around the world -- it is the only G-20 economy to reach that milestone -- while keeping it on course to hit a July target of vaccinating all adults at least once. Only Israel has administered jabs to a greater proportion of its population. While the vaccine campaign has been a success, Britain has suffered the fifth-largest number of Covid-19 deaths in the world with more than 127,000 fatalities, according to Johns Hopkins University data.The pace of the country’s vaccine rollout and a plunge in cases and hospitalizations led to an easing of restrictions. Shops this month were permitted to reopen after almost 100 days of lockdown, while restaurants were told they could serve customers -- but only outside. Job postings and the number of people returning to the office have since started to recover, giving a lift to an economy fell into its worst recession in 300 years on pandemic fallout.Though those adults still left to be vaccinated typically represent less than 1% of virus deaths, according to government calculations, they still pose a transmission risk, particularly as younger people are more likely to be asymptomatic.That’s making the coming weeks pivotal for the country, as epidemiological and medical experts look for early signs of a resurgence in cases. The government has earmarked May 17 as the start of the second phase in the easing of lockdown, with international travel slated to restart that day.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-covid-19-vaccination-over-half-the-population-receives-first-dose-of-vaccine-101619282924965.html
24-04-2021||World||Indian Covid-19 variant found in Switzerland, says health authority||A first case of the Covid-19 variant contributing to the exploding outbreak in India has been detected in Switzerland, the public health authority said Saturday."The first case of the Indian variant of Covid-19 has been discovered in Switzerland," Switzerland's Federal Office of Public Health (BAG) said in a tweet.The virus variant was found in "a passenger who arrived in Switzerland after transiting through a European airport.""The person changed flights in a European country before flying on to Switzerland," spokesman Daniel Dauwalder told AFP in an email, adding that the positive sample was collected in March in the northern canton of Solothurn.The news comes after Belgian authorities on Thursday said a group of 20 Indian nursing students who arrived from Paris had tested positive for the variant in the country.India's healthcare system is meanwhile buckling under a new wave of infections blamed in part on the new "double mutant" variant, known as B.1.617.On Saturday, India reported a record daily number of cases and deaths from Covid-19, while the government is struggling to provide enough oxygen to overwhelmed hospitals.A total of almost 190,000 people have died of coronavirus in India according to official figures.Countries have been on high alert for the variant, with several suspending flights from India.The BAG said it was discussing whether to add India to its red list of high risk countries.People arriving from countries placed on Switzerland's red list are required to quarantine for 10 days.But Dauwalder pointed out that India already figured on a separate list held by the State Secretariat for Migration, which meant that for now, in most cases only Swiss citizens and residents were permitted to enter Switzerland after a stay in India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indian-covid-19-variant-found-in-switzerland-says-health-authority-101619283005895.html
24-04-2021||World||Indonesia navy declares lost sub sunk, all 53 aboard dead||Indonesia’s navy on Saturday declared its missing submarine had sunk and cracked open, killing 53 crew members aboard, after finding items from the vessel over the past two days.Military chief Hadi Tjahjanto said the presence of an oil slick as well as debris near the site where the submarine's last dive on Wednesday off the island of Bali were clear proof the KRI Nanggala 402 sank. Indonesia earlier considered the vessel to be only missing.Navy Chief Yudo Margono told a press conference in Bali, “If it's an explosion, it will be in pieces. The cracks happened gradually in some parts when it went down from 300 meters to 400 meters to 500 meters ... If there was an explosion, it would be heard by the sonar."The navy previously said it believes the submarine sank to a depth of 600-700 meters (2,000-2,300 feet), much deeper than its collapse depth of 200 meters (655 feet), at which point water pressure would be greater than the hull could withstand.The cause of the disappearance was still uncertain. The navy had previously said an electrical failure could have left the submarine unable to execute emergency procedures to resurface.Margono said that in the past two days, searchers found parts of a torpedo straightener, a grease bottle believed to be used to oil the periscope, debris from prayer rugs and a broken piece from a coolant pipe that was refitted on the submarine in South Korea in 2012.“With the authentic evidence we found believed to be from the submarine, we have now moved from the ‘sub miss’ phase to ‘sub sunk,’” Margono said at the press conference, in which the found items were displayed.Margono said rescue teams from Indonesia and other countries will evaluate the findings. He said no bodies have been found so far. Officials previously said the submarine’s oxygen supply would have run out early Saturday.An American reconnaissance plane, a P-8 Poseidon, landed early Saturday and had been set to join the search, along with 20 Indonesian ships, a sonar-equipped Australian warship and four Indonesian aircraft.Singaporean rescue ships were also expected Saturday, while Malaysian rescue vessels were due to arrive Sunday, bolstering the underwater hunt, officials said earlier Saturday.Family members had held out hopes for survivors but there were no sign of life from the vessel. Indonesian President Joko Widodo had ordered all-out efforts to locate the submarine and asked Indonesians to pray for the crew’s safe return.The German-built diesel-powered KRI Nanggala 402 has been in service in Indonesia since 1981 and was carrying 49 crew members and three gunners as well as its commander, the Indonesian Defense Ministry said.Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands, has faced growing challenges to its maritime claims in recent years, including numerous incidents involving Chinese vessels near the Natuna islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/indonesia-navy-declares-lost-sub-sunk-all-53-aboard-dead-101619267597400.html
24-04-2021||World||Out of the cave: French isolation study ends after 40 days||Ever wonder what it would feel like to unplug from a hyperconnected world and hide away in a cave for a few weeks? Fifteen people in France found out.After 40 days in voluntary isolation in a dark, damp and vast cave, eight men and seven women who took part in a scientific experiment emerged Saturday from their self-segregation in the Pyrenees.With big smiles on their pale faces, the 15 participants exited the Lombrives cave to a round of applause and basked in the light of day while wearing special glasses to protect their eyes after so long in the dark.“It’s really warm!” said one.For 40 days and 40 nights, the group lived in and explored the cave without a sense of time. There were no clocks and no sunlight inside, where the temperature was 10 degrees Celsius (50 F) and the relative humidity stood at 100%. The cave dwellers had no contact with the outside world, no updates on the pandemic or any communication with friends and family above ground.Scientists at the Human Adaption Institute leading the 1.2 million-euro $1.5 million) “Deep Time” project say the experiment will help them better understand how people adapt to drastic changes in living conditions and environments, something much of the world can relate to because of coronavirus pandemic.In partnership with labs in France and Switzerland, scientists monitored the 15-member group's sleep patterns, social interactions and behavioral reactions via sensors. One of the sensors was a tiny thermometer inside a capsule that participants swallowed like a pill. The capsules measure body temperature and transmit data to a portable computer until they are expelled naturally.The team members followed their biological clocks to know when to wake up, go to sleep and eat. They counted their days not in hours but in sleep cycles.On Friday, scientists monitoring the participants entered the cave for the first time since the experiment started. They said many of the people in the research group miscalculated how long they had been in the cave and thought they had another week to 10 days to go.“It’s really interesting to observe how this group synchronizes themselves,” project director Christian Clot said in a recording done from inside the cave. Working together on projects and organizing tasks without being able to set a time to meet was especially challenging, he said.Although the participants looked visibly tired, two-thirds of them expressed a desire to remain underground a bit longer in order to finish group projects started during the expedition, Benoit Mauvieux, a chronobiologist involved in the research, told The Associated Press.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/out-of-the-cave-french-isolation-study-ends-after-40-days-101619257835037.html
24-04-2021||World||Old SpaceX capsule delivers new crew to space station||A recycled SpaceX capsule carrying four astronauts arrived at the International Space Station on Saturday, the third high-flying taxi ride in less than a year for Elon Musk's company.The Dragon capsule docked autonomously with the orbiting outpost more than 260 miles (420 kilometers) above the Indian Ocean, a day after launching from NASA's Kennedy Space Center.The new arrivals — representing the U.S., France and Japan — will spend six months at the space station. They’ll replace four astronauts who will return to Earth in their own Dragon capsule Wednesday.It was the first time two SpaceX crew Dragons were parked there at the same time — practically side by side.“We are so excited to have you aboard,” radioed the space station's commander, Shannon Walker.Although this was SpaceX’s third crew flight for NASA, it was the first to use a vehicle that’s flown before, an essential part of Musk's push to the moon and Mars. The Dragon capsule was used for SpaceX’s first crew launch last May, while the Falcon rocket soaring Friday hoisted crew two in November.NASA astronauts Shane Kimbrough and Megan McArthur — the commander and pilot of the returning Dragon — monitored their capsule's flat screen computers as the space station loomed ever larger. They could have taken control if necessary, but the autonomous system did its job, much like a self-driving car.Also checking into the space station: France's Thomas Pesquet and Japan's Akihiko Hoshide. Both have lived there before, as has Kimbrough. It was the first station visit for McArthur.McArthur flew to the space station in the same seat and the same capsule — named Endeavour — as her husband, Bob Behnken, did on SpaceX's debut crew mission.For the next four days, the space station will be home to 11 astronauts, just shy of the record of 13 set during NASA's space shuttle era. The current population includes six Americans, two Russians, two Japanese and one French. It will shrink by four on Wednesday when three Americans and one Japanese depart for home and a splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/old-spacex-capsule-delivers-new-crew-to-space-station-101619257309615.html
24-04-2021||World||Australia: 4th largest city Perth in 3-day lockdown after Covid-19 cases found||Australia’s fourth-biggest city entered a three-day lockdown on Saturday to prevent the spread of Covid-19 after a returned overseas traveler who’d completed hotel quarantine tested positive for the virus.More than 2 million people in Perth and a neighboring region will have to stay home except for essential work, medical care, provisions or exercise. Authorities are racing to contact and test people who may have been exposed to the man, who was released from 14 days of quarantine on April 17, flew to Melbourne four days later and tested positive on Friday.“It is critically important to give our contact tracers and health teams the time they need to ensure community spread is limited,” Western Australia state Premier Mark McGowan said.New Zealand, which has a quarantine-free travel bubble with Australia, has halted flights from the state.The man was infected after the virus spread from an adjacent room, potentially through the ventilation system --heightening concerns about the suitability of some hotels to isolate returned travelers.While Australia has come close to eliminating local transmission of the virus by closing its international border to non-residents, occasional cases leak into the community from quarantine hotels via infected security guards or cleaners, or travelers who have caught Covid-19 during mandatory isolation. As virus cases surge in countries such as India, there are fears Australia’s quarantine system will buckle with more returning travelers testing positive.McGowan has asked the federal government to halve the number of overseas travelers arriving in Western Australia each month to ease the pressure.The Northern Territory government said Saturday that eight people who are in isolation after arriving on flights from Chennai and New Delhi had tested positive for the virus.The main Labor opposition is demanding Prime Minister Scott Morrison speeds up the sluggish vaccine rollout to mitigate such risks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/australia-4th-largest-city-perth-in-3-day-lockdown-after-covid-19-cases-found-101619236933401.html

Iran's eastern provinces border with Pakistan and Afghanistan. Visitors can also travel Iran by way of the Gulf.Iran's civil aviation organisation announced on local media that all flights to and from India and Pakistan would be halted from midnight Sunday.Health Minister Saeed Namaki has asked the interior minister to “halt the direct and indirect transport of travellers from India”, Iranian media reported.Most of Iran, whose coronavirus cases have surpassed 2 million, has been under a lockdown for the past two weeks as it grapples with a fourth wave of the pandemic.The health ministry has reported a daily average of over 20,000 infections. Nearly 70,000 have died.The country's vaccination drive, meanwhile, has been slow going.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-to-bar-travellers-from-india-over-covid-19-variant-officials-101619255160068.html
24-04-2021||World||3 held after police worker stabbed to death near Paris||French investigators were on Saturday questioning three people linked to a Tunisian man who stabbed a police employee to death near Paris in a suspected Islamist attack.The murder at a police station in Rambouillet, a commuter town about 60 kilometres (40 miles) from Paris, revived the trauma of a spate of deadly attacks last year.The victim was a 49-year-old woman named as Stephanie M., a police administrative assistant and mother-of-two, who was stabbed twice in the throat at the entrance of the station.Her 36-year-old attacker named as Jamel G., who had not been known to police or intelligence services, was shot and fatally wounded by an officer at the scene.President Emmanuel Macron, who was out of the country on a visit to Chad, tweeted that France would never give in to "Islamist terrorism".The latest violence targeting police is likely to focus attention further on the danger of Islamic extremism in France and wider concerns about security a year ahead of a presidential election.Prime Minister Jean Castex said he would hold a meeting in Paris with ministers and security officials after the killing.National anti-terrorism prosecutors have opened a terror investigation.A source close to the inquiry told AFP the knifeman shouted "Allahu Akbar" (God is Greatest) during the attack.Chief anti-terror prosecutor Jean-Francois Ricard confirmed "comments made by the assailant" indicated a terror motive.- Security stepped up -Jamel G's father and two other people were taken into custody on Friday, and questioning was continuing on Saturday as police delve into his background, contacts and possible motives.The assailant had arrived in France illegally in 2009 but had since obtained residency papers, a police source said. He had just moved to Rambouillet.Far-right leader Marine Le Pen immediately questioned why the attacker had been able to settle in the country, and hit back at recent criticism about police brutality in France."We need to get back to reason: supporting our police, expelling illegal immigrants and eradicating Islamism," she wrote on Twitter.Polls show her running close to Macron in next year's election, though experts warn that surveys conducted so far ahead and during a pandemic should be interpreted with caution.About 30 police officers wearing balaclavas raided the suspect's home in Rambouillet on Friday, AFP reporters said.At the same time police in the Paris region searched the home of the person who had sheltered Jamel G. when he first arrived in France, sources close to the inquiry said.Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, who also visited officers in Rambouillet, said security would be stepped up at stations nationwide.- Spate of attacks -France has been repeatedly targeted by Islamist attackers since 2015, with a series of incidents in the last year keeping terrorism and security as a leading concern.Macron's government has introduced legislation to tackle religious extremism, which would make it easier for the government to close places of worship and track foreign funding of mosques.The bill has been condemned by critics who see it as stigmatising Muslims.Last September, a Pakistani man wounded two people with a meat cleaver outside the former offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, which had printed cartoons of the Prophet Mohammed.In October, a young Chechen refugee beheaded teacher Samuel Paty who had showed some of the caricatures to his pupils in a crime that profoundly shocked the country.Later that month, three people were killed when a recently-arrived Tunisian went on a stabbing spree in a church in the Mediterranean city of Nice.In the most serious recent attack against French police, three officers and one police employee in Paris were stabbed to death in October 2019 by an IT specialist colleague who was himself then shot dead.He was found to have shown an interest in radical Islam.These attacks came after the massacres carried out by Islamist extremists from 2015 that began with the killing of staff in the offices of Charlie Hebdo in January that year.In France's deadliest peacetime atrocity, 130 people were killed and 350 were wounded when Islamist suicide bombers and gunmen attacked the Stade de France stadium, bars and restaurants in central Paris and the Bataclan concert hall in November 2015.The following year a man rammed a truck into a Bastille Day crowd in Nice, killing 86 people.Just a few weeks earlier, in June 2016, two police officers were stabbed to death at their home outside Paris by a man claiming allegiance to the Islamic State group.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/3-held-after-police-worker-stabbed-to-death-near-paris-101619255794114.html
24-04-2021||World||New version of Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine to become easier to ship and store, says CEO Albert Bourla||US pharmaceuticals giant Pfizer is planning a new version of its coronavirus vaccine that can be stored in a standard freezer and comes diluted and ready for use, its CEO told AFP on Friday.The vaccine developed by Pfizer and Germany's BioNTech is already a mainstay in Europe's efforts to control the pandemic -- but it is a challenge to ship and protect.The current version must be stored at minus 70 degrees Celsius (minus 94 degrees Fahrenheit), limiting its distribution to specially equipped vaccination centres.But Pfizer's chief executive Albert Bourla told AFP in an interview that a new version is in the pipeline and that he was optimistic the vaccine will also prove effective against new virus variants.Indian variantBourla said Pfizer has large amounts of real world data from some of the variant outbreaks."We have already data for the UK one -- I hate using the countries, but people know them like that -- which is very prominent in Israel... efficiency was 97 percent," he said."We have data from South Africa, with the South African variant, and overall the efficacy was 100 percent. And also have data from Brazil. And it looks also this is very well controlled."Pfizer has not yet compiled sufficient data on the efficiency of its vaccine against the so-called Indian variant, the latest to raise concerns that a new wave of infections could overcome the immunisation drive.But he said he was "optimistic" the vaccine would prove effective, and that the firm's mRNA technology can be adapted to counter new strains."The thing that makes me feel more comfortable is that we have developed a process that once a variant becomes a variant of concern, we should be able to have a new vaccine within 100 days," he said."It's a tough target, but I am very comfortable that we should be able to do it."And because of the effectiveness of this mRNA technology, I believe that variants will not become an issue, we'll be able to control them."Keeping coolThe European Union is betting big on Pfizer's relatively expensive vaccine, but there are concerns that the difficulty of keeping it at very cold temperatures will make it hard to distribute in poorer countries.But here again Bourla was confident."We are doing actually two things on this front," he said.The US Food and Drug Administration allows the vaccine to be kept at minus 20 Celsius in a standard freezer for two weeks and Bourla thinks that could be extended."And we are about to generate the data for another two weeks. So that this formulation can be stored, let's say, a month in minus 20 if we get approval for that," he said."On the other hand, we are also working with a new formulation which is much improved, that will be ready to use: that means you don't need to dilute the vaccine, it will come diluted."Pfizer hopes the vaccine will able to be stored for two to three months in normal refrigeration and an additional three months in a freezer, Bourla said."So a total of four-to-six months outside the minus 50 or 70... we believe we'll be able to have it if we are successful in summer."Higher price justifiedLeaked price details suggest that the Pfizer vaccine is many times more expensive than, for example, the competitor product from UK-based AstraZeneca, which has failed to meet delivery promises.But Bourla says the higher cost is justified."Our strategy is to try with a pricing (that is) able to provide equitable access to all," he said. Equitable means that more vaccine doses are made available to countries that need it more."So we have one tier of pricing, which covers all the high income countries, Europe is included in that, the US is included in that, Japan, Canada, all the high income countries," Bourla said."I don't want to go to what is the price for each one country, but at the largest it is the cost of a meal. So I would say for the value that the vaccine brings, we price that very, very reasonably," he said.For countries defined as middle-income by the World Bank, "the price is almost half of what we have in the high-income countries," the CEO said."And for the low-income countries, we have decided to give it on a non-profit basis, of course. So I think this is our strategy, this is our policy. So eventually, this vaccine will reach all the people of the world."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/new-version-of-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-to-become-easier-to-ship-and-store-says-pfizer-ceo-albert-bourla-101619256829321.html

Yudo Margono said Saturday that rescuers found several items including parts of a torpedo straightener, a grease bottle believed to be used to oil the periscope and prayer rugs from the submarine.“With the authentic evidence we found believed to be from the submarine, we have now moved from the ‘sub miss’ phase to ‘sub sunk,’” Margono said at a press conference.Indonesia earlier considered the submarine that disappeared on Wednesday off Bali as just missing. But it now declares the submarine as officially sank with no hopes of finding any survivors.Officials said the oxygen supply for its 53 crew ran out early Saturday.Indonesia pressed ahead with a search for a navy submarine off Bali on Saturday, hours after the oxygen supply for 53 crew members aboard is believed to have been exhausted, with a U.S. reconnaissance plane and other nations' vessels set to join the hunt.There's concern the KRI Nanggala 402 may have sunk too deep to reach or recover in time. It lost contact after its last reported dive Wednesday off the resort island, and the navy chief has said it was expected to run out of oxygen early Saturday morning.“We keep doing the search until we find it and whatever the result," Indonesia military spokesperson Djawara Whimbo said.An American reconnaissance plane, P-8 Poseidon, landed early Saturday and is set to join the search, along with 20 Indonesian ships, a sonar-equipped Australian warship and four Indonesian aircraft.Singaporean rescue ships are also expected later Saturday, while Malaysian rescue vessels were due to arrive Sunday, bolstering the underwater hunt, Whimbo said.He said Indonesia’s hydrographic vessel was still unable to detect an unidentified object exhibiting high magnetism that was earlier detected located at a depth of 50 to 100 meters (165 to 330 feet).“The object is floating in the water, so maybe it is moving,” he said.Indonesian military, navy and police chiefs are due to hold a news conference later Saturday.There have been no signs of life from the submarine, but family members have held out hope that the massive search effort would find the vessel in time.“The family is in a good condition and keeps praying,” said Ratih Wardhani, the sister of 49-year-old crewman Wisnu Subiyantoro. “We are optimistic that the Nanggala can be rescued with all the crew.”Indonesian President Joko Widodo has ordered all-out efforts to locate the submarine and asked Indonesians to pray for the crew’s safe return.The search focused on an area near the starting position of its last dive where an oil slick was found but there is no conclusive evidence so far the oil slick was from the sub.Navy Chief of Staff Adm. Yudo Margono has said oil could have spilled from a crack in the submarine’s fuel tank or the crew could have released fuel and fluids to reduce the vessel’s weight so it could surface.The navy however, believes the submarine sank to a depth of 600-700 meters (2,000-2,300 feet), much deeper than its collapse depth of 200 meters (655 feet), at which water pressure would be greater than the hull could withstand.The cause of the disappearance is still uncertain. The navy has said an electrical failure could have left the submarine unable to execute emergency procedures to resurface.The German-built diesel-powered KRI Nanggala 402 has been in service in Indonesia since 1981 and was carrying 49 crew members and three gunners as well as its commander, the Indonesian Defense Ministry said.Indonesia, the world’s largest archipelago nation with more than 17,000 islands, has faced growing challenges to its maritime claims in recent years, including numerous incidents involving Chinese vessels near the Natuna islands.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/items-found-from-lost-sub-indicting-it-sunk-indonesian-navy-101619255803073.html
24-04-2021||World||Covid-19: India going through 'very terrible' situation, says Dr Anthony Fauci||Dr Anthony Fauci, the Biden administration's top medical adviser on the pandemic on Friday said that India is going through a very terrible situation right now in a press briefing regarding surge in Covid-19 cases."India is going through a very terrible situation right now. They've had, yesterday, the largest number of cases that has ever been reported by any country," said Fauci.India on Saturday recorded 3,46,786 new Covid-19 cases, the highest single-day spike since the pandemic broke out last year.Regarding the ability of vaccines to protect against Covid-19 variants in India 'not yet fully characterised', Fauci said, "They have a situation there where there are variants that have arisen. We have not yet fully characterised the variants and the relationship between the ability of the vaccines to protect. But we're assuming, clearly, that they need vaccines."He informed that US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is working with its counterpart agency in India to provide technical support and assistance and suggested to get people vaccinated.Meanwhile, White House coronavirus coordinator Jeff Zients said that US has longstanding commitment to India's public health."We are working closely with them in the Covid-19 response. The Quad partnership and team is providing assistance across governments," said Zients in the White House press briefing.US is 'committed to sharing vaccine supply' and 'as our confidence around our supply increases, we will explore those options'."And, you know, this is a global pandemic, and India demonstrates the risk of what can happen if we don't get the pandemic under control everywhere.

24-04-2021||World||ASEAN leaders meet Myanmar coup leader amid killings||Southeast Asian leaders demanded an immediate end to killings and the release of political detainees in Myanmar in an emergency summit with its top general and coup leader Saturday in the Indonesian capital, Indonesian President Joko Widodo said.The leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations also told Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing during the talks in Jakarta that a dialogue between contending parties in Myanmar should immediately start, Widodo said.“The situation in Myanmar is unacceptable and should not continue. Violence must be stopped, democracy, stability and peace in Myanmar must be returned immediately,” Widodo said during the meeting. “The interests of the people of Myanmar must always be the priority.”Daily shootings by police and soldiers since the Feb. 1 coup have killed more than 700 mostly peaceful protesters and bystanders, according to several independent tallies.It was not immediately clear if and how Min Aung Hlaing responded to the blunt messages. It was the first time he traveled out of Myanmar since the coup, which was followed by the arrests of Aung San Suu Kyi and many other political leaders.Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi expressed hopes on the eve of the summit that “we can reach an agreement on the next steps that can help the people of Myanmar get out of this delicate situation.”Following the coup, ASEAN, through its current chair Brunei, issued a statement that did not expectedly condemn the power grab but urged “the pursuance of dialogue, reconciliation and the return to normalcy in accordance with the will and interests of the people of Myanmar.” Amid Western pressure, however, the regional group has struggled to take a more forceful position on issues but has kept to its non-confrontational approach.All ASEAN states agreed to meet Min Aung Hlaing but did not address him as Myanmar’s head of state in the summit. Critics have said ASEAN’s decision to meet him was unacceptable and amounted to legitimizing the overthrow and the deadly crackdown that followed.Rights watchdog Amnesty International urged Indonesia and other ASEAN states to investigate Min Aung Hlaing over “credible allegations of responsibility for crimes against humanity in Myanmar.” As a state party to a U.N. convention against torture, Indonesia has a legal obligation to prosecute or extradite a suspected perpetrator on its territory, it said.“The Myanmar crisis trigged by the military presents ASEAN with the biggest test in its history,” said Emerlynne Gil of the London-based rights group. “This is not an internal matter for Myanmar but a major human rights and humanitarian crisis which is impacting the entire region and beyond.”Indonesian police dispersed dozens of protesters opposing the coup and the junta leader’s visit.More than 4,300 police have fanned out across the Indonesian capital to secure the meetings, held under strict safeguards amid the pandemic. Indonesia has reported the highest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths in Southeast Asia.The leaders of Thailand and the Philippines skipped the summit to deal with coronavirus outbreaks back home. Laos, which has the least number of infections in the region but this week imposed a lockdown, also canceled at the last minute. The face-to-face summit is the first by ASEAN leaders in more than a year.ASEAN’s diversity, including the divergent ties of many of its members to either China or the United States, along with a bedrock policy of non-interference in each other’s domestic affairs and deciding by consensus, has hobbled the bloc’s ability to rapidly deal with crises.Aside from Myanmar, the regional bloc groups Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/asean-leaders-meet-myanmar-coup-leader-amid-killings-101619250687292.html

24-04-2021||World||Dispute over Russian pipeline tests Biden's Europe outreach||Pressure is growing on President Joe Biden to take action to prevent the completion of a Russian gas pipeline to Europe that many fear will give the Kremlin significant leverage over U.S. partners and allies. Yet such action could provoke an enormous rift in trans-Atlantic relations, notably with Germany, at a time when Biden has made restoring good ties with Europe a priority.As the Nord Stream 2 pipeline nears completion, U.S. lawmakers from both parties have stepped up demands on a reluctant White House to impose new sanctions on Russian and European companies to halt the project. But prospects of that happening would seem slim: Germany continues to support the project as it steps up consumption of natural gas, and the pipeline is roughly 95% finished.Biden has said he opposes the pipeline, which is owned by Russian state company Gazprom, with investment from several European companies. He has been keen to portray himself as tough on Russian President Vladimir Putin while being a strong supporter of Eastern European countries like Poland and Ukraine that are dead set against it as it bypasses both.Of potentially greater concern to the U.S., the Russia-to-Germany pipeline would increase Western Europe's already heavy dependence on Russian energy while U.S.-Russian tensions are soaring over a number of issues, including Ukraine, election interference, cyber intrusions and the crackdown on opposition figure Alexei Navalny and his supporters.At the same time, the administration is seeking broad European support, especially from Germany, the continent's economic powerhouse, for its planned withdrawal from Afghanistan, climate change measures and efforts to counter China's increasingly global assertiveness. It's not clear if sanctions targeting businesses from Germany and elsewhere would undermine efforts to advance those goals and repair relations that were frayed during Donald Trump's presidency.On Wednesday, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee unanimously signed off on legislation that would require the administration to either impose sanctions on 20 companies involved in the pipeline’s financing and construction or explain why they deserve exemptions. In January, the Trump administration hit several Russian firms and ships with penalties for their involvement, but Biden has not expanded the list.The legislation was sponsored by vocal administration critic Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. But it also won support from some of Biden's strongest Democratic foreign policy supporters in the Senate, like committee chair Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Chris Coons of Delaware and Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire.“I think, right now, as we see Putin trying to eliminate his biggest opposition leader, Navalny, in prison, the best shot we can make is to stop the Nord Stream 2 pipeline, if we are going to get his attention,” Shaheen said.Democrats agreed to support the sanctions after Republicans promised to drop opposition to two of Biden's top State Department nominees. The bipartisan support suggests the administration will be hard-pressed to ignore it. Biden was already stung by criticism in February for not expanding on the Trump administration's sanctions.“We share an overall attitude towards Nord Stream 2 with many on Capitol Hill, and that is the position that it is a bad deal," State Department spokesperson Ned Price said Thursday. “We will continue to do everything we can, including consistent with legislation that’s already on the books, to oppose its construction and finalization.”But the administration has yet to take a position on the new legislation, which congressional aides on both sides of the aisle believe has a good chance of passing. It would give Biden 15 days from the date of passage to make a determination on whether to hit the 20 companies and vessels with sanctions.The sanctions — which would apply to German, Russian, Polish and Austrian entities — would freeze their assets, make it difficult for them to do any international business and possibly affect their executives.Even if Biden vetoes the legislation, he will face another deadline for action in mid-May when the State Department must submit to Congress an update on the administration's compliance with previous laws aimed at protecting European energy security that require sanctions on unspecified companies involved in the construction of the pipeline that bypasses both Poland and Ukraine.On Tuesday, Chancellor Angela Merkel defended Germany's cooperation with Russia on Nord Stream 2. She noted that Russian gas already flows freely into Europe along other routes, including the existing Nord Stream 1 pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany.“I would like to point out that the gas delivered through Nord Stream 2, which isn’t yet flowing, is no worse than the gas from Nord Stream 1, that which flows through Ukraine, and that which comes across Turkey from Russia,” Merkel said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/dispute-over-russian-pipeline-tests-biden-s-europe-outreach-101619238945442.html
24-04-2021||World||Canadian PM, wife get AZ vaccine jab||Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and his wife Sophie Gregoire received their first jab of the Covid-19 vaccine on Friday, with both getting the AstraZeneca injection what was symbolic support for it.The Trudeaus received their injection at a pharmacy in Ottawa, and just before getting the jab, the Prime Minister said he was “very excited”. That inoculation came as the National Advisory Council on Immunisation or NACI also lowered the age threshold for getting the AZ vaccine from those over 55 to the 30-plus category.The AZ vaccine has resulted in rare side-effects, blood clots with lower platelets, and one more case of this adverse reaction was reported in the province of Ontario, taking the countrywide total to four, following similar instances in Quebec, Alberta and New Brunswick earlier. The Ontario case was also linked to the AZ version manufactured by the Serum Institute of India under the brand name Covishield.In its recommendation, NACI said the complete series of the AZ vaccine could be offered to those over 30 without contraindications, but “only if the individual does not wish to wait for an mRNA vaccine” and if it is determined “that the benefit of earlier vaccination with the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine outweighs the risk of Covid-19 while waiting for an mRNA Covid-19 vaccine.”Health Canada has “concluded that the benefits of this vaccine continue to outweigh the potential risks”. The adverse event has been referred to as Vaccine-Induced Immune Thrombotic Thrombocytopenia or VITT and is estimated to occur in one in every 100,000 to one in every 250,000 people vaccinated with the AZ jab.NACI also said the AZ vaccine has demonstrated an efficacy of 62% in the 18 to 64 age bracket while those older “who received one dose of AstraZeneca, real-world observational data of vaccine effectiveness have shown a reduction in the risk of symptomatic disease and hospitalization”. It also noted that the AZ vaccine and the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines provide against the B117 variant of concern first detected in the United Kingdom.In a statement, the Council of Chief Medical Officers of Health said, “All of Canada’s approved Covid-19 vaccines provide a high level of. Through earlier access to vaccination, we have the opportunity to vaccinate more people faster, protect our health care system, reduce severe illness and save lives.” It added that their “overall goal” remains focused on “enabling as many people as possible to be immunised as quickly as possible against Covid-19 with a safe and effective vaccine, while ensuring that high-risk populations are prioritized”.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadian-pm-wife-get-az-vaccine-jab-101619239259553.html
24-04-2021||World||Top US lobby group urges Biden to help India fight Covid-19||The US Chamber of Commerce, one of the most powerful lobbying groups in America, has urged the Biden administration to send its stockpile of unused AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccines - also called Covidshield - to India and other countries that could use them.“As the Covid pandemic inflicts a heavy toll on countries around the globe, the US Chamber strongly encourages the administration to release the millions of AstraZeneca vaccine doses in storage - as well as other life-saving support - for shipment to India, Brazil, and other nations hard-hit by the pandemic,” said Myron Brilliant, executive vice-president of the chamber.Pressure has been growing on the Biden administration to do more to ensure the availability of vaccines around the world as the situation at home improves with more than 210 million Americans - over half the population - having received at least one shot of the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna two-dose vaccines and the one-dose Johnson & Johnson variant (which is currently on pause).AstraZeneca vaccines, which are available in India as Covidshield made by the Serum Institute of India, is not approved for use in the United States yet, with regulatory bodies concerned by its use of outdated data to seek authorisation. The company was prepared to roll out 30 million doses by April. It was not immediately known if that target had been met.“These vaccine doses will not be needed in the United States, where it’s estimated that vaccine manufacturers will be able to produce enough doses by early June to vaccinate every American,” Brilliant said, echoing top public health officials such as Anthony Fauci, who has said the US won’t need AstraZeneca as it has enough already, of Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines.Sending the AstraZeneca vaccines to India and other countries, Brilliant said, “would affirm US leadership, including in initiatives such as COVAX, and as we work with partners around the globe because no one is safe from the pandemic until we are all safe from it”. COVAX is a World Health Organization-led initiative to ensure free and affordable access to vaccines around the world.A growing number of lawmakers are urging the Biden administration to support a proposal put forward by India and South Africa to temporarily waive intellectual property rights to Covid-19 vaccines, therapeutics and technologies to make them more accessible around the world.And, Indian and US officials are in talks to resolve a supply bottleneck created by President Joe Biden’s use of war-time powers under the Defense Production Act that prioritise US supplies of raw materials for Covid-19 vaccines for use in American. This could slow down Indian production of vaccines down the line it is feared.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/top-us-lobby-group-urges-biden-to-help-india-fight-covid19-101619237639285.html

Seventy percent of voters polled were satisfied with how the government was handling the pandemic, up from 53% in January, it said. The results also showed that Muhyiddin retains strong backing from the dominant Malay electorate, with 83% support.Muhyiddin’s rating is “still strong” despite the “stressed conditions voters report for their own personal financial conditions and their perception of the economy,” Merdeka Center said.The prime minister is gearing up for an election that he said will be called as soon as the pandemic is brought under control. Malaysia declared a state of emergency in January, allowing Muhyiddin to suspend parliament until the emergency ends in August.Muhyiddin took over as prime minister early last year with a razor-thin majority after his predecessor, Mahathir Mohamad, abruptly quit.Malaysia started its Covid-19 vaccination program late February and unveiled a 20 billion ringgit ($4.9 billion) stimulus package in March while easing movement curbs.Still, the public mood about where the country is headed was mixed, with 41% believing that the country was “moving in the right direction” and 46% that was “headed in the wrong direction,” the survey showed.The poll was conducted between March 31 and April 12, before infections started climbing again. New Covid-19 cases topped 2,000 on April 15 for the first time in more than a month and have remained above that level through April 23.The survey involved 2,111 registered voters across Peninsular Malaysia with an estimated margin of error of 2.13%, according to Merdeka Center.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaysian-pm-s-approval-rating-stable-amid-covid-19-vaccine-rollout-101619236296370.html
24-04-2021||World||Vaccine industry leaders say manufacturing hurdles slowing rollout||Removing intellectual property protections from Covid-19 vaccines or pressuring companies into technology sharing will not speed up production of the jabs, and could even slow it down, the industry has warned.Proponents of doing away with IP rights say more companies in more countries could produce the vaccines, providing broader access in poorer nations that so far have seen few doses.South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, whose country is co-leading a push at the World Trade Organization to exempt Covid-19 vaccines from IP rights, insisted Friday the jabs were "a public good and must be recognised as such"."We call on the pharmaceutical industry to directly transfer this technology free of intellectual property barriers to low and middle-income countries," he told an event hosted by the World Health Organization."Let us together challenge vaccine nationalism and show that protecting intellectual property rights does not come at the expense of human lives."Vaccine makers have voiced broad commitment to cooperating to boost production, but at a separate event on Friday, industry representatives insisted that IP waivers and forced technology sharing was the wrong way to go.10 billion dosesAn IP waiver "wouldn't give us the tools to produce more doses of vaccines", Thomas Cueni, head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations (IFPMA), told reporters.He pointed out that around 275 manufacturing deals, including on technology transfer among staunch competitors, had helped the industry go from zero to one billion Covid-19 vaccine doses already produced, with the goal of 10 billion doses by the end of the year.Industry players said though that that target hinged not on IP restrictions or broader technology transfers, but on resolving serious challenges, linked to trade barriers and export restrictions, hindering the movement of vaccine components and the vaccines themselves."Vaccine manufacturing is not just about patents," said Sai Prasad, head of quality operations at Indian vaccine maker Bharat Biotech and president of the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers' Network (DCVMN).'Complex'Prasad pointed to the complexity of ensuring that manufacturers have the equipment and know-how to meet the stringent quality and safety standards required in vaccine production."This is a very complex space, very complicated science, manufacturing is very complicated.... We need to be careful who we are transferring technology to."With vaccine scepticism already rampant, manufacturing difficulties could have dire consequences, warned Michelle McMurry-Heath, who heads the Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO)."We don't want to do anything to undermine vaccine confidence," she said."We need to recognise that there are only a handful of manufacturers across the globe who have that expertise at hand, and we need to focus on getting them the materials they need to produce as many doses as quickly as possible."Industry players said a major challenge was a global shortage of more than 100 components and ingredients needed for vaccine manufacturing.While much effort has gone into ensuring there are enough glass vials and syringes, today there are shortages in the lipids used to produce the mRNA Covid-19 vaccines made by Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech, as well as tubing and plastic bags used in the vaccine production process.Faced with such shortages, Moderna chief Stephane Bancel told reporters that pushing for technology transfer to manufacturers less equipped to produce large quantities of vaccine could backfire.Could 'slow down' production"If we have more players coming into the space, (they will be) taking more of the raw materials away from people (positioned) to make vaccines for this year," he said.McMurry-Heath agreed."Trying to diffuse the limited raw materials that we have right now across many more manufacturers that perhaps don't have experience manufacturing vaccines, could jeopardise the progress we are on track to make," she warned.Moderna is aiming to produce one billion doses of its Covid-19 vaccine by the end of this year, and hopes to produce another 1.4 billion doses next year.But Bancel warned broadening its efforts to share technology to help others manufacture its jabs could actually delay production.Since transferring the technology and expertise takes months, he said new partners added now would "have almost no impact" on global vaccine production this year.However, "it will slow down our ability to scale up in 2021", Bancel said, pointing out that it would require moving staff involved in production over to the technology transfer process."If we distract the small team of engineers we have to do those tech transfers now," he warned, "the impact on lives and the spread of the virus in 2021 will be very large."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/vaccine-industry-leaders-say-manufacturing-hurdles-slowing-rollout-101619233624634.html

But he said that "if we were to have problems, we have a plan of how to enter the field ... our armed forces could one day go into the streets."The comments by Bolsonaro, a far-right former army captain who has long praised Brazil's two-decade military dictatorship, will do little to assuage critics who fret about his politicization of the military. Others worry about his commitment to a peaceful handover of power in the event of a tight result in next year's presidential election.Pressure has grown on the president as Brazil's coronavirus pandemic has spiraled out of control. He has faced widespread criticism for his handling of the outbreak in Brazil, which has the world's second highest coronavirus death toll after the United States.Last month, Bolsonaro put his former chief of staff in charge of the Defense Ministry and swapped all three commanders of the armed forces as part of a cabinet reshuffle that was met with shock from senior military officers.Since his 2018 election victory, Bolsonaro has made baseless allegations of voter fraud in Brazil, which critics say could lay the groundwork to challenge upcoming elections in the same vein as his political idol, former U.S. President Donald Trump.Bolsonaro threw his support behind Trump's conspiracies of a stolen election last year, which culminated in his supporters' deadly Jan. 6 assault on the Capitol building in Washington.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/brazils-bolsonaro-says-military-would-follow-his-orders-to-take-the-streets-101619231420252.html

The Indonesian navy said it was sending search helicopters and ships to the area where contact was lost with the 44-year-old KRI Nanggala-402 submarine on Wednesday as it prepared to conduct a torpedo drill.Australia has also deployed a sonar-equipped warship with a helicopter to help the submarine hunt, as concerns grow that the submarine might have been crushed by water pressure.If the submarine was still intact, Indonesian officials said on Friday it would only have enough air to last until around dawn on Saturday."So far we haven't found it... but with the equipment available we should be able to find the location," Achmad Riad, a spokesman for the Indonesian military, told a news conference. Indonesia's navy said it was investigating whether the submarine lost power during a dive and could not carry out emergency procedures as it descended to a depth of 600-700 metres (1,968-2,296 feet), well beyond its survivable limits.An object with "high magnetic force" had been spotted "floating" at a depth of 50-100 metres, Indonesian Navy Chief of Staff Yudo Margono said on Friday, and an aerial search had earlier spotted an oil spill near the submarine's last location.The diesel-electric powered submarine could withstand a depth of up to 500 metres but anything more could be fatal, navy spokesman Julius Widjojono said. The Bali Sea can reach depths of more than 1,500 metres.One of the people on board was the commander of the Indonesian submarine fleet, Harry Setiawan.Late on Friday, the Pentagon said U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had spoken with his Indonesian counterpart Prabowo Subianto and offered additional support, which could include undersea search assets.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/hope-fades-for-indonesian-missing-submarine-as-us-assists-search-101619228253150.html

The most common side effects are usually mild or moderate and get better within a few days."Despite reports that clot cases were more prevalent among women, the EMA said that "there were insufficient data available from across the EU to provide further context on benefits and risks with regard to sex."Blow to confidence Public confidence in the AstraZeneca jab has taken a blow since the EMA said on April 7 that a very rare, but often fatal, form of blood clot affecting the brain should be listed as a side effect.Clots are also being listed as a side effect of the J&J vaccine, which uses the same adenovirus vector technology as AstraZeneca, the EMA said earlier this week.Brussels asked the EMA earlier this month to carry out further investigations, and the watchdog said its announcement on Friday was to "provide an update on the analysis of data" on AstraZeneca.The EMA said it was also sharing the latest opinion issued by its human medicines committee "aimed at supporting national decision-making on how to best use the vaccine in their territories."The regulator said on Tuesday that there had been 287 cases of the rare clots worldwide linked to AstraZeneca, 25 to the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, eight to the Johnson & Johnson shot and five to the Moderna jab.The EU is now increasingly relying for its rollout on the BioNTech/Pfizer vaccine, which uses rival mRNA tech.The European Commission is also looking to launch legal action against AstraZeneca for underdelivering Covid-19 vaccine doses to the EU, which hobbled its early rollout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/astrazeneca-vaccine-benefits-increase-with-age-eu-drug-watchdog-101619229326450.html

The case prompted some police reforms, but advocates including President Joe Biden say more is needed.While the Chauvin trial progressed in Minneapolis, the city was rocked by the fatal police shooting of yet another African American, 20-year-old Daunte Wright.On Wednesday US Attorney General Merrick Garland announced a civil investigation to determine whether the Minneapolis Police Department systematically uses excessive force and "engages in a pattern or practice of unconstitutional or unlawful policing," including during legal protests.- 'We needed a victory' -The jury deliberated less than 11 hours before finding Chauvin guilty of all three charges against him: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter.A crowd gathered outside the heavily guarded downtown Minneapolis courtroom erupted in cheers, and some wept tears of relief, when the verdicts were announced after a three-week trial that had an entire nation on edge.Chauvin, who had been free on bail, was put in handcuffs after Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill read out the unanimous verdicts reached by the racially diverse, seven-woman, five-man jury.Ahead of the verdict, cities across the United States had been braced for potential unrest and National Guard troops were deployed in Minneapolis.Floyd was initially arrested on suspicion of a non-violent crime -- trying to pass off a counterfeit $20 bill. His brother Rodney told AFP that Black people had been victims of deadly injustice at the hands of US authorities for hundreds of years."We needed a victory in this case, it's very important, and we got it and hey, we might actually breathe a little bit better now," he said.Three other former police officers involved in Floyd's arrest are to go on trial later this year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-ex-cop-derek-chauvin-to-be-sentenced-on-june-16-for-george-floyd-murder-101619228267092.html

We were treated like fools for decades, however, I got them to pay billions of dollars more for the military protection and services we render.""The Biden Administration is not even going to ask for the additional billions South Korea agreed to pay us," Trump added, referring to current President Joe Biden.During his presidency, Trump positioned himself as a lead negotiator in peace talks on the Korean peninsula.He first met in June 2018 with Kim in Singapore, the first-ever summit between the countries still technically at war, and later said the two leaders "fell in love."The pair met twice more during Trump's time in office, and North Korea held off on nuclear and missile tests -- but analysts say Pyongyang has kept advancing its weapons programs.In March, South Korea agreed to pay 13.9 percent more toward the cost of the US troop presence on the peninsula, in a six-year deal resolving an issue that festered under the Trump administration.The financial dispute had bedeviled the two allies' security alliance after Trump -- who took a transactional approach to foreign policy -- repeatedly accused South Korea of freeloading.Washington stations around 28,500 troops in South Korea to defend it from the nuclear-armed North Korea, as well as to protect US interests in northeast Asia.Under the new deal, Seoul has agreed to pay 1.18 trillion won ($1.03 billion) for 2021, with annual increases thereafter linked to its defense budget.The sum represents a 13.9 percent increase on the roughly $920 million Seoul was paying under the previous agreement, which expired in 2019 -- but is a far cry from the Trump administration's initial demand of $5 billion a year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/donald-trump-slams-south-korea-s-moon-but-says-he-likes-north-korea-kim-jong-un-101619228351059.html

Today I'll sign the relevant decree," Putin said in a televised meeting in response to a proposal from the head of Rospotrebnadzor, Anna Popova.She said that the non-working stint over May 1-11 was part of an effort to limit the time Russians spend on public transport and their exposure to the virus.Click here for full Covid-19 coverageMany Russians go on vacation in early May every year.May 1, when Russians mark Labour Day, and May 9, when the country celebrates its victory in World War II, are public holidays.Before the announcement May 4-7 were supposed to be regular work days.The move, expected to be welcomed by the public in an election year, also signals a reversal in Russia's recent hands-off approach to containing the virus.Most restrictions across the country have been lifted, and life in the capital Moscow -- the epicentre of the country's outbreak -- all but returned to normal at the beginning of the year.Instead of a fresh lockdown, the country has relied on its homegrown Sputnik V vaccine to tackle a fresh wave of infections that battered the country since last autumn.But Russia has been among the hardest hit by Covid-19, with the Rosstat state statistics agency recording more than 224,000 virus-related deaths -- significantly higher than the 107,501 health officials had reported as of Friday.The Rosstat toll would mean Russia has the third-highest number of coronavirus deaths in the world, after the United States and Brazil.Putin, during his annual state of the nation address this week, hailed three vaccines developed by Russia, saying there were central to the country's ambition of developing herd immunity by the fall.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/putin-announces-10-day-non-working-period-to-prevent-virus-surge-in-russia-101619225440641.html
24-04-2021||World||Russian family divorce saga: Oligarch's son Akhmedov to pay $100 mn to mother||The son at the center of the UK’s largest divorce lost a London court ruling over his role in hiding assets from his mother with a judge calling him “a dishonest individual who will do anything to assist his father.”Temur Akhmedov worked with his billionaire father, Farkhad Akhmedov, to do “all he could” to stop his mother from obtaining a 450 million-pound ($627 million) court-approved divorce payout, Judge Gwynneth Knowles said in a ruling Wednesday. The judge ruled Temur should pay his mother more than $100 million.The trial attracted scrutiny after Temur revealed he’d lost more than $50 million day trading while a college student. He’d argued that far from hiding his father’s money from his mother, he’d instead lost some of it with bad trades.“Temur has learned well from his father’s past conduct and has done and said all he could to prevent his mother receiving a penny of the matrimonial assets,” the judge said.Temur’s mother, Tatiana Akhmedova, wants the keys to a luxury apartment overlooking London’s Hyde Park in a bid to recover some of the cash.Azerbaijan-born Farkhad made much of his wealth from the sale of his stake in a Russian gas producer in November 2012 for $1.4 billion. But the oligarch has refused to make any divorce payments, leaving Tatiana, backed by litigation funder Burford Capital Ltd., to pursue cases in at least six countries.“Entirely predictably, given its original wrong and misguided judgment, the London court has ruled in favor of visiting ‘the sins’ of the father on an innocent and loyal son,” Farkhad said in a statement.The fight has led to Tatiana’s so-far unsuccessful legal attempts to seize a 115-meter (377-foot) superyacht once owned by Roman Abramovich that is currently in Dubai, and a collection of modern art worth more than $140 million in a secure storage facility in Liechtenstein known as the “Treasure House.”Farkhad moved to Russia after the initial divorce order in 2016. But by getting an English ruling against Temur, a UK resident, it’ll be easier for his mother to obtain his local assets.At the trial last year, Temur said his father made his own decisions. He said his mother’s choice to draw him into the litigation has been “tremendously upsetting and in many ways quite frightening.”He said in a statement that while he disagreed with the ruling, “he would consider it a price worth paying for should it lead to a reasonable settlement between the parents he both loves.”Tatiana said during the trial that her relationship with her eldest son “is now very strained.” She said she felt she had no choice but to sue him.“I always knew that my strength would prevail through the smoke and mirrors as presented by Farkhad and his circus of illusionists,” Tatiana said in a statement after the ruling.Temur said at the trial that he’d had some initial success trading stocks, only to hit a losing streak while studying at the London School of Economics. When he tried to make back the money, “convinced this loss was just bad luck,” he increased his risk exposure and lost everything, he explained in court.The judge rejected Temur’s explanation that his mother knew about his trading, saying the transfer of millions of dollars from his father’s account was in fact designed to put it out of her reach. That he’d then racked up losses was beside the point, she said.“All happy families are alike, each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way,” Knowles said in her judgment. “With apologies to Tolstoy, the Akhmedov family is one of the unhappiest ever to have appeared in my courtroom.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russian-family-divorce-saga-oligarch-s-son-akhmedov-to-pay-100-mn-to-mother-101619224484851.html

Three of the dead were men, while one was a woman.Many of the fire service personnel sustained injuries during the rescue operations.In total, 23 people were said to be injured in the incident, with many admitted at the Sir Salimullah Medical College and Mitford Hospital, The Daily Star reported.Director General of Bangladesh Fire Services Md Sazzad Hussain said an investigation is underway to determine the cause of the fire.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/4-killed-23-hurt-as-fire-breaks-out-in-chemical-warehouse-in-dhaka-101619224814214.html
24-04-2021||World||'I'm in!': Transgender icon Caitlyn Jenner running for California governor||Caitlyn Jenner's decision Friday to enter the race for California governor injects a jolt of celebrity into a campaign to recall Gov. Gavin Newsom while raising questions about whether a political newcomer can lead the nation's most populous state as it recovers from the pandemic.Jenner — an Olympic hero, reality TV personality and longtime Republican — announced “I'm in" on Twitter, joining a growing list of candidates seeking to oust Newsom from office.“For the past decade, we have seen the glimmer of the Golden State reduced by one-party rule that places politics over progress and special interests over people. Sacramento needs an honest leader with a clear vision,” Jenner said in a statement announcing her “Caitlyn for California" candidacy.Newsom, a first-term Democrat, is facing a likely recall election this year, though officials still are reviewing petition signatures required to qualify the proposal for the ballot. County election officials are required to submit their final signature tallies to the state no later than next Thursday.The race had failed to attract a nationally recognized contender before the entrance of the 71-year-old Jenner, who won the decathlon in the 1976 Summer Olympics and is widely known from shows “Keeping Up with the Kardashians” and the spin-off “I Am Cait” that debuted after she came out as a transgender woman in 2015.However, she is untested as a candidate and little is known about her positions on critical issues facing the state, from the coronavirus pandemic to managing the economy. She has ties to former President Donald Trump, who remains broadly unpopular in California outside his GOP base, as well as his former political operatives.Jenner credits herself with advancing the movement for equality. But the LGBTQ advocacy group Equality California said it would oppose her candidacy, citing her ties to Trump and Republicans who have sought to undercut transgender rights around the nation.She also has faced speculation that she's entering politics to steer attention to her entertainment career.Still, with her name recognition and ability to attract publicity, she could overshadow other GOP contenders, including former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, former U.S. Rep. Doug Ose and businessman John Cox, who lost badly to Newsom in the 2018 governor’s race.Hours after Jenner announced she would run, Faulconer took a lightly veiled swipe at her lack of experience in government.“I think I’m uniquely positioned in terms of somebody who has won elections and knows how to get results," he told reporters.Newsom declined to comment directly on Jenner’s candidacy during an event marking the reopening of a section of Highway 1 in Big Sur that collapsed in February. Instead, he pivoted to a rousing defense of his administration, highlighting the state’s progress on constructing roads and bridges, vaccinating Californians and building a budget surplus.“That's what I’m focused on,” he said.But a fundraising appeal from his campaign sent after Jenner's announcement warned that “we’re going to need help keeping up with Caitlyn’s personal wealth and ability to raise money from right-wing donors, now that she has Trump’s team with her.”In a statement, Jenner called herself an outsider, “a proven winner” and the only candidate “who can put an end to Gavin Newsom's disastrous time as governor.”It was notable that her announcement did not include a video, which is commonplace in political campaign kickoffs. Instead, in her written statement, she referred only vaguely to cutting taxes, a “roadmap back to prosperity” and taking on special interests.Her campaign did not respond to a request for an on-camera interview.She described herself as “economically conservative, socially progressive” in a People magazine interview last year.Her run would come nearly two decades after the ascendancy of Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican who used his Hollywood fame as a springboard to California's highest office in a 2003 recall election.If the recall qualifies as expected for the ballot this year, voters would be asked two questions. First, whether Newsom should be removed from office and second who should replace him.If a majority says no to recalling Newsom, he stays in office and the votes for the replacements are irrelevant. But if a majority votes to remove him, then whoever among the candidates gets the most votes becomes California governor. With dozens of names expected on the ballot, it's likely a winner would get less than 50% of the votes.The recall effort largely has been fueled by criticism of Newsom’s handling of the pandemic, which shuttered schools and closed thousands of businesses.He’s also been hit by the fallout from a multibillion-dollar fraud scandal at the state unemployment agency while weathering a public shaming for dining out with friends and lobbyists at an exclusive San Francisco Bay Area restaurant last fall, while telling state residents to stay home for safety. Photos showed Newsom without a mask.However, recent polling has suggested Newsom would hold his seat, and the sour public mood could shift as coronavirus restrictions recede. California also is likely to be the recipient of billions of dollars of federal recovery funds, which Newsom will dispense and could use to his political advantage.Anne Dunsmore, a consultant for Rescue California, one of the political committees backing the recall, said she recently spoke to Jenner and views her as a serious candidate.“I don’t think she’s going to use it to further her own purpose, but rather bring awareness to what’s happening here,” Dunsmore said.Jenner made headlines in recent years with her ties to Trump, who lost to Joe Biden in the state by over 5 million votes.Jenner supported Trump in 2016 but later criticized his administration’s reversal of a directive on transgender access to public school bathrooms. She also split with Trump after he said transgender people would not be allowed to serve in the U.S. military.The team advising Jenner has included Trump’s former campaign manager, Brad Parscale, and GOP fundraiser Caroline Wren, who also worked for Trump's campaign.Jenner also could face questions about a 2015 fatal crash in which she rear-ended two cars. A 69-year-old woman was killed when her car was pushed into the path of an oncoming Hummer.Thad Kousser, a political science professor at the University of California, San Diego, noted that voters have embraced non-traditional candidates in the past, including Schwarzenegger. But Jenner will face long odds because of her links to Trump in the heavily Democratic state, while also lacking an established political constituency.Still, she has “the ability to directly reach out to millions of voters” through social media, Kousser said. “It would be a mistake to view her of one of these ‘circus candidates.’”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/im-in-transgender-icon-caitlyn-jenner-running-for-california-governor-101619224193695.html

Regulators put dosing with the vaccine on hold 10 days ago to gather more information.The agencies could decide to resume use of the vaccine as soon as Friday evening. The FDA will include a warning statement with the shot about the risk of clots, which have primarily been seen in young women.More than than 8 million Americans have been given J&J’s vaccine. The panel reviewed evidence from 15 women who suffered the rare side effect. Three died, while seven remain hospitalized and five were discharged.Thirteen of the women were under the age of 50, according to the presentation. Meanwhile, 12 of the 15 cases involved rare brain blood clots. As of April 21, about 4 million women in the U.S. had received the J&J vaccine.Plenty of InterestCDC Director Rochelle Walensky said Friday that many people would still want a J&J shot. Unlike two-dose vaccines developed by Pfizer Inc. and Moderna Inc., J&J’s coronavirus vaccine requires a single shot and can be kept in refrigerators, making it a preferred tool for those who interact less frequently with the health system, or live in hard-to-reach places.“I do think that there’s plenty of people who are interested in the J&J vaccine if just for convenience as well as for a single-dose option,” Walensky said.The agency has been doing risk-benefit analysis, she said, including looking at who would prefer the J&J vaccine or wouldn’t be able to access others. The CDC and the Food and Drug Administration “feel strongly that we need to act swiftly after that analysis,” Walensky said.Panelists wrestled with whether the benefits of J&J’s vaccine -- preventing hospitalization and death -- outweigh the risk of developing a clot. One of the most commonly cited concerns about keeping J&J’s vaccine sidelined was the disproportionate impact on vulnerable communities, including the homeless. Many state and local health departments were using J&J’s vaccine, which requires only one dose and is easier to store than other available Covid-19 vaccines, to reach these groups.Sarah Long, a Drexel University College of Medicine pediatrician who voted against the recommendation, says she didn’t object to resuming use of the vaccine, but to the lack of guidance.“I am very sorry that we haven’t chosen to put up front the knowledge that we have,” she said during the meeting, “that this is unique, it’s clustered, that it’s almost certainly related to the vaccine.”While the cases reviewed Friday suggest the blood clots are most common in young women, panelists warned the clots may still occur in men. One man in J&J’s clinical trial developed a clot. And two of the 15 cases recorded thus far occurred in women over 50, raising the possibility that the syndrome can also appear in older people.European Union regulators have already decided to move forward with J&J’s vaccine, and Friday issued an analysis showing that the benefits of AstraZeneca Plc’s vaccine, also linked to clotting, outweigh its risks. The European Medicines Agency said the blood clots should be listed as a very rare side effect of J&J’s vaccine so doctors and people who receive it can be aware of the symptoms.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-resumes-j-j-covid-vaccinations-despite-clotting-fears-101619222633060.html

The Bali Sea can reach depths of more than 1,500 metres.An Indonesian defence expert said the crew could still be found alive. “But if the submarine is in a 700-metre sea trough, it will be difficult for them to survive because underwater pressure will cause cracks and ruptures of the steel hull,” Connie Rahakundini Bakrie said.The submarine joined the Indonesian fleet in 1981, according to the defence ministry, and underwent a refit in South Korea completed in 2012. It was said to be in good condition.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/rescuers-race-against-time-to-find-lost-uboat-101619208679283.html

No serious adverse events were reported.It is the first candidate vaccine for malaria to surpass a target set by the UN’s World Health Organization (WHO), for researchers to create a jab of 75% efficacy by 2030.A broader Phase 3 trial involving 4,800 children will now be carried out in four African countries, in collaboration with the Serum Institute of India and the US pharma company Novavax.Adrian Hill, head of the Jenner Institute - which developed the coronavirus vaccine now being distributed by AstraZeneca - said the test results marked “a great day” in the global fight against malaria.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/malaria-vaccine-found-to-be-77-effective-in-trials-hits-who-target-101619207378828.html
24-04-2021||World||US defends curbs on vaccine raw material exports, Angela Merkel targets Indian pharma||The US has defended curbs on exports of raw materials needed by India to make Covid-19 vaccines, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel was critical of the slowdown of vaccine exports from India against the backdrop of a record spike in Coronavirus infections in the country. The position taken by the US state department and the German leader caused consternation in official circles in New Delhi, though there was no formal response from Indian officials. India has raised with the US the need to lift restrictions imposed on the export of critical raw materials and equipment several times since February. US President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act on February 5 to restrict exports of the raw materials to boost domestic vaccine production. External affairs minister S Jaishankar raised the matter with secretary of state Antony Blinken when they spoke on April 19, and it has also been taken up in Washington by Indian envoy Taranjit Singh Sandhu. Asked by a reporter about India’s call to ease the export curbs as they threaten to slow the country’s vaccination drive, US state department spokesperson Ned Price told a briefing on Thursday that the Biden administration’s priority is to meet the vaccine requirements of the American people. “What I will say broadly is that the US first and foremost is engaged in an ambitious and effective and, so far, successful effort to vaccinate the American people,” Price said. “Number one, we have a special responsibility to the American people. Number two...this country has been hit harder than any other country around the world – more than 550,000 deaths, tens of millions of infections in this country alone. But there’s also a broader point here that I made yesterday that it’s...not only in our interest to see Americans vaccinated, it’s in the interests of the rest of the world to see Americans vaccinated,” he added. Price also pointed to arrangements between the US and the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad on vaccine production, including increasing production capacity in India, but did not say whether or when the US would ease curbs on export of vaccine raw materials. The silence of the top US leadership on this matter has not gone down well in New Delhi, especially against the backdrop of the agreement on vaccine production and delivery at the first virtual summit of Quad leaders in March. In a separate development, Merkel held out what was perceived in some quarters as a veiled threat on the issue of India calibrating Covid-19 vaccine exports since last month in order to focus on its domestic immunisation programme. Germany is among the European countries affected by a slowdown in exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India (SII). “We now have a situation with India where, in connection with the emergency situation of the pandemic, we are worried whether the pharmaceutical products will still come to us,” Merkel was quoted as saying by Politico while participating in an online conversation on Wednesday. “Of course, we have only allowed India to become such a large pharmaceutical producer in the first place, also from the European side, in the expectation that this should then also be complied with. If that is not the case now, we will have to rethink,” she added. Observers noted Merkel’s comments came against the backdrop of several European countries themselves banning exports of vaccines, and at a time when India is registering a record number of infections – 332,730 as of Friday – and is struggling to cope with the surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-defends-curbs-on-vaccine-raw-material-exports-angela-merkel-targets-indian-pharma-101619206077962.html

India also plans to airlift oxygen containers from the United Arab Emirates.The last two days have seen the air force carry out several sorties to airlift oxygen containers, cylinders, essential medicines and equipment required for setting up and sustaining Covid-19 hospitals and facilities to deal with the surge in infections. The IAF is using a variety of aircraft for Covid-19 relief work including C-17, C-130J, IL-76, An-32, Avro, Chinook and Mi-17 helicopters, as previously reported by Hindustan Times.“One IAF Chinook helicopter and an An-32 transport aircraft took Covid-19 testing equipment from Jammu to Leh and from Jammu to Kargil (on Saturday), respectively. The equipment consisted of bio-safety cabinets, centrifuges and stabilisers. These machines have been made by the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) and now given to UT of Ladakh to enhance testing,” the statement said.With India reeling under a public health emergency and its health resources at breaking point, the defence minister on Saturday chaired a meeting of top officials including the chief of defence staff to review the efforts of the ministry and the armed forces to fight the Covid-19 crisis.The armed forces and the defence ministry “will leave no stone unturned in providing all possible assistance to the civilian administration,” Singh later wrote on Twitter.During the review meeting, Singh was told by the navy that its warships have been kept on standby for moving oxygen tankers, the defence ministry said in a statement.The minister was also informed that an extra 250 ICU beds will be functional at the DRDO Covid facility in Delhi by Saturday evening taking the total number of beds to 500.The defence ministry said that compared to last year, the Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) has deployed more medical staff, including specialists, super specialists and paramedics, at DRDO’s Sardar Vallabhbhai Patel Covid-19 hospital to cater to the current surge in infections.“As against 294 doctors and health workers in 2020, 378 have been mobilised in 2021. These include 164 doctors in 2021 as against 132 doctors in 2020. Last year, only 18 specialists were mobilised, as against 43 specialists and 17 super specialists this year,” the defence ministry said in another statement. .The highly skilled specialists and super specialists have been deployed at the facility after being drawn from already-stretched service hospitals, it said. The number of critical patients admitted in 2021 is more than eight times compared to last year’s worst peak, the statement said.The DRDO is among the organisations that are at the forefront of fighting the second deadly wave of Covid-19 that has ripped through the country. It has so far set up or is in the process of setting up state-of-the-art Covid-19 hospitals in six cities to treat more than 3,100 critical patients. The DRDO has set up a 500-bed hospital in Delhi, a 1,000-bed hospital in Ahmedabad and converted an ESIC hospital into a 500-bed Covid-19 facility in Patna. In addition, hospitals with 450 beds in Lucknow and 750 beds in Varanasi are expected to be functional soon. A sixth Covid-19 hospital is being readied in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur.These hospitals would be operated by the AFMS in coordination with the state governments.The armed forces and other wings of the defence ministry can play an important role in the fight against Covid-19, said Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former directed general of AFMS said on Thursday.“They have the manpower, resources and discipline to provide relief in these hard times. The military especially has a culture of quick response, be it enemy action or natural catastrophes. It can do a lot to alleviate the sufferings of our countrymen during the pandemic too,” Chopra said.The AFMS is importing mobile oxygen generation plants from Germany to address the oxygen crisis precipitated by the second wave of the pandemic. It is importing 23 such plants that are expected to arrive in a week.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-intensifies-efforts-for-covid-relief-as-govt-asks-it-to-render-maximum-help-101619278495948.html

Both the BJP and the commission have refuted such charges.“The BJP won’t even get 70 seats. The Congress-Left alliance may get at the most 20– 25 seats, or even less. You don’t have the power to stop TMC,” Mamata said while attacking the ECI.Though none of the senior officials of the poll panel in Kolkata commented on the chief minister’s remarks, the BJP has hit out.“These are clear signs that she has become unnerved. She knows very well that on May 2 the TMC is going to be ousted from power and hence is making such wild allegations. The BJP is coming to power with more than 200 seats,” said Samik Bhattacharya, BJP spokesperson.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/trinamool-congress-to-move-top-court-against-ec-after-polls-says-cm-mamata-101619276089424.html

24-04-2021||India||Daily Covid-19 deaths in India could peak over 5000 in next 15-16 days: Study||A new study has projected that India’s daily deaths due to the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) could peak as high as 5600 on May 10 and that additional 329,000 fatalities are estimated between April 12 and August 1. The study, 'COVID-19 projections’, was conducted by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) at the University of Washington which published a summary on April 15 that evaluated the grim situation in the country and projected around 665,000 deaths by August this year.The study said that its worst-case scenario projects around 729,000 cumulative coronavirus disease-caused deaths on August 1, 2021. However, the study also suggested that universal mask coverage (95 per cent), if attained by next week, can save around 70,000 cumulative lives in the reference case scenario by August this year. Around 85,000 lives will also be saved considering the projected Covid-19 vaccine rollout, the study said, where it estimated that over 700 million people will be vaccinated by August 1.Click here for complete coverage of Covid-19According to the study, Covid-19 is the fifth major cause of deaths in the country this week. This was based on the estimation that daily deaths in the last week increased to 1,500 per day on an average in contrast to 970 deaths per day before. The infection detection rate in the country was revealed to be eight per cent, and the estimates of the study suggest that nearly 24 per cent of the population in the country have been infected as of April 12.Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra and Punjab, which have been showing the highest rise in the number of Covid-19 cases, according to the Union health ministry’s data, have a daily death rate of greater than 4 per million, the study said.India is fighting a dangerous second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) amid a heavy oxygen supply crunch. The highly, seemingly contagious second wave took the Covid-19 positivity rate of the country to 15.37 per cent from being less than 1.50 per cent during the initial weeks of February. The death toll of the country currently stands at 189,544 after more than 2600 deaths were reported in the last 24 hours, the health ministry’s data showed on Saturday morning.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/daily-covid-19-deaths-in-india-could-peak-over-5000-in-next-15-16-days-study-101619273221048.html

Citing some reports he said ₹600 (equivalent to 8 USD) per shot is the highest in the world and the vaccine firm was distributing the same to neighbouring Bangladesh for half of the cost.“I have written another letter to the Prime Minister citing these facts. Vaccine pricing is quite high, some studies show. We want the government to stick to its age-old policy of giving vaccine free of cost,” the CM reiterated. He said he had a meeting with private hospital managements on Saturday and asked them to increase their bed capacity to maximum.“We will have to learn a lesson from the trauma of the some of the states in north India. We have enough stock of oxygen but we may need more beds. There is no need to panic but we have to be vigilant,” he said adding the weekend 48- hour curbs were successful. “It is good that people responded well. We may have to tighten it further going by the caseload,” he said. Many busy roads and markets remained empty because permission was granted to only emergency services.For the third consecutive day, the viral caseload crossed 25,000-- out of 1,31,155 tests 26,685 were positive clocking a high TPR of 20.35%. The state also reported 25 fatalities taking the death toll to 5080. The active caseload is about to touch 2 lakh (1,98,576). Among those infected, 75 are health workers and 30 policemen, according to the data released by the state health ministry.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-logs-26-685-new-covid-19-cases-test-positivity-rate-climbs-to-2035-101619273088256.html
24-04-2021||India||In urban India, 50 million people in 15 cities have no access to safe, affordable drinking water: Unicef report||Healthy drinking water is very important for good health. Safe water supply ensures the health of a country, yet it is woefully under-prioritised, globally. And in India, it's at the lowest echelon.In urban India, 50 million people in 15 cities have no access to safe, affordable drinking water, reveals a UNICEF India report.Healthy drinking water is arguably one of the essential commodities, which plays a pivotal role in ensuring good health as it helps channelise the metabolic processes of the body. More so, in the current Covid scenario, water helps in staying healthy because proper hydration works as an important factor, helping your body fight the Covid virus."Amid the scarcity of water, it is very important to know about the purity of water available for consumption. It is often seen that people usually check if the water is clear while drinking. If it looks clean, they assume that it is safe to drink. But this is often not the case. Water looking clean might not always be safe for drinking," said Manjari Chandra, Consultant Nutritional Medicine, speaking on the essence of knowing healthy water."Healthy drinking water is very important for good health. But unhealthy water that the majority of urban Indians drink to survive due to the lack of knowledge about healthy water, is equally detrimental to health. Therefore, it is quintessential for everyone especially those who are living in urban India to know whether the water they consume is healthy or not because the sources it comes from and the way it is treated, determine its purity and safety for consumption," said Chandra,Drinking water comes from a variety of sources including public water systems, private wells, or bottled water. However, in urban India, the majority of the population resides in private households wherein privately owned and operated sources of drinking water, such as wells, cisterns, and springs are available. But people hardly know how the water they consume reaches them. How it is contaminated during the treatment and supply stages etc."The density of population in urban India is quite high and so is the scarcity of safe drinking water. Therefore, the majority of the population consumes water from privately owned water sources. In such a situation, knowing the way drinking water reaches them, turns very important considering its safety and purity. Usually, due to the hectic schedule, people living in urban India don't notice the discrepancy in the water pipelines of their own houses, which more often causes water contamination. So, it is obligatory for an individual to have a close eye on its maintenance. There are other sources of contamination that people usually don't pay heed to such as the water tank placed on their roofs if not cleaned at regular intervals contaminates the water stored in it," said Dr Prof Sanjay Rai, Professor, Dept. of Community Medicine, AIIMS, President, IPHA."Also, in urban India, Reverse Osmosis (RO) is one of the most effective water treatment processes being practised and widely used for water purification by the majority of the population. It is generally used for home water treatment to remove salts, chemical toxins, organic contaminants, dyes, pesticides, and microbes. In this process, the raw water is forced (with pressure) through a dense membrane filter that prevents the passing of impurities. Although, the Reverse Osmosis process has certain benefits such as it does not produce or use any harmful chemicals, yet water consumed after the treatment through the RO process is devoid of useful minerals. Unless minerals are added back, the RO water could have harmful effects on health. Therefore, it is very important that the water you drink must contain the right minerals to maintain the balance of the body," added, Dr Rai.In India, access to treated piped water continues to be inadequate for the majority of the population. Water from major sources like tube wells and hand pumps is also found to be unsafe as they are known to be carriers of waterborne diseases. While people blame unhygienic food for most of the ailments, waterborne diseases such as cholera, acute diarrhoeal diseases, typhoid, and viral hepatitis have caused 10,738 deaths, over the last five years since 2017. Of this, acute diarrhoeal diseases have caused maximum deaths followed by viral hepatitis, typhoid, and cholera.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/in-urban-india-50-million-people-in-15-cities-have-no-access-to-safe-affordable-drinking-water-unicef-report-101619271319685.html
24-04-2021||India||Why India is facing an oxygen crisis as Covid-19 cases mount||By air, by train and by road, India is scrambling to move large quantities of medical oxygen to hospitals in its capital New Delhi and other areas hit hard by a record surge of Covid-19.Are hospitals running out of oxygen ? The main problem is that medical oxygen is not reaching hospital beds in time. This delay is a product of where production units are located, a stretched distribution network, and what critics have said is bad planning.Several hospitals in Delhi, which has no significant oxygen production capacity, made frantic public calls this week seeking emergency supplies.With Covid-19 cases also swamping its neighbouring states like Haryana and Uttar Pradesh, oxygen facilities there are over-stretched attempting to meet local demand.To fulfil Delhi's current needs, additional medical oxygen now has to be trucked in from industrial zones in eastern India.Why are oxygen deliveries getting delayed ? The facilities from where Delhi will now receive oxygen are spread across seven states, some more than 1,000 km (625 miles)away, according to a court document.Given the hazardous nature of the substance, all liquid oxygen must be transported in a limited number of specialised tankers, requiring advance planning to ensure deliveries are made on time, a gas industry source told Reuters.In recent days, as a scramble for oxygen among states worsened, local officials in some regions disrupted movement of tankers in a bid to keep supplies for themselves.In part due to such blockades, Delhi only received about 177 tonnes of oxygen on Wednesday against its allocation of 378 tonnes, an official said.But the industry source said that Delhi had also dragged its feet on planning ahead, without factoring in the time it takes to move oxygen cross-country by road."This problem wouldn't have happened if they had acted 2-3 weeks ago," the source said.Delhi's government did not respond to questions about the planning.Does India have enough oxygen ?India has a daily production capacity of at least 7,100 tonnes of oxygen, including for industrial use, which appears to be enough to meet current demand.This week, the government allocated 6,822 tonnes of liquid oxygen per day to 20 of the country's worst-affected states, compared to their combined demand of 6,785 tonnes, Prime Minister Narendra Modi's office said on Thursday.India's total medical oxygen demand was just 3,842 tonnes as of April 12, as the surge in cases really took hold.States are typically allocated supplies by an inter-ministerial group of bureaucrats mandated to monitor and facilitate the flow of essential medical kit during the pandemic.Modi's office has noted that the availability of liquid medical oxygen had increased by about 3,300 tonnes in the past few days, with steel plants and other industrial units diverting their production.What is India doing to solve the crisis ?The federal government has activated the Indian railways to move multiple tankers from refilling plants to where it is most needed.Working with industrial gas major Linde India and others, the government is also using the Air Force's cargo planes to fly empty tankers to production hubs. Refilled oxygen tankers will then move back by road.The armed forces are importing 23 mobile oxygen generation plants from Germany.Several other industries are offering oxygen to hospitals, while salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group is importing 24 specialised containers to transport liquid oxygen.The government has issued orders to convert argon and nitrogen tankers into oxygen ones.But as some experts predict a trebling of daily infections in a few weeks, India will have to dramatically ramp up both oxygen production and distribution systems.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/why-india-is-facing-an-oxygen-crisis-as-covid-19-cases-mount-101619268862048.html
24-04-2021||India||‘Covishield most affordable Covid-19 jab’: SII calls out ‘inaccurate comparison’||The Serum Institute of India (SII) on Saturday responded to criticism over the latest price of its Covid-19 vaccine, Covishield, for state governments and private hospitals, saying the initial rates were kept very low globally as they were based on advance funding given by those countries for at-risk vaccine manufacturing.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 hereThe world’s largest vaccine manufacturer explained that government procurement for the immunisation programmes in all countries, including India, has been at a far lower price as the volumes are very large. “There was an inaccurate comparison done between the global prices of the vaccine with India. COVISHIELD is the most affordable COVID-19 vaccine available in the market today. The initial prices were kept very low globally as it was based on advance funding given by those countries for at risk vaccine manufacturing. The initial supply price of COVISHIELD for all government immunization programme, including India, has been the lowest,” the Pune-based SII said in a statement assuring transparency.SII’s statement comes against the backdrop of flak it faced after it notified on Wednesday that it will sell one jab of this two-dose vaccine for ₹600 to private facilities and ₹400 to state governments as the country preps for the third phase of vaccination from May 1. The pharmaceutical company’s CEO Adar Poonawalla later said for new contracts, the Centre will also have to pay ₹400 for each dose of Covishield, like state and UT governments, according to reports. However, the Union health ministry earlier on Saturday issued a clarification saying that the Centre will procure both the vaccines at Rs150 and those doses will be provided free to the states.Pointing to the seriousness of the situation during the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic and the firm’s need to ensure sustainability, SII said, “The current situation is extremely dire; the virus is constantly mutating while the public remains at risk. Identifying the uncertainty, we have to ensure sustainability as we must be able to invest in scaling up and expanding our capacity to fight the pandemic and save lives.”The Pune-based firm added that only a limited portion of SII’s volume will be sold to private hospitals at ₹600 per dose and assured that the cost of the vaccine is still lower than a lot of other medical treatment and essentials required to treat Covid-19 and other life-threatening diseases.As the country battles the second wave of infections, Adar Poonawalla suggested it is important for the market to open up for other vaccines from across the world. “This will accelerate and advance the immunization program of our country,” he said in the statement.SII’s Covishield, which has been developed by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca, and Bharat Biotech’s Covaxin are being used in the government’s massive vaccination drive in a race against the pandemic, which affected millions across the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covishield-most-affordable-covid-19-jab-sii-calls-out-inaccurate-comparison-101619267794573.html

Covid-19 vaccines too would be exempt from basic customs duty, it was decided.“The Prime Minister chaired a meeting to review steps taken to boost oxygen availability in the country. The PM emphasized that there was an immediate need to augment the supply of medical-grade oxygen as well as equipment required for patient care both at home and in hospitals,” an official statement read.The statement said the government had decided to grant full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess on import of oxygen and related gear for three months.The scrapping on related import duties will ease imports and make imported oxygen and related medical equipment cheaper, measures likely to boost availability.The PM stressed all ministries and departments need to work in synergy to increase availability of oxygen and medical supplies, according to the statement.Basic customs duty on Remdesivir, a drug recommended for use to treat Covid-19 in certain in-hospital cases, and Remdesivir’s active pharmaceutical ingredients has already been waived off.In the meeting chaired by PM, there were discussions on speeding up import of equipment related to providing oxygen, which could result in more easing of import regulations related to medical use of oxygen.Shortage of medical oxygen has paralysed Covid-19 treatment in major hospitals in Delhi and other cities for the third day on Saturday. Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Friday had said the capital’s requirement of oxygen stood at 700 MT, while only about 400 MT was available, while the capital’s quota was enhanced to 480 MT.In order to augment production and availability and meet rising demand, the PM-chaired meet decided to grant full exemption from basic customs duty and health cess on import of a range of medical equipment and gear, including medical-grade oxygen, oxygen concentrators along with flow meters, regulators, connectors and tubing vacuum pressure swing absorption units.Any other device from which oxygen can be generated will also enjoy these waivers.The PM has directed the revenue department to ensure seamless and quick custom clearance of such equipment.The department of revenue has named Gaurav Masaldan, joint secretary, customs, as the nodal officer for issues related to customs clearance for the oxygen and oxygen-related gear, the official statement added.The country has recorded more than 25 lakh active coronavirus cases and has so far reported more than 1,89,000 coronavirus-related deaths. The ongoing surge in infections has greatly increased demand for medical oxygen.The official statement said a host of administrative and other measures had been taken to boost oxygen availability, as medical doctors sounded alarm over dwindling stocks to treat critical patients.“IAF planes are bringing in cryogenic oxygen tanks from Singapore. IAF is also transporting oxygen tanks in the country to reduce travel times. Similarly, in a major decision yesterday, free food grains will be given to 80 crore Indians for the month of May and June 2021,” the statement said.Those who participated in the meet chaired by the PM, included the finance minister, commerce and industry minister, the health minister, principal secretary to the PM, Member NITI Aayog, Dr Randeep Guleria of AIIMS and the Secretaries of the department of revenue and health along a host of other officials.Commerce minister Piyush Goyal tweeted that customs clearances for Covid-19 related imports will be fast-tracked. “In another step towards fighting Covi-19, Customs will expedite clearances for import consignments relating to the pandemic to ensure critical equipment and medicine can reach on time,” the tweet said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-scraps-duties-on-oxygen-to-ramp-up-import-amid-covid-19-surge-101619263020529.html

24-04-2021||India||PM Modi reiterates need for Covid-19-appropriate behaviour, increased vaccination||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday reiterated the need for Covid-19-appropriate behaviour and increased vaccination against the disease while hoping both urban and rural India would win the fight against the virus and help the country overcome the crisis it faces amid the second wave of the pandemic.Speaking at the virtual launch of the distribution of e-property cards to over 40,00,00 property owners under the Centre’s SMVITA scheme on the National Panchayat Day, Modi thanked rural India for its cooperation in preventing Covid-19 transmission in the villages. He said Panchayat leaders need to work again to stop the spread as India faces a much bigger challenge this time.The second pandemic wave has led to a scarcity of critical resources such as oxygen and medicines as rising infections have overwhelmed hospitals across the country.Modi, who was addressing Panchayat leaders across the country virtually, referred to India’s year-long experience in tackling the virus spread and added local leaders should use this to spread awareness among the masses and stop the Covid-19 spread. He asked the leaders to ensure the people in villages get the double Covid-19 vaccine dose.Modi called the Panchayati Raj Day a very important occasion to recognise the achievements of local governments. He added that the day was remarkable in India’s history as million would get property cards. Modi said the SMVITA scheme was aimed at fast tracking development, which will be possible only with the full support of the Panchayats.Modi spoke about the Garib Kalyan Rozgar scheme launched in 2020 for migrant workers forced to return to their homes following the lockdown imposed last year to check the pandemic spread. “The government of India has already initiated the free distribution of the food to the poor, and this would benefit over 800 million,” said Modi. Modi called it the responsibility of local leaders to promote democracy at the grassroots level and also asked them to look for new ways to develop each village. He referred to the SMVITA scheme and added property ownership rights will create a sense of security among the rural people. “This would end all the quarrels that used to take place over the issues of property rights and would end corruption and persecution of Dalits.” He added e-property cards will make more people eligible for bank loans to invest in making their lives better.Modi asked banks to formulate a format for these e-property cards and added citizens, who have procured them, should be facilitated with easy loan processes. He added a geographical drone survey being done under SMVITA has made village maps available to Panchayats.“This should serve as a framework for future course of development of the villages and Gram Panchayats should make full use of these maps.” Modi asked district administrations to launch awareness programmes in villages to educate the rural people on how to use e-property cards. He said the Centre was committed to developing rural India and Panchayats were empowered to look after various central initiatives such as ensuring safe drinking water supplies.Modi said the Centre has diversified the role of Panchayats by involving them in decision-making. He added the government is committed to helping local governments in making rural India better. “For this, the Central government has empowered the Panchayats to spend finances on the development on their own and we are working tirelessly to ensure that Panchayats do not depend on local government offices for the release of these funds,” he said. “We are committed to directly depositing these funds into the accounts of Gram Panchayats.” Modi said for the first time in India’s history, over two lakh crore rupees were directly sent to Panchayats. He said Panchayats should come up to the expectations of the Centre and utilise these funds for quality infrastructure in every village.Modi said the Centre has devised an online system to audit the work of Panchayats to ensure that quality work is done in villages. He asked all Panchayats to connect to this audit system sooner. “There is no doubt that there are challenges in the development of India but with a goal and a timeline, India can and will overcome these challenges.”Modi asked Gram Panchayats to work on making online education available for every village student.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-modi-reiterates-need-for-covid-19-appropriate-behaviour-increased-vaccination-101619259480805.html

'INC TV' is one such channel which will put forth the voice of people," he said.Maken said the media should put the government in the dock and question it, and only then will there be pressure on the dispensation to act in public welfare."The accountability of the government and leaders is a must," he said."Various institutions in the country are under attack from the government and this is not being highlighted in the media," party treasurer Bansal alleged.The idea behind the digital TV is to have dissemination of views and opinions of different sections of the society, especially that of the poor and oppressed classes, the party said.With the help of the platform, the party seeks to convey its message directly to people and raise issues of importance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-panchayati-raj-day-congress-party-launches-new-digital-platform-inc-tv-101619257321193.html

After allocation have you made any effort for the tankers to collect oxygen?“Every state is arranging its own tankers. If you're not having your own tanks then arrange them. You will have to do it. Get in touch with the Central government officers. We are not here to facilitate contact between officers," the Bench said.The Bench was told by the Delhi government, represented by senior advocate Rahul Mehra, that many hospitals that have a long association with oxygen suppliers have been refused supply."Place one instance and we will hang that man. We are not going to spare anyone even if they are senior government officers. We will initiate action under DDMA and other sections against the erring persons. Whatever judicial action is required, we will take that, "the bench said.Also read: 20 patients die at Delhi’s Jaipur Golden hospital due to oxygen shortageBatra Hospital, which has 352 Covid-19 patients admitted at the moment, told the court that they have been allocated 8 tonnes of oxygen but they received only 0.5 tonnes on Friday. “Our oxygen stock will not last for more than 1 hour,” the representatives of the hospital told the court.Mehra said the situation is alarming as the suppliers have obstructed the delivery of oxygen.Pointing out the gaps in the supply of medical oxygen for Delhi's hospitals, Mehra said, "We got 309 metric tonnes yesterday. This is also trickling. Inox's supply has been affected and we have been given Air Linde. IAS and DANICS officers have jumped it and there's a chaotic situation with disorderly functioning. The allocation of 480 should be practically applicable.""We fear we will lose many people. I am not sensationalising this, but this is the truth. I have seen the functioning in the last 12 hours," Mehra said.Senior advocate Sachin Datta who represented Jaipur Golden Hospital said the hospital borrowed 1,500 tonnes of oxygen from All India Institute of Medical Sciences (Aiims) in New Delhi. "We have already lost 25 lives. We are literally gasping for breath. The cases are slipping out of our hand. We are trying to ask every authority but to no avail."Also read: India records 3,46,786 Covid-19 cases, 2,624 deaths in 24 hoursPlea from hospitals come on the day 20 patients suffering from coronavirus disease, most of who were admitted to the critical care unit of Jaipur Golden hospital in Rohini, Delhi, died due to low oxygen pressure as the hospital’s oxygen stock ran dry, hospital officials said.“We lost 20 patients almost all of whom were in critical care unit and on a high flow of oxygen. Our liquid medical oxygen was over by about 10 pm and then we switched over to the oxygen cylinders attached to the main gas pipeline. There was a drop in pressure and the patients could not survive,” said Dr Deep Baluja, medical director of the hospital.This comes a day after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal flagged the severe oxygen crisis faced by the national capital and “catastrophic” events that may follow if Delhi’s demand for liquid medical oxygen is not met. Kejriwal said some state governments are stopping tankers meant for Delhi to meet their requirement.“Will people of Delhi not get oxygen if there is no oxygen-producing plant here? Please suggest whom should I speak to in Central Govt when an oxygen tanker destined for Delhi is stopped in another state?” Kejriwal said during the Covid-review conference with Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/looking-at-big-human-tragedy-3-hospitals-facing-oxygen-shortage-rush-to-delhi-hc-101619247130321.html
24-04-2021||India||'Villages at the heart of Aatmanirbhar Bharat': PM Modi launches distribution of e-property cards under 'SWAMITVA'||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday launched the 'SWAMITVA scheme' aimed at distribution of e-property cards. PM Modi launched the scheme through video conferencing saying that as the country faces the challenge of the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) pandemic, the government is focussed on the welfare of people."The SWAMITVA scheme will help people across the country as corruption has reduced significantly in the villages because of the scheme," PM Modi said."We have to work together to fight this pandemic and ensure that more and more people get vaccinated as government expands the vaccination drive from May 1. We've to ensure that guidelines issued from time to time are followed in villages. We have the security cover of vaccines this time. So, we've to ensure that everyone in villages gets both the doses of vaccine," PM Modi added.According to a statement from the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), as many as 4.09 lakh property owners were given e-property cards, marking the roll out of the SVAMITVA scheme for implementation across the country.Prime Minister also talked about the Centre's scheme to provide 5 kilogram of free food grains which was announced on Friday under the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana.“Under this special scheme (PMGKAY), around 80 Crore NFSA beneficiaries covered under both categories of NFSA, namely Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Householders (PHH), will be provided with an additional quota of free-of-cost foodgrains (Rice/Wheat) at a scale of 5 Kg per person per month, over and above their regular monthly entitlements under NFSA. Government of India will bear all expenditure of over ₹26,000 Crore on account of food subsidy and Central assistance to states/UTs on account of intrastate transportation etc,” a government statement said on Friday.Read more: On Covishield price row, Centre says it will procure vaccines at ₹150 per doseThe launch of the scheme comes as the country observes National Panchayati Raj Day which is observed on April 24 every year. The day, which is celebrated since 2010, commemorates the passing of the Constitution Act (73rd Amendment) which was passed in 1992 and came into effect on April 24,1993.PM Modi said that the day is crucial as it celebrates the importance of panchayats in country. "Panchayats and villages are the most important units of our strong democracy. Villages are part of India's progress and are the most important part of India's self-reliance goal (atmanirbhar bharat)," PM Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/village-at-the-heart-of-atmanirbhar-bharat-pm-modi-launches-swamitva-scheme-101619247690511.html

24-04-2021||India||‘Unless world is vaccinated, variants will grow’: Dr Drew Weissman||Covid-19 will continue to be a problem and “variants will keep getting scarier and scarier” until at least two-thirds of the global population is vaccinated, one of the world’s foremost scientists has said, calling for efforts to minimise the inequity that has left large parts of the world without access to doses.The comments were made by Dr Drew Weissman, professor of medicine at University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman medical school, who, along with his long-time collaborator Dr Katalin Kariko, is credited with the research that underpins the success of mRNA vaccines by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna.“There are two things that have to happen for us to get the pandemic under control and stop the variants from appearing. We have to vaccinate the entire world and countries need to have a high enough percentage of people vaccinated – somewhere between 75-85% in order to reach herd immunity. Until that happens, variants will keep appearing and they are going to keep getting scarier and scarier,” he said in an interview over a video call.Also Read | mRNA vaccines can adapt to variants faster than others: Dr Drew WeissmanThe World Health Organization (WHO) said in a report on Friday that even after nearly a billion doses being given out, coronavirus vaccines remain out of reach in the poorest countries. “Over 81% have gone to high- or upper middle-income countries, while low-income countries have received just 0.3%,” WHO director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a briefing.“The world really needs to get moving on this,” Dr Weissman said, while adding that vaccine hesitancy too needs to be tackled. “What people who are hesitant do not realise is that if they don’t take it, we are never going to reach herd immunity and Covid is going to be a problem for years and years to come,” he said.The Penn professor also said that he expects mRNA vaccines to become cheaper over time and that he and his colleagues at the university were working on making such vaccines more stable at refrigerator temperature so that they can be moved around more easily. “All of those advances I think are going to come over the next few months,” he said.“It (mRNA vaccines) is expensive because it’s brand new. The companies have just figured out how to make 100 million doses a month. Over time, I believe it is going to get less and less expensive.”RNA is genetic material that human cells read to make specific proteins. For decades, scientists attempted to leverage RNA to create therapeutics. RNA allowed scientists to instruct the body to create the proteins they intended to (in the case of Covid-19 vaccines, it is the spike protein the coronavirus uses to latch onto cells).Click here for full Covid-19 coverageBut scientists discovered it was not easy to deliver the RNA, since the immune system recognised and destroyed it before it could enter cells and start issuing instructions. It was this problem Dr Weissman and Dr Kariko, who is also known as Kati by her colleagues, solved and reported in a paper published in August 2005.“We spent a bunch of years studying that inflammatory activity and finally figured out how to get rid of it, which was by modifying a part of the RNA code,” Dr Weissman said, referring to what was scientifically known as a nucleoside modification.“Kati then moved to BioNTech where she developed the LNP technology (liquid nano particles), which is also a crucial part of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines,” Dr Weissman added. LNPs are microscopic bubbles in which the RNA of the vaccine is wrapped, helping evade the body’s natural defences till it achieves what it’s meant to do: teach a cell how to recreate the Sars-Cov-2 spike protein so that the immune system can recognise it and fight off the real virus.The platform is also easy and quick to tweak, which will likely be an important tool to create new vaccines in case the Sars-Cov-2 mutates to become more resistant.“The minute new variants that look concerning appear, you can take the sequence and plug it into an RNA vaccine. It will take you literally weeks to make a new vaccine. That’s because the technology is the same no matter what the sequence. (But) if you have to make an adenovirus or an inactivated virus vaccine, you have to make the virus, grow it, inactivate it -- all that takes a lot of time,” Dr Weissman saidThe scientist said that he and his lab are working on multiple projects to help make vaccines accessible to more parts of the country. “My lab and me personally have had a big issue with equality of vaccine access. Early last spring, we started working with the government of Thailand to build their own RNA vaccines. They are going to be able to make the vaccine in Thailand and supply it to seven surrounding LMIC. I am also working with WHO to do the same thing in Africa so that same access is available,” he said.The professor expects some of these to become available by the end of the year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/unless-world-is-vaccinated-variants-will-grow-dr-drew-weissman-101619244215586.html

Serum CEO Adar Poonawalla reportedly has confirmed that for new contracts, the Centre will also have to pay ₹400 for each dose of Covishield, like state and UT governments. But the Union health ministry on Saturday issued a clarification saying that the Centre will procure both the vaccines at ₹150 only. And those doses will be provided free to the states.Expanding the ongoing vaccination drive, the Centre announced its strategy for a 'liberalised and accelerated phase 3' of vaccination where vaccine makers can sell their vaccines at open market and states and private hospitals can directly buy them from vaccine makers. Till the second phase, vaccine procurement was centralised with the government of India procuring the vaccines and sending them to states. As states have increased per day vaccinations, a shortage of doses was being reported in April from several states.#Unite2FightCoronaIt is clarified that Govt of India’s procurement price for both #COVID19 vaccines remains ₹150 per dose. GOI procured doses will continue to be provided TOTALLY FREE to States.@PMOIndia @drharshvardhan @AshwiniKChoubey @DDNewslive @PIB_India @mygovindia https://t.co/W6SKPAnAXwWhile Bharat Biotech has not yet announced the open market price of Covaxin, Serum Institute said it will provide Covishield to states at ₹400 per dose and to private hospitals at ₹600 per dose. This is a considerable increase from ₹150 in which the Centre procured per dose of vaccines from both SII and Bharat Biotech in the first two phases of the vaccination. Clarifying, Adar Poonawalla said ₹150 was a special price for the Centre for the initial contracts. When the Centre places new orders, it will also have to pay ₹400.Deferential to CentreDifferential to States.1. SII recently said ₹400 is new price for ALL new govt procurements — States & Centre.

Why?@PMOIndia @nsitharaman https://t.co/IyUCswrpRqCongress leader Jairam Ramesh on Saturday raised the issue of pricing and said if for the new orders, the government has to pay ₹400, then it will be paying higher than what the US, UK, EU, Saudi, Bangladesh and the South African government paid.Replying to the Congress leader's tweet, the ministry said the Centre will continue to procure both Covishield and Covaxin at ₹150 per dose. "What is the truth?" Jairam Ramesh replied.Here is all you need to know about the price controversy> Both Covishield and Covaxin are manufactured in India. While Covaxin has also been developed in India, Covishield was developed by Oxford University in collaboration with AstraZeneca. Both the vaccines are presently manufactured in India.> When the vaccination drive began in January, the Centre procured the vaccines from both the vaccine makers at around ₹200 per dose. Vaccines for healthcare workers and frontline workers were free.> As private hospitals were included in the second phase of vaccination and were allowed to charge ₹250 per dose, the government renegotiated the procurement price and brought it down to ₹150. People above the age of 45 years were included in the phase.> Now in the third phase, the Centre allowed states and private hospitals to directly buy vaccines from the manufacturers. The pricing has to be transparent and declared in advance, the Centre said.> Serum Institute's announcement followed Centre's guideline where it also said that its open market price in India is cheaper than that of America, China, Russia.> When a controversy erupted over why states will have to pay ₹400 per dose while the Centre paid ₹150, Adar Poonawalla said ₹150 was a special price and will not be effective even for the Centre for the new orders.> Centre contradicted and said it will continue procuring both Covishield and Covaxin at ₹150.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/on-covishield-price-row-centre-says-centre-will-procure-vaccine-at-rs-150-101619242478101.html

The new policy will see an increase in wholesale liquor license fees, excise duty, permit fees, import duty and brand label fee, said officials.The excise duty on wine and draught beer remains unchanged, but the duty on India made foreign liquor (IMFL) has been increased 20%. The wholesale liquor license fees has been increased 25%.Retail liquor license fee for bars and restaurants remain unchanged at ₹18 lakh. These establishments can also operated until 6 am instead of 3 am with an additional payment of ₹20 lakh.For imported foreign liquor (IFL) license fees has been increased from ₹1 crore to ₹1.5 crore.Read more: Liquor smugglers try to run over excise inspector in MohaliDr Anirudh Sharma, deputy excise and taxation commissioner (DETC) (west), said that they had achieved their collection targets on liquor this year despite the Covid-19 pandemic and registered a growth of 15%. “The new excise policy benefits most licensees. There has been no increase in the liquor license fees for the restaurants, pub and bars as they have already suffered huge losses. We have also removed Covid cess of ₹10 to ₹30 on each bottle,” he said.VK Beniwal, DETC East, said they too had been able to meet their targets. “There has been no increase in the license fees for all star category hotels. Security deposit and annual fee instalment remains the same,” he said.Members of National Restaurants Association of India (NRAI) welcomed the policy.“Restaurants serving liquor under bar, pub, microbrewery categories will have three benefits under the 2021-22 policy. Mandatory license to serve imported foreign liquor has been withdrawn, the renewal of license based on minimum stock purchase for preceding year has been waived and the extension in time. This probably is the longest opening hours for a non-hotel outlet in India”, said Rahul Singh, trustee, NRAI.Read more: Illicit liquor manufacturing racket busted in Amritsar, 1,450-litre ENA seizedWhile the benefits were obvious, Singh said they hoped at a rationalising of the annual license fee of ₹18 lakh, which is one of the highest in the country. “It is not sustainable for restaurants to get liquor license for providing a complete experience to families. It’s skewed towards full fledged bars and pubs,” he said.Microbreweries were hopeful of allowing their excess production to be offset by selling kegs to other outlets, which is permissible across many states.Ishan Grover, a consultant brewer, said that in Haryana, microbreweries have received no relief from the government. “All the microbreweries are shut since the restrictions were announced. We are not benefitted in any ways as the operations start post 8 pm and now we cant continue operations after 6 pm. We are hit and it will take years to recover these losses and our cost of operating is too high so until the situation is back to normal we wont be able to run the business,” he said.The licensee were hoping to see a change in policy for drinking age which is 25 years after Delhi reduced it to 21 years in their new excise policy. The police has not made any changes despite neighbouring national capital announcing the same.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/liquor-prices-to-go-up-in-haryana-in-may-as-new-excise-policy-kicks-in-101619240713123.html

After BSF guards opened fire, they flew back into Pakistani territory, security officials confirmed.“Around 4.30 am on Saturday, two Pakistani drones entered our territory in Arnia sector but the alert BSF immediately opened fire. The drones, probably spy drones, flew back into Pakistani territory,” a senior BSF officer said.“Despite the existence of a ceasefire agreement between Pakistan and India, Pakistan rangers did not stop their nefarious activities against India and carried on with their ill motives on International Border in Jammu. Today alert BSF troops in Arnia Sector foiled drones intrusion bid by Pakistan on International Border. During the early morning hours today, two drones/UAVs were observed entering from Pakistan side and Immediately fired upon by vigilant BSF troops which compelled them to retreat to Pakistan territory,” said an official statement issued by BSF DIG SPS Sandhu. Pakistan rangers have been regularly violating the International Boundary through drone intrusions, trying to drop arms and ammunition in Indian territory but successfully repulsed by BSF troops on border, the statement added.It may be recalled that the BSF shot down a Pak hexa-copter carrying huge cache of arms and ammunition on 20 June 2020 at BOP Pansar in Hiranagar sector of Kathua district.“Saturday’s drone intrusion bid foiled by BSF Jammu troops is indicative of alertness and swift retaliatory action by the BSF on a drone intrusion from Pak side. The BSF intelligence branch was receiving inputs about possible use of drones by Pakistan for ferrying arms and ammunition from Pakistan into Indian side,” said the statement. Accordingly, the troops are on alert and the border domination was exponentially increased, it added. India and Pakistan renewed their mutually brokered truce deal on February 25 this year and since then there has been no firing and shelling by the Pakistani forces along the 744-km-long Line of Control (LoC) and 200-km-long International Border (IB). The thaw between the two countries has given much needed relief to the villagers on either side of the border. As a result, farmers on the Indian side have been able to cultivate crops on their farmlands close to the IB in Jammu region.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pak-drone-enters-indian-territory-in-jammu-flies-back-after-firing-by-bsf-jawans-101619240399468.html

With 3,46,786 people testing positive out of 17,53,569 tests in the last 24 hours, India's total Covid-19 tally reached 1,66,10481 on Saturday. The single-day toll also made a new record as 2,624 people died, taking India's total death tally to almost 1.9 lakh (1,89,544).Around 2.19 lakh people have recovered from the disease in the last 24 hours, taking the recovery rate of the country to 83.92 per cent, the Union health ministry's bulletin showed. The number of active Covid-19 cases in the country is over 25 lakh, which is around 15 per cent of the total cases.Covid-19: Second national wave still risingThe number of cases in India started rising since February. While the rise at that time was limited to only a few states, including Maharashtra, in March and April, the second wave of the pandemic reached most of the states while India's vaccination drive was on. In the past few days, the Covid-19 situation has become precarious, as the staggering rise in the number of daily infections has been coupled with an acute shortage of hospital beds, oxygen, drugs etc.Expressing concern over India's situation, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said people are dying across the world because they are not being vaccinated against Covid-19, they are not being tested and not being treated. "The situation in India is a devastating reminder of what the virus can do," he said.Chairing a meeting of chief ministers of the high-burden covid states, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday assured the Centre's full support to all states and asked the state governments to deal strictly with any kind of hoarding, black-marketing of essential medicines and injections. In a separate meeting with the leading oxygen manufacturers of the country, the Prime Minister stressed the need for good coordination between the government and the oxygen producers.The Covdi-19 situation of the country worsens at a time the country is preparing for the rolling out of the third phase of vaccination from May 1 where people between the age of 18 to 44 years will be considered eligible for inoculation.

This is not a drug meant to treat only Covid-19, Dr Naresh Gupta, director-professor of Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College (MAMC) said, adding that like any other drugs, Remdesivir too has side effects. The video was shared on Twitter by the Centre through its citizen engagement account MyGovIndia."This is not a drug specifically meant for coronavirus. It is a drug against virus and can be used against coronavirus too. In a study published by the World Health Organization, it has been claimed that Remdesivir will have no impact on a patient under ventilation. What may happen is that your stay in the hospital becomes shortened. That too is the finding of only one study," Dr Gupta said.Remdesivir can have dangerous side effects if used in high dosages without consulting. Watch Dr. Naresh Gupta, Senior Medical Consultant, MAMC explain that why it is only meant to be given to patients admitted to hospital. #IndiaFightsCorona @MoHFW_India @PMOIndia @PIB_India pic.twitter.com/OyQPIZVYHuTalking about the side effects of Remdesivir, Dr Gupta said that one may collapse after being administered with Remdesivir. "Its side-effects may be life-threatening. That's it's not recommended to people who are being treated at home. Now we have to weigh whether a particular case requires Remdesivir. In my mind, we are using it more than required."When to use Remdesivir, Tocilizumab? When to do HRCT chest? Govt issues clinical guidance for Covid-19 treatmentCovid-19 patients are panicking and stocking Remdesivir thinking that they may need it later and at that time they may not get it. But this is wrong as stocking Remdesivir when there is no actual need will deprive someone who may actually need it, the MAMC director said.Watch: Oxygen Express train with 30,000 litres of liquid medical oxygen reaches UPIn its latest clinical guidance for Covid-19 treatment, the Centre has specified guidelines on which medication to be used in which phase and said Remdesivir is only for patients who are on supplemental oxygen support in the hospital.The Centre is ramping up the production of Remdesivir and till April 30, all states and Union Territories will be given some interim allocation. From May onwards, India will be producing 74 lakh units of Remdesivir injections, while the present supply is 38.80 lakh units.Calling Remdesivir a 'little contribution in the overall Covid-19 management', Niti Aayog member (health) VK Paul said, "Remdesivir is only for emergency use. It is not under standard therapy. Only doctors should administer this injection in hospitals."AIIMS director Randeep Guleria has also warned against the injudicious use of Remdesivir. "Remdesivir should only be given who are hospitalised, have low oxygen saturation and have infiltrates on the chest X-ray or CT-scan," Dr Gulerial said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/remdesivir-has-side-effects-too-warns-expert-as-demand-rises-in-covid-2nd-wave-101619237387424.html
24-04-2021||India||2 killed, 25 hurt as tree branch falls on Thrissur Pooram artists||Tragedy struck Thrissur Pooram, often called the mother of all temple festivals in Kerala, a thick branch of a banyan tree broke off and fell on a procession of artists claiming 2 lives in the early hours of Saturday, officials said. “It happened in a second. We heard a sound and branch came down heavily. Since we were carrying heavy instruments we could not run also,” said one of the injured, P Parameswaran, a flutist. The deceased have identified as N Rameshan and P Radhakrishnan, both employed with Thiruvambady temple. There were around 60 people at the site when the tragedy struck. District collector S Shanavas said the incident happened around 12.30 am and more than 25 people were injured in the freak mishap. A major tragedy was averted by the timely intervention of authorities after two caparisoned elephants ran amok in the melee but were later brought in control and chained. State cooperation minister A C Moyideen visited the spot and said it was a freak accident. “It was least expected. A big contingent of police and fire personnel were at the site and that really helped to limit the damage,” he said. The injured include percussion instrument artists, policemen and office-bearers of the temple boards. In view of the tragedy, the festival committee has called off the firework event scheduled later in the night. “Some of the fireworks were already filled. Dismantling of them will be more dangerous. So we light them just to destroy them,” said G Ramesh, secretary of Paramekavu temple. He said timely intervention of all averted a big tragedy and stampede. The Pooram was being held after big uncertainty and it was allowed after several rounds of discussion without spectators. The largest cultural pageant of the state, Pooram, was started in the late 18th century by the erstwhile King of Kochi Sakthan Thamburan. Every year, the festival is held at Vadukunathan temple in Thrissur but last year it was not held in view of the pandemic situation. Usually, more than two million devotees take part in the 10-day celebration which culminates with a musical ensemble and grand fireworks. It is also a major tourist attraction of the state but the pandemic took sheen out of the festival last year and this time. On Friday the state reported 28,447 fresh Covid-19 cases with a high test positivity rate of 21.78 per cent.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tragedy-hits-thrissur-pooram-2-dead-after-tree-falls-down-101619237699397.html

24-04-2021||India||Covid-19: Second national wave still rising||As the second wave of the Covid-19 outbreak in India continues to touch new highs in terms of daily cases, the positivity rate – the proportion of cases returning positive for Covid-19 – is still rising in every major state in the country despite testing record levels, according to an HT analysis. This suggests that this wave is yet to peak and that daily cases may continue to grow in most states -- at least in the near future.To analyse the trends of the outbreak, HT analysed data from the past month (between March 23 and April 22) in India’s 20 most populous regions, looking at two factors — positivity rate and daily tests for Covid-19.Positivity rate is a crucial metric as experts say it shows how widespread the virus is in the community, and when coupled with increasing new cases, it indicates that the virus is spreading fast within the community. As a rule of thumb, tracking a region’s positivity rate serves as a good barometer for whether cases are going to increase or decrease in the coming days: a rising positivity rate generally means cases will rise in the immediate future, while a dropping positivity rate tends to precede a drop in new infections.The country, meanwhile, is testing at the highest rate ever – in the week ending April 22, India , on average, tested 1.56 million samples every day, the highest ever. And this number is increasing: on Thursday, for instance, the country set a single-day testing record with 1.74 million samples tested in 24 hours. In fact, in the past month, every state has improved its average rate of testing.That is even more worrying -- a rising positivity rate as tests increase is the worst possible scenario from an epidemiological perspective.Currently, the seven-day average of positivity rate is rising in all of India’s 20 most populous regions. Only three of these regions – Assam (3%), Jammu and Kashmir (4.3%) and Telangana (4.4%) – are currently below the World Health Organization’s recommended threshold of 5%. Meanwhile, only two more – Bihar and Gujarat – are under 10%. Six states and UTs – Chattisgarh, Delhi, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Andhra Pradesh and West Bengal – have exhibited a positivity rate in excess of 20% in the past week.At the national level, the average positivity rate has gone from 4.2% a month ago to 18.4% in the week ending April 22 – a rise of 14.2 percentage points.Delhi saw its positivity rate increase the most in the country in the past month – the number went up 26.7 percentage points, from an average of 1.1% for the week ending March 23 to 27.8% for the week ending April 22 — along with Chhattisgarh (also up 26.7 points, from 3.8% to 30.4%). Chhattisgarh has the highest positivity rate in the country (30.4%) currently, while Delhi is on the second spot (27.8%)Andhra Pradesh is on the third spot, in terms of seeing the biggest change in positivity rate in the past month – its positivity rate has gone up 20.2 percentage points, from 1.1% on March 23 to 21.2% in the past week. It is followed by West Bengal and Madhya Pradesh, both of which have seen the positivity rate soar around 18 percentage points in the past month.At the other end of the spectrum, Assam, Maharashtra and Punjab have seen the least increase in their positivity rates. In Assam, it has gone up from 0.2% a month ago to 3.0%.Maharashtra, India’s worst-hit state by the disease, has seen the second least change in positivity rate – the number went from 21.9% to 25.2%, a rise of 3.3 percentage points. If the state manages to turn this number around , then it may point to a peak to a peak of infections in the state. It is followed by Punjab where the positivity rate went from 7.3% to 11% in the past month.To be sure, Maharashtra remains the biggest hot spot in terms of cases in the country and the state continued to report over 67,000 new cases every day in the past week with a positivity rate of more than five times WHO’s recommended threshold.The rising positivity rate cannot be explained by low testing. Nationally, the seven-day average of daily tests per million residents have risen 53% in the past month – from 766 samples a day per million, to 1,176. The best improvement has been visible in Assam (daily tests up 306%), Jharkhand (up 250%) and Rajasthan (187%). In Maharashtra, daily tests have increased by 113%.Delhi lies on the other end with only an increase of 13% in its daily testing in the past month -- from an average of 3,910 samples tested per million residents a day last month to 4,413 for the week ending April 22. However, in terms of daily tests per million, Delhi remains the best testing state in the list. It is followed by Telangana 3130 tests per million last week, Jammu and Kashmir (2935), Kerala (2905) and Gujarat (2531 tests a day per million residents). West Bengal (484 samples tested per million every day in the last week), Madhya Pradesh (632) and Bihar (834) were the lowest.Experts said both positivity rate rising despite increased testing is an alarming trend. “This shows that the rate of reproduction of cases -- what we call the R-naught -- is going up still, which shows that the virus is extremely infectious right now... And this is why even if you increase your testing the positivity rate is not going down. I don’t think there’s much chance for cases to plateau or come down, at least in the near future,” said Dr Lalit Kant, former head, epidemiology, ICMR.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/2nd-national-wave-still-rising-101619214117702.html
24-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||India’s surging second wave of coronavirus disease infections is unlike anything the world has seen thus far. It is a surge that makes the pace of the US’s brutal third wave seem tortoise-like.Numbers across the first four weeks of April highlight this. April 1: 81,413 cases, 468 deaths. April 8: 131,830 cases, 802 deaths. April 15: 219,913 cases, 1,156 deaths. April 22: 332,394 cases, 2,255 deaths. The number of active cases has soared in this duration, from 0.62 million on April 1 to 0.98 million on April 8 to 1.57 million on April 15 and 2.43 million on April 22.Cases have risen 308% between April 1 and 22; deaths by 382%; and active cases by 292%.It isn’t surprising that this deluge has overwhelmed the health care systems even in most large cities. Even the best systems will likely collapse under the pressure created by the rate of growth of cases (and the consequent rate of growth of those that need hospitalisation). Everything (tests, hospital beds, oxygen, medicines) is in short supply, and health care workers are stretched to breaking point (many are falling ill too, although anecdotal evidence suggests that those who have been fully vaccinated are mostly recovering without hospitalisation).The question everyone is asking is: How long will this last? Surely, India cannot continue to report in excess of 300,000 cases for very long?One number that may provide some clues on this front is the positivity rate.This is the number of people testing positive expressed as a proportion of those tested (the whole thing is expressed as a percentage). The assumption here is that most states are following the Union government’s instruction of making sure at least 70% of their tests are the accurate RT-PCR ones, and also that these tests can identify mutant strains of the Sars-CoV-2 virus that are clearly responsible (at least in part) for the current surge in cases. As tests increase, the positivity rate should come down. In general, any positivity rate in excess of 5% and rising is worrying; anything in excess of 10% and rising is alarming.India’s positivity rate for the week that ended on April 22, was 18% (and also higher than the corresponding number for the previous week, so it is rising). The number indicates that the country is probably not testing enough people, and that the number of cases is only likely to increase.A digression is in order here.The surge requires a change in India’s testing protocol. Rapid Antigen Tests are not accurate, and while this column has argued against their use indiscriminately, it has recommended that they be used “wherever time is a constraint” (Dispatch 159, September 16, 2020). Since RT-PCR tests are backlogged (at every stage, from specimen collection to the actual testing) for days, states should mandate the administration of rapid antigen and RT-PCR tests together. Those that test positive in the rapid test can be isolated or hospitalised depending on their need; those that test negative merely have to be isolated while they wait. The main problem with rapid antigen tests is the high number of false negatives (in contrast, the test is very accurate in identifying cases with high viral loads), so it’s easy to see how this approach can reduce delays in testing, and ensure that at least some of those infected with the virus get the treatment they need earlier than they otherwise would have.But back to the question of how soon things will get better, a reading of positivity rates across some of India’s most populous states suggests this won’t happen for at least a few weeks, may be more.For instance, Uttar Pradesh’s positivity rate for the week ended April 22 was 14.2%, Maharashtra’s, 24.5%, West Bengal’s, 19.4%, Bihar’s, 9.2%, Tamil Nadu’s, 10%, Madhya Pradesh’s, 23.5%, Karnataka’s, 13.6%, Rajasthan’s, 18.3% , Punjab’s, 10.6% and Kerala’s, 17.2%. And all rates are higher than their corresponding ones for the previous week.Sure, states can always resort to managing the numbers instead of the pandemic as some seem to already be doing (the low positivity rate of Gujarat is at odds with reports emerging from the state), but if they continue to report numbers as honestly as they have until now (however honest that may be), we are looking at a situation where cases will continue to grow till well into May.If the current trend continues, India may well be the first country to see 400,000 daily cases, perhaps even 500,000. And even at a 1% case fatality rate, that will translate into 4,000 and 5,000 deaths. This is what governments must prepare for as they seek to manage the second wave (the time to contain it is long past), but if they do the right things now, they can still prevent the third wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101619213867626.html
24-04-2021||India||Govt flags ‘excess’ O2 use at hospitals||The Delhi government on Friday flagged the possible “excess” use of oxygen by some hospitals, as per guidelines prescribed by the government of India, and directed hospitals to urgently carry out an audit in this regard.The government, in an order issued on Friday, also said that it will maintain a buffer stock of oxygen cylinders and liquid medical oxygen (LMO) for use in “extreme critical situations”.The directions came amid a severe shortage of oxygen in city hospitals which have been left overwhelmed by a surge in Covid-19 cases.Government officials said that the Capital managed to get only 178 metric tonnes of oxygen on Wednesday, against an allocated quota of 375 MT, and 350 MT on Thursday against an increased allocation of 480 MT.This, even as the demand for oxygen has shot up to 700 MT per day. The data for Friday is yet to be summarised, said officials.“It is also observed that some hospitals are using oxygen in excess of the guidelines prescribed by the government of India (10lt/min for non-ICU and 24lt/min for ICU patients). Hospitals are required to carry out an audit urgently and identify cause of excess use and [draft] a strategy to reduce oxygen usage to prescribed level. The strategy should be implemented in the shortest possible time. Special emphasis should be on reducing the number of high oxygen usage systems, such as HFNCs,” said the order, a copy of which Hindustan Times has seen.It further said, “Government will maintain a buffer of oxygen cylinders and LMO for use in extremely critical situations. Hospitals are requested to maintain their supply through normal channels, through assigned vendors. Request for allocation from buffer stock should be made only in critical situations when the supply of oxygen is alarmingly low – three hours or less.”Senior government officials said that they are yet to draft a full list of daily allocations for all Covid-19 hospitals in the city.In the order, the government directed hospitals to appoint officers in charge to update the oxygen stock in real-time and act as the contact point for emergencies.They were also asked to maintain detailed logs of stocks of both oxygen cylinders and liquid medical oxygen, consumption and deliveries, and submit it to the health department on a daily basis.The government told hospitals that they will be assigned a daily quota of oxygen, which will be reviewed periodically, and directed suppliers, vendors and refill agencies to submit daily reports to the health department.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) on Thursday issued an order elaborating an action plan, which included strict demand-based supply of oxygen to all health care facilities, seamless transportation of tankers till the Capital’s borders, a 24x7 control room to resolve emergency calls from hospitals within 30 minutes, and constituting oxygen audit committees in all hospitals.The DDMA’s Thursday order also said that the Delhi government will have to issue a daily schedule specifying the oxygen allocation to every health care facility in the city, adding that the allocation and supply of oxygen within the city will be “strictly regulated” and shall “supersede any existing contractual arrangements” entered into by any health facility with any supplier until further orders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-flags-excess-o2-use-at-hospitals-101619211906794.html

Further searches are being conducted in Punjab, Haryana and Delhi by crime branch teams to nab other members of the two gangs and make more recoveries, police said.“They were selling remdesivir injections for ₹25,000 to ₹40,000 per vial. The key players are still absconding,” said DCP (crime) Monika Bhardwaj.Crime branch teams used dummy customers to strike deals with the racketeers and catch them red-handed.One such customer contacted a person who assured delivery of one vial of remdesivir injection for ₹25,000 at Parmanand Chowk near GTB Nagar in north Delhi.On April 21, the team caught Talwinder Singh alias Sajan, belonging to Amritsar in Punjab, and recovered from him three vials of remdesivir. Police said his gang was supplying injections across India using a courier company in Chandni Chowk.Police searched the company’s office and arrested Jitendra Kumar, who charged ₹2,000 as commission for delivering each remdesivir injection. Their questioning led to the recovery of 68 more vials.“Even when in our custody, Singh received a request from a person who was ready to pay ₹50 lakh as several members of his family were Covid positive,” said a senior police officer.In the second operation, another team arrested Shoaib and Mohan with 10 vials of remdesivir injection from outside Batra hospital in south Delhi.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/4-held-for-illegally-selling-covid-drug-101619211476751.html
24-04-2021||India||Key farm leader says there’s no Covid-19 pandemic, refuses to call off stir||Hundreds of farmers protesting three agricultural laws at five sites on Delhi’s borders said they would not call off or draw down their agitation despite record Covid-19 infections paralyzing the country’s health system. On Friday, farm union leaders summoned more peasants to join their movement. Gurnam Singh Chaduni, a key farm leader, on Friday told HT he did not believe that the country was facing a pandemic. “In any disease, there are naturally at least 2% deaths, as with coronavirus. Does that mean these are pandemics? The tragedy is that the government did not prepare with adequate oxygen and beds,” Chaduni said. Public-health experts have partly blamed large political rallies following state elections and religious gatherings for surging Covid-19 numbers. If coronavirus infections break out at the farmers’ protests since last November, it could risk hundreds of lives, they said. Chaduni also said the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), the parent body of the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party, should intervene to resolve the logjam. “The Prime Minister is selling off the country. That is surely not the RSS’ agenda. So I think, it’s time now that the RSS should intervene in our demand for withdrawal of the farm laws,” said Chaduni. Farmer unions, especially from Haryana and Punjab, are demanding the rollback of three laws passed in September last year to lift restrictions on trade of farm produce to allow more private investments. Farmers say these changes will leave them at the mercy of large corporations and supermarkets. Farmers in large numbers are currently at five sites near Delhi’s borders: Singhu, Ghaziabad, Tikri, Dhansa and Shahjahanpur (on the Rajasthan-Haryana border). The Haryana government had criticsed the farmers, alleging that their occupation of key spots along road networks had hampered the movement of critical medical equipment and patients. The Samyukt Kisan Morcha (SKM), the platform of farmers leading the protests, has called for increasing the protests despite surging Covid-19 infections around the country. The SKM leaders met with Haryana government officials on Thursday and one side of the highway at Singhu Border will see removal of barricades. “Passage has been made for movement of emergency services,” the SKM said in a statement. “Farmers are preparing to come back to protest sites in large numbers. A large convoy of protestors in tractor trolleys will be leaving from Barwasni in Sonepat district of Haryana for Singhu Border. These farmers are associated with Kisan Mazdoor Sangharsh Samiti. It is expected that there will also be many women farmers in this convoy,” Darshan Pal, a leader of the SKM, said. Public intellectual Gopalkrishna Gandhi has appealed to the farmers to call off their agitation. In an open letter authored by him and published in HT on Friday, he stated: “This is not the time to converge in hundreds around a city where the virus is dancing the dance of death-by-crowding. I am not asking you to stop it or end the agitation. Only to dismantle its present form and keep it dismantled until the virus is completely under control.” “It is a well-known fact that large crowds are a source of risk for the spread of Covid-19 infections,” said Sushil Sharma, a surgeon with Noida’s Kailash hospital.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/key-farm-leader-says-there-s-no-covid-19-pandemic-refuses-to-call-off-stir-101619209258039.html
24-04-2021||India||Kerala CM Pinarayi Vijayan urges PM Modi to make Covid-19 vaccines free||With Kerala reporting another sharp spike of 28,447 Covid-19 cases, the highest since the outbreak began last year, Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan on Monday asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to tweak the proposed vaccine policy and ensure free doses to the overburdened state.Talking to the media in the state capital the CM said in the virtual meeting chaired by the PM he appraised him about the shortage of vaccines and told him that the new policy will put extra burden on the state which is already reeling under the impact of the pandemic. He expressed hope that the Union government would take a proactive decision on this soon.“In India major vaccines were distributed free of cost. When the country is going through a difficult situation it is not proper to impose a fee on vaccines. Three-level price mechanism is really intriguing. Hope the PM will realise this and will do a rethink,” the CM said adding most of the states expressed similar views in the meeting. He said the state needs ₹1300 crore to meet the vaccine bill if the Centre insists on charges for the vaccines.Vijayan said the state can’t wait interminably for doses and it will chalk out a plan to buy directly from the market. “For herd immunity vaccination is important. We want to carry it out as quickly as possible to contain the surge. In the state only 11 per cent people were exposed to the virus so we have to act fast,” the CM said adding despite mounting cases the state has maintained the lowest case fatality rate, 0.39 per cent in the country.The CM lauded people for contributing to the CM’s relief fund to foot expenses of the vaccine. “It is really heart-warming. On Friday also we received more than ₹one crore towards this. This shows the spirit of the people. We will make a separate fund for this and use it only for vaccines,” he said.He said the second wave in Kerala was critical and the government will do everything possible to save lives. “It is more than what we expected. There is no short cut but people will have to go by the restrictions. If we work in unison we can overcome this like last year,” he said adding the weekend restrictions will be on the lines of lockdown. The government has also called an all-party meet on Monday. He said a decision on further restrictions will be taken after the all-party meet.The state has hit another high reporting 28,477 cases on Friday with a test positivity rate of 21.78 per cent. With 27 fatalities, the death toll went up to 5055. Ernakulam district topped the list with 4548 cases. The active caseload also went up to 1,78,983. The first coronavirus case was reported in the country in Kerala in January 2020, when a medical student in China returned to Thrissur.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kerala-cm-pinarayi-vijayan-urges-pm-modi-to-make-covid-19-vaccines-free-101619208597664.html
24-04-2021||India||Bengal: Phase 7 campaigning over, Modi ends it with a virtual address||Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday ended his campaign for the eight-phase Bengal assembly polls with a virtual address that spoke about the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) agenda and promises to the state, with no mention of either chief minister Mamata Banerjee or her party, the Trinamool Congress (TMC).Modi was supposed to address four rallies in the state, including one in the heart of Kolkata, but cancelled them to address high-level meetings on Covid-19 in Delhi. Later, the Election Commission (EC) imposed a ban on roadshows and big rallies and limited the number of people attending political meetings to 500 in view of the sharp spike in coronavirus infections.In all, Modi addressed more than two dozen rallies rallies in the state .Bengal reported 12,876 infections asnd 59 deaths on Friday.Urging people to cast votes in large numbers in the last two phases to be held on April 26 and 29, the PM, in his 32-minute long speech, said, “After four decades, people of Bengal are striving to establish a government of their choice.”The PM focused on the BJP’s electoral promises made to the poor, youth, farmers, middle-class and women. In sharp contrast to the attacks he earlier made on TMC, Banerjee and her nephew Abhishek Banerjee, Modi made only a couple of general remarks in reference to governance and law and order situation in the state. “Infiltration, extortion et al are enemies of development…. We will give a government which will be free of corruption. Bengal yearns for peace, security and development,” he said.Hours before addressing his virtual rally, Modi announced in a tweet that if the BJP comes to power, all people in Bengal would get free vaccine. He also announced after his meeting with the chief ministers that the Centre would provide free ration in May and June.TMC leaders said Modi was following Banerjee’s policies as she was the first to make these announcements. “Banerjee announced last year that the Bengal government would continue to give free ration to people till June. She repeatedly wrote to Modi to let the state buy vaccines so that people can get these free from May,” said Bengal’s deputy parliamentary affairs minister, Tapas Roy.Bengal BJP’s chief spokesperson Samik Bhattacharya confirmed that Modi will not address Bengal voters anymore. “This was his last speech. We are planning something for Union home minister Amit Shah. Otherwise, the campaign will be limited mostly to street-corner meetings,” said Bhattacharya.“Modi seems to have given up,” quipped TMC Lok Sabha member, Saugata Roy .Campaigning for 34 assembly seats that are scheduled to go to the polls on April 26 in the seventh phase of election ended on Friday, .A total of 8,678,221 voters -- 4,444,634 men, 4,233,358 women and 229 transpersons -- will exercise their franchise in the 34 constituencies spread across Malda (Part I), Kolkata Dakshin, Murshidabad (Part I), Paschim Bardhaman (Part 1) and Dakshin Dinajpur districts.Polling will be held between 7 am to 6.30 pm as in other phases at 12,068 polling stations in nine assembly constituencies each in Murshidabad and Paschim Bardhaman districts, six each in Dakshin Dinajpur and Malda districts four in Kolkata Dakshin.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bengal-phase-7-campaigning-over-modi-ends-it-with-a-virtual-address-101619204036865.html
24-04-2021||India||Centre resumes free food for poor scheme||The Union government on Friday resumed the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Ann Yojana, a programme to distribute free foodgrain to the poor as a food assistance due to disruptions caused by India’s surging Covid second wave.Over 800 million beneficiaries under the National Food Security Act will get an additional 5kg of wheat or rice and 1kg of gram free during May and June 2021, under the scheme which was launched first in April 2020 during the national lockdown.“Under this special scheme (PMGKAY), around 80 Crore NFSA beneficiaries covered under both categories of NFSA, namely Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and Priority Householders (PHH), will be provided with an additional quota of free-of-cost foodgrains (Rice/Wheat) at a scale of 5 Kg per person per month, over and above their regular monthly entitlements,” an official statement said.“The country has plentiful stocks of foodgrains to meet demand,” a food ministry official said.According to official data, the Food Corporation of India currently has 77 million tonne of foodgrains, 3.6 times more than the required emergency reserve for this time of the year.Nearly 810 million qualify for subsidised foodgrains under the food security law, under which beneficiaries get 5kg of wheat or rice covers per person per month. The Act applies to 67% of the population (75% in rural areas and 50% in urban pockets).The Centre will “bear full expenditure” of over ₹26,000 crore for the additional foodgrain allocation to the beneficiaries as part of central assistance to States, an official said.Record Covid-19 infections and a crippled health care system have left several migrant workers jobless, and hit the income of the poor due to lockdown-like restrictions in several states as authorities battle the pandemic.In 2020, when India imposed a strict four-month lockdown to deal with pandemic, a migrant crisis had gripped the country. Thousands of jobless migrants fled cities and faced hunger.According to reports, migrants have begun moving out of cities such as Mumbai and Delhi as a second wave of Covid infections rages.An official said migrants should not panic and they can withdraw subsidised ration from any state under the ‘One nation, one ration card’ programme. While the programme is operational in 32 states, Delhi is not one of them.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/centre-resumes-free-food-for-poor-scheme-101619203916675.html

Some news outlets, including HT, initially ran web stories, quoting the Congress member of Parliament’s tweet.Minutes after his tweet, several Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leaders and Mahajan’s family refuted Tharoor’s information and said the 78-year-old leader was healthy and fine. They also pointed out that Tharoor had no official source of information, and hadn’t verified the facts before tweeting, leaving the Congress leader with no option but to delete his tweet and apologise.BJP general secretary Kailash Vijayvargiya replied to Tharoor, saying Mahajan,78, was healthy and wishing her a long life. Other leaders also said that Mahajan was admitted to Bombay hospital in Indore for mild fever and was doing fine. She had also tested negative for Covid-19.Responding to Vijayvargiya, Tharoor thanked him and tweeted, “I have deleted the tweet. I wonder what motivates people to invent and spread such evil news that takes in people. My best wishes for Sumitra ji’s health and long life.”Her younger son, Mandar Mahajan, put out a video message as well. “My mother is perfectly healthy. The rumours about her demise are absolutely false,” he said.On Friday morning, news agency ANI spoke to Mahajan. “How could news channels run a report on my so called demise without even cross checking with the Indore administration? My niece refuted Mr. Tharoor on Twitter but what was the urgency in announcing without confirmation?” she said.Hours later, Tharoor said that he apologised to Mahajan’s son. “Spoke to Sumitra Mahajan ji’s son to convey my sincere apologies at last night’s misinformation. He was most gracious & understanding. Delighted to hear she is very much better,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/tharoor-apologises-to-family-after-twitter-gaffe-on-mahajan-s-health-101619203856625.html
24-04-2021||India||France, Australia, EU extend help amid crisis||France, Australia and the European Union (EU) on Friday offered support and solidarity to India as it grappled with a massive surge in coronavirus infections that has stretched medical facilities across the country and resulted in shortages of oxygen and medicines.French ambassador Emmanuel Lenain tweeted a message from President Emmanuel Macron about providing support for India’s Covid-19 response, while cooperation on pandemic-related issues figured in a virtual meeting between external affairs minister S Jaishankar and European Commission executive vice-president Margrethe Vestager.“I want to send a message of solidarity to the Indian people, facing a resurgence of Covid-19 cases. France is with you in this struggle, which spares no-one. We stand ready to provide our support,” Macron was quoted as saying by the French envoy.Though the meeting between Jaishankar and Vestager largely focused on preparations for the virtual India-EU Summit next month, the two leaders also discussed India’s Covid-19 response. “Appreciated the support offered by EU on Covid challenges currently faced by India. Confident that EU will help strengthen our capabilities at this critical juncture,” Jaishankar tweeted after the meeting.European Council President Charles Michel too said in a tweet that the EU “stands in solidarity with Indian people amidst [the] resurgent #COVID19 pandemic”. He added the fight against the virus is a “common fight” and said the EU would discuss its support and cooperation at the India-EU Summit on May 8.Australian foreign minister Marise Payne extended solidarity to India “as it tackles this latest COVID-19 outbreak” and said in a tweet: “India’s generosity and leadership in providing vaccines to our region is appreciated. We will continue to work together closely to respond to this global crisis.”Meanwhile, China on Friday said it was holding talks with India on sending assistance to New Delhi to fight the surge in Coronavirus cases, a day after offering to help with support.“Based on the needs [of the] Indian side, we stand ready to offer support and assistance. We are now holding communications with the Indian side,” foreign ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian told a briefing in Beijing. He didn’t give details of the assistance China intended to provide.India on Friday recorded the world’s highest daily tally of coronavirus cases for the second day in a row, with daily deaths too recording a jump. With 332,730 new cases, India’s total caseload crossed 16 million, and the official death toll rose by 2,263 to touch 186,920, according to health ministry data.As the cases surged, Canada announced it would temporarily bar passenger flights from India and Pakistan for 30 days as part of stricter measures to combat the spread of the coronavirus.The government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau acted after prominent opposition politicians complained Ottawa hasn’t done enough to combat a third wave of infections in Canada. The ban will not affect cargo flights.Canada’s health minister Patty Hajdu said while Indian citizens accounted for 20% of all international arrivals, they represented more than 50% of positive tests conducted by Canadian authorities. “By eliminating direct travel from these countries, public health experts will have the time to evaluate the ongoing epidemiology of that region and to reassess the situation,” she said.France imposed a 10-day quarantine requirement for travellers from India, Brazil, Chile, Argentina and South Africa, while Indonesia on Friday announced a ban on all travellers from India that will come into force on April 25.“The government has decided to stop granting visas to foreign nationals who live in or have visited India in the past 14 days,” economic affairs minister Airlangga Hartarto, who heads Indonesia’s Covid-19 handling and economic recovery committee, told a news conference.Australia, Canada, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Oman, the US, Britain and New Zealand have imposed travel restrictions on India or issued advisories against travelling to India.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/france-australia-eu-extend-help-amid-crisis-101619203136680.html
24-04-2021||India||People are dying for oxygen: SC to TN Govt on reopening of Vedanta plant||People are dying for want of oxygen, said the Supreme Court on Friday, questioning the Tamil Nadu government for opposing the reopening of Vedanta’s Sterlite copper unit at Thoothukudi only to produce medical oxygen.The bench, led by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde, took a dim view of the state government’s submission that letting the plant function will create law and order problems.“When people are dying, can a state say we will still not run it because there could be law and order problems or that Vedanta did this and that? People are dying for want of oxygen. Somebody has to take the responsibility,” observed the bench, which also included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat.“Just because they (state government) have a problem with Vedanta, they will let people die. What is this? We have never heard this kind of an argument by a state before,” lamented the bench, as it sought a categorical answer from the state government by Monday on whether it would let Vedanta operate or if the state was willing to take over the plant to produce the oxygen on its own.The plant was shut down in May 2018 after 13 civilians were shot dead in the anti-Sterlite protests in Thoothukudi. The Madras high court in August 2020 rejected Vedanta’s petition to reopen the plant, citing environmental concerns. The SC has also rejected requests to reopen the plant for a trial run.However, a fresh plea by Vedanta, argued by senior advocate Harish Salve, urged the court to let it make only the oxygen plant in Thoothukudi functional so that it could provide free of cost thousands of tonnes of oxygen for medical purposes to combat the shortage of oxygen.The central government, through solicitor general Tushar Mehta, has also supported Vedanta’s application citing the dire need for medical oxygen due to the surge in infections during the second Covid-19 wave.But representing the state government, senior advocate CS Vaidyanathan resisted the plea, submitting there was a total lack of confidence among local people after the shooting incident and any attempt to reopen the plant will impact the law and order in the area.Senior advocate Colin Gonsalves, appearing for the organisation of affected families, also submitted that people have a lot of anger against the plant while adding that Tamil Nadu had surplus oxygen and hence, there was no need to reopen the plant.However, the CJI was unimpressed with the grounds of opposition: “It is not just about Tamil Nadu. The whole country needs it. With respect to everyone’s sentiments, this may not be right to say because we are in surplus we don’t want to produce more.”The bench further reminded the Tamil Nadu government of the constitutional provisions on the directive principles of state policy. “The material resources should be distributed equitably. I am sure the Tamil Nadu government also understands this. We are not on who will produce. Let Tamil Nadu government produce it if they have a problem with Vedanta.”On being asked if the state government was willing to operate the plant, Vaidyanathan said even the Centre could take over the plant but he would need some time to obtain instructions regarding this.The bench then told Vaidyanthan that the state could not allow people to die just because it had a problem with Vedanta. Vaidyanthan said he would file a proper affidavit in this regard by Monday.On Thursday, Salve had made a request on behalf of Vedanta for reopening the Sterlite Copper plant to produce and supply oxygen for Covid-19 patients. He argued, “People are dying everyday. We want this permission only for starting the oxygen plant. And we will supply it free of cost. Give us the permission today and we can start producing it in 5-6 days.”The S-G too cited the dire need for medical oxygen, saying, “Let Vedanta operate its plant only for the purpose of producing oxygen and this will be diverted only for medical purposes. Sooner the plant starts functioning, better for the country.”Mehta had said between protecting human life and the environment, they must lean toward protecting human lives.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/people-are-dying-for-oxygen-sc-to-tn-govt-on-reopening-of-vedanta-plant-101619203076600.html
24-04-2021||India||US, India issue joint statement on Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030||Through the US India Climate and Clean Energy Agenda 2030 partnership, the US and India aim to demonstrate how the world can align swift climate action with economic development, taking into account national circumstances and sustainable development priorities, a US-India joint statement released on Thursday night.Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday announced the launch of the joint climate and clean energy initiative to “mobilise investments, demonstrate clean technologies and enable green collaborations” in India that could also “create templates of sustainable development” for other developing countries.The statement said the partnership will proceed along two main tracks—the strategic clean energy partnership co-chaired by Secretary of Energy Granholm, and the Climate Action and Finance Mobilization Dialogue, co-chaired by Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry.“Both the United States and India have set ambitious 2030 targets for climate action and clean energy. In its new nationally determined contribution (NDC), the US has set an economy-wide target of reducing its net greenhouse gas emissions by 50–52% below 2005 levels in 2030. As part of its climate mitigation efforts, India has set a target of installing 450 GW of renewable energy by 2030.”Through the partnership, the US and India are firmly committed to working together in achieving their ambitious climate and clean energy targets and to strengthening bilateral collaboration across climate and clean energy.“The partnership will aim to mobilize finance and speed clean energy deployment; demonstrate and scale innovative clean technologies needed to decarbonize sectors including industry, transportation, power, buildings; and build capacity to measure, manage, and adapt to the risks of climate-related impacts,” the statement added.HT had reported on March 29 that Petroleum minister, Dharmendra Pradhan and Granholm agreed to prioritise greater collaboration in the clean energy sector, such as biofuels, carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS), hydrogen production and carbon sequestration, through technology exchange, joint research and development (R&D) through Partnership to Advance Clean Energy Research (PACE-R) as part of the strategic partnership.Independent experts welcomed the US’s upgraded NDC. “The new NDC target that the US submitted aims to reduce its GHG emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels. Since the US’ emissions grew between 1990 and 2005, this new target roughly amounts to a 43-45% reduction below its 1990 emissions or its 2020 emissions. This is a step in the right direction, particularly when combined with its commitment to net-zero GHG emissions by 2050. Unlike the UK and EU, however, the US’ pledge is not yet enshrined in law. But it has the potential to spur technological innovation,” said Ulka Kelkar, director, climate programme, World Resources Institute.The US on Thursday also released its international climate finance plan. “The US intends to double, by 2024, our annual public climate finance to developing countries relative to the average level during the second half of the Obama-Biden Administration (FY 2013-2016). As part of this goal, the United States intends to triple our adaptation finance by 2024. The Biden Administration will work closely with Congress to meet these goals,” the plan said. Several experts said the USA’s climate finance plan is not ambitious enough. World Resources Institute’s Joe Thwaites, an expert in climate finance said in a tweet: “The climate finance plan the Biden administration launched today starts to play catch up after the US was largely absent for the last four years…In this time many other developed countries already doubled their climate finance, and some committed to doubling again before 2025. In this light Biden’s commitment to doubling its public climate finance by 2024 compared to the 2013-16 baseline is not particularly ambitious.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/us-india-issue-joint-statement-on-climate-and-clean-energy-agenda-2030-101619202957105.html
24-04-2021||India||Amid shortage, PM Modi holds virtual meet with oxygen producers, industrialists||New Delhi At a meeting with oxygen producers and industrialists Mukesh Ambani, Sajjan Jindal and Naveen Jindal, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Friday highlighted the need to increase the availability of cylinders and upgrade logistics for transporting them easily.The Prime Minister’s meeting came amidst a crippling shortage of oxygen, a critical medical intervention against Covid-19, which causes respiratory distress in some cases. The vitual meeting was also attended by chairperson of the Steel Authority of India Limited (SAIL) Soma Mandal, TV Narendran of Tata Steel and other oxygen manufacturers. “It was a very good meeting. Everyone gave good suggestions,’’ said Naveen Jindal, when contacted by HT. “Everyone assured the Prime Minister that they would work to tackle the shortage, that everyone would make an all-out effort to tide over the crisis.’’Jindal said that there were concerns about some states blocking the free transport of oxygen tankers from one state to another. The Prime Minister, he said, assured everyone that no one will be stopped. To increase the availability of oxygen, the PM also suggested that tankers used to carry argon and nitrogen should be converted and used to carry oxygen too. “Some of us said that we will be importing some tankers too. Everyone assured him that they would do their best to ensure that no lives are lost for want of oxygen,’’ Jindal said.The producers also discussed the need for rational use of oxygen so that there was no wastage. Modi apprised the attendees of how the government had pressed the railways and the air force into service to help in transporting oxygen to several states.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/amid-shortage-pm-modi-holds-virtual-meet-with-oxygen-producers-industrialists-101619202956604.html
24-04-2021||India||Shah urges states to provide security for oxygen transport||The ministry of home affairs (MHA) on Friday asked all states and Union territories to provide adequate security to oxygen transporting vehicles and to make provisions for exclusive corridors for such transportation, treating these vehicles like ambulances.At a review meeting chaired by home minister Amit Shah, he directed an expert group to optimise and rationalise the allocation of oxygen to various states and UTs, keeping in view the active cases and to reduce time for movement of medical oxygen.“In view of the sharp rise in Covid-19 cases and resultant increasing demand of medical oxygen across the country, Union Home Minister, Shri Amit Shah has reviewed the situation and directed various measures to augment the supply of oxygen for medical purposes. Accordingly, an Expert Group is optimising and rationalising the allocation of oxygen to various States and UTs, keeping in view the active cases and to reduce time for movement of medical oxygen,” said a statement by MHA.The ministry has further written to states/UTs, to direct district collectors/ deputy commissioners to list all the plants situated in their district, in which different types of oxygen is generated, along with the installed capacity, the statement added.“They should also take action to revive those plants, which are lying closed. These efforts will ensure ready availability of oxygen at the district level, besides supply of medical oxygen from usual channels,” the ministry said.Earlier, the ministry on Thursday directed states to make sure there was no hindrance in the supply of oxygen transporting vehicles, while invoking the Disaster Management Act, 2005. Within hours, the Delhi high court directed to ensure adequate security to the trucks transporting oxygen and their non-obstruction on the way as well as creation of a special corridor for immediate transportation.In his letter to states/UTs on Friday, Union home secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla pointed out that the Delhi high court “has further directed that non-compliance of its order will invite action for contempt of court and also invite criminal and penal action under DM Act and under the Indian Penal Code (IPC)”.Meanwhile, the Indian Air Force has already started transporting empty tankers after delivery of oxygen to destination state/UT to oxygen producing locations to reduce movement time.The MHA is coordinating lifting of high capacity tankers from abroad, such as Singapore and UAE by Indian Air Force (IAF) transport planes. Further, Ministry of Railways is running special trains carrying oxygen tankers across the country for faster movement.MHA and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare are in regular touch with the States and UTs for promoting optimal use of medical oxygen and undertake periodic audits to ensure there is no wastage of medical oxygen and essential medicines, the statement added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/shah-urges-states-to-provide-security-for-oxygen-transport-101619202896633.html
24-04-2021||India||15 Covid patients die in Virar hospital fire||Fifteen Covid patients were charred to death after a fire broke out on the second floor of a four-storey private hospital, Vijay Vallabh Covid Care Hospital, in Virar in the early hours of Friday, officials said.The wife of one of the patients, Chandni Doshi, 40, died of shock minutes after hearing that her husband Kumar Kishore Doshi, 45, was killed in the blaze. She was being treated for Covid at another hospital, Jeevdani, in the vicinity. They have a 14-year-old daughter.A short-circuit may have been behind the fire, which broke out around 3.15am, according to preliminary findings by the the Vasai-Virar fire brigade.“There were 17 patients in the ICU, of whom 14 have been confirmed dead,” said Dilip Palav, chief fire officer, Vasai-Virar civic fire brigade. “Around 10 tenders were pressed into service, and the fire was controlled within 10 minutes,” he added.Eyewitnesses said the fire spread quickly. “I had come to the hospital to admit my friend’s mother. I saw the ward completely in smoke, and later the charred bodies,” said Avinash Patil.Tempers ran high in the area after the incident, with relatives of the victims expressing their anguish against the government and the hospital administration.Dr Dilip Shah, CEO of the hospital, said he was mobbed by agitated relatives who blamed the hospital for the tragedy. “There were 90 patients in the hospital at the time of the incident. We are cooperating with the police, who are checking documents of fire and structural audits and also the occupation certificate of the hospital,” he said.Some people also surrounded ministers Eknath Shinde and Dadaji Bhuse, who visited the spot. A few alleged that the central air-conditioning unit was faulty, and that the management was aware of it. The relatives also beseeched Palghar collector Dr Manik Gursal and Vasai-Virar municipal commissioner Gangatharan Devrajan, who assured them that the guilty would be punished after an inquiry was conducted. Some of the relatives also said that were told about the deaths hours later. “My sister, Shama Arun Mahale, 48, was admitted in the ICU. I was informed about her death only at 7.30am,” said Dr Ravi Tandel, her brother.Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray ordered an inquiry into the incident, and compensation of ₹5 lakh each to the family members of the victim, and ₹1 lakh each to other seriously injured patients. “The cause of the fire should be properly investigated. The administration has been instructed to immediately inquire whether the fire safety was adequate and whether it was a private hospital,” a statement from the chief minister’s office (CMO) said.“Orders have been given to the administration to undertake a thorough inquiry and those found responsible will not be spared. The government has already announced a financial assistance of ₹5 lakh each to the families of those who lost their lives,” said Eknath Shinde, state urban development minister and Shiv Sena leader.Sanjay Patil, deputy commissioner of police, Zone 2, Mira-Bhayander Vasai-Virar commissionerate, said and an FIR (first information report) was registered against the hospital management, doctors, and staff, under sections 304 (culpable homicide not amounting to murder), 337 and 338 (whoever causes hurt to any person by doing any act so rashly or negligently as to endanger human life) of the Indian Penal Code.“No arrests have been made so far. The bodies have been sent for post-mortem examination,” he said.Leader of Opposition and Bharatiya Janata Party leader Devendra Fadnavis said, “This has been the fifth such case related to hospitals in the past six months. We have witnessed tragic incidents at hospitals in Bhandara, Nagpur, Nashik, Bhandup and now at Virar. After every incident, chief minister Uddhav Thackeray says that a fire safety audit would be conducted, but nothing comes out of it. Covid-19 hospitals are currently under tremendous pressure and in such a backdrop, the state should set up a mechanism for fire safety.” Friday’s fire comes two days after 24 Covid patients died after a leak in an oxygen tank in Nashik led to disruption in the supply of oxygen. Nine Covid-19 patients, mostly senior citizens, were killed on March 27, after a massive fire broke out at Sunrise Hospital, located inside the Dreams Mall in Bhandup. Six of the dead were on ventilators.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/15-covid-patients-die-in-virar-hospital-fire-101619202837463.html

Hiran is linked to the explosives-laden Scorpio found abandoned near billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s south Mumbai residence Antilia on February 25, an incident that ballooned into a huge political controversy, eventually resulting in the exit of the state’s home minister.An NIA officer who asked not to be named said the agency summoned Mane for interrogation in connection with the Antilia and murder cases on Thursday and placed him under arrest on Friday.He was produced before special judge Rahul R Bhosle. Advocate Prakash Shetty, appearing for NIA said the federal agency requested Mane’s custody to recover his phone and other personal devices and also to obtain his call data records. The agency claimed Mane was a part of the conspiracy to kill Hiran and had confessed to his role in the murder.Mane’s counsel advocate Aditya Gore opposed the remand, claiming that his client was not involved in the murder and that the agency has no evidence against him, except his purpoted confession.The special court accepted Shetty’s contention and remanded Mane to NIA custody.The court also extended the judicial custody of two other accused, suspended police officer Sachin Vaze and his colleague at crime branch’s criminal intelligence unit (CIU) Riyazuddin Kazi, till May 5.Mane was in charge of unit 11 of the crime branch till recently. He was transferred as a part of the clean-up drive undertaken by police commissioner Hemant Nagrale, after Vaze was arrested by NIA in the cases and posted at the local arms branch.Vaze was originally in charge of the investigation of the explosives case, but removed after reports emerged of his links with Hiran, who was in possession of the SUV, and reported it stolen on February 17, 2021. Hiran himself was found dead in a creek on March 5. It subsequently emerged that Vaze had borrowed the car in November and returned it in early February.NIA took over the explosives case on March 8 and the murder case on March 24. Vaze was named the main accused in both.To contain the damage, the Maharashtra government transferred police commissioner Param Bir Singh for his management of his case. The police officer subsequently wrote a letter to the chief minister alleging that home minister Anil Deshmukh instructed Vaze to extort ₹100 crore from restaurants and bars, and when no action was forthcoming approached the courts.The Bombay high court eventually asked the Central Bureau of Investigation to conduct a preliminary enquiry into the matter, prompting Deshmukh’s resignation.According to NIA officers, Mane was under suspicion from the beginning, and a team from the agency visited the Kandivli unit of the crime branch where he was posted. The team inspected several vehicles parked at the office. The agency investigations, the officers said, already revealed that the person who made the last call Hiran received before he went missing, at 8.30pm on March 4, identified himself as a crime branch officer from Kandivli and drew the victim out of his Thane home on the pretext of a meeting along Ghodbunder Road. The following day, Hiran’s body was found in a creek at Reti Bunder near Mumbra with six handkerchiefs stuffed in his mouth and his face covered by a scarf.NIA officers claimed that Mane was involved in the murder conspiracy. According to Shetty, he was placed under arrest after thoroughly verifying his role.The NIA officers said that Mane was present at CIU on March 3, when Vaze tried to convince Hiran to take the blame for placing the explosives-laden SUV near Antilia. According to NIA, Vaze assured Hiran that he would be out on bail soon. The plan to eliminate Hiran was allegedly hatched after he refused to take the blame, the officers added.The NIA officer who asked not to be named said that at least two witnesses, a hotelier who visited CIU on March 3 and a deputy commissioner of police, also questioned by NIA , have corroborated that Mane was with Vaze at CIU office that day. The officer added that Mane was also present at the meeting attended by Vaze, arrested former constable Vinayak Shinde and another former officer before the murder at Chakala in Andheri.NIA has so far arrested Vaze, assistant police inspector Kazi, Shinde and cricket bookie Naresh Ramniklal Gor in the two cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/hiran-case-another-cop-remanded-to-nia-custody-101619202836666.html
24-04-2021||India||Didn’t stop HCs from passing orders to combat Covid: SC||The Supreme Court clarified on Friday that it has not restrained high courts from passing urgent orders to combat the crisis triggered by the second Covid-19 wave, as was widely believed on Thursday. A bench, headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, maintained that the top court did not stop the high courts from taking up the matter when it initiated a public interest litigation on its own on Thursday, asking the Centre to present before it on Friday, a national plan to deal with the crisis that has now made India the worst hot spot of the global pandemic.With the Centre seeking more time, much of Friday’s hearing was not devoted to the ballooning Covid-19 crisis, but to the clarification, and a recusal.The clarification by the top court came after a controversy ensued over justice Bobde’s bench taking suo motu (on its own motion) cognisance of the surge in infections the day before his retirement and appointing senior advocate Harish Salve as the amicus curiae to assist the court . This, even though Salve represented Vedanta, which wanted its controversial shuttered plant in Tamil Nadu’s Thoothukudi reopened for producing oxygen.On Thursday, the apex court issued notices to the petitioners before the high courts, asking why uniform orders should not be passed by the Supreme Court, something interpreted by most people as the bench taking over all the cases.When the proceedings commenced, Salve opted to withdraw as amicus, citing adverse comments by some lawyers in the media against his “friendship” with justice Bobde and a possible conflict of interest.“It is the most sensitive case this court will look into. I don’t want this case to be decided under a shadow that I knew the CJI from school and college and allegations being made or there is a conflict of interest.”SG Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union government, requested Salve not to succumb to the “pressure” and stay on but Salve remained firm. Mehta also asked for an adjournment till next week to present a national plan on availability and distribution of essential supplies and services, saying he would not want justice Bobde’s last day in office to get mired in any controversy. The surging second wave of the coronavirus disease has resulted in the number of active Covid-19 cases in the country rising to around 2.4 million by Thursday evening, leaving people scrambling for hospital beds, oxygen, and key medicines.Subsequently, the CJI accepted Salve’s withdrawal, observing: “We were also pained at reading what some senior advocates had to say. But everyone is entitled to their opinion. In future, we will have to appoint someone as amicus only when we don’t know that person. Bu we will honour your sentiments and allow you to recuse.”The bench, which included justices L Nageswara Rao and S Ravindra Bhat, also expressed its displeasure at “some senior lawyers” questioning the suo motu proceedings and the purported attempts to hold the hands of at least six high courts across the country which have kept the Centre as well as the state governments concerned on their toes regarding the supply of essential medicines, medical oxygen and hospital beds. For instance, the Delhi High Court’s interventions may well have prevented a series of medical tragedies in the national Capital.An anguished justice Rao said: “Even before the order was passed, motives were imputed that we were going to stop the high courts. Some senior advocates are destroying the institution.”The judge then turned to senior advocate Dushyant Dave, who was among those who questioned the intervention of the Supreme Court at a time when high courts were proactively working for the benefit of people, and asked: “You have imputed motives to us without reading the order. Is there anything in our order to transfer the case? Is this how a senior advocate should speak? Without reading the order?”Dave retorted: “No motives have been imputed but we all thought that your lordship was going to do it (transfer the case)... entire country thought like that. It was a genuine perception. My lordships have done this before. And there is still an indication in your order.”Intervening at this point, justice Bhat told Dave: “We never said a word and did not stop the high courts. We in fact asked the Centre to go to high courts and report to them. What kind of perception are you talking about?”Solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union government, asked Dave whether a senior counsel should react on the basis of a perception or should rely on a judicial order, which prompted Dave to respond: “Mr Mehta, you represent a government that runs only on perception.”At this juncture, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association and senior lawyer Vikas Singh submitted that the lawyers’ body was opposing the transfer of proceedings from the high courts and referred to how the Supreme Court simply accepted a statement from the S-G during the pandemic last year that no migrant was on the roads.Singh also complained about the shortage of oxygen in the hospitals of Delhi, getting CJI Bobde to respond: “That is exactly the kind of issues we wanted to deal with. But anyway, now since the S-G has requested for an adjournment, we will adjourn this case to Tuesday next week.”On Thursday, the Supreme Court called the crisis triggered by the second Covid-19 wave a “national emergency”, and asked the Centre to present before it on Friday a national plan. Issuing notices to the Union and state governments, the order said its focus areas at this time were the supply of medical oxygen, essential medicines, the method and manner of vaccination, and the declaration of lockdowns to check the spread of the disease. It also issued notices to the petitioners before the high courts, asking why uniform orders should not be passed by the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/didnt-stop-hcs-from-passing-orders-to-combat-covid-sc-101619202716650.html
24-04-2021||India||IAF deploys 5 aircraft to aid oxygen distribution||Pitching in to fight the Covid-19 pandemic, the Indian Air Force (IAF) has deployed five types of aircraft to ferry essential items to different parts of the country, and has carried out several sorties to airlift oxygen containers, cylinders, essential medicines and equipment required for setting up and sustaining Covid hospitals and facilities to deal with the surge in infections, the defence ministry said on Friday.Aircraft have also been kept on standby to cater to additional workload.“The IAF transport aircraft and helicopters have been pressed into service for carrying out these tasks. These include C-17, C-130J, IL-76, An-32 and Avro. Chinook and Mi-17 helicopters are on standby,” the ministry said in a statement, adding that tasks undertaken so far include airlift of doctors and nursing staff from Kochi, Mumbai, Vizag and Bangalore to Delhi. Transport planes and choppers are on standby for being deployed at short notice, it said.IAF on Thursday airlifted three oxygen containers from Hindon to Panagarh in West Bengal, where these will be filled up and supplied to different centres for Covid relief. It also moved oxygen containers from Begumpet to Bhubaneswar on Friday. Once filled, the containers will be carried to Covid centres by rail or road.“The C-17 and IL-76 aircraft of IAF have started airlifting big empty oxygen tankers from their place of use to the filling stations across the country to speed up the distribution of much needed oxygen. In addition to this, the aircraft have transported large quantity of load comprising bio-safety cabinets and autoclave machines for setting up of an additional Covid facility at Leh,” the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/iaf-deploys-5-aircraft-to-aid-oxygen-distribution-101619202476575.html
24-04-2021||India||Military importing 23 oxygen plants from Germany||The Armed Forces Medical Services (AFMS) is importing mobile oxygen generation plants to address the oxygen crisis precipitated by the second wave of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19), people familiar with the development said on Friday.The AFMS is importing 23 mobile oxygen generation plants from Germany, and these will arrive within a week, said one of the officials cited above. “These plants will be deployed in AFMS hospitals catering to Covid patients,” he said.The military and other wings of the defence ministry have been ordered to respond on war footing to fight the outbreak that has so far claimed nearly 185,000 lives, as reported by Hindustan Times.From setting up Covid hospitals to ramping up oxygen production and airlifting of medical staff and oxygen containers to liaising with state governments to help them deal with the rising number of daily cases, the armed forces, the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) and defence public sector undertakings (DPSUs) are working overtime for Covid-19 relief.The DRDO is among the organisations that are at the forefront of fighting the second deadly wave of Covid-19 that has ripped through the country. A new Covid hospital set up by the DRDO in Ahmedabad will be functional from Saturday. The hospital has been readied in less than 10 days.The Dhanvantri Covid Hospital will have a capacity of 900 beds including 150 intensive care unit (ICU) beds, said a second official. The remaining 750 beds also have provision for oxygen, he added. The DRDO has set up the facility in collaboration with Gujarat government.It has so far set up or is in the process of setting up state-of-the-art Covid hospitals in six cities to treat more than 3,100 critical patients.The DRDO has set up a 500-bed hospital in Delhi and converted an ESIC hospital into a 500-bed Covid facility in Patna. In addition, hospitals with 450 beds in Lucknow and 750 beds in Varanasi are expected to be functional soon. A sixth Covid hospital is being readied in Bihar’s Muzaffarpur.The Indian Air Force on Thursday airlifted three empty oxygen containers from Hindon to Panagarh in West Bengal where these will be filled up and supplied to different centres for Covid relief. The IAF used its C-17 and Il-76 heavy-lift aircraft to move the containers. Also, it moved empty oxygen containers from Begumpet to Bhubaneswar on Friday. Once filled, the containers will be carried to Covid centres by rail or road.The IAF has deployed its aircraft for airlifting medical personnel, oxygen containers, oxygen cylinders, trolleys and essential medicines to places where they are needed, as reported by HT.The DRDO has also stepped in to address the oxygen crisis precipitated by the second wave of the disease. It has transferred oxygen generation technology to the industry, which has now started providing oxygen plants to state governments and hospitals. The Uttar Pradesh government, for instance, has ordered five such plants from Coimbatore-based Trident Pneumatics.The technology transferred to the industry is based on the onboard oxygen generation technology developed for Tejas light combat aircraft. The oxygen generation plants can produce 1,000 litres of oxygen per minute. The DPSUs are also making arrangements to buy oxygen plants for the production and supply of oxygen cylinders at a swift pace.Technology developed by the DRDO for a supplemental oxygen delivery system for soldiers posted in high-altitude areas has also been transferred to the industry, and it will soon be available in the market for use by Covid patients.The armed forces and other wings of the defence ministry can play an important role in the fight against Covid-19, said Lieutenant General BK Chopra (retd), a former directed general of AFMS said on Thursday.“They have the manpower, resources and discipline to provide relief in these hard times. The military especially has a culture of quick response, be it enemy action or natural catastrophes. It can do a lot to alleviate the sufferings of our countrymen during the pandemic too,” Chopra said.On April 20, defence minister Rajnath Singh carried out an extensive review of the preparedness of the armed forces and other allied organisations to deal with the surge in Covid infections across the country.Each plant can produce 2,400 litres of oxygen per hour. “At this rate, it can cater to 20-25 patients round the clock. The advantage of these plants is that they are easily portable,” an official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/military-importing-23-oxygen-plants-from-germany-101619202356638.html
24-04-2021||India||CJI Bobde wanted Shah Rukh Khan to mediate in Ayodhya case: Laywer||Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, who demits office on Saturday, had reached out to actor Shah Rukh Khan to facilitate the resolution of the Ayodhya title dispute through mediation, senior advocate Vikas Singh disclosed on Friday.Speaking at the virtual farewell of the outgoing CJI, Singh revealed that justice Bobde sought his assistance in roping in Shah Rukh Khan since the lawyer knew the actor well.“While he (justice Bobde, as a member of the Ayodhya bench) was in very initial stages of the mediation, he was of the firm view that Ayodhya dispute should be resolved through mediation... just see his commitment to the mediation process that he asked me since I knew the family of Shah Rukh Khan very well, whether Shah Rukh Khan will be interested in participating in the mediation if the mediation were to go forward,” Singh, president of the Supreme Court Bar Association, said during the address.Singh added that he spoke to Khan, who was “more than willing” to be a part of the mediation process since he felt the best way forward is when Hindus and Muslims can live together peacefully in this country and when there is complete religious harmony.“He (Khan) suggested that the foundation stone of the Hindu temple should be laid by some prominent Muslims and foundation stone of the mosque be paid by prominent Hindus. Unfortunately, the mediation did not go ahead,” lamented Singh.Shah Rukh Khan did not respond to queries seeking comment .A five-judge bench in the Supreme Court, comprising then CJI Ranjan Gogoi and justices Bobde, Dhananjaya Y Chandrachud, Ashok Bhushan and SA Nazeer, had in March 2019 ordered mediation for exploring the possibility of amicable resolution of the land dispute. It constituted a three-member mediation committee which included former top court judge FM Ibrahim Kalifulla, spiritual guru Sri Sri Ravi Shankar, and senior advocate Sriram Panchu. The panel was given the liberty to include more mediators or seek assistance of anyone.Narrating the entire episode, Singh told HT that he rang up Shah Rukh Khan, who was initially reluctant to be a part of the contentious dispute but later agreed to assist in any fruitful manner.“I had to persuade him that it is the Supreme Court that wanted his assistance, and so he agreed. He was always of the view that Hindus and Muslims must live peacefully and with mutual respect. It is then he came out with a suggestion if the mediation goes forward, one of the ways forward could be to have the first brick of the temple be put by some renowned Muslims and vice versa. However, the mediation never lifted off the ground,” said Singh.Singh also disclosed another “secret” between him and justice Bobde.“I wanted to sell my Harley Davidson bike. Everyone knows justice Bobde is a bike enthusiast. I was on a flight with him when I told him I wanted to sell my bike. The CJI said he would want to buy it, and I sent it to him for a trial. I told him it is heavy but justice Bobde replied he has been riding bikes since his childhood. It was because of that bike he had a fall and the chief justice got an injured femur. He told me the fall was not because of the weight of the bike but because of its side-stand,” said Singh.Singh told HT that the injury not only delayed the Ayodhya hearings by at least four weeks in 2019, but he had to also look out for another buyer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cjibobde-wanted-shah-rukh-khan-to-mediate-in-ayodhya-caselaywer-101619202296684.html
24-04-2021||India||mRNA vaccines can adapt to variants faster than others: Dr Drew Weissman||The earliest couple of coronavirus vaccines the world had access to were by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. They have high efficacy rates, and produce some of the strongest immune responses among all Covid-19 vaccines. Common among the two is also their platform – modified mRNA coated in a lipid nano-particle. This technology is the result of research by two scientists, Drew Weissman and Katalin Kariko. In a video interview with Hindustan Times, Weissman, professor at Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, spoke about the platform’s development and future possibilities in finding new cures, while urging the world to focus on vaccinating the global population quickly. Edited Excerpts:Tell us a little about your journey in developing the platform. The first time RNA was used as a therapeutic was in 1990. I moved to Penn in 1997 and that’s when I met Kati Kariko. My interest at the time was in a subset of immune cells involved in vaccines. Part of the study was in developing new kinds of vaccines. Kati was working on mRNA. We met, we started talking, and started working on mRNA vaccines. What I noticed early on was RNA was highly inflammatory, and that’s bad when you are trying to make a drug, vaccine, or a therapeutic. So we spent a bunch of years studying that inflammatory activity, and finally figured out how to get rid of it, and that was by modifying one of the RNA code. We published that (paper reporting the success) in 2005, and that’s the technology that Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech use in their vaccines. Kati moved to BioNTech, where she developed the LNP technology (liquid nano particles – the way mRNA is delivered), which is also a crucial part of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines.So essentially, the 2005 finding was a turning point for the potential of mRNA vaccines?Definitely. Some people have continued to study unmodified RNA. They are using the same LNP (delivery mechanism) that Pfizer is using, but if you compare their results to Pfizer’s, Pfizer makes antibodies about five times higher than people recovering from Covid. Curevac, which uses the same immunogen (mRNA wrapped in LNP) but with unmodified RNA, makes antibodies in the lower quartile -- much less than the Pfizer vaccine. The comparison tells you the importance of modified RNA.How did mRNA platforms role come into play with Covid-19?Initially, what happened is companies used the tech they knew best. A big problem with science is that when a company develops a vaccine, they don’t compare it with what others do because they do not want to know how much better or worse their product is. [However] what BioNTech did was a four-arm Phase 1 study and compared different RNA platforms - they looked at unmodified RNA, nucleoside-modified RNA (the method Weissman and Kariko pioneered) and self-replicating RNA. And they found nucleoside-modified worked best for Covid.The mRNA vaccines are expensive as far as LMIC nations are concerned. How do we look at making it more accessible?It is expensive because it’s brand new. The companies have just figured out how to make 100 million doses a month. Over time, I believe it is going to get less and less expensive. The other big difficulty is the freezing that it requires. We and other companies are working on how to make it stable in our refrigerators, how to freeze-dry it so that it can be stored at room temperature. All of those advances are going to come over the next few months. Many of those are issues we can address.My lab and me, personally, have had a big issue with equality of vaccine access. So early last spring, we started working with the government of Thailand to build their own RNA vaccines and their own GMP centres (production facilities). They are going to be able to make the vaccine in Thailand and supply it to seven surrounding LMIC. I am also working with the WHO to do the same thing in Africa so that same access is available.Is the end of the year a realistic time-frame for some of this?With the Thai vaccine, the hope is to give it to people by the end of this year. It goes to a bunch of countries, like Vietnam, Pakistan, Malaysia and some others.What sort of role mRNA can play in keeping up with variants?The vaccine is literally plug and play. All you need is the sequence of the antigen. For the coronavirus, it’s the spike protein. The minute new variants appear that look concerning, you can take the sequence of the variant and plug it into an RNA vaccine. It will take you literally weeks to make a new vaccine. That’s because the technology is the same no matter what the sequence. [But] if you have to make an adenovirus or an inactivated virus, you have to make the virus, grow it, inactivate it -- all that takes a lot of time.Can you share some details about the vaccine you are working on with WHO, especially issues relating to intellectual property?Right now, it is an unknown. The IP is always an issue. People are always working on that to make the IP available. This involves negotiations. Moderna said they would not hold an IP for any Covid-19 vaccine so other companies are free to use it. I think that is a great step forward.As far as building a facility, a GMP unit (for mRNA vaccines) costs millions of dollars to build. Then you need to get the technology transferred. That’s what we are working on with WHO to get the technology so that we will be able to go in to a GMP facility somewhere in Africa and help them set up to make an mRNA-LNP vaccine. I think that’s the critical difficulty people will have. Once we give them the technology, they can start making the vaccines and that starts takes weeks.What other doors do you think the modified RNA platform will now open?We have five Phase 1 trials for other vaccines with mRNA before the pandemic hit. We and other companies have clinical trials that are being set up to deliver monoclonal antibodies as mRNA. We have some gene therapy clinical trials that we look forward to. We are setting up to do HIV cure studies in macaques. There’s really a huge amount of technologies and therapeutics that we are developing with modified RNA.Where do you think we will be this time next year, April 2022?I am a little concerned because in the United States we have fantastic vaccine roll-out, Israel has good coverage and so has UK; Europe has not done well, and then rest of the world has little access. India has access because of Serum Institute but their roll-out is not as fast as wanted and the vaccine availability isn’t great.There are two things that have to happen for us to get the pandemic under control and stop the variants from appearing. We have to vaccinate the entire world, and countries need to have a high enough percentage of people vaccinated – somewhere between 75-85% in order to reach herd immunity. When that happens, Covid won’t go away but the variants won’t appear quickly, and the virus won’t spread. I don’t know how quickly that happens, but until it does, variants will keep appearing. And they are going to keep getting scarier and scarier. The world really needs to get moving on this. It’s just as much about convincing people to get vaccines – in the US, we are reaching a point where there are more vaccines than people willing to take them, and that’s a big problem. What people who are hesitant do not realise is that if they don’t take it, we are never going to reach herd immunity, and Covid is going to be a problem for years and years to come.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mrna-vaccines-can-adapt-to-variants-faster-than-others-101619202236657.html
24-04-2021||India||Covid vaccines: US defends restrictions on raw material export||The US has defended curbs on exports of raw materials needed by India to make Covid-19 vaccines, while German Chancellor Angela Merkel was critical of the slowdown of vaccine exports from India against the backdrop of a record spike in coronavirus infections in the country.The position taken by the US state department and the German leader caused consternation in New Delhi, though there was no formal response from Indian officials. India has raised with the US the need to lift restrictions imposed on the export of critical raw materials and equipment several times since February.On February 5, US President Joe Biden invoked the Defense Production Act to restrict exports of the raw materials to boost domestic vaccine production. External affairs minister S Jaishankar raised the matter with secretary of state Antony Blinken when they spoke on April 19; the same was also taken up in Washington by Indian envoy Taranjit Singh Sandhu.Asked by a reporter about India’s call to ease the export curbs as they threaten to slow the country’s vaccination drive, US state department spokesperson Ned Price told a briefing on Thursday that the Biden administration’s priority is to meet the vaccine requirements of the American people.“What I will say broadly is that the US first and foremost is engaged in an ambitious and effective and, so far, successful effort to vaccinate the American people,” Price said.“Number one, we have a special responsibility to the American people. Number two...this country has been hit harder than any other country around the world – more than 550,000 deaths, tens of millions of infections in this country alone. But there’s also a broader point here that I made yesterday that it’s...not only in our interest to see Americans vaccinated, it’s in the interests of the rest of the world to see Americans vaccinated,” he added.Price also pointed to arrangements between the US and the members of the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue or Quad on vaccine production, including increasing production capacity in India, but did not say whether or when the US would ease curbs on export of vaccine raw materials.The silence of the top US leadership on this matter has not gone down well in New Delhi, especially against the backdrop of the agreement on vaccine production and delivery at the first virtual summit of Quad leaders in March.In a separate development, Merkel held out what was perceived in some quarters as a veiled threat on the issue of India calibrating Covid-19 vaccine exports since last month in order to focus on its domestic immunisation programme. Germany is among the European countries affected by a slowdown in exports of the AstraZeneca vaccine made by the Serum Institute of India (SII).“We now have a situation with India where, in connection with the emergency situation of the pandemic, we are worried whether the pharmaceutical products will still come to us,” Merkel was quoted as saying by Politico while participating in an online conversation on Wednesday.“Of course, we have only allowed India to become such a large pharmaceutical producer in the first place, also from the European side, in the expectation that this should then also be complied with. If that is not the case now, we will have to rethink,” she added.Observers noted Merkel’s comments came against the backdrop of several European countries banning exports of vaccines, and at a time when India is registering a record number of infections – 332,730 as of Friday – and is struggling to cope with the surge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid-vaccines-us-defends-restrictions-on-raw-material-export-101619201996595.html
24-04-2021||Today's||Four questions on the vaccine strategy||The one thing journalists are good at is asking questions. We’re naturally curious, even inquisitive. We rarely accept at face value what is said to us. If it’s from someone in authority, we usually distrust it. Our inclination is to dig below the surface because we suspect the truth is hidden from view. This can make us pesky and awkward. At times, even bolshie and obstreperous.Well, I think it’s time to ask a few questions about the government’s vaccination strategy. But I’ll do it fairly. I’ll simply pose the questions that need to be answered. While we wait for the government’s response — if there is one — you judge if the questions raise deep and disturbing concerns. In other words, I’ll leave you to come to whatever conclusion you want.The first question is the most important. It has two parts. Given that as far back as May or June last year, when Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca were working on a two-dose vaccine, we knew that if 75% of the Indian population was to be fully vaccinated, we would need two billion doses. Given that we also knew our total nationwide vaccine-producing capacity could not deliver two billion doses in the required time frame, wasn’t it obvious the government needed to take immediate steps to ramp up our production capacity? This isn’t based on rocket science. Just simple maths.So what did the government do? Sums of ₹10 crore were made available to the Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech to help with vaccine trials but, as far as I can tell, nothing was done to boost production capacity. If I’m right, was this explicable and understandable? Or utterly irresponsible?The consequence is today, when the government wants to vaccinate at five million doses a day but public health experts are recommending 10, we produce under 2.5 million.Let me come to a second key question. As far back as May or June, Serum Institute decided to risk its own money and produce and stockpile AstraZeneca (Covishield) in the hope it would be successful. The United States, United Kingdom and the European Union placed firm orders and also paid for them. All of this was before the vaccine was approved and licensed. The intention was to guarantee an assured supply. Did the Indian government take a similar step? If not, why not? Did it not believe this was wise and necessary? Or did it not think of it?The argument that India doesn’t have the money simply doesn’t wash. A sum of ₹35,000 crore was set aside in the budget for vaccination. Why wasn’t it used? Furthermore, Serum Institute is an Indian company. Placing confirmed advance orders and paying for them would have helped boost its capacity. This was, therefore, atmanirbhar to boot.Time for a third question. At the end of 2020, the government reached an agreement with Serum Institute to buy 100 million doses at ₹200 each. That’s one of the lowest prices in the world. But in January, when it placed a firm order, it was for only 11 million doses. Why? I’m told thereafter the government acquired additional amounts in similar lots of 10 or 20 million. Again, why? Our purchase strategy should have been designed to help our vaccine producers. Doesn’t this feel like tactical game-playing?Finally, my last question. Nearly three weeks ago, Serum asked for ₹3,000 crore to boost its manufacturing capacity. By now, the government knew India was short of vaccines whilst the second surge was escalating exponentially, yet it took two weeks to respond. Why? In a crisis, speed is critical but the government thought time was on its side. Its explanation — we had to find a way of paying. It did so at the speed of business-as-usual.I’ll stop at this point. It’s now for you to decide if these questions raise disturbing issues and are worth asking. We may differ in our answers but the ones that matter will come from the government. But when?Karan Thapar is the author of Devil’s Advocate: The Untold StoryThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/four-questions-on-the-vaccine-strategy-101619276165197.html
24-04-2021||Today's||Women are key to financial inclusion||For a long time, financial service providers have focused on high net-worth individuals, salaried individuals and business owners to increase their profitability.This is attributed mainly to two factors. One, a lot is known about these segments because they leave large financial footprints and rich data. This enables financial service providers to make accurate decisions, create targeted products and manage Know Your Customer (KYC) risks. Two, the cost of customer acquisition, maintenance and service costs in retail banking business is high.However, digitisation is enabling inclusion of customer segments, which have been historically excluded from the financial service provider gamut. Effective implementation of Aadhaar-based eKYC collection and authentication lowered barriers of entry to the formal financial system. It has allowed the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile (JAM) trinity to lay the foundation to bring 230 million unserved and underserved women into the formal financial services ecosystem. Women Jan Dhan customers constitute a cumulative ₹61,000-plus crores of deposits in these accounts.We worked with a leading public sector bank to look at ways of increasing savings adoption by Jan Dhan customers, and found that when engaged effectively, they are an important and economically valuable consumer segment for banks for the following set of reasons.First, women are decision-makers for spending and savings in most low-income households. They are thus more committed and disciplined savers than men. In our pilot project, we found 32% of women who were committed to saving versus 25% of men. These women grew their balances by 36% during the project period of five months (versus 24% by men). This showed that when given the opportunity, women save and by doing so build financial resilience.Two, women value relationships over deals, special offers and rates. As their interaction with the bank improves, women can be encouraged to avail overdraft loans and micro-insurance, which enable them to invest in their families and create revenue opportunities for financial services. Thus, the bank will see better cross-sell and larger lifetime value in serving women customers.Three, the Government of India sent ₹500 as direct benefit transfer (DBT), each month between April to June 2020, directly to women Jan Dhan accounts as Covid-19 relief. This has led to the activation of dormant women accounts and a spate of new accounts being opened by women. Families now want women to have and use their accounts, since they want to receive government benefits being sent to women. We saw a 15% increase in the number of women’s accounts since March 2020, compared to a 4% increase of men’s accounts in the same period.Despite digital technologies and government initiatives, hurdles to serve women Jan Dhan customers have not been eliminated. A challenge in engaging women is the lack of gender-disaggregated data.Financial service providers need to deploy strategies that focus on the Jan Dhan women segment by using sex-disaggregated data. For instance, target and communicate with women and design products and processes to be women-centric. At a policy-level, collecting and analysing gender-disaggregated data is vital for the creation of products and services for low-income women.Women’s engagement with financial institutions and their ability to access participation in work and credit from such institutions can increase their social capital. Thus, empowering 230 million women Jan Dhan customers financially leads to the potential upliftment of 920 million lives, at an average family of four. It is economically viable for banks to target women, while contributing to such social good. The second wave of the pandemic has intensified the need for economic support. Our research shows that the government’s continued focus on women and their inclusion in the financial sector can have a transformative impact in boosting household economic resilience, expanding women’s access to credit and work opportunities, aiding empowerment and equity.Sriraman Jagannathan is executive vice president, Asia, and Bhargavi Ramadugu is specialist, advisory services, Women’s World BankingThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/women-are-key-to-financial-inclusion-101619276163691.html
24-04-2021||Today's||Covid-19: Is this a political turning point?||Never has independent India faced a crisis of the magnitude that is currently confronting the nation (with the exception of the Partition). Yes, there have been wars, internal insurgencies and conflicts; there is chronic deprivation; and there have been political challenges. But never has India witnessed hundreds of thousands of people get afflicted by a deathly virus every day or the scale of today’s suffering — visible in hospital emergency wards, at homes, even in crematoriums. There can only be one national priority at the moment — beating back the second wave of the viral pandemic by providing every medical asset and resource necessary, breaking the chain of transmission, moving towards universal vaccination as early as possible, and ensuring relief to every suffering family. Everything else will come later — but it will come, for a defining and transformative moment such as this will inevitably have political consequences.Riding on Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s popularity, the central government enjoys an unprecedented degree of popular legitimacy and power. Many have, in the past, made the mistake of underestimating the PM’s political skills, and the government’s ability to bounce back from crises. Demonetisation was meant to erode the government’s base among the poor, but as reportage in Hindustan Times from eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP) in November 2016 showed, the move, in fact, enhanced its popularity. The economic slowdown was meant to shatter the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)’s winning record in 2019 — but a clever mix of nationalism and the politics of welfare neutralised it. The Citizenship (Amendment) Act protests were seen as shaking the regime’s foundations — but the ruling party converted it into a polarising issue and its electoral implications remain unclear.The lockdown and migrant crisis was expected to erode the Centre’s credibility — yet, there is little evidence, be it through anecdotal accounts or election results (in Bihar) or surveys (in Bengal) that it dented the PM’s image. The farm agitation was expected to deal a blow to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Yet, perhaps due to its geographical concentration to limited regions, and the mistakes of the movement itself, the party’s base remains largely intact.But the second wave of Covid-19 is, arguably, a political turning point. To be sure, no government could have anticipated the scale of the crisis, with close to 350,000 cases a day. The United States (US), with far more resources, better scientific infrastructure, and a developed health system, too went through multiple waves of the pandemic — and it is only with expedited vaccination that the pandemic has been brought under some degree of control, for now. But while this context is important, so is the fact that historical trends (remember the second wave of the Spanish Flu was more devastating than the first), contemporary experiences (the subsequent waves of Covid-19 elsewhere) and the nature of the disease itself (the virus is unpredictable) should have made India more alert, less complacent. This crisis is also different for three political reasons. For one, the pandemic has come home to the Indian elite, upper middle class, middle class, and the neo-middle class. The BJP may dismiss the “Lutyens elite”, but beyond that central Delhi bubble, across urban India, lie large swathes of Indians who have played an outsized and disproportionate role in determining politics.Remember, in 2009, urban and middle-class India went with Manmohan Singh, delivering to the Congress a surprising victory. Remember, in 2014, even as the intelligentsia was sceptical of the BJP and Modi, this segment of urban and semi-urban middle class Indians backed a new leader — and provided the momentum for the BJP’s victory. By 2019, the party had indeed expanded — but this segment stayed loyal, visible in results from cities and towns across north, west, and east India. Today, it is middle class India which has been hit. If the 2019 election, to use analyst Abhinav Prakash’s memorable words, was between Lodhi Road (representing the anti-BJP constituency) and Noida (representing the pro-BJP constituency), today, both Lodhi Road and Noida are affected, as are the middle class locations of Lucknow and Patna, Kanpur and Thane, Surat and Bengaluru.These citizens are living through the crisis, and their experiences are at variance with official claims. Neither can blame be easily deflected on to other entities — although some of that is already underway with repeated reminders that health is a state subject and that India’s pandemic stats still look good when seen in the context of its population. Two, the suffering of citizens is today getting channelled as anger — at governments in general, and the Centre in particular. Last year, citizens gave the government the benefit of doubt — this was a new disease, there was sympathy for the State, and a sense that no force could, instantly, beat back the pandemic. Citizens were willing to pay the costs through a lockdown and diminished economic opportunities to save themselves and save the nation, in the hope that the government would be better prepared.This year, there is limited sympathy. The government’s claims of the progress in health infrastructure in the past year — and indeed there has been progress — is met with scepticism, for what citizens are experiencing is a historical era of scarcity. The State is seen as weak, unable to even provide citizens with the oxygen required to breathe. The rallies in West Bengal and the green signal to the Kumbh — both of which have undoubtedly added to Covid numbers — are seen as examples of entirely skewed priorities. And in neighbourhoods, family WhatsApp groups, and hospitals, there is only one question — could the government not have prepared for this wave better, when it had one year to do so? The crisis has also exposed weak Indian State capacity, both domestically and internationally. And the sense that India was a rising power, feted by the world, has taken a hit — the country is seen as desperately needing support to tide over the crisis.And finally, the second wave will intensify the economic crisis. The recovery from the lockdown last year had a clear tilt — where corporate India was getting back on its feet and markets were rising, but the deprived were continuing to suffer and inequality was growing. This time, both ends of the economic spectrum will get hit again, in different degrees. The hopes of a major boom this year are being moderated, migration of workers from cities to villages has started, factories are shut again, demand is plummeting, supply chains are disrupted, and the health and economic crisis is back. It is not certain if citizens will continue giving the government the benefit of doubt as their incomes dip and expenses rise, amid enhanced health related costs.This is not to suggest that the BJP will lose elections. In West Bengal, for instance, the party may well win. Neither is to suggest that in three years, the current mood, a product of the current circumstances, won’t change. But among citizens, deep distrust and doubt have crept in over the central government’s ability to deliver. The romance has frayed. And this may well be the political legacy of the second wave.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/covid19is-this-a-political-turning-point-101619276162447.html
24-04-2021||Today's||The contours of the Bengal battle||Next Sunday, the winner of the West Bengal elections will be known. The result has the potential of shaping, and possibly undermining, India’s federalism.The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) campaign has been fronted by star campaigners from Delhi — Prime Minister Narendra Modi, home minister Amit Shah, party chief JP Nadda, and Union minister Smriti Irani, the only one to speak Bengali. So notable has the been absence of the state BJP that party leaders from Delhi have had to assure crowds that the chief minister will be Bengali if the party wins.The BJP’s dependence on Delhi campaigners has enabled chief minister (CM) Mamta Banerjee to play the Bengali card, for all its worth, and attack the BJP as a party of outsiders. She believes she can win because Bengalis have a strong sense of their identity, and a long record of voting for staunchly Bengali leaders and parties, whatever their political hue.After Independence, Bengalis stayed with BC Roy as CM until his death almost a decade-and-a-half later. He was a member of the Congress but, in those days, the Congress was a federation of parties headed by leaders who were very much their own men. Roy was an independent-minded Bengali patriot who was close to Mahatma Gandhi but had an ambivalent relationship with Jawaharlal Nehru.After him came a period of political instability, which earned Bengal a bad name for violent unrest. Then there did come five more years of Congress rule, but in 1977, Bengal revolted against Indira Gandhi’s autocracy and elected the Communist Party of India (Marxist) and its allies. They ruled for almost 34 years. The state’s long-serving CM, Jyoti Basu, once told me that the CPI(M) hadn’t been able to spread to the neighbouring states because it was so firmly identified as a Bengali party. Mamata Banerjee’s Trinamool Congress, which displaced the Communists ten years ago, is even more firmly Bengali than they were.In this election, the BJP is hoping that its Hindu identity will trump Banerjee’s Bengali identity. To strengthen its bid for the Bengali Hindu vote, the BJP has accused her of cultivating a Muslim vote bank. Even though the central Border Security Force is responsible for preventing illegal immigration, the BJP maintains it is still continuing and blames the state government for it.The immigrants issue led the home minister to jeopardise the success of the PM’s recent Bangladesh visit. Two days after Modi’s return, Shah said in a newspaper interview, “Poor people are leaving Bangladesh because they don’t get enough to eat in their own country.” This provoked an angry response from Bangladesh’s foreign minister, who called the remark unacceptable.The BJP has also tried to persuade Bengalis that joining the mainstream will revive investment in Kolkata and its hinterland, once known as the workshop of India. Bengal’s reputation for violent industrial unrest has lingered on, harming investment prospects. The years of Communist rule didn’t help, nor did Banerjee when she drove Tata’s Nano project out of the state.This election, with its eight phases, has been controversial because of its duration — the longest in West Bengal’s history. This may well have favoured the BJP because it has the resources to sustain such a lengthy campaign. There has also been the controversy over the rallies both sides have held, ignoring the pandemic. It’s been a bitter, personalised fight. If, when the din of electoral warfare dies down, the BJP emerges the winner, India will lose a doughty champion of federalism and Bengal will break its tradition of being ruled by a Bengali party.The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/the-contours-of-the-bengal-battle-101619276161197.html
