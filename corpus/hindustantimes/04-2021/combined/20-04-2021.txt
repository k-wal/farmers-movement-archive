20-04-2021||News||In Kabul, the republic versus the emirate||On September 11, 20 years after the 9/11 attacks, the United States (US) will finally end its “longest war” in Afghanistan. The move, long-expected but specifics of which are still awaited, comes at a critical juncture that may alter the strategic contours of South Asia. From offering Pakistan increased strategic heft in Kabul via the Taliban —with little clarity about what Rawalpindi will actually do with it — to risking State collapse, major uncertainty looms in Afghanistan.A political solution isn’t easy. Kabul’s failure to overcome factionalism underlines the political vacuousness of the Islamic republic, despite its constitutional existence. Similarly, the Taliban’s reliance on indiscriminate violence to negotiate with adversaries, and to potentially govern, indicates its near-total ideological unmooring from whatever little an Islamic emirate has to offer.For India, which has borne the brunt of instability in Afghanistan in the past, this is a highly undesirable situation. Since 2001, New Delhi relied on the US security presence to expand its strategic footprint in Afghanistan and shore up ties with sitting presidents in Kabul, while refusing to engage with the Taliban, and advocating an impossible “Afghan-led, Afghan-owned” reconciliation process. It spent over $2 billion in aid and infrastructure development and sought to ensure a strategic balance between Afghanistan and Pakistan, despite the power asymmetry between the two.Also Read | US focus shifting to China from Afghanistan, says BlinkenThe uncertainty of the current situation complicates India’s strategy, and risks undermining its interests. Escalation in multi-sided violence may create difficult-to-govern areas and further erode India’s presence in Afghanistan — consulates in Herat and Jalalabad are closed due to security concerns. Related spillover effects of forced migration, drug trafficking, and flourishing of transnational jihadists will impact the neighbourhood and Europe more than the US.India, which is unfortunately facing a similar prospect of State collapse in Myanmar, doesn’t have the capacity to resolve Afghanistan’s deep-rooted problems. But, in the next four months, before the last American soldier departs, it must make certain adjustments to prevent serious harm.To begin with, as scholars Rudra Chaudhuri and Shreyas Shende recommend in a Carnegie India report, India must appoint a special envoy to strengthen ties with allies within republican Afghanistan, and increase military (especially aerial combat) support for Kabul. The envoy should then be mandated to open channels with select Taliban figures. India has not invested much diplomatic capital on this front but cannot afford to remain aloof from the Taliban anymore.Tactical in nature, the aim of such outreach should be two-fold. One, to gauge the Taliban’s intent and capability to exercise policy autonomy vis-à-vis Pakistan. The former’s approach towards India’s consulates, developmental projects, prevention of use of Afghan territory for attacks against India, and, relatedly, the Kashmir issue (on which the Taliban remained studiedly neutral on August 5, 2019) will be an effective litmus tests on this count.Two, to explore and, if possible, exploit fissures within the Taliban. Despite being indebted to Rawalpindi and being temporarily united, the Taliban is likely to struggle with unity once in power. This doesn’t mean that India should undertake policy planning in expectation of an imminent Taliban implosion — which is unlikely in the short-term. But it must identify space for political manoeuvring within the Taliban in coordination with its other Afghan allies. Some figures (such as Mullah Yaqoob, who is already challenging the current leadership, and Mullah Baradar), who understand the nuances of international diplomacy, might be open to diversifying ties and reducing dependence on Pakistan once in power.This aspect of the Taliban seeking policy autonomy vis-à-vis Rawalpindi was visible in the post-Mullah Omar period (2015-18) of Taliban infighting when Mullah Akhtar Mansour became alienated enough by Pakistan to develop a parallel channel with Iran. Tehran posed a challenge to Islamabad’s dominance in Afghanistan’s militant landscape. From opening a Taliban office in Mashhad to supporting the renegade Mullah Rasul and engaging Mansour, Tehran ensured that it had some leverage over the Taliban, despite Kabul’s discomfort and Islamabad’s pushback. The Kulbhushan Jadhav case rocked this triangular relationship in 2016 at the peak of Iran-Pakistan covert rivalry in Afghanistan.To be sure, India is likely to coordinate its Afghanistan policy with the US in the coming years as part of Quad. But given the situation on the ground, Tehran will be a critical regional ally for New Delhi. At the Raisina Dialogue, Iranian foreign minister Javad Zarif, in a discussion with his Indian counterpart S Jaishankar and Afghanistan’s national security adviser Hamdullah Mohib stated clearly that Tehran does not desire an emirate in Afghanistan. Like India, Iran does not view a Kabul dominated by Pakistan-supported Sunni Islamists as being in its strategic interests. Despite its alignment with China and Russia, and despite recent strains in bilateral ties, Tehran is likely to cooperate with New Delhi on this issue.Afghanistan today is more resilient than its early 1990s avatar and is likely to offer stiff localised resistance to the Taliban. Consequently, Pakistan’s strategic wins, if one can call them that, may prove pyrrhic in the medium-term. The resurgence of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan, which has deep links with the Afghan Taliban and al-Qaeda, should, ideally, offer Rawalpindi a pause. Afghan resistance against the Taliban coupled with the endurance of nationalist Afghan opinion, which cuts across the republic and emirate spectrum, affords India geopolitical manoeuvring space.If New Delhi plays its cards right, it can both protect its interests in Afghanistan and support Kabul to stand its ground, however tenuous, vis-à-vis Pakistan.Avinash Paliwal teaches at SOAS University of London and is the author of My Enemy’s Enemy: India in Afghanistan from the Soviet Invasion to the US Withdrawal The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/analysis/in-kabul-the-republic-versus-the-emirate-101618826191193.html

Due to our alert preparedness and proactive measures, we have been able to manage the situation to a large extent. However, we need to be prepared for the worst-case scenario and ensure that every patient is treated with dignity and put in best efforts to save precious lives,” the chief minister said.“I once again request the people of Odisha to please cooperate. It is in the interest of the state and its people that we should manage the covid situation without lockdown. Wearing a mask and maintaining social distance will help us in this,” Patnaik said.The chief minister’s appeal comes a day after the state government announced weekend lockdowns in all urban areas beginning April 24 as the state reported 4,761 fresh Covid cases, its highest single-day surge.“With lockdowns in seriously affected states, the district collectors should be prepared for the return of the migrants. The protocols followed earlier should be reactivated by the collectors immediately based on the existing database,” he said, adding that quarantine norm and testing should be ensured for all returnees from other states.Patnaik ordered a further increase in the number of beds at Covid hospitals and Covid Care Centres across the state and said special focus should be on providing the maximum possible number of beds with oxygen support. “The system has to work on war-footing to ensure this within committed timelines. Our oxygen supply situation has to be closely monitored and ensure that all related accessories at the hospital level are available on priority. Many states are facing critical medicines shortage. Even though we have sufficient medicines in stock, we must ensure buffer stock to tackle higher demand in the coming weeks,” he said.With the R0 value (which indicates how contagious an infectious disease is) reaching 2.38 and the daily positivity rate rising to 14.71 on Tuesday, experts said the state would see a daily surge much higher than the one in the first wave. “I see Odisha peaking in another 2-3 weeks with the daily surge reaching 8,000-9,000 case a day. It would be more, but Odisha is not conducting more RT-PCR tests which would have detected the actual number of infected persons,” said noted microbiologist Dr TM Mohapatra.Meanwhile, the Bhubaneswar Municipal Corporation and Cuttack Municipal Corporation have decided to shut all religious institutions in the two cities for devotees until further orders.On Tuesday morning, several Class 10 students protested before the official residence of the chief minister seeking cancellation of the Class 10 board exam which would be conducted by the Odisha Board of Secondary Education. Last week, the Odisha government postponed all the examinations, including the Class 10 and Class 12 examinations, till June in view of the surge in the Covid-19 cases in the state.“As board exams in several states including Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka and CBSE, CISCE, we want the Odisha government to cancel the matriculation exam. We are under a lot of pressure as we do not know whether we should study for the Class 10 board exam or prepare for higher studies,” said a student.“The Covid-19 situation has aggravated in the state and the new strain is also affecting children and youngsters. We are not feeling safe to appear in the board exam.”Later, school and mass education minister Samir Dash said his department is reviewing all aspects and all options are open.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/be-prepared-for-lockdown-if-covid-protocols-not-followed-odisha-cm-101618942299071.html
20-04-2021||Gurugram||Over 1,000 vendors to be added to city’s vending zones||The town vending committee of the municipal corporation decided to add at least 1,105 street vendors to its zones in a meeting on Tuesday, with officials reiterating their stance on taking action against those found responsible for various discrepancies and unpaid dues.The meeting, held at John Hall in Civil Lines, was aimed at scrutinising and discovering anomalies in the policy to initiate action against violators, an issue that has been in the focus since last November, said officials. The matter pertains to pending payments from three contractors who were hired for the street vending zone project.Deputy municipal commissioner (DMC) Vijaypal Yadav, who oversees the project, submitted a report on his findings to the committee, highlighting that although the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) issued a work order for incorporating 3,452 street vendors in its street vending zones, only 1,620 vendors, 53% of the capacity, were operational.Yadav’s report also highlighted various discrepancies and negligence on part of a retired MCG city project officer (CPO) who was in charge of the project since its inception in 2016 till last year.MCG commissioner Vinay Pratap Singh said, “Based on the investigation report in the street vending project, appropriate action will be taken against all officials concerned found to be guilty and the action taken will be conveyed to the MCG House in the next meeting. Along with this, directions were issued to recover the remaining amount from the vending agencies. If not paid on time, criminal action will be taken against the agency concerned.”Each street vendor pays ₹1,500 per month for stationing their cart in the MCG’s street vending zone.Until January, each vendor paid ₹1,000 to the contractor and ₹500 to the MCG per month. The entire sum, including MCG’s share, was collected by the contractors. However, the same is yet to be deposited with the MCG.The services of the three contractors were terminated by the MCG.In the meeting, Singh directed Yadav to recalculate the pending amount and subsequently, initiate criminal action against the contractors for non-payment.In Yadav’s report, it was highlighted that of the 1,620 street vendors, around 300 were found to be illegal as their original owners had either leased the carts to others or transferred the ownership to them, which is not allowed under the street vending policy. Singh directed Yadav to remove all such carts as well as those found illegally stationed across the city.Singh said, “For all existing street vendors, the committee has decided to not collect monthly fees for May. From June 1 onwards, they have been directed to pay the money to the MCG every quarter, through digital payment. MCG officials have been directed to create a software for digital fees mechanism by June 1 for payment purposes.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/over-1-000-vendors-to-be-added-to-city-s-vending-zones-101618942118322.html
20-04-2021||Gurugram||Residents’ associations take charge of fight against Covid-19 in condos, gated societies||Amid the rapid surge in Covid-19 cases in the city, residents’ welfare associations of several condominiums and gated societies have effected restrictions in their societies to limit the spread of infections. The measures range from limiting the entry of visitors and restricting entry to parks to banning renovation work and walking pets in common areas.At Carlton Estate, a condominium in DLF-5, entry of property dealers, potential buyers or tenants, and all renovation work has been banned till April 26.Pawan Tharwani, the president of the Carlton Estate Condominium Association (CECA) said that depending on the number of Covid-19 cases, the RWA will take a call next week on extending the ban. “Seeing a large number of cases in the condominium, which led to one of the towers being made a containment zone, the RWA considered various measures to limit the spreading of Covid-19. We realised that nearly 100-130 visitors could be stopped daily by banning the entry of property dealers, potential buyers or tenants, and all renovation related work till April 26. This may be extended depending on the situation,” said Tharwani.He said that there were positive cases in at least 25 apartments in the condominium.At Fresco Apartments, a gated society in Nirvana Country, the number of visitors has been capped, with no more than five outsiders allowed in a house. Besides, gyms and squash courts were also shut until further notice.The RWA has also set up a three-stage sanitation process for domestic helps and vendors — wash hands with soap at a basin located at the entrance and sanitise their hands twice, once at the entrance and the other before entering the tower.“The main reason behind limiting visitors to just five per house is for ensuring that no large gatherings are taking place and minimising the chances of people contracting the coronavirus disease through interaction. We have also closed our gyms and squash courts while our in-house sports academies only allow entry of one resident at any given point for training purposes,” said Nilesh Tandon, president, Fresco Apartments.Tandon said that there are currently 35 active cases in the housing society.In the township of DLF Phases 1 and 2, the RWA has restricted the entry of residents in parks. Residents walking their pets must do so only outside their houses and cannot venture into lanes or vacant spaces nearby for the purpose, the RWA members said.“Only our horticulture staff is allowed inside the parks in DLF Phases 1 and 2. The security staff is constantly keeping vigil over such restrictions. Our main aim is to limit the potential areas where large-scale public interaction can occur and restrict the rising number of cases in our township,” said Dhruv Bansal, spokesperson, Qutub Enclave residents’ welfare association that looks after both DLF Phase 1 and DLF Phase 2.There are at least 50 active Covid-19 cases in DLF Phases 1 and 2, said Bansal.On April 7, Gurugram deputy commissioner Yash Garg had issued an order to RWAs directing them to take actions that encourage residents to stay indoors and discourage social events.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/residents-associations-take-charge-of-fight-against-covid-19-in-condos-gated-societies-101618942062924.html
20-04-2021||Gurugram||Govt issues order to shut Sheetla Mata temple, withdraws it hours later citing clerical error||The Haryana government on Tuesday issued and withdrew an order to close Sheetla Mata temple in the city within a few hours, citing a clerical error. On Tuesday afternoon, citing the need to “break the chain of Covid-19 infections,” the state government issued an order for closing Sheetla Mata temple and Mansa Devi shrine in Panchkula. Both temples receive heavy footfall and large crowds are anticipated on Wednesday, due to the Hindu festival of Ramanavami.The decision, however, was reversed a few hours later, with the Haryana government saying that directions issued by the Centre regarding religious places will be followed.“It was a simple case of a clerical error. The original order was meant to state that due to rising Covid-19 cases, coronavirus protocols such as six-foot social distancing, limited entry of devotees, mandatory wearing of masks, temperature checks at entrance and sanitising of hands need to be followed strictly at the two religious sites and greater vigilance needed to be adopted for the same during the ongoing Navratri celebrations. Due to miscommunication, an incorrect order was originally sent out and later reversed,” said a senior official in the Urban Local Bodies (ULB), privy to the matter. Vinay Pratap Singh, the commissioner of the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG), who is also the chief administrator of the Shri Mata Sheetla Devi Shrine Board, said that adequate staff has been deployed to ensure Covid-19 protocols are followed. “The decision on closing or opening the temple rests with the Haryana government. All Covid-19 safety protocols are being followed closely to ensure there are minimal chances of the virus spreading among devotees. We realise that a large gathering is taking place and hence, deputed necessary temple staff, MCG staff, and Gurugram police at relevant points to keep close vigil,” said Singh.For keeping a vigil, 58 CCTV cameras are installed inside the premises and around 200 workers will be stationed, said MCG officials.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/govt-issues-order-to-shut-sheetla-mata-temple-withdraws-it-hours-later-citing-clerical-error-101618942062046.html
20-04-2021||Gurugram||Wildlife department asks GMDA to stop waste dumping at Basai wetland||The district wildlife department on Tuesday appealed to authorities concerned, including the Gurugram Metropolitan Development Authority (GMDA), to stop the dumping of mixed waste in the ecologically sensitive Basai Wetlands.Rajesh Chahal, wildlife inspector, Gurugram, said that the land falls under the jurisdiction of GMDA but is part of the ecologically sensitive wetland. “Mixed waste, including construction waste, cloth, glass pieces, loose soil was being dumped at the site on Tuesday evening when I went there for a visit. Waste had accumulated over a 50-metre stretch to almost 10 feet in height, with more trucks spotted coming in,” said Chahal.“From the wildlife point of view, this area is extremely sensitive as it falls on the flyway of migratory birds from Najafgarh Jheel to Sultanpur Bird Sanctuary. Being an old wetland, birds are habituated to visiting this region. We are requesting the authorities to immediately stop dumping of waste here,” he said.Officials from GMDA said that they are looking into the matter. Ajay Malik, additional chief executive officer of GMDA, said, “I have learnt about this incident, but I will not be able to comment till I check the details.”Another forest official, requesting anonymity, said, “Even though this is an ecologically sensitive area, due to not being notified as a protected site, our hands are tied, and we are not able to stop this.”Basai is a village in Gurugram with a network of ponds and a wetland, making it home to a variety of frogs, turtles, fish, insects and other aquatic life. It also hosts a variety of migratory birds, such as ducks, geese, songbirds, snipes, godwits, stints, plovers, harriers, eagles and cranes that fly in from Siberia and Europe. Further, egrets, herons, kingfishers and spoonbills, among other birds, reside at the wetland.Environmentalists also raised concerns about the issue. Vaishali Chandra, a city-based environmentalist, said, “The Basai wetlands is the abode of thousands of avian lives, both migratory and native, throughout the year. The dumping of construction and demolition waste along with loose soil will slowly exterminate the habitat of these birds, jeopardising their lives. This needs to be stopped immediately.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/wildlife-department-asks-gmda-to-stop-waste-dumping-at-basai-wetland-101618942061101.html

The Central government has failed to meet Covid challenge and the people are dying because of lack of beds, medical oxygen and failure to vaccinate people,” said Selja.Members of the BJP, however, said that the maximum failure on the Covid front happened in Punjab, Maharashtra and Delhi. “These states are worst affected. The Congress and opposition leaders were responsible for causing vaccine hesitation. The government is working on a plan and it is being executed,” said Raman Malik, BJP spokesperson.Selja also criticised how the union health minister had replied to the suggestions made by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh to manage the challenges posed by Covid-19. “The conduct of the BJP leadership was neither civil nor decent,” said Selja.“The entire energy is being spent to subvert the electoral machinery to win elections at a time when lives of people should have been saved,” Bansal said, pointing to the incidents in West Bengal.Senior leader Ajay Singh Yadav said that Congress functionaries across the state will soon actively engage in helping Covid-19 patients and also workers suffering due to the lockdown-like situation. “We will be helping people across the state as the party will form district-wise committees,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/congress-hits-out-at-bjp-over-pandemic-situation-101618942060420.html

A spokesperson said that the company will utilise these days to carry out necessary maintenance work in the manufacturing plants. The company has two major plants in Haryana, located at Gurugram and Daruhera in Rewari district. “Each plant and global parts centre will remain shut for four days, in a staggered manner, between April 22 and May 1 on basis of the local scenario. All corporate offices of the company are already in work from home mode and very limited workers are in offices on rotation basis for continuity of essential services,” a statement released by the company said. According to the statement, the shutdown will not impact the company’s ability to meet the demand, which has been impacted due to localised shutdowns in many states and production loss will be compensated during the remainder of the quarter. All plants will resume normal operations post this short shutdown period, a spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/hero-motocorp-to-halt-production-for-four-days-101618942059763.html
20-04-2021||Gurugram||‘Lockdown in Delhi will help contain spread in Gurugram too’||TC Gupta, the additional chief secretary, mines and geology, employment, and housing, who has been appointed as the Covid-19 officer for Gurugram by the Haryana government spoke to Archana Mishra about the current situation in the district.Gurugram has been grappling with multiple challenges in dealing with Covid-19. How do you analyse the current situation?The main problem is the availability of beds as some people who could be home isolated have been hospitalised. Teams have been deputed to monitor hospitals. To ramp up facilities, hospitals on Tuesday were directed to tie up with three or four-star hotels where moderately ill coronavirus patients can be isolated and have a provision for emergency medical treatment. At least five hospitals have assured of tying up with the hotels by Wednesday. Thirdly, there is a lack of government health facilities in Gurugram. In Civil Hospital, there are 21 beds only for suspected cases. Any moderate to severely ill case is referred to ESIC Hospital, which has only 72 beds, of which 14 beds do not have oxygen support. The 120-bed Medeor Hospital is not fully operational due to many reasons.How do you plan to address the situation?Many hospitals raised the issue that they do not have enough health staff even if they increase the beds. Their existing staff is also getting infected. Therefore, we have decided to provide private hospitals with paramedic staff. We can deploy over 400 health staff in Gurugram after discussion with the state government. Already, Medanta Hospital has been given an additional staff of 100. Likewise, nearly 64 are given to Medeor Hospital. The demand is for roughly about 200 health workers.So far, at least 47 ventilators have been procured from the state warehouse and four from Civil Hospital. In all, 61 ventilators will be given to the SGT Medical College, as the 500-bed facility is being upgraded. Also, hospitals were directed to give preference to patients, especially those from Gurugram, who require hospitalisation.Has there been an assessment on how many people from Gurugram have not been able to find beds?With the mutual consent of private hospitals, we are starting a portal where people who require beds can register. The civil surgeon’s team will review the registration based upon parameters and medical reports. Health facilities will give preference to registered beneficiaries who require immediate hospitalisation. It is expected that over 200 Gurugram residents will register. Through this, we will get to know how many are not getting beds. However, people can directly approach hospitals too.Hospitals and chemists have been complaining about the poor supply of medical oxygen? How is the administration tackling the situation?Hospitals had earlier tied up with a medical oxygen supplier in Bhiwadi of Rajasthan. Since the Rajasthan government has imposed a ban on the export of oxygen to other states, the oxygen supply mechanism has been slightly affected. But to facilitate hospitals, we have connected them with a supplier in Panipat. The distributor has limited tankers and we are trying to supplement the distributor with tankers. Availability of oxygen is not a problem in Haryana but it is the logistics that have to be managed. It will be stabilised within a day or two.After the lockdown in Delhi, will the Haryana government impose a lockdown in Gurugram?Not yet. The issue was discussed at a state-level task force meeting on Monday. Lockdown has not been contemplated.Are we seeing any impact of Delhi’s lockdown in Gurugram?Because of a lockdown in Delhi, the spread will be contained due to less movement between the two cities. Daily cases in the last three days have almost stabilised. There is no exponential increase as it was happening a week before. If the stability is maintained, the situation will not worsen. But we are on our toes.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/lockdown-in-delhi-will-help-contain-spread-in-gurugram-too-101618942058899.html
20-04-2021||Gurugram||Migrant exodus a concern for Gurugram’s industries||Fearing an impending lockdown due to the sharp spike in Covid-19 cases, droves of workers employed in industries and construction work have started leaving fearing a repeat of last year’s situation, despite repeated assurances by the state government. Chief minister Manohar Lal Khattar said on Tuesday that the industry in the state will not be impacted like last year.Factory owners in Manesar and Gurugram said that at least 15 to 20% of workers have left and they expect more to leave, as the decision of the Delhi government to impose a lockdown and the enforcement of a night curfew in Gurugram triggered panic among workers. More than 2,000 workers’ families dotted the areas in Rajiv Chowk, Khandsa and Sector 12 from where private buses to UP, Bihar and Madhya Pradesh operate. “The number of people leaving is increasing every day,” said Rakesh, an auto driver, who waits for commuters at Rajiv Chowk.,“We are a group of 10 people living together in Patel Nagar and we work as construction workers. All of us are returning home to Darbhanga in Bihar as last year, we were left with no food to eat during the lockdown. Once the police come on the road, none will be allowed to move. We don’t want to ask for food or help,” said 20-year old Manish, adding that they will return only after the situation improves.Workers who were queuing up to buy tickets at Rajiv Chowk said that the bus fares have more than doubled due to the demand over the last three days. “The fare was ₹1,000 three days ago, but now, bus operators are demanding ₹2,500 to ₹3,000 per person, which is exorbitant,” said Ritesh Kumar, a resident of Madhubani in Bihar.A large number of workers said that they were returning home to attend weddings, but admitted that the economic difficulties faced last year played a part in their decision. “If there is a lockdown, then the salary would stop but expenses such as rent, food, and other things won’t stop. It is difficult to depend on government machinery in such a situation,” said Brahmdeep Kumar, of Supaul in Bihar.Industry owners in Gurugram and Manesar said that the government must reassure workers that there would no lockdown. “Around 30% of the workers in my unit left yesterday without any intimation and another 20% of them are preparing to leave,” said Dinesh Sharma, a garment unit owner, adding that they will not be able to fulfil existing orders.Manmohan Gaind, the vice-president of Manesar Industries Welfare Association, said that workers were affected by their experiences during last year’s lockdown. “The industrial output is going to dip further if this labour migration is not stopped. The closure of markets in Delhi has also stopped raw material supply and lack of workers will further hit industry badly,” he said.Pawan Yadav, the president, IMT Industrial Association, said that workers should not panic and the industry will support them if a difficult situation arises. “We will soon be reaching out to workers to motivate them to stay as the Haryana government has repeatedly said that there would no lockdown,” he said.Industrialists in Udyog Vihar said that apart from the migration of workers, the industry was badly hit as workers and executives from Delhi were unable to commute. “Many unit owners have complained to us that workers are unable to come and that movement passes are difficult to get in Delhi,” said Ashok Kohli, president, Chamber of Industries, Udyog Vihar.Taking cognizance of the problems faced by industrial workers, Khattar, who addressed the people in the state on Tuesday evening, appealed to migrant workers to not panic and said that the economic cycle will not be allowed to stop on the lines of 2020. “Economic activity will continue in the state and there would be no lockdown as it hurts workers who earn ₹10,000 to ₹15,000 monthly. If they lose a job they have to find a new one and it is very difficult. The economic activities will not be stopped and we will ensure the industry remains functional in all circumstances,” said Khattar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/migrant-exodus-a-concern-for-gurugram-s-industries-101618942058259.html
20-04-2021||Gurugram||Short supply of Covid-19 testing kits a major concern||Hospitals and labs in the city are dealing with a short supply of Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) testing kits, leading to long queues outside facilities with a wait time of more than six hours, in some instances, on Tuesday.“There has been a shortage of kits after a lockdown was announced in Delhi. The suppliers are not providing kits due to travel restrictions. The hospital has been sending its own vehicle to collect the kits so that there is no delay in sample collection. The process is likely to be streamlined in a few days,” said Anil Khatana, head of operations, W Pratiksha Hospital in Sector 56.A representative of a private lab administering RT-PCR tests, said, “Due to lockdown, many labs and hospitals are stocking up RT-PCR kits. Due to this reason, the entire testing process is getting affected. Testing is getting capped based on the available stock of kits.”A visit by an HT team to some of the big hospitals found that many people who arrived as early as 8am were still waiting to be tested at 2pm. Due to the swelling of crowds, distancing norms were also flouted.Santosh Gupta, a resident of Sector 10, who works in Sector 66, said, “I came at 8am, thinking I will go to office directly after my test, but even after six hours, I was not tested. They asked me to return on Wednesday morning. More than 100 people were waiting along with me, including people with high fever and flu.”Several hospitals had also posted outside the testing room early in the day that the sample collection for RT-PCR testing had ended. Even as some resumed testing later in the day after receiving kits, queues did not subside.“Due to heavy footfall, the hospital has started a token system for the general population and senior citizens. Documentation also takes time, but we are trying to streamline the process,” Dr Ritu Garg, zonal director, Fortis Memorial Research Institute.Depender Kumar, a resident of Sector 65, who was waiting in a line outside a big private hospital, alleged that there are no facilities for people coming to give their samples. “The government should think about what problems people are facing while visiting for tests. We are even waiting in long queues but are unable to get the tests done or get reports on time due to long pendency and shortage of kits. Waiting outside the hospitals with many people around, with a few not even taking any precautions such as wearing face masks, is also a threat for us. There is no clarity and the hospital staff does not give a correct estimate of how much time will it take. Waiting for six hours is no joke,” he said.At present, the government is conducting Covid-19 tests at more than 40 locations across the city, of which 23 are government locations where tests are conducted for free without prior reservation.“Gurugram is doing the highest number of sampling in the state. Government institutions are being approached by people for testing and a lot of them were turned away by private labs due to shortage of kits or other reasons,” said Dr Umang, medical officer, Patel Nagar urban primary health centre.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/short-supply-of-covid-19-testing-kits-a-major-concern-101618941998406.html

On Tuesday, at least 2,344 new Covid-19 cases were also confirmed, taking the active case count to 14,270 and the total tally to 85,878.As the district continued to struggle to contain the transmission of infection, the number of hospitalisations was at 788 on Tuesday, an increase of over 100 from 663 people who were undergoing treatment at government and private facilities on Tuesday. The increase in daily test positivity rate, the proportion of positives out of the samples tested, from almost 19% to 23% shows an unprecedented spread of infection since the outbreak of the pandemic, said officials. Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer of Gurugram, said that the focus is currently on containing the number of deaths. “The mortality rate is currently around 0.46%. The effort is to keep it below 1% by ensuring that serious patients receive treatment on time,” he said.  According to the district health bulletin, out of the 14,270 active cases, over 13,343 are in home isolation, while at least 211 moderately ill patients are in Covid care centres. To control the surge, the district health department conducted 12,013 tests on Tuesday, including 1,534 rapid antigen tests. At least 11, 622 people took the Covid-19 vaccine shots on Tuesday, of which over 9,381 were administered in government facilities and 2,241 in private ones. Overall, 414, 997 have taken the Covid-19 vaccine shots over the last four months.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/gurugram-records-2-344-new-covid-19-cases-four-deaths-101618941999037.html
20-04-2021||Gurugram||Delayed test results hamper efforts to check virus spread||Even as Covid-19 testing was intensified in the district since April 1 to identify local clusters and check the positivity rate, delayed test results are hampering the measures to contain the spread of the virus in the district. Residents said that in most cases, it is taking at least five days to get the results, which is delaying medical treatment as well as causing them anxiety.“A lot of challenges have emerged recently in delivering timely test results. Currently, it is taking over five days to give a test report due to the lack of availability of RT-PCR (Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction) kits and other medical consumables. Many hospitals and labs have been stocking up the supplies due to lockdown in Delhi and other states. Second, diagnostic teams are also getting infected with coronavirus, leading to insufficient staff. Therefore, it is getting difficult to deliver test results in 72 hours,” said a representative of a private lab, requesting anonymity.According to government guidelines, test results have to be confirmed within 24 to 48 hours. However, the issue of delayed test results continues to persist since the first week of April, when 5,000 tests were being conducted every day. With the testing scaled up to 10,000 tests per day at present, the delay is compounding isolation and contact tracing processes.Dr Virender Yadav, the chief medical officer, said, “Private labs have already been directed to deliver timely test results. Action will be taken against labs or hospitals if any case of delays.”A representative of a second private lab administering the RT-PCR test attributed the delay to overload of sampling and documentation work. “Due to increased sample collection, the testing process has been getting delayed by more than 72 hours. Also, now, the documentation process for every test has increased, which consumes a lot of time,” said the representative of the second lab, requesting anonymity.Residents said the delay in getting the results is causing uncertainty and stress, especially to those in quarantine.“It took six days to get the report and I tested positive. My entire family got infected because of me as we were not sure of my status. Now, all of us are admitted to a private hospital,” said Pawan Kumar, a resident of Sector 86, who is currently undergoing treatment at a private hospital in Manesar.Sunita Joshi, a resident of Sector 45, said that delay in receiving the test results of her two children affected the subsequent isolation process. “The hospital informed me that negative reports take time and if I had not received a message, it means there is nothing to worry about. Thinking they are negative, I did not take precautionary measures but the reports, sent after six days, stated that both were positive,” she said.Another resident alleged that he developed a lung infection as he could not get timely treatment. “It’s been more than four days that I isolated myself and developed a high fever, cough and cold. My doctor asked me to get a chest scan but the hospital refused to do it without a negative Covid-19 report. I am in no state to drive or visit hospitals, yet I am still running from pillar to post to get my test done, but to no avail,” said Amit Kumar, a resident of DLF Phase 1.Due to consistent delay in getting results from private facilities, people have started queuing up at urban primary health centres (UPHCs) for testing. “There has been a manifold increase in sampling size, which is leading to a slight delay in delivery of test results,” said Dr Umang, medical officer, Patel Nagar UPHC.Doctors are advising people to wait for reports, with primary and secondary contacts asked to wear masks and isolate themselves. “As the spread of Covid-19 is intensifying, along with new strains of the virus emerging, the health department is working day and night. The public needs to understand the situation and exhibit Covid appropriate behaviour that involves strict isolation in case of any symptoms like fever, cough, runny nose. Sanitisation and using masks is extremely important and mandatory,” said Umang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/gurugram-news/delayed-test-results-hamper-efforts-to-check-virus-spread-101618941938265.html

Contrary to their claim, Swaroop Narayan Srivastava, 82, was taken to LLR Hospital suffering from pneumonia and in desperate need of oxygen. His relative, Deepak Srivastava, said that doctors told him to bring his own oxygen cylinder. “Now, we are moving him to a non-Covid private hospital. We are lucky, we got a bed. LLR people were not ready to begin treatment without the cylinder,” he said. LLR Hospital, the biggest hospital, has seen oxygen demand shoot up to 12,000 litres in a day, said the doctors, adding that the situation became critical in the early hours of Tuesday. Somehow it was managed. The LLR Hospital arranged for some 100 cylinders from Bharua Sumerpur in Hamirpur and one tanker is coming from Dehradun daily, said doctors, on condition of anonymity. They said still the supply was not enough considering the influx of patients. Meanwhile, at Anurag Hospital in Sharda Nagar, an announcement was made for people to take away patients or arrange for oxygen cylinders. The hospital had run out of oxygen and it was not made available. A patient, Ashutosh, was also allegedly assaulted when he registered his protest with the hospital staff. He had to call the police to save himself as the guard allegedly held him at gunpoint. SHO Kalyanpur Vir Singh confirmed the incident said it was being looked into. Oxygen consumption in Covid-19 hospitals has also risen to 53 tonnes in Kanpur. While the city had 12 tonnes in stock, 16 tonnes was made available additionally. Another 25 tonnes was on the way from Chandauli. “At the most it will last less than 24 hours; we need consistent supply,” said a hospital owner whose hospital ran out of essential items for treatment at 3 am on Tuesday. At present, the overall demand was of 8,500 cylinders and the availability was roughly between 5,500, and thus, a shortfall of 3,500 cylinders, said doctors of GSVM Medical College and private hospital owners. In his briefing, the Kanpur DM said that he had deputed magistrates at four oxygen plants to ensure that the oxygen reaches the right places. Similarly, magistrates have been deployed in all Covid-19 hospitals to check ‘black marketing of beds’ so that patients get a bed conveniently. Meanwhile, a private company has been hired to run the integrated command centre more efficiently, and it will take over the centre in a day or two, municipal commissioner Akshay Tripathi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kanpur-gasps-for-oxygen-but-brass-says-all-is-well-101618941338255.html
20-04-2021||Mumbai||Vaccine for all adults: Maharashtra to use development funds||In a special cabinet meeting held on Tuesday, it was decided that the government will use the state’s development funds to procure vaccines, including those which may need to be imported, Maharashtra health minister Rajesh Tope said. This decision comes a day after the Centre allowed all adults to seek a vaccine against Covid-19 starting May 1, although people under the age of 45 will only be able to receive doses once private sales begin or if state governments procure stocks for distribution to these age groups. “We currently have two vaccines, Covishield and Covaxin, but if the need arises, we have also decided to import stock of other vaccines such as Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, and Sputnik from other countries. There will be no dearth of the money for the vaccine, as we have decided to use the development funds to procure vaccine stock,” Tope said after the meeting. Sputnik V made by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, was approved formally on April 13 and its initial doses are expected to be imported. On Monday, pharma giant Johnson & Johnson applied to India’s drug regulator seeking permission to conduct Phase-3 clinical trial of its single-dose Covid-19 vaccine in India as well as for an import license. Last week India said that it would fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines authorised by Western countries and Japan, paving the way for possible imports of Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna shots. None of the companies have announced plans to enter the Indian market under the fast-track routes as yet. In Maharashtra, with 73% of the state population in the age group of above 18 years, more than 90 million people are now eligible for the vaccine. “A lot of the population from the age group of 18-44 years is from the working class and is highly mobile. Thus, they could transmit the virus to others. By vaccinating this age group we could contain the transmission rate at great extent,” Tope said. Maharashtra has around 4200 vaccination centres with a daily inoculation rate of over 350,000 people. The state has so far administered 12.76 million doses on 11.32 million citizens. This means, in a month, 4 million people are being inoculated. At this rate, it would take well over a year to vaccinate the remaining 80 million. The pace needs to be augmented rapidly, a senior official of the public health department said. “We are planning to increase the number of vaccination centres to more than 6000. Our manpower in the government machinery is all set to roll out the drive. There will be large-scale participation of the private sector which will help us in effective implementation of the drive. We expect adequate supply of the vaccine as three more manufacturers are set to enter the market,” Dr TP Lahane, Director of Medical Education and Research, said. Health department officials said that they were expecting guidelines to be issued by the central government soon which would clarify specific questions on cost (how much the Centre will pay, and how much will the state have to spend); supply frequency; and pricing of vaccinations (whether the Centre would put a cap on the price, which Monday’s order said would be decided by the vaccine manufacturers). Apart from this, the state will also have to take a call on which section of the 18-44 age group it would bear the vaccination cost for, as well whether it would need to exercise control over how many vaccine doses can private hospitals buy. This will prove vital to ensure equitable vaccination for all, as well as help the state earmark the outlay for the inoculation. “We have robust infrastructure in Maharashtra with the past experience of implementation of such huge vaccination drive. We are only concerned about the supply of the doses,” said state immunisation officer Dr DN Patil. The state government had been demanding the stock of about 5 million doses per week as it had aimed to double its daily inoculation to 700,000 doses. The official said that though the state has the infrastructure with the capacity of vaccinating 1 million people a day, the health care workers in the government and private sector are fatigued. “We will have to increase the number of vaccination centres to a large number for which additional personnel will be required.” “We are also expecting the price of the vaccine to drop further amid the increase in the demand and one more player (Sputnik) likely to be added in the next few weeks. At the same time, we are also planning to rope in the private sector by allowing the corporate houses to inoculate their employees and social organisations to hold the camps,” said the official. According to the details in the PIB statement issued on Monday, vaccine makers will be able to sell half of what they produce at a price of their choosing to the open market and to state governments. If the vaccines have been imported as ready-to-use, the government will allow all of the stocks to be sold on the open market or to the states. The pricing for any doses sold in the open market will need to be “transparent”, although the government’s release did not indicate a cap. Vaccine manufacturers will still need to supply half the vaccines to the Centre for the state-sponsored component of the vaccination programme, which remains limited to the 45-and-over age group, and health care and front-line workers even after May 1. However, people under the age of 45 will only be able to receive doses once private sales begin or if state governments procure stocks for distribution to these age groups. The Centre said that the allocation of doses to states and Union territories will be on the basis of their active case load and their performance in vaccinating people, while wastage will be taken into effect as criteria that can affect a state negatively when doses are being distributed by Centre. “We never have stock for more than 3-4 days. We have been planning to ramp up the daily inoculation to 6-7 lakh people, but the short supply of the doses is causing a hindrance. Now the Centre has announced to allow the state to procure the stock directly from the manufacturers, but it remains to be seen if the manufacturers have the capacity of the production,” said another official from the health department. Both, Covishield and Covaxin are manufactured in India, by Serum Institute of India and Bharat Biotech respectively. An executive of SII said that the company would be able to ramp up production from the current 60 million doses a month to 110 million doses by June. The Centre on Monday agreed to pay SII ₹3000 crore advance payment of two months for vaccines. J&J and Novavax already have licensed Indian companies (J&J has authorised Biological E and Novavax has authorised Serum Institute of India) to produce millions of doses. Tope said that the United Kingdom vaccinated 60% of its population within three months of the lockdown and it has helped it in bringing down the positivity and mortality rate drastically. He said that the Central government should continue to bear the financial burden for the people above 45 years. “The vaccine companies overwhelmed with the orders from other countries and the waiting period for the delivery is long. The Maharashtra government wants to register its orders for Pfizer, Moderna vaccines in advance,” a health department official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/vaccine-for-all-adults-maharashtra-to-use-development-funds-101618940738240.html
20-04-2021||Lucknow||'Health services have collapsed': Akhilesh Yadav on Covid-19 surge in UP||With Uttar Pradesh battling a surge in Covid-19 cases, Samajwadi Party chief Akhilesh Yadav on Tuesday claimed that health services in the state have "collapsed" and the situation is worse in villages as compared to cities.Taking a dig at the state government for converting hospitals and other buildings built by the erstwhile SP dispensation into Covid-19 facilities, Yadav said Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath is "allergic" to the work carried out by his party during its regime.Uttar Pradesh has registered a record increase in Covid-19 cases on five of the last seven days.The state's Covid-19 case count stands at 9,09,405 while 10,159 people have succumbed to the disease so far, according to official data."Health services in the state have collapsed," Yadav said in a statement issued here.The situation is bad not only in cities, it is worse in villages, where there is no one to hear the voice of the poor villagers, he claimed.Yadav further said, "The CM, who is allergic to the work carried out during the SP's regime, is playing with the lives of the people."The CM did not care about improving the health services. The SP had put forth this demand. But now as the situation is worsening, the government has decided to convert cancer hospital, Haj House, Awadh Shilpgram built during the SP's regime into Covid centres, he said."The priority of the BJP government and its CM is to be in power and win elections without caring about the spread of coronavirus even at his rallies. There is no value of people's lives for the BJP," he added.Yadav alleged that the BJP government has been befooling people for the last four years."Due to the lack of coordination among administrative officers, the situation is worsening day by day," he claimed.In another statement, Leader of Opposition in the state assembly and senior SP leader Ram Govind Chowdhury demanded the withdrawal of a state government order to impose a fine of ₹10,000 on those found without masks for a second time."This is a reminder of the British era and the CM should immediately roll back his decision. The Yogi government has handed over the state to vultures who are targeting the common man by realising fines and black marketing essential commodities," he said.The party whose PM and CM attended rallies without wearing masks do not have the moral right to penalise the common man for it, Chowdhury said, referring to Modi and Adityanath addressing public meetings in states where assembly elections are underway.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/health-services-have-collapsed-akhilesh-yadav-on-covid-19-surge-in-up-101618927118842.html

Lucknow based National Botanical Research Institute (NBRI), Central Drug Research Institute (CDRI), Birbal Sahani Institute of Paleosciences (BSIP) and Indian Institute of Toxicology Research (IITR) are planning to set up sample collection units in the city. “We are planning to begin Covid-19 sample collection as covid cases are increasing. Mass testing is one of the major aspects of controlling the spread of Covid-19 infection and we want to assist the health infrastructure of the state government,” said NBRI director Dr SK Barik. The move is in keeping with the state government’s decision to boost testing following the alarming surge in Covid-19 cases. The state recorded nearly 30,000 new cases on Tuesday. Of these, about 5000 cases were reported from state capital itself. At present majority of sample collection is being done by King George’s Medical University (KGMU) and Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences (SGPGI) in Lucknow, beside some private labs. Samples collected at government centres are then sent to these research institutes for testing. If research institutes begin samples collection for testing, an additional 1500 to 1700 Covid-19 samples could be tested each day. “Our staff is equipped to handle Covid-19 samples. We are in talks with the local administration about places where sample collection can be done. Once it is finalised we will be in position to begin sample collection within 72 hours,” said CDRI director Dr Tapas Kundu.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/research-institutes-to-help-covid-testing-sample-collection-in-lucknow-101618938638086.html

While the state’s seven-day doubling period was 33.35 days, the national average was 59.25 days. Jharkhand’s recovery rate was 80.87% against the national 86%.Jharkhand, which logged 124,201 cases till March 31 this year, added 43,034 new cases in last 19 days with an average daily detection of around 2,265 cases.The state reported its highest-ever single-day spike recently on Monday after discovering 4,290 cases, that pushed the tally of active cases to over the 30,000-mark.Jharkhand has as many as 30,477 active cases, of which Ranchi contributed 11,726 active cases alone.However, the district has a total of 2,995 beds comprising isolation beds, oxygen-supported beds, ICU and ventilator beds in both government and private sectors.The rising number of cases in the state has put health care and services in crisis causing much trouble to patients, with many of them dying in last 10 days allegedly for want of adequate treatment.The state was also facing acute shortage of life-saving drugs, particularly Remdesivir injection meant for Covid-19 treatment.Taking seriously the pressing need of Remdesivir, chief minister Hemant Soren earlier wrote to Union minister of chemicals and fertilizers DV Sadananda Gowda, seeking permission to import 50,000 vials of the said medicine worth one million dollars from Bangladesh-based pharmaceutical company BEXIMCO.Soren stated, “...The precariousness of the situation will be evident from the fact that against the total order of 76,640 vials, Jharkhand has received only 8,038 vials of Remdesivir injection in the last fortnight, leading to the medicine not being administered to many needy patients. Since we could not get this medicine as per our requirement from Indian manufacturers, we explored international markets and obtained a quotation from BEXIMCO, Bangladesh.”Many Jharkhand parliamentarians and legislators have released constituency funds for meeting the growing demand of oxygen cylinders and medicines.Recently on Monday, Union minister Arjun Munda released ₹50 lakh from his constituency fund for meeting the urgent requirement of medical oxygen in his Khunti constituency.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/ranchi-news/states-case-growth-rate-nearly-double-than-national-average-101618937498600.html

The new treatment regime would stipulate early scanning of lungs and application of emergency drugs.The health department is likely to issue a fresh set of standard operation protocol very soon. Along with it, the district authorities have been asked to refurbish all health centres across the state with necessary infrastructure so that treatment of Covid-infected patients could be undertaken at the lower level after proper diagnostics.Chief minister Nitish Kumar had already directed the officials of health department to ramp up RT-PCR test and drastically curtail the reporting time so that fatalities could be cut significantly. The instruction was given by the CM after the death of former minister Mewalal Chaudhary, who died due to Covid for want of timely diagnosis of the disease.At the meeting that was held in virtual mode and was attended by development commissioner Amir Subhani, additional chief secretary (panchayati raj) Amrit Lal Meena, principal secretary (health) Pratyay Amrit, director general of police SK Singhal and divisional commissioners, district magistrates and superintendents of police (SPs), DMs were directed to arrange required medical facilities like oxymeters, basic path lab, medicines and PPE kits at the PHCs, community health centres, subdivisional and district hospitals so that Covid patients could be treated there.“Only critically sick persons, who required critical care, shall be allowed admission in the premier hospitals like AIIMS, PMCH, NMCH, IGIMS, etc,” said the CM’s principal secretary. The task force on oxygen supply has been directed to stay in touch with the nearest refilling plants at Bokaro, Jamshedpur, Durgapur, etc, to streamline supply of liquid oxygen. Currently, three private plants in Patna, which generate oxygen from the air and refill up to 50 cylinders per hour, have been told to stay operational round-the-clock. Another oxygen plant set up in Begusarai has also be operationalised, while plants attached with premier hospitals have also be told to optimize their production.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/bihar-looks-for-fresh-treatment-protocol-to-catch-up-with-virus-101618937257940.html
20-04-2021||Lucknow||AAP versus UP govt over migrants workers’ exodus from Delhi||The exodus of migrant workers from Delhi after chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement of a six-day curfew has sparked A war of words between the Uttar Pradesh government and the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP). Siddharth Nath Singh, UP government spokesperson and MSME minister, alleged that the Delhi government had meted out step-motherly treatment to migrant workers belonging to UP and Bihar. “To hide the failure of his government, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal has announced a six-day lockdown in the national capital in haste,” he said. “The Delhi government failed to provide beds, hospitals and other facilities to Covid patients and when health services collapsed, they announced lockdown without any preparations,” said Singh. “The migrants were dumped on the Delhi-UP border on Monday night. The hapless people were left to their fate. Earlier too during the nationwide lockdown in March last year, the Delhi government had dumped the migrant workers,” he added. To send the migrants workers home, the UP government acted swiftly. On the direction of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, fleets of government and private buses were sent to Anand Vihar and Kaushambi bus stations located on Delhi border, said the minister. “Over one lakh migrant workers were sent home on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday,” said Singh. Also read: ‘Lockdown should be last resort’ - PM Modi urges states in address to nationCountering the statement of the UP minister, AAP’s Uttar Pradesh spokesperson Vaibhav Maheshwari said, “Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said lockdown has been imposed for a small period to break the Covid infection chain.” “In a video message, he also appealed to migrants workers to stay in Delhi as the state government was arranging for their food and shelter. The Delhi government is providing all facilities to migrants including medical, food and lodging,” he added. Maheshwari said the UP government failed to provide basic facilities to Covid-19 patients across the state and a large number of them was not getting beds and oxygen in hospitals. “The UP government has failed in Covid management whereas the Delhi government is working sensitively to provide medical facilities to Covid patients,” he said. A state government official said the buses ferrying migrants from the Delhi border had been sent to all districts. Around 1,400 buses left the Anand Vihar and Kaushambi bus stations on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday with migrants workers heading home in UP. The magistrates of all 75 districts were directed to screen migrants workers and those with Covid symptoms will stay in quarantine facilities set up by the government or in home isolation. Village surveillance committees will maintain a vigil on migrant workers and monitor their health conditions. According to the guidelines issued by the state government, migrants coming from other states will have to stay in seven days’ home quarantine even if they do not have Covid-19 symptoms, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/lucknow-news/app-versus-up-govt-over-migrants-workers-exodus-from-delhi-101618936958769.html

The hospital authorities said another patient on ventilator had to be shifted to different facility. According to doctors at Yog Multispecialty Hospital, the patient died as he was in critical condition. While he was critical, the hospital also faced lack of adequate oxygen supply, which was almost bottoming out when the administration, by the evening, sent 32 cylinders to the hospital. “For the past two days, we have been struggling due to lack of liquid oxygen. Currently, there are 11 patients on ventilators at our hospital. We have only an hour’s supply left,” Dr Abhijeet Darak had said on Tuesday afternoon, hours before his facility received 32 cylinders. Within an hour, Pune district collector Rajesh Deshmukh organised 10 cylinders, even as the hospital had sought 20. “We have ensured adequate oxygen supply to Yog hospital. We are trying to restore it to other hospitals as well I am currently discussing same with Chief Secretary,” said District Collector Rajesh Deshmukh while refusing to speak further citing ongoing meeting. The hospital has 14 ICU beds and 23 oxygen beds with an hourly oxygen need of seven cylinders, said Darak. The district collector has assured supply of 20 oxygen cylinders, but the hospital administration is not aware of when will it reach them. “If those cylinders reach, they can last for another three to four hours,” Darak said.In merely 10 days, the number of patients on oxygen support has increased by 1,208 in Pune city. There has been an exponential growth in the number of critical patients as well. According to the daily Covid report issued by Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC), on April 9, there were 4,662 patients who were on oxygen support. The number reached 5,870 on April 18.

The two men were identified as Pattaram Kesaramji Devasi (33), a resident of Bhagwanagar in Wakad; Rakeshkumar Bastiram Vaishnav (25), a resident of Dhankawadi in Pune. These two are travel agents who provide bus tickets near the Shani temple along the highway. “They charged ₹600 per test.

While the two have been remanded to two days in police custody, the police are on the lookout for two others who are suspected to have conducted the forgery part and sent soft copies of forged reports through WhatsApp. The tests were never conducted, and the logo of the laboratories was misused, according to the police and the labs. This is the second such case that has been brought to light in the past three days in Pune. The police are now investigating how long these men had been indulging in the forgery. On Sunday, the Pune city police had also arrested two technicians who were found to have forged reports of GenePath labs located on JM Road. “Our each and every report is secured by two different encrypted QR code algorithms, by scanning this QR code patient name and our lab name appears. Also, we received a call from Hinjewadi police station for the same. We found those reports were fake without QR code and were not provided by our lab and the same has been informed to police authorities,” said Mahesh Nade, operation manager of Lifenity lab in Pune.

We stated that Wagholi is one of the biggest and richest gram panchayats among the 23 villages that are proposed to be merged due to huge urbanisation. We paid taxes to the Pune Metropolitan Regional Authority (PMRDA). So, post-merger, the PMC should take a share of Wagholi village’s tax from PMRDA and utilise it to build infrastructure in Wagholi. We also demanded to give drinking water from Bhama-Askhed dam to Wagholi and hand over PMRDA water scheme to PMC.” Pradeep Thengal, deputy commissioner, municipal administration, Pune division, said, “Most of the villagers demanded to provide basic infrastructure, and not put reservation on farmlands, provide drinking water and gradually increase property tax.

After a few years, some of them want to complete their course and get the degree, but till then a new syllabus takes over and things are completely changed. Mahesh Kakade, SPPU’s director of the board of examination and evaluation said, “The SPPU academic council has decided to give a similar opportunity to students before academic year 2016-17 to appear for the examination if they want. Now, they can take new subjects and appear for the exams and complete their pending graduate or post graduate degree courses.”In order to enforce this decision, new changes have been made by SPPU’s senior officials. Students who left college before the academic year 2016-17 can take subjects of the current syllabus for their remaining degree course, appear for the examination and get the degree completed. Earlier, there was no option for such students to appear for the exams with a previous syllabus. A decision was taken by the SPPU’s academic council that students with old syllabus can now appear for the exams with new subjects. It will benefit thousands of students who can again join back their education and complete their degree. Welcoming this decision of SPPU, Kedar Mane who had left his engineering degree course way back in 2010 said, “I left my mechanical engineering degree course in the last year due to some personal family issues. I had to work to earn money for my family and it was not possible for me to continue education and job at one time.

20-04-2021||Pune||150 students caught cheating during SPPU online exams||The Savitribai Phule Pune University (SPPU) examination department has caught a total of 150 students cheating while appearing for the online first-semester exams. As a follow-up action, these students have now been told to appear before the SPPU’s grievances addressal committee. It’s a message SPPU wants to send that the university is vigilant against cheating despite the exams attempted remotely via the internet. The first semester examination is being held online for students from first to last year of all courses and started from April 10. The exam is conducted of 50 marks with multiple-choice questions (MCQ) method in online mode. SPPU’s own Edutech foundation company is conducting this exam. Students from Pune, Nashik and Ahmednagar district daily appear for the exams for over 3,700 subjects to be held throughout this examination period. From the last four days, the daily number of students appearing for the exams is over 1 lakh. SPPU is using an online ‘proctored test’ method to conduct the examinations for its courses. Through this method, students are able to give the exams from anywhere by using smartphones, tablet, laptop or desktop computers and even from the internet cyber cafes. SPPU is the first government university in the state to use this method for exams. Due to Covid-19 pandemic as students would not be able to come physically to university campus to give the entrance exams, a decision was taken to conduct exams through this method which is prominently used by IITs in the country “In this method when a student logs in to give the exam through smartphone, laptop or tablet, all the minute movements of the students are captured and monitored by the system. If a student is doing cheating or found doing any suspicious thing he/she is given warning three times. If the student continues their act then the student is disqualified from the exam.” said Mahesh Kakade, SPPU’s director of the board of examination and evaluation. “Until now we have caught 150 students cheating through this method and they are going to appear before SPPU’s grievances addressal committee. Though our exams are conducted online, but students are not at all allowed to do cheating in the exams.” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/150-students-caught-cheating-during-sppu-online-exams-101618934257960.html

Dr Chandragupta said the police had also started a massive exercise to trace at least 900 patients who bought fake doses over the last six months or so.The Mysuru police stumbled upon the racket when it started investigating possible instances of people selling Remdesivir on the black market. There have been multiple reports of shortage of Remdesivir vials in Karnataka due to the surge in coronavirus cases. According to medical practitioners, the drug which costs between ₹1,000 to ₹5,000 was being sold for upto ₹40,000 by unscrupulous people.One of the leads that the investigators received led them to a nurse working in a private hospital in Mysuru’s Vidhya Nagar locality, identified by the police as Girish.“We arrested him after sending a decoy (customer) to purchase the vials,” the Mysuru police commissioner Dr Chandragupta said. Girish had sold the vial to the decoy customer at the maximum retail price though he sold the medicine on the black market.Dr Chandragupta said when they tried to ascertain the source of his supply, he was evasive. “When we continued to question him about his supply, he claimed that he was selling fake medicine,” he said.Many vials labelled as Remdesivir, but filled with a mix of paracetamol and saline solution have been seized during the raids that followed.According to the national treatment protocol, Remdesivir is one of the investigational drugs approved for use in treating hospitalized Covid-19 patients. The drug has been in huge demand after the surge in Covid-19 cases; most chemists have run out of stocks due to its indiscriminate use by patients even though several experts contend that it is largely ineffective in the treatment of the viral disease. According to the Mysuru police, Girish, who had been selling fake doses of Remdesivir for months, procured used bottles of the medicine from a couple and filled it with saline solution. The couple who supplied the used vials and two medical representatives who helped Girish sell the fake does have also been arrested.Police said Girish has sold at least 900-1,000 vials to customers in Mysuru, Bengaluru and other places. Chandragupta said they were trying to trace the people who bought the fake doses. “We are collecting information from the accused and we will track down the patients who have taken medicines. Since he has been doing this since 2020 and he was selling the fake medicine at MRP (maximum retail price), there were a lot of customers,” the commissioner added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/bengaluru-news/they-sold-saline-in-remdesivir-vials-to-900-desperate-covid-patients-arrested-101618933598400.html

20-04-2021||Patna||‘Govt working overtime to smoothen oxygen supply, Remdesivir orders placed’: Bihar health minister||Amid a shortage of medical oxygen and Remdesivir anti-viral drug reported from various parts of Bihar, including capital city Patna, state health minister Mangal Pandey on Monday said efforts were underway to ensure adequate supplies and the situation is being monitored daily.“We are increasing the supply of oxygen but the situation is still not such that the private hospitals could keep stock. Our priority is to ensure regular daily supply. Some of the hospitals want to keep stock but that is not possible at present as the demand is growing everywhere in the country. No forecasts can be made about the pandemic which has stumped us all,” said Pandey.The minister said that three tankers of liquid oxygen had arrived on Saturday, followed by five on Sunday and seven are likely to arrive by Monday evening. He said the administration is expecting a further increase in the demand in the days to come.“There is no fixed requirement at present. A requirement of a patient for eight litres of oxygen could drop to four litres or increase to 16 litres from morning to evening. The number of patients in hospitals also varies. But we are doing everything possible to ensure the supply of oxygen. The oxygen plants at the PMCH, NMCH and DMCH are also functional but they too have a limited capacity of 40-50 cylinders,” he added.The minister said that efforts were also underway to ensure the supply of Remdesivir. “I have also urged Union chemical and fertilizer minister Mansukh Mandaviya for some extra procurement for Bihar and he has assured all help. I am also directly in touch with the companies producing Remdesivir. The centre has already capped the price, stopped export and given permission for doubling production. All this will work,” he added.The minister said that 1,200 vials of Remdesivir have been received while the government has already ordered 50,000 more through the Bihar medical services and infrastructure corporation Limited (BMSICL). “The supplies are also regulated as it is provided only on doctors’ prescription and Aadhaar Card,” he added, ruling out any possibility of black marketing due to limited and regulated supply.The acting superintendent of the Nalanda Medical College Hospital (NMCH), Dr Vinod Kumar Singh, wrote to the health department last week to relieve him of the additional charge due to a shortage of oxygen cylinders in the state’s first dedicated Covid hospital. However, since then, the situation has improved at the NMCH, which now plans to increase the number of beds.While Singh wrote about the oxygen shortage, many other hospitals in the state capital are battling a huge shortage of oxygen and ventilators. Many private hospitals in Patna also discharged patients due to lack of oxygen or pasted notice that they could discharge patients if the stocks don’t arrive in time. Those who can afford are also taking patients to Delhi by air ambulance.Many suppliers of oxygen cylinders are also at their wit’s end, as those taking cylinders are not returning. “We were providing oxygen cylinders to the needy on a humanitarian basis.

We cannot supply to others,” said Sanjeev Deora of Marwari Seva Samiti.One of the biggest private hospitals in Patna, Ruban Hospital, is also facing the heat with a huge rush of patients. “We increased our capacity to 160 beds but we have 175 patients. For oxygen supply, the administration had been helping us but we lack ventilators as most of the patients reach here in critical condition. We have just 40.

Vaccine manufacturers will also be allowed to sell the vaccine in the open market. Currently, only citizens above the age of 45 years and who have a comorbid condition, can get the vaccine.The Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) has asked the Maharashtra government for permission to allow it to purchase the vaccines directly from manufacturers. In Pune, the Serum Institute of India is manufacturing the Oxford-AtraZeneca vaccine, Covishield. The vaccine is mostly being administered in the country. PMC claims that if the state allows it to purchase the vaccine directly from the firms, it will cover the entire Pune population by the end of July this year. Ganesh Bidkar, PMC’s leader of the house, said, “We have written a letter to chief minister Uddhav Thackeray and asked the government’s permission to procure the vaccine directly. PMC will bear the cost. Already, PMC has chalked out a plan for a massive vaccination drive.” On Monday, Pune divisional Commissioner Saurabh Rao had said, the administration has already undertaken “Mission 100 days” to inoculate everyone above the age of 18 by June 15, as the city and rural parts of the region battle a massive spike in the Covid-19 infection. “With the Centre’s decision and various stakeholders in Pune who are very aggressive, we are hoping to vaccinate all above the age of 18 before 100 days is up. This will be possible with the help of state government and local sponsors,” Rao had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/pmc-seeks-state-govt-permission-to-directly-purchase-vaccines-from-manufacturers-101618926577492.html

The hapless people were left to their fate. Earlier too during the nationwide lockdown in March last year, the Delhi government had dumped the migrant workers,” he added.To send the hapless migrants home, the UP government acted swiftly. On direction of chief minister Yogi Adityanath, fleets of government and private buses were sent to Anand Vihar and Kaushambi bus stations located on Delhi border, said the minister. “Over one lakh migrants were sent home on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday,” said Singh.Countering the statement of the UP minister, AAP (Uttar Pradesh unit) spokesperson Vaibhav Maheshwari said: “While announcing the six-day curfew, Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had said lockdown has been imposed for a small period to break the Covid infection chain.” “In a video message, he also appealed to migrants workers to stay in Delhi as the state government was arranging for their food and shelter. The Delhi government is providing all facilities to migrants including medical, food and lodging,” he added.Maheshwari said the UP government failed to provide basic facilities to Covid patients across the state and large number of them was not getting beds and oxygen in hospitals. “The UP government has failed in Covid management whereas the Delhi government is working in a sensitive manner to provide medical facilities to Covid patients,” he said.A state government officer said the buses ferrying migrants from the Delhi border had been sent to all districts. Around 1,400 buses left the Anand Vihar and Kaushambi bus stations on the intervening night of Monday and Tuesday with migrants workers heading home in UP. The DMs of all 75 districts were directed to screen migrants. those with Covid symptoms will stay in quarantine facilities set up by the government or in home isolation. Village surveillance committees will maintain vigil on migrants and monitor their health conditions. According to the guidelines issued by the state government, migrants coming from other states will have to stay in seven days’ home quarantine, even if they do not have Covid symptoms, he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/up-govt-aap-in-war-of-words-over-migrants-exodus-from-delhi-101618923097372.html

Taking it to Twitter, Baijal assured the migrant workers that the Delhi government will take care of all their requirements during the ongoing Covid-19 crisis.“All necessary arrangements are being made for you (migrant workers). You run Delhi through with your tireless hard work and the city belongs to you,” he wrote on the microblogging siteEarlier in the day, Baijal had chaired an emergency meeting with chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and chief secretary Vijay Kumar Dev to take stock of the situation. He directed Kejriwal and Dev to take all steps possible to prevent a reverse migration. The chief minister is currently under self-isolation after his wife Sunita Kejriwal tested positive for Covid-19 on Tuesday.मेरी दिल्ली के सभी प्रवासी नागरिकों से अपील है कि आप घबराहट में दिल्ली छोड़ कर ना जायें।मैं आपको भरोसा दिलाता हूँ कि कोरोना आपदा की इस स्थिति के दौरान सरकार आपकी सभी जरूरतों का ख्याल रखेगी।आपके लिए सभी आवश्यक इंतज़ाम सुनिश्चित किए जा रहे हैं।The Delhi L-G also appointed the principal secretary (home) and the special commissioners as ‘nodal officers’ to handle the overall situation.The government will open shelter homes and also provide free food to migrants in order to ensure they do not leave the city during the period when a lockdown is in place, officials told Hindustan Times on Tuesday.

20-04-2021||Pune||Sumitra Bhave: A multi-talented creative being who had power to bring about change||It’s very difficult for me today to take my character out of the joint identity Sumitra Bhave and I shared. She is not with us anymore, but she is with me in spirit. I think it is my responsibility to take her legacy forward through my life and film-making. As a person, I remember her as through multiple personalities - an artiste on one hand and a social scientist on the other. She was also an entrepreneur, leader, manager, and a humble activist immersed in social movements. She was also a free spirit going beyond any restrictions. One could find all the contradictions within her; a strong feminist who forever stood for women’s rights. At the same time, she was a simple human being and a compassionate woman caring for everyone. She would throw away all the ‘isms’ when it came to empathy and human values. She was an interesting, multi-faceted, multi-talented personality with layers of possibilities. I always feel that she could have been many persons at the same time. Had she pursued her career as a newsreader in All India Radio (AIR) in Delhi, she would have become director general and possibly changed the face of television. But then, she also wanted to become a painter and go to Paris. Possibly, she would have been a new age Amrita Shergil for us. She was a poet too and writers like Bhalchandra Nemade, Kavi Grace, loved her poetry in her college days. Perhaps we could have got a philosophical poet in her like Arun Kolhatkar. When social activist Medha Patkar worked with Sumitra in the Mumbai slums and on the children’s family programme during her work at a non-profit, the later was a boss. Had she continued, Sumitra probably would have been another Medha Patkar. She studied kathak dance under Rohini Bhate’s guidance. She could possibly have been a dancer or established a Kalagram like Protima Bedi, teaching various styles of dance to students. She chose to become a filmmaker and brought all these elements in her work. She was a social reformer and idolised persons like Gopal Ganesh Agarkar and Mahatma Phule and learnt how they fought to change the society and the mindset of people. The social reformer in her and all her ideas, converted into her filmmaking which was complex, where she wrote her own scripts. We directed films together to bring these ideas on screen. Today, I look at myself as her humble disciple, a person who was fortunate to be with her right since the age of 17, till her last breadth, and possibly even after that. I have learnt about conviction in filmmaking and her compassionate and humane attitude towards people and society helped me be what I am today. I will not just cherish my memories with her, but would try and find her in my own self and take it forward; take her crusade forward. Honestly, I would want to emulate her.---Filmmaker Sunil Sukthankar, along with Sumitra Bhave, together made various landmark films, some of national award winners.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/sumitra-bhave-a-multi-talented-creative-being-who-had-power-to-bring-about-change-101618918838207.html
20-04-2021||Patna||Bihar unveils interest-free incentive scheme to promote women entrepreneurs||Bihar government on Monday cleared the release of ₹200 crore under the Mukhyamantri Mahila Udyami Yojana, a scheme to encourage entrepreneurship among women through cash subsidies and interest-free loans, each up to ₹5 lakh, for starting a business. This was part of Nitish Kumar’s chief pre-poll promises, popularised as Seven Resolves part-2, said state officials.Two other similar schemes were also approved by the state cabinet chaired by chief minister Nitish Kumar on Tuesday, which aim to encourage entrepreneurship among the scheduled castes/scheduled tribes and extremely backward classes and also amongst the young population of all castes. The state cabinet also approved the release of ₹400 crore for these schemes on the same day. The beneficiaries of the three schemes, except the women and those from the SC/ST category, will be charged token 1% interest on the loans provided. All the beneficiaries are deemed to pay back the loan in 84 equal monthly instalments after one year of the cash transfer, said officials. The three schemes were among the nine proposals of different departments, which were approved by the cabinet.Additional chief secretary, industries, Brijesh Mehrotra said the cash incentive will be doled out in two instalments in the current fiscal depending on the business needs and the old practice of releasing at least three instalments will be discontinued. The candidates will get three months to apply for the scheme possibly after May 15.Social analyst Tarkeshwar Ojha said the Nitish Kumar government was generous with innovating schemes but they didn’t have the desired impact since doing business in the state was not easy owing to “deterioration in law and order, high cost of land and bureaucratic red-tape”.Akhilesh Kumar, an automobile dealer says there were only 240 women among the 21,112 applicants, who applied for incentive under the CM’s rural transport scheme launched in 2020. He feared women may not again participate in huge numbers in the new scheme. “Schemes for other classes might be lapped up in the job-scarce state like Bihar,” he added.Media in-charge of Bihar Pradesh Congress Committee (BPCC) Rajesh Rathore alleged that the government had failed miserably in keeping up its employment-generation promises. “What happened to the CM’s call to provide jobs to all migrants during their return last year? They had to leave the state... Bihar would have developed a lot, had the government been sincere in executing even 5% of the cabinet decisions,” claimed the Congress leader.Janata Dal (Unite) leader and former minister Neeraj Kumar, however, dismissed the allegations and stated that Nitish Kumar was committed to “honest implementation” of the project. “And seven resolves are the schemes that the CM is committed to implement. He has been monitoring their implementation personally,” he said.In other important decisions taken on Tuesday, the cabinet raised the state contingency fund to ₹8,732.10 crore from the existing limit of ₹350 crore. The transport department’s proposal to incentivise the retailers of vehicles for selling registration numbers of choice also got its approval.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/patna-news/bihar-unveils-interest-free-incentive-scheme-to-promote-women-entrepreneurship-101618918777818.html

Additionally, the committee found that the water improved further downstream near Mathura. But since the lockdown was lifted in a phased manner from June 1, the clarity of the Yamuna water has also gone down during the lockdown period.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/thin-layer-of-toxic-foam-floats-near-yamuna-river-bank-in-delhi-101618913996497.html

With the sharp rise in Covid cases in the state, amid Kumbh mela that attracted millions of devotees, the state government has imposed a night curfew from 9pm to 5am in all districts.In all, five samples were sent by Doon Government Hospital to National Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) in Delhi in March. The hospital got the result a few days ago which confirmed the presence of the double mutant Covid-19 virus in three samples and the UK strain in one. Confirming the development, Dr Deepak Juyal of the virology department in the hospital said, “The hospital had sent samples to detect the presence of the new strains in the samples collected in Dehradun.

But, the death rate is less. The patients infected from this virus are responding well to the treatment given by doctors,” he said. However, he said, “People need to take precautions, including wearing of masks, social distancing and avoiding crowded places. There should be no complacency in this as it could prove costly.”Uttarakhand has reported 126,193 Covid-19 cases since the outbreak last year. Of these, 102,899 have been treated.

Delhi HC during hearing on Covid-19||The Delhi high court on Tuesday expressed serious concerns about wastage of Covid-19 vaccines, and stressed on the need to vaccinate more and more people. The court's observations came during a hearing on a petition filed by a lawyer Rakesh Malhotra seeking directions from the court to ramp up tests and take immediate measures to contain the grim Covid situation in the national capital.Citing news reports, the bench of justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said, "The number of vaccines have been wasted is 44 lakh out of 10 crore vaccine. The vials have to be consumed once it has to be opened. Now the once which are not used are being wasted.""Why are we wasting even one shot, why can't we deal with it?" the bench further said.The judges also suggested creating a mobile application consisting of a list of people who can be vaccinated. "Give it to people willing to take it. Those drops which can save the lives, are being wasted," said the court.Talking about the dip in vaccination numbers, the court said, "If we wait for 10 days, the problem may persist. We are losing on valuable and young lives. The pandemic does not discriminate. Whomsoever needs vaccines, give them. Everyone needs vaccination."According to Hindustan Times' vaccine tracker, nearly 5 per cent vaccines are wasted in the national capital.In a meeting with the chief ministers earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that a major part of Covid-19 management is to prevent vaccine wastage and appealed to the youth of the country to help people above 45 to get vaccinated.The Prime Minister said the efforts are being made to improve the maximum manufacturing facility of the vaccine. Meanwhile, the development of new vaccines is also underway, he added.Days after that, Russia's Sputnik V received the approval from India's drug regulator for emergency use during Covid-19 crisis. It will now be used along with Covishield and Covaxin being used in the country for inoculating people as part of nationwide vaccination drive launched on January 16.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/why-are-we-wasting-even-one-vaccine-shot-delhi-hc-during-hearing-on-covid19-101618915257368.html

20-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai Police seize 2,200 vials of Remdesivir from exporters||The Mumbai police seized 2,200 vials of Remdesivir injection from the premises of two exporters located in Andheri and New Marine Lines area on Monday. Remdesivir is used to treat serious Covid-19 patients and has been in short supply in Maharashtra, leading to a political tug of war between the state and the Centre. The Central government last week banned Remdesivir’s export till the time the domestic situation improves.Deputy commissioner of police (operation) Chaitanya Siriprolu said that teams from Mumbai Police and Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) jointly raided two locations in the city on Monday after learning that certain exporters were hiding stocks of the crucial drug despite a direction by the government to declare their stocks for domestic use.2000 vials of the injection were recovered at one exporter’s location in Marol, Andheri East, which belongs to a pharmaceutical company. These 2000 vials were taken into possession by FDA for use/distribution in hospitals, he said.Another 200 vials of Remdesivir were recovered at another exporter’s location in the New Marine Lines area. These too were taken into possession by the FDA.“These 2,200 Remdesivir vials were produced for export but were kept stocked by the exporters as there is a ban on the export of Remdesivir. FDA officials are following due procedure to make these vials available to hospitals,” said Siriprolu, who is also the spokesperson for the Mumbai Police.Officials aware of the developments said the investigators are checking if the seized vials of Remdesivir were linked to Daman-based Bruck Pharma, an exporter of the drug at the centre of a recent political controversy, involving Mumbai police and senior BJP leader and former Maharashtra chief minister Devendra Fadnavis.Fadnavis had accused Maharashtra government of cheap politics and alleged that Mumbai police was harassing a Bruck Pharma executive over suspicion that it was hiding thousands of vials of the drug after its export was banned. Fadnavis claimed that the harassment took place at a time when the company was given permission to supply the stocked medicine to Maharashtra.The ruling coalition parties alleged in response that Fadnavis was more concerned about the pharma company than the residents of the state.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-seize-2-200-vials-of-remdesivir-from-exporters-101618910617644.html

20-04-2021||Delhi||Three-fold increase in Covid beds in Delhi since April 3: Sisodia||Delhi’s deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia on Tuesday said there has been a three-fold increase in total Covid-19 beds across hospitals in the city since April 3, and around 2,700 more beds will be added within the next six days, even as he expressed concerns about the increase in Covid-19 cases. “The Covid-19 situation in the city is alarming. We are currently recording around 25,000 new cases a day. Going by the rate of increase in cases, it looks like the number of daily cases will soon rise to 28,000 -30,000. In the last 4-5 days, we have been working round-the-clock on providing hospital beds to Covid-19 patients. We are also increasing Covid-19 beds. On April 3, we had 6,071 beds in the city. As of now, we have 19,101 beds. We have increased beds by three times on a war footing in such a short time,” said Sisodia, who is also Delhi’s nodal minister for Covid-19 management and inter-ministerial coordination, in a video press briefing.Also Read | Kejriwal says will work with MCDs to defeat Covid, blame game begins soon afterHis comments came amid concerns regarding the rate at which hospital beds are getting occupied in the city. As on Tuesday noon, government records said there were 19,124 Covid-19 beds in the city, of which 16,661 (87.12%) were occupied, and there were only 32 ICU beds left in the city – out of a total of 4,447.“On Monday, the DRDO facility opened and all 250 beds got occupied within four hours. In that centre, 250 more beds are awaited. The city’s total Covid-19 bed capacity will increase by around 2,700 in the next 5-6 days,” said Sisodia.He named several Delhi government hospitals -- Burari hospital, Ambedkar Nagar hospital, DDU hospital, Acharya Bhikshu hospital, Raja Harishchandra Hospital and Lok Nayak hospital -- which are likely to witness augmentation of Covid-19 beds capacity in the coming days.On Monday, HT reported that the health department of the Delhi government had issued an order directing the 11 Delhi government-run Covid-19 hospitals to increase their total ward beds by 1,979 and ICU beds by 915. The names of the hospitals cited by Sisodia were mentioned in the order.Addressing concerns over the burden on the healthcare infrastructure, Sisodia said, “We appeal to people not to panic. Don’t rush to hospital on being diagnosed Covid-19 positive. If severe symptoms surface, then consult a doctor and consider checking for hospital availability on the app (Delhi government’s mobile application) and only then go to hospital. Running from one hospital to another exhausts the patients and also burdens the hospitals.”“Also, we have received a large number of complaints from patient attendants that doctors are not monitoring patients regularly. But it is not so. Please understand that you cannot identify doctors clad in PPE kits. So please don’t have such wrong perceptions. Doctors are doing their best and are completely invested in their work, risking their own lives.”In another press briefing, Delhi health minister Satyendar Jain also addressed the issue of Covid beds and said, “Nearly 1,000 to 1,500 beds have been increased in the city each day. There were just about 6,000 Covid-19 beds as on April 8, which has now been tripled to over 18,000 beds. But, there has been an unprecedented increase in the number of cases.” He said that the makeshift facility at Radha Soami Satsang Beas is likely to open up on Tuesday, with 600 beds added on Monday at the Commonwealth games village facility. On being asked about patients with severe infection being refused admission without an RT-PCR positive report, the minister said, “There is a shortage of beds in Delhi; over 16,500 beds are already occupied by patients from Delhi as well as outside. Wherever there are beds available, patients are being admitted.” (With inputs from Anonna Dutt)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/threefold-increase-in-covid-beds-in-delhi-since-april-3sisodia-101618904856991.html

As many as 2,000 vials of Remdesivir were recovered from an exporter in Marol in Andheri East, and 200 vials of the drug were found with another exporter in New Marine Lines.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here“These 2200 Remdesivir vials were produced for export but were kept stocked by the exporters as there is a ban on the export of Remdesivir. FDA officials are following due procedure to make these vials available to hospitals,” the Mumbai Police’s spokesperson was quoted as saying by news agency ANI.The development comes at a time when several states have reported a short of the drug as they are struggling to tackle the rising number of cases in the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic.Meanwhile, the Maharashtra government and the opposition are at loggerheads over the supply of the drug. The ruling Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government has accused Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader Devendra Fadnavis of hoarding the antiviral drug. The Shiv Sena alleged that the BJP was aiding the black-marketing of the medicine. The BJP, on the other hand, accused the state government of resorting to “childish politics”.The accusations come in the backdrop of Mumbai Police questioning a director of a pharmaceutical company on Saturday following information that thousands of vials of Remdesivir were to be flown out of the country, despite a ban on its export. Fadnavis and another state BJP leader Darekar rushed to the police station when they found out about the company director’s interrogation. After the incident, the Sena raised doubts about the alleged politics being played on the issue of supply of oxygen and Remdesivir injections for treating Covid-19 patients.Maharashtra is facing a shortage of 18,000 to 20,000 vials of Remdesivir injections daily, Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingne said on Monday. “We need at least 60,000 doses of Remdesivir daily and are currently facing a shortage of 18,000 to 20,000 doses daily. Our problem is the number of patients is increasing daily,” Shingne said.The state’s health minister Rajesh Tope has assured that the situation will improve in the coming days. “Five companies are producing Remdesivir injections and their production is being ramped up. In addition, we will give pharmaceutical companies in Maharashtra the permission to sub-contract the production of this injection,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-police-raid-2-exporters-recover-2-200-remdesivir-vials-101618900676267.html

20-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi under 6-day lockdown as Covid-19 cases, deaths soar||Delhi went under a complete lockdown from Monday night, which will remain in place till the morning, of April 26, as cases of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) in the city have been rising at a tremendous pace. Chief minister Arvind Kejriwal made the announcement on Monday as infections have increased by nearly 600% in the last two weeks in the national capital.Follow latest updates on Covid-19 here“Delhi’s health system is now unable to take in more patients. It is now necessary to impose a lockdown in Delhi from 10pm today to 5am on Monday (April 26). Essential services will remain open, food and medicine shops will be allowed to operate, weddings will be limited to 50 guests,” Arvind Kejriwal said in a media briefing.The massive spike in cases has triggered a shortage of medical supplies in hospitals in the Capital. With hospitals running out of beds, the Delhi government last week requested the Centre to make isolation coaches available at two railway stations, Shakur Basti and Anand Vihar, for Covid-19 patients.Due to the fear of the extension of the lockdown following Arvind Kejriwal’s announcement, scores of migrant workers were seen crowding at interstate bus terminals to leave the city. “We are daily wagers, the chief minister should have given us some time before announcing the lockdown. It takes us ₹200 to reach home, but they are charging ₹3000 to ₹4000 now. How will we go home?" a migrant labourer told news agency ANI.However, Arvind Kejriwal reached out to the migrants in Delhi. "I appeal to you with folded hands. It's a small lockdown, only for six days. Don't leave Delhi and go. I am very hopeful and that we won't need to further extend the lockdown. The government will take care of you," he said.During the six-day lockdown in Delhi, movement will be prohibited unless someone is seeking or providing essential services, medical help, or needs to go to exempted workplaces, such as government offices. People in some of these categories will require an e-pass from the government, while others need to carry an identity card, according to the order issued by chief secretary Vijay Dev.On Monday, Delhi reported record of 240 deaths due to the viral disease, the highest since the beginning of the pandemic last year, and 23,686 cases with a positivity rate of 26.12%, according to official data.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-under-6-day-lockdown-as-covid-19-cases-deaths-soar-101618889737135.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Migrant workers start leaving Delhi, say Kejriwal should've given more time before announcing lockdown||Amid a massive surge in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in the national capital, scores of migrant workers were seen leaving Delhi throughout Monday, hours before the six-day lockdown came into effect at 10pm. Despite Arvind Kejriwal's appeal to the migrant workers to not leave Delhi over what he called a "short lockdown", the distressed workers waiting for hours at the bus stops claimed that the chief minister should have given more time before announcing the lockdown because, in the face of this crisis, the trip back home is now costing 10 times more.Also Read: Record 240 deaths in Delhi, more than 23,000 Covid-19 cases"We are daily wagers, the chief minister should have given us some time before announcing the lockdown," one of the migrant labourers told news agency ANI during their long wait at the bus station. "It takes us ₹200 to reach home, but they are charging ₹3,000 to ₹4,000 now, how will we go home?" they added.Covid-19 protocols and social distancing went for a toss, the news agency reported, as hundreds of migrant workers thronged the Anand Vihar Bus Terminal in Delhi on Monday evening to board the buses for their native places, many of them waiting for hours. Exhausted women and children were seen laying on the ground with their heads on sacks looking numbly at the hustle, as more migrant workers joined the crowd in the bus terminal with heavy loads on their heads and shoulders. Several others were seen climbing atop buses that were leaving the station.The situation wasn't much different in Ghazipur or in Ghaziabad's Kaushambi, where the scene was reminiscent of the mass exodus of people from eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar last year when migrant workers had gathered in thousands at Anand Vihar after the central government announced a lockdown in March.Also Read: 'It's a short lockdown, don't leave Delhi': Kejriwal's appeal to migrant workersDelhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal on Monday announced a six-day Covid-19 lockdown from 10pm on April 19 till 5am on April 26 and urged migrant workers to not leave the national capital during this period. Kejriwal pointed out that its duration being only six days, the present lockdown was a relatively "short" one, and promised that the government will "take care" of them through this crisis. He also assured that the Delhi government will be working hard to ensure adequate medical facilities in the national capital and remained hopeful that the government won't need to extend the current lockdown any further.Lockdown-like measures introduced by several state governments usually spell a loss of livelihood for many migrant workers working in India’s major cities. These migrant workers, who form an essential part of any city’s economy, faced difficulties when the Centre imposed its first lockdown in 2020 following the first wave of Covid-19. Most of them were unable to find transport and had to walk home in desperation and many died due to exertion and lack of food.Delhi on Monday reported a record of 240 deaths due to Covid-19, the highest since the beginning of the pandemic last year, and 23,686 cases with a positivity rate of 26.12%, according to official data. The national capital has reported 823 deaths due to the infectious disease in the last five days, with the fourth wave of infections being the worst so far in the city.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/migrant-workers-say-kejriwal-should-ve-given-more-time-before-declaring-lockdown-101618884796305.html

His sister and her husband needed admission in an ICU as their oxygen saturation had dipped to 80% (the normal oxygen saturation is 95% to 100%; anything less than 94% for a sustained period is considered to be serious).“The hospital does not have any ICU beds. I’ve called many others but we haven’t received any assurance of an available bed anywhere in the city. We are waiting here because this hospital has told us that beds might become available by 8pm. For now, they are in the car and using the one oxygen tank that I managed to get,” said Gupta.Eight-month pregnant Fareeha Khan was also brought to the emergency department of Holy Family hospital on Monday morning.“Her oxygen saturation had dipped to 82%; the doctors have given her oxygen but they do not have any beds to admit her. We have been calling several hospitals for admission,” said her father IS Khan.The doctors said that the situation was unprecedented and added that they didn’t see anything close to it even during the November surge in cases, which was previously the worst wave of infections in the Capital.“You know what the situation is; the hospital is completely full. We are making place for the sick as patients get discharged. We are keeping some of the others in the observation area,” said Dr Suresh Kumar, medical director, Lok Nayak hospital.A similar situation existed in the Delhi government-run GTB hospital even though the hospital had 986 beds available on Monday evening, according to the Delhi Corona app.“There are 11 or 12 oxygen ports in the Covid-19 emergency; there are at least 70 patients here. The doctors in casualty are supposed to stabilise the patient, give them oxygen and medicines till they can be moved to the ward or ICU. However, all ICU beds and those with central oxygen supply are already occupied. This has clogged the emergency department,” said a doctor posted in the hospital emergency on condition of anonymity.Also read: 2020 rerun? Migrant exodus begins, againThe doctor said: “The 900 or so beds that are available do not have an oxygen pipeline, but can accommodate patients with oxygen cylinders. The only problem with oxygen cylinders is that they can provide oxygen at a speed of up to 15 litres a minute. They cannot be used to give high-flow oxygen, for which nearly 50 litres of oxygen are needed per minute.”At the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), a senior administrator said, “We already have about 900 Covid-19 patients admitted to the hospital; we do not have the capacity for more. We ask patients who come to the emergency to look for beds elsewhere; we cannot refer them because we do not know where to refer them to.”The administrator added, “Those who can wait, wait. Depending on their condition, they might have to wait anywhere between several hours to a couple of days.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/beds-filling-fast-city-can-t-keep-up-with-icu-oxygen-demand-101618873234592.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Local residents chip in with cooked meals||At a time when social media are flooded with desperate pleas for help to find vacant hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen, and other facilities, concerned citizens are stepping in to provide resources ranging from oxygen cylinders to cooked meals to families battling the infection.Anupriya Singh (Anna), a 42-year-old designer who doubles up as an aggregator of home chef services, recently formed another network of home chefs operating through WhatsApp groups to cater to Covid-affected families.“Right now, everyone knows someone or the other who is down with Covid. Seeing the situation, I started reaching out to home chefs so that we could cater to more people and save on crucial delivery time and expenses. As of today, we have over 120 chefs who are serving Covid-affected families. Every day, I create a new list of home chefs who can provide services in different parts of Delhi,” said Singh.She said nearly 40 chefs are joining the network on a daily basis, with requests for food pouring in from different quarters.“We are not allowing the chefs to price their thalis above ₹150. Some chefs are ready to deliver food for free, but recipients insist on paying for it. Money from such services will be used to start a fund through which we plan to support the needy,” said Singh.Also read: Can’t continue to obstruct others, SC tells farm leadersWithin the neighbourhood, chefs are relying on services of friends or security guards to deliver food to families whereas services of app-based aggregators are being availed of to deliver food to far-off addresses. “Some chefs are also sending their family members to deliver food. People are stepping out to make deliveries themselves despite the severity of the prevailing situation,” said Singh.Ankit Gupta, 28, an Urdu poet who has been living in Delhi for the past year, has been using Twitter to connect those seeking Covid-related help. Gupta said concerned individuals have been using Twitter as a platform to respond to calls for help. “Through social media, we have formed a network of volunteers who are reaching out to hospitals and government officials so that patients can be admitted or provided services at the earliest,” said Gupta.Besides queries related to hospitalisation, Gupta has also been receiving requests from those who are hassled by the curfew restrictions. On Monday, Gupta delivered packets of cooked meals to around 1,000 people near Kashmere Gate. “Due to the lockdown restrictions, people have lost jobs and are unable to pay for food or rent. Through social media, we raised money and were able to help such people,” said Gupta.Aryaman Bhatnagar, a resident, is among those who are using social media to verify crucial information and compile resources. Bhatnagar said the network was started on WhatsApp by citizens.“We provide verified leads and credible information -- pertaining to bed availability, oxygen, and medicines -- to those in need. There is a lot of information doing the rounds of WhatsApp and other platforms but, most often, the information is either false or the numbers are not working. Our aim to make sure that a person in need can get verified information on one common list or link,” said Bhatnagar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/local-residents-chip-in-with-cooked-meals-101618870954744.html

According to people familiar with the matter, Tanmay received the first dose of the vaccine in Mumbai and the second dose at the National Cancer Institute in Nagpur.After the photos were widely shared on social media, several leaders questioned how the 22-year-old received the vaccine since only frontline or health care workers, and those over the age of 45 are eligible to receive the doses.Also watch | Fadnavis accuses Maha police of harassing Remdesivir supplier; DCP refutes claimCongress leader and Maharashtra minister Nitin Raut demanded an inquiry into the matter. “When eligible persons (45+) are struggling for vaccination, how can a relative of a BJP leader who is barely 22 years old get it,” he asked. He said that persons involved in such “favouritism” should be dealt with sternly and be booked.When contacted, Fadnavis’s office expressed surprise. “Even we were shocked when it appeared in social media as to how a 22-year-old boy got vaccinated,” said Ketan Pathak, who works in the media cell at the Bharatiya Janata Party leader’s office. Tanmay’s grandmother Shobhatai Fadnavis, who is a senior BJP leader, said, “Is it a sin to get a vaccine?”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/fadnavis-under-fire-as-nephew-gets-vaccine-101618866644809.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Wheat procurement: Slow lifting leads to glut in mandis, farmers protest||Even as the government stopped procurement operations over the weekend, farmers were back to square one on Monday as they struggled to unload their produce amid space crunch in mandis.Despite deputy commissioners’ directions to speed up lifting operations at least 50% of procured wheat was still in mandis and the arrival of more grain created a glut in most northern districts of the state. With harvesting of wheat is its peak, sluggish lifting operations have added to farmers’ woes.A farmer, Surender Singh of Kurukshetra, who is waiting to unload his wheat at Ladwa grain market, said, “I harvested five acres of wheat on Friday but I did not receive any schedule over SMS. However, I had to bring the produce of two acres in the mandi as I do not have enough storage.” In Karnal, farmers, especially those from the border districts of Uttar Pradesh, staged a protest outside the Karnal grain market over non-procurement of produce.The protesting farmers said that had registered themselves on the ‘meri fasal mera bayora’ portal but they did not get any SMS to bring their produce to the mandis.After three hours, the farmers were allowed to bring their produce to the Karnal mandi. “As there was no space in the mandis farmers waiting from 3am were not given gate passes to enter till 10am,” said a commission agent Rishi Pal of Indri Grain Market of Karnal.As per Kurukshetra deputy commissioner Sharandeep Kaur Barar, 47% of 3.97 lakh tonnes of procured wheat in all mandis has been lifted so far. But 2.11 lakh tonnes of the grain is still lying in mandis of the district.In Karnal, of 5.98 lakh tonnes of wheat procured, 3.49 lakh tonnes have been lifted and 42% was still in the mandis. Similarly, in Kaithal, 4.8 lakh tonnes of grain had arrived but around 2 lakh tonnes were yet to be lifted.As per mandi officials, the government’s decision to stop procurement for two days did not provide any major relief to farmers who continued to bring their produce to the mandis without gate passes and commission agents. Besides tardy lifting, officials said the early peak season had led to the situation.Haryana govt procures 5.32 lakh tonne wheat (BOX)Chandigarh The Haryana government on Monday procured 5.32 lakh tonnes of wheat through different procurement agencies at minimum support price (MSP).Of the 60 lakh tonne wheat that has so far arrived across 396 mandis of the state, around 50 lakh tonnes have been procured. Until Monday, about seven lakh J- forms of nearly two lakh farmers had been issued and ₹2,336 crore transferred directly into the accounts of farmers, an official spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/wheat-procurement-slow-lifting-leads-to-glut-in-mandis-farmers-protest-101618866213780.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Ex-Kalka MLA Pradeep Chaudhary to be reinstated in Haryana assembly||The Himachal Pradesh high court stayed former Kalka MLA Pradeep Chaudhary’s conviction in a rioting case on Monday, following which his membership to the Haryana assembly will be restored. Legal experts say the orders of the Haryana assembly speaker to unseat Chaudhary from the legislative assembly will have to be withdrawn. The HC order has also terminated prospects of an assembly bypoll. In January, a Nalagarh court had convicted and sentenced Chaudhary three years’ imprisonment on charges of rioting. The Congress leader was subsequently unseated as a member of the Haryana assembly as per Section 8 (3) of the Representation of the People Act. The disqualification provision says that a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than two years shall be disqualified from the date of such conviction and shall continue to be disqualified for a further period of six years since his release. Chaudhary’s counsel Bipin Negi said a single judge bench of justice Sandeep Sharma of the HP high court suspended his conviction on Monday. “The Solan sessions court had already stayed his sentence. The suspension of the conviction will continue till the appellate court decides on our appeal against his conviction,’’ Negi said. Former Punjab advocate general Ashok Aggarwal said if the HC has stayed the conviction of the unseated MLA, the speaker will have to restore his membership. Former Haryana advocate general Mohan Jain said, “When the HC has decided in Chaudhary’s favour by suspending his conviction, then the assembly speaker has no other option but to withdraw the orders to disqualify him from the Assembly.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/exkalka-mla-pradeep-chaudhary-to-be-reinstated-in-haryana-assembly-101618866034927.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||No shortage of ICU beds, ventilators, oxygen: Vij||Despite massive increase in the Covid cases in Haryana, 89% isolation beds, 58% ICU beds and around 63% ventilators are vacant, health minister Anil Vij on Monday said, assuring citizens that oxygen availability was at least four times more than the consumption. Presiding over a state-level Covid monitoring committee meeting, the health minister said Critical Corona Care Centres will be set up in all government medical colleges of the state and that in view of the ongoing surge in Covid cases the surgery in civil hospitals has been discontinued. “At least 270MT of oxygen is available, while the state is consuming 60 MT,” Vij said, adding that there is no shortage of oxygen and Remdesivir in the state. The health minister said Haryana has 45,086 quarantine beds and 11,549 isolation beds, of which about 89% are vacant. He said of 2,131 ICU beds, 58% are vacant, while of 1,079 ventilators around 63% are vacant. He said that there are about 42,000 Covid cases in the state, of which around 30,000 are in home isolation. The management of the doctors of the AYUSH department has been given to civil surgeons of the respective districts so that Covid patients can be looked after properly, he said. A home isolation kit is being prepared, which will contain medicines, oximeter, Covid prevention literature and other necessary materials. The government has decided to conduct Covid test of patients going to private and government hospitals with symptoms such as cough, cold, sore throat or fever. Devotees returning from Haridwar after attending the Kumbh Mela will be tested at the entry points of Haryana. The health department will take initiatives to conduct Covid tests and administer the vaccine to farmers sitting on dharna on the Haryana border. For this, first talks will be held with farmers’ leaders. The state-level Covid monitoring committee that comprises senior IAS, IPS and health department officers, also includes chief principal secretary to CM DS Dhesi, and chief secretary Vijai Vardhan.No Ram Navami lockdown

A case under 306 (abetment to suicide) has been registered and all four have been arrested.” Police said the woman had charged Sidhu’s brother-in-law Gursharan Singh, a deputy superintendent of police (DSP), with rape last year.The woman, her husband and son were arrested with drugs by Gursharan’s team in July last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/scribe-ends-life-4-arrested-for-abetment-in-bathinda-101618865193900.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||AJL re-allotment case: Enough material to take cognisance against Hooda: CBI court||Stating that it has enough materials to presume that the former chief minister has committed offences, the special court of Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), Haryana, has ordered framing of charges against Bhupinder Singh Hooda in the alleged illegal allotment of a plot in Panchkula to Associated Journal Limited (AJL), the publisher of National Herald newspaper.The court dismissed an application filed by Hooda, seeking discharge and said that the allegations are “specific”. “Whether or not those allegations are true, is a matter which cannot be determined at the stage of framing of charges. Any such determination can take place only at the conclusion of the trial,” special judge, CBI court, Sushil Kumar Garg said. On Friday, the court had framed charges against Hooda and AJL.The FIR was registered in 2016 during the BJP’s regime for the alleged offences in 2005 when the Congress leader was the chief minister. According to the CBI, a 3,360 square metres institutional plot (C-17) in Sector 6, Panchkula, was allotted by Haryana Urban Development Authority (HUDA) to AJL in 1982, but because construction was not carried out in 10 years, it was taken back in 1992. In 1995 and 1996, appeal and revisions were filed by AJL against resumption of the plot, but these were also dismissed by the HUDA administrator and Haryana’s financial commissioner, town and country planning. However, when Hooda became the chief minister in 2005, he allowed the re-allotment of the plot to AJL on old rates, allegedly causing of loss of ₹62 lakh to the government exchequer.Hooda had argued that the CBI had failed to show any “dishonest intention” on his part and that re-allotment of the plot can be treated as an “error of judgment” which may be a civil claim. However, the court said that the argument has no force because “dishonest intention” of Hooda cannot be gathered from “the vacuum”, but from the facts and circumstances of the case. It took note of public prosecutor KP Singh’s argument that Hooda had full knowledge of everything but despite it all, he re-allotted the said plot to AJL, which allegedly revealed the dishonest intention on his part.Hooda had also argued that there is “no conflict of interest” and “no personal or institutional bias” in favour of AJL. “It is crystal clear that both accused belonged to the same party and M/s AJL is also associated with the Congress, one of whose objectives is to promote the party’s ideology,” the court observed, taking note of CBI’s argument that accused Motilal Vora (since deceased) was a veteran politician of the Congress party, which came into power in Haryana in 2005.“Prima facie sufficient grounds are made out to proceed with the trial against the accused and no ground for discharge is made out,” the court said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/ajl-re-allotment-case-enough-material-to-take-cognisance-against-hooda-cbi-court-101618864953486.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Centre earmarks ₹906 cr for Punjab under Samagra Shiksha||The Centre has earmarked an outlay of ₹906 crore for Punjab for the financial year 2021-22 under the flagship Samagra Shiksha scheme. The tentative fund allocation has been conveyed by the Union ministry of education to the state government under the centrally sponsored integrated scheme for school education. Of this, the ₹544 crore will be provided by the Centre as its share and the remaining ₹362 crore by the state government. The programme aimed at ensuring inclusive and equitable quality education is jointly funded by the Centre and the state on 60:40 sharing basis. A school education department official said the funds earmarked by the central ministry for the current financial year are tentative estimates. “The department will submit its annual work plan and budget to the Union ministry of education for approval with details of activities and civil works to be undertaken this year. The final budget will be approved by the ministry’s project approval board on the basis of approvals granted for specific activities. Unspent balance of previous fiscal (2020-21) will also be carried forward,” said the official who is in the know of the matter. The department, which is giving final touches to the annual work plan and budget 2021-22, will submit it to the ministry in the next few days. The project approval board meeting was originally scheduled for April 16 and has been deferred. The new date is still to be decided. Of the estimated allocation of ₹906 crore, ₹615.42 crore, or say 68%, are proposed to be earmarked for elementary education and ₹276.20 crore for secondary education. A sum of ₹14.26 crore has been proposed for teacher education, including State Council for Education Research and Training (SCERT) and District Institutes of Education and Training (DIETs). The ministry has informed the state government that the overall plan proposal should not exceed 125% of the estimated plan outlay. However, the school education department is hopeful of getting a higher allocation than the estimates conveyed by the central ministry due to an increase in student enrolment in government schools. The special enrolment drive, including a door-to-door campaign by primary and pre-primary teachers amid a surge in Covid-19 cases in the state, has seen students shift to government schools from private ones during the past one year as the latter have been insisting on tuition feeds whereas everything, from education to textbooks and uniform, are free in the state-run schools. The thrust areas for the current year include early childhood development, care and education, digital initiatives, foundation literacy and numeracy, and universalisation of secondary and senior secondary education and funds will be allocated for activities accordingly. “The Covid-19 pandemic has presented unprecedented challenges for the education sector as the schools could not open for most part of this academic year and large migrations took place all over the country,” reads a letter sent by the department of school education and literacy, Union ministry of education, to the state government last month, laying emphasis on the importance of digital initiatives in these challenging times.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/centre-earmarks-rs-906-cr-for-punjab-under-samagra-shiksha-101618864833696.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||2 Dalit kids burnt to death: 6 years on, CBI court accepts closure report, clean chit to 11 accused||In a six-year-old case, pertaining to two infants burning to death, the special CBI court has accepted the investigating agency’s closure report and given 11 people the clean-chit. As per the FIR, on the night of October 19, the two children of Jitender from Sunped village,Faridabad, who belonged to the Dalit community, aged two years and nine months, were burnt to death after 11 people allegedly entered his house through the window, poured patrol and set the room on fire. Jitender said the 11 people while fleeing said they wanted to kill people of the community. In October, 2015 a case was registered against 11 persons by the police, however, two days later it was transferred to CBI following the Centre’s intervention.The CBI’s investigation revealed that in October 2014, four persons from the accused’s family were murdered and according to Jitender the men set his house on fire as revenge. Later, investigations revealed that some negotiations were going on between people belonging to the Thakur and Dalit community to reach a compromise in the previous murder, but to no avail. CBI special judge Sushil Kumar Garg observed: “The possibility cannot be ruled out that the complainant might have implicated the accused persons to settle scores of Dalits in the aforesaid murder case.”The order mentioned how the complainant and his wife had made several inconsistent statements. They also finally admitted that they did not see anybody setting the fire. Jitender also admitted that the names were given at the insistance of other villagers. Experts opined ‘no forcible entry’Experts from three laboratories — FSL Madhuban, Karnal, Haryana; CFSL New Delhi, and Telangana State Forensic Science Laboratory, Hyderabad — have opined that there was ‘no forcible entry’ into the bedroom and that the fire originated inside the bedroom from the Center of the bed and that the room was bolted from inside when the fire erupted.“Clearly observing that there was no indication of outsiders having come inside the room and there being no sign whatsoever of disturbance outside the room,”the order mentioned.Narco, polygraph test against the coupleIt adds: “The polygraph reports of the suspects and the couple indicate that the responses given by the suspects are not deceptive and consistent, whereas, responses of the couple reflect deception, indicating that they are hiding some vital information instead of revealing the truth. Even the narcoanalysis of Jitender makes his act and conduct doubtful.”The court ordered: “Mere suspicion cannot take the place of proof. Hence, this court is satisfied that there is not sufficient material against the above said accused persons. Thus, it would be a futile exercise in flogging a dead horse only on the ground of mere suspicion and without there being any substantive material on record.”Accepting the closure report of CBI, the court said that “the investigation has been conducted in right perspective and no doubt remains to be cleared either by way of re-investigation or by leading evidence.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/2-dalit-kids-burnt-to-death-6-years-on-cbi-court-accepts-closure-report-clean-chit-to-11-accused-101618864593430.html

At a press conference in Chandigarh, they said a six-member ‘ekta committee’ was formed to hold discussions with like-minded people. Committee spokesperson Karnail Singh Peermohammad termed coming together of the two senior leaders as an important political development. “This will have an impact on the results of the Punjab assembly polls scheduled in 2022. We will also contest the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC) elections if held before the state elections,” he said. The organisational structure of the new outfit will be announced in the first week of May, he added. In February 2020, Dhindsa along with his MLA son and former finance minister Parminder Singh Dhindsa were expelled from the SAD after he held party president Sukhbir Singh Badal responsible for the 2017 assembly poll debacle besides being unable to handle the sacrilege incidents during the SAD-BJP government. Brahmpura and his son Ravinder Brahmpura were expelled from SAD in November 2018. Dhindsa appealed to Prime Minister Narendra Modi to accept the demands of farmers who have been agitating against the three agriculture reform laws for several months. He accused Punjab CM Amarinder Singh and the Badals of playing a friendly match, saying it was the state that was suffering due to this. He said Amarinder had big promises ahead of the 2017 state polls but failed to deliver on any of them. Besides Brahmpura and Dhindsa, Ujagar Singh Badali, Mahinder Singh Hussainpur, Jagdish Singh Garcha, Ranjit Singh Talwandi and Shinderpal Singh Brar were among those present.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/sukhdev-dhindsa-ranjit-singh-brahmpura-announce-merger-of-their-sad-splinter-groups-101618864533594.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Virus spread creates new record in Haryana||The number of coronavirus infected patients in Haryana went through the roof last week (April 12-18) with the state reporting a record high of 40,090 new infections. This is more than double the numbers reported the week before. The virus trajectory which started climbing 10 weeks ago had already reached an apex level the week before (April 5-11) with 18,748 fresh infections. Before the two new records in terms of highest number of weekly infections were set in the past fortnight, the highest number of cases during the last surge was 17,426 infections reported between November 16 and 22. The surge has also pushed the number of active cases to 45,363. The state also reported 147 deaths last week even though the case fatality rate was below 1%. As per health department statistics, the sample positivity rate jumped to 5.23% in the last week as compared to 4.82% the week before and the recovery rate dropped to 87.22% from 91.96%. National capital region (NCR) districts — Gurugram with around 12,000 active infections, Faridabad with around 5,500 active infections, Sonepat with over 3,400 infections were the major contributors to the tally. Karnal with over 3,100 active infections, Hisar with over 2,700 active cases, Panchkula with over 2,100 cases and Ambala with around 2,000 active cases also caused concern among health authorities, officials said. Additional chief secretary, health, Rajeev Arora said that they are stepping up sampling and vaccination at Singhu and Tikri borders where a large number of farmers have assembled. “Also, we are going to conduct RT-PCR tests on those returning from Kumbh at three locations – Kala Amb, Yamunanagar and Karnal near the UP borders,’’ Arora said. Vaccination crosses 3 million mark Health officials said around 32 lakh individuals have been vaccinated and the authorities were sampling 2 lakh peopel every week. “We are planning to further step up the vaccination drive in the coming days,’’ said an official. Panipat enters critical category, Jhajjar exits desirable Panipat district with a sample positivity rate of 6% has entered the critical category, joining four other districts -Faridabad (9.05%), Gurugram (7.51%), Panchkula (6.77%) and Rewari (6.38%). Officials said Ambala with a positivity rate of 5.82% and Karnal with a positivity rate 5.68% are fast-approaching the critical positivity mark of over 6%. With Jhajjar making an exit from the desirable positivity rate category, only two districts- Nuh (0.83%) and Charkhi Dadri (1.17%) now have a desirable positivity rate of less than 2%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/virus-spread-creates-new-record-in-haryana-101618864236479.html

Most residents, however, were unaware of the fact that their area had been sealed and were seen fighting tooth and nail with cops, to enter or exit the area. Dugri station house officer, inspector Surinder Chopra said as many as 45 checkpoints have been set up in the area and only people with emergencies will be allowed to go out. “As the area is connected with other parts of the city through multiple roads, we have deployed our personnel on each and every road and street to ensure foolproof sealing,” he said.A cop, who was on duty at one of the checkpoints, said, “Many residents were not prepared for the lockdown; so they came out of their houses to buy necessary items. The grocery stores within the area are already running out of stocks.” Dilpreet Singh, a resident of Phase 1, said, “My family owns a land in Meharban area. My father has gone there to harvest the wheat crop. Now, I don’t know if the cops will allow him to return home.

20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Punjab positivity rate jumps 36% in two weeks||Blurb: Out of 22 districts, nine on Monday recorded positivity rate of more than 10% Chandigarh With Covid-19 spreading its wings wide and fast in the second wave, Punjab’s daily positivity rate has jumped by nearly 36% in the past fifteen days from nearly 7.8% to 10.6% as on Monday. Maximum and the highest ever positivity rate (12.6%) the state witnessed was on April 15, as per the information gathered from the health department, when a record 4,333 cases were witnessed out of 34,409 tests conducted. On other days, in the last one week, state’s positivity rate has remained more than 10%, meaning of every 100 samples tested for the virus, 10 were found positive. Punjab’s single day spike touched a new high of 4,957 cases on Sunday but state’s positivity rate remained 10.49% as tests conducted on the day were also the highest (47,247). Punjab’s overall positivity rate till date remained around 4.5% but there is no district at present which is showing less than 5% of positivity rate as on Monday. Muktsar has the highest positivity rate of 27.10% in the state, whereas Ferozepur has the lowest (5.7%). Out of Punjab’s 22 districts, nine districts — SAS Nagar, Ludhiana, Pathankot, Faridkot, Fazilka, Muktsar, Fatehgarh Sahib, Tarn Taran, Moga and Mansa — on Monday recorded positivity rate of more than 10%. State’s nodal officer for Covid-19 Dr Rajesh Bhaskar said state’s positivity has increased in past few days but the good thing is that it has remained constant at around 10% when the state is moving towards peak. “The best thing is we have been utilising most of our testing capacities with around 45,000 tests being done daily,” said the nodal officer. Situation grim in SAS Nagar SAS Nagar (Mohali) district has emerged as the biggest concern for the health authorities in past one week, with the district on Sunday witnessing around 36.53% of positivity rate, as per health functionaries. On Monday, Mohali’s positivity rate was 21.10% with the district witnessing 792 cases, maximum for any district. “There have been a few questions over the low testing in the district in past few days and now the district administration has been asked to ramp it up. On Monday, some fresh instructions were passed on to the district administration to implement the restrictions strictly and increase testing,” a senior health department functionary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/punjab-positivity-rate-jumps-36-in-two-weeks-101618864055126.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Let’s ‘shake’ CM to make him to perform his duty on Sacrilege issue: Sidhu to Phoolka||Congress MLA Navjot Singh Sidhu on Monday asked noted lawyer and former Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) MLA Harvinder Singh Phoolka to join hands with him to “shake” Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh to make him perform his duty by taking action against the culprits of the 2015 sacrilege and police firing incidents. The former minister said this in reply to a letter written to him by Phoolka wherein the latter asked him to do something “concrete” to take the issue to a logical conclusion and ensure justice to the Sikh community in the matter. The case was a talking point again in Punjab’s political circle after the high court ordered to quash the Kotakapura police firing probe conducted by the special investigation team (SIT) led by inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh. In his reply, Sidhu said, “The Punjab assembly is supreme authority on making laws for the state. Apart from making laws, we work to make the executive answerable before the people. You are well aware that in the sacrilege case that the assembly can only guide the executive on the path to be followed.” “While campaigning for Congress during a rally in Bathinda, I raised the demand that justice must be delivered in the sacrilege case at every cost. I demanded exemplary punishment to those who ordering firing on protesters. My ministerial portfolio was changed due to my utterance but I chose to resign because no post is above the Guru’s honour,” he said.“Being a representative of people, I don’t care who holds power. The case needs registration of an FIR, investigation and making arrests, but this cannot be done even by calling 10 assembly sessions because only the state’s home minister has the power to do it,” the Congress MLA added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/lets-shake-cm-to-make-him-to-perform-his-duty-on-sacrilege-issue-sidhu-to-phoolka-101618863998683.html

Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh was heading the special investigation team probing the 2015 Kotakpura and Behbal Kalan police firing cases. The incidents had taken place after the alleged desecration of a religious text in Faridkot. The 1998-batch officer of the Punjab cadre had tendered his resignation on April 11, two days after the Punjab and Haryana high court had quashed the probe by the SIT into the Kotkapura firing incident. Though Amarinder had earlier refused to accept Kunwar’s resignation but the officer was firm on his stand. The CM has forwarded IG’s resignation to the home department for further action, said official sources.

20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Will file defamation suit against IG Kunwar Vijay over witness claim: Sukhbir Badal||Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD) president Sukhbir Singh Badal on Monday said he will file a defamation suit against inspector general of police (IGP) Kunwar Vijay Pratap Singh for falsely claiming that he tried to lure the witness in the Kotkapura police firing case with the promise of a job in the Shiromani Gurdwara Parbandhak Committee (SGPC). In a press statement, the former deputy chief minister claimed that had never met Ajit Singh, the witness, and it was clear that Kunwar Vijay was obsessed with targeting the SAD and the Badal family. It was with this purpose that the police officer forwarded a “malicious” letter to the director general of police (DGP) making such wild allegations, he said. “The IG knew from the proceedings of the Kotkapura case in the Punjab and Haryana High Court that his probe would be set aside. The latest allegation is a result of this frustration and aimed at politicising a case. He wanted to implicate the SAD leadership at the behest of the Congress government but did not succeed. Now he taking the letter route to defame our leadership,” said Sukhbir. “Ajit Singh had also set the record straight by asserting that he had not been approached by anyone for a job or the other way round. Despite such a clear-cut rebuttal from the witness, the IG prevailed upon a section of the media to publish this malafide report. Our lawyers are looking into the case to ascertain if there is a wider conspiracy to defame me,” he added. Kunwar Vijay set to join AAP: Majithia Akali Dal MLA Bikram Singh Majithia on Monday accused IGP Kunwar Vijay Partap Singh of deliberately politicising the Kotakpura firing case as he was set to join the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ahead of the 2021 Punjab assembly elections. Talking to mediapersons after the election of office-bearers of the Majitha municipal council, the former minister claimed that the IG flouted all service rules by disrespecting the Punjab and Haryana High Court orders. The political vendetta launched by him against the SAD was exposed by the court, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/will-file-defamation-suit-against-ig-kunwar-vijay-over-witness-claim-sukhbir-badal-101618863933347.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Procurement picks up pace in Doaba amid snags||JALANDHAR Farmers on Monday protested against the delay in procurement of their produce at Nadala grain market of Doaba region, comprising Jalandhar, Kapurthala, Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar and Hoshiarpur districts. Farmers Puran Singh and Nawjinder Singh said they were camping at the grain market for five days and didn’t succeed in selling their crop yet. District mandi officer Arvinder Singh said most of the issues have already been resolved. “We have already procured more than 40% of the crop as compared to last year,” he said. District food supply controller Geeta said that the issue of gunny bags has already been resolved as the government has allowed arhtiyas to use the old gunny bags. “The delay in payment was due to holidays, while lifting has picked up pace. The procurement will as smooth as before in a day,” she said. In Jalandhar, the procurement has by and large been smooth at 137 purchase centres amid complaints of gunny bag shortage and late payments. District mandi officials said the issues farmers raised were being resolved immediately. Tardy lifting in Hoshiarpur In Hoshiarpur district, wheat arrival is gathering pace but the lifting is slow. Of the 66,573 metric tonnes wheat procured in the district by Monday, only 18,127 MT could be lifted. Payment is also tardy as only 9 per cent of due amount has been cleared so far. District food supply controller (DFSC) Rajnish Kaur said the lifting was affected due to rains. She said the payment got delayed due to some technical glitches but the problem is being resolved by the head office. In Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district, nearly 97% of wheat has been purchased of the total arrived in the grain markets, said deputy commissioner Shena Aggarwal. She said the procurement process got partially hit due to the bad weather. Farmers alleged shortage of gunny bags in Banga sub-division of Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar district. DFSC Rajesh Bhaskar said the problems faced in Banga have been resolved. Principal secretary, food and civil supplies, KAP Sinha said, there was no shortage of gunny bales as Centre has allowed reuse of gunny bags. “We have made arrangement of 68,000 bales from arhtiyas for the second time use. There was a shortage of more than 10% bales, as we need total 5.24 lakh bales to procure 130 lakh tonnes wheat expected to come for procurement in the current season.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/procurement-picks-up-pace-in-doaba-amid-snags-101618863635347.html

20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Gap in arrival, purchase and lifting weighs heavy in south Malwa||BATHINDA Kulwant Singh of Kishangarh village in Mansa district has been camping at the grain market in Bareta for the last eight days to sell his wheat. He has 12-acres of land and harvested only a part of the total area. “Officials and arhtiyas say there are no gunny bags. In absence of packaging material, procurement has slowed down work and farmers are hassled,” said Singh. As per official records, only 4,895 metric tonnes (MT) wheat was purchased by different agencies in Bareta mandi on Monday and only 400 MT food grain was lifted. President of arhtiyas’ association at Bareta Jitender Mohan Garg blames the state authorities for poor preparedness for the procurement. “Contrary to the claims of the Punjab government, the purchase is disappointingly slow as there has hardly been any availability of gunny bags. There is no space left in the mandi,” he added. In the south Malwa region, Bathinda and Mansa districts have more problems related to procurement. In the last three days, farmer protests have been reported at various places of the two districts against the slow purchase. Of 3.68 lakh MT wheat arrived in Bathinda so far, nearly 74,000 MT is still lying unsold at various centers across the district. Wheat grower Sikander Singh had to travel 20 km to Bathinda last Friday as procurement at the purchase centre at his native Shergarh village was delayed. “I am waiting here for the last four days and it may take at least three more days for my turn due to the heavy rush. Authorities should expedite lifting and ensure smooth supply of gunny bags,” he said. Officials admit the tardy lifting of the wheat is now threatening to create a glut-like situation in the coming days as heavy more crop has been harvested that will flood the grain markets. An arhtiya at Talwandi Sabo Sukhpal Singh said a delay in the supply of bags could lead to a situation where farmers will struggle to find a place for their crop inside the grain markets. To date, about 38,000 MT has arrived at Talwandi and 10,000 MT grains stand unsold. “There is no coordination or support from the authorities. As the stock is lying unsold, farmers are unable to bring the harvested crop to mandis,” said. Bathinda district mandi officer Preet Kanwar Singh Brar said the situation is likely to improve by Tuesday afternoon after additional supply has been assured by the state authorities. “It is more of fear in the mandis whereas the real situation is not very alarming. Wheat purchase is a massive exercise and Bathinda, the largest district of southern Punjab, is expected to procure 10.31 lakh metric tonnes wheat and these issues will be resolved soon,” said the official. Officials in Fazilka said there have been more complaints of delay in uploading farmers’ details on the web portal for direct payments. “There is a lack of technical support for the teething problems in the new payment system. But the state administration is working to fix the challenges,” said a district functionary.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gap-in-arrival-purchase-and-lifting-weighs-heavy-in-south-malwa-101618863215003.html

The wife claimed that after Wajid’s untimely death due to Covid-19 last June, Khan had been trying to transfer all of her late husband’s assets to their mother’s name, and thus refusing any benefits to the petitioner and her two children.The single bench of justice Gautam Patel, while hearing the interim application in the testamentary petition filed by Kamalrukh Khan, Wajid’s wife through video-conferencing was informed that she sought directions to her mother-in-law, Khan and her late husband’s chartered accountant to furnish details of all properties and assets, including eight paintings of MF Husain and other renowned painters, in his name which he had earned during his illustrious career of more than 20 years in Bollywood. Kamalrukh claimed that Wajid had amassed immovable and movable assets in his name, valued in crores of rupees, and also had a share in the Sajid-Wajid Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) firm floated by the two brothers. However, after Wajid’s demise, Sajid had been trying to transfer the properties in his name for himself and their mother and hence she sought details of all properties and assets in the name of Wajid, Kamalrukh claimed. Advocate Zubin Behramkamdin, who along with Bahraiz and Behzad Irani represented Kamalrukh, informed the bench that she did not convert to Islam after marriage and remained a Parsi, as a result of which Wajid’s mother did not like her. Wajid had executed the Hibahnama (gift deed) last May in which he allegedly “desired to give nothing to his children and Kamalrukh”. Moreover, they applied for “letters of administration” of Wajid’s estate, based on the Hibahnama , without informing Kamalrukh, following which she moved HC. Wajid had tried to pacify his mother by filing for divorce, but never pursued it. The advocates submitted that there was no animosity between the couple and hence, after his demise, his property should be inherited by his wife, mother and children, which was his intention as per his will he prepared in 2012. The will was not probated, and a case awaiting its adjudication in HC is pending. Khan and his mother’s advocate Birendra Saraf informed the court that they would not create any third-party rights in the property in Wajid’s name till the next hearing, which was accepted by the bench. Thereafter justice Patel directed, “The Respondents will file an affidavit in reply on or before 21st April 2021. The Reply is to disclose the entire estate of the deceased the late Mr Wajid S Khan along with the necessary tax returns and their accompanied computation of income or sale. Also required will be the returns of the Limited Liability Company in which the deceased had an interest. All other similar commercial entities in which the deceased had any interest or share (apart from regular investments) are also to be disclosed with their complete financials.” The petition is posted for hearing for Friday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/submit-details-of-late-brother-s-assets-composer-sajid-told-by-bombay-hc-101618863152799.html

The websites, allegedly made by the accused Sonu Kumar Chaudhari, were used by online fraudsters to cheat people under the pretext of allotting them the dealerships of some companies, advancing loans and data entry jobs, said the police. Chaudhari would charge ₹2 lakh for making a website. During his interrogation, he revealed that was doing so to make easy money, as during the lockdown, his computer solutions company had shut down and he was left unemployed. Chaudhari also owns a small firm, Mithila Info Software, which had to be shut during the lockdown. Hence, he decided to work for the online fraud groups, a police officer said. Chaudhari holds a BTech degree and is currently pursuing an MTech course. He was arrested after the representatives of a tyre manufacturing giant approached the cyber police in January, alleging that their company’s fake website had been created, and under the pretext of allotting dealerships, people were being cheated through the website. The police registered a first information report (FIR) and found some technical leads in the matter. “We traced the suspect to Darbhanga, Bihar, and arrested him recently. Chaudhari admitted that he had created 15 similar websites and helped coding 150 others. For each fake website, he would get around ₹2 lakh,” said deputy commissioner of police (DCP), Cyber, Rashmi Karandikar. Around ₹50 lakh has been found from his bank account, the police said. The police have seized Chaudhari’s phones, laptop, tabs and hard disk.

The group has also claimed that permanent structures have emerged on the Alibag shorefront, in blatant violation of coastal regulatory zone (CRZ) rules. Nidhi Choudhury, Raigad district collector, could not be reached for comment, despite multiple attempts. Ashish Thakre, deputy conservator of forests, Alibag, responded saying the site in question does not fall under the jurisdiction of the forest department. “The site in question is about a kilometre away from Mandwa jetty. Solid waste (non-biodegradable and mixed) is being dumped on mangroves and a garbage dumping ground is being created. Multiple sluice gates have been put in place that are preventing the flow of tide water to the mangroves. Already, a large portion of the intertidal land was reclaimed for cultivation of paddy, which is being used to set up resorts and cottages as the area dries up,” wrote D Stalin, director, Vanashakti NGO, in his letter to the authorities last week, which featured geotagged images of the violations.Stalin also said permanent structures on Mandwa beach are not being used for indigenous purposes such as storing of boats or mending of fishing nets. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Stalin said, “Each week, new CRZ violations are being reported from different parts of the city. Despite constant intimations to the authorities, most such cases are going unchecked.” Stalin also called for immediate restoration of the flow of tidal water to the mangroves near Mandwa jetty. “The purpose of installing sluice gates is only to prevent high tide ingress during episodes of heavy rain or during cyclones. By shutting of the flow of tide water, there is heavy siltation in the water channel. It will cause waterlogging in the landward areas during the upcoming monsoon,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/crz-violations-rampant-near-alibag-s-mandwa-jetty-says-environment-group-101618862375486.html

Whether it is Maharashtra’s opposition or any other [party], nobody should indulge in politics over any medicine. I do not know what is the helplessness of Maharashtra’s opposition party that they are standing in support of black marketers, hoarders and profiteers.”He was referring to Fadnavis calling the questioning of Daman-based pharmaceutical manufacturer Bruck Pharma’s director about a stock of the drug “a shameful act”. The executive, who was supposed to supply Remdesivir to Maharashtra, was questioned by the Vile Parle police for about 45 minutes on Saturday and later let go.The opposition leader visited the police station on Saturday night along with other BJP leaders and enquired why the executive was questioned.Also read: Harsh Vardhan targets Manmohan over letter, Congress charges backThe Congress, which is a part of the MVA government, also slammed the BJP leader.State revenue minister and Congress leader Balasaheb Thorat said, “We did not understand the need for leader of opposition Devendra Fadnavis to go to the police station. He has worked as the chief minister, and we expected him to help to handover the stock to the government....”The BJP hit back, saying that the ruling alliance was politicizing the issue. A delegation of BJP leaders also met Maharashtra governor Bhagat Singh Koshyari over the issue.Fadnavis said the BJP was trying to procure the anti-viral drug for the people of Maharashtra. “...Even this time, we were trying to ensure that the stock of Remdesivir is procured for the people of Maharashtra. It was not meant for the BJP, but for the patients in the state.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/remdesivir-hoarding-row-mva-trains-guns-on-fadnavis-bjp-hits-back-101618862376008.html

In Tarn Taran grain market, Covid-19 protocols were not being followed and there was no arrangement for the hand sanitiser or face mask for the farmers, labourers and the commission agents.“I came here (Tarn Taran grain market) with my produce at around 6am on Monday. It is 4pm and I have not seen any official approaching me for the purchase. It appears that I will have to stay here for at least two more days,” said 85-year-old Sewa Singh of Palasaur village in Tarn Taran.Another farmer Bohar Singh (55) of Jarmastpur village in Tarn Taran said, “I have been in the mandi since Sunday. So far, no one has approached me for the procurement. I am finding it too difficult to get bardana. My 8-acre produce is lying in the open and what will happen if rain comes?”He said, “Like me, many farmers have been waiting for two days to get their produce purchased. Even those farmers whose crop has been purchased in the last three days have still not got the payment.”Amandeep Singh, 40, a farmer in Bhikhiwind village of Tarn Taran said, “I remained in Bhikhiwind mandi for three days before my crop was purchased on Friday. However, still I have not got the payment.”General secretary of Tarn Taran Arhtiya Association Yashpal Sharma said, “Barring Warehouse and FCI, the procurement agencies have no bardana. Due to this, the farmers and commission agents have been facing problems for the last three days. There has been no lifting from Tarn Taran grain market.”Avtar Singh (62), a farmer of Manawala village, who owns 15 acres of land, said he came to Bhagtanwala grain market with his 70 quintal wheat early Monday morning. “It is 4pm and there is no hope for the purchase because of non-availability of bardana,” he said.Bhagwanwala grain market’s Arhtiya Association president Amandeep Singh Chhinna said, “Nearly 5,000 metric tonne wheat has reached the grain market, but there has been zero lifting so far. Only Markfed and FCI agencies have purchased the crop of a few farmers. There is a big problem due to bardana.”Tarn Taran deputy commissioner (DC) Kulwant Singh said there is no shortage of bardana. He said, “There is a requirement of 25,328 gunny bags overall in the district and we have already got 13,197 bags. So far, only 1,770 bags have been used. We will soon get the remaining bags.”Tarn Taran district food supply controller Sukhwinder Singh said, “Out of the total pending ₹11 crore, payment of ₹2 crore has been released to farmers. There had been a technical glitch due to the new DBT system. We are trying to release the payment within 48 hours of the purchase.”Amritsar DC Gurpreet Singh Khehra said out of the total 21,002 metric tonne that has reached the grain markets, 11,015 metric tonne has been purchased. He said all the arrangements are in order. Amritsar district administration also released a press note of some farmers expressing their gratitude for the adequate arrangements for the procurement in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/gunny-bag-shortage-tardy-lifting-leave-farmers-stuck-for-days-in-tarn-taran-101618862375028.html

20-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra govt announces SOPs for housing societies with over 5 Covid-19 cases||Maharashtra government on Monday unveiled a series of measures to be adopted by housing societies which have been declared as micro-containment zones (MCZ) due to the presence of five or more Covid-19 positive patients in that building.The standard operating procedures (SOPs) presented by state chief secretary Sitaram Kunte pointed that societies have to interact with disaster management authority (DMA), who will enforce these rules. The rules prohibit doorstep delivery and add that milk, medicines and other essential products through e-commerce sites will be delivered at a common place like lobby or main entrance. It also mandates that private security guards need to wear personal protective equipment (PPE) kits, especially when interacting with delivery executives. The government has also ordered the closure of gymnasiums, swimming polls and other common areas in society premises. As per the SOP, societies are to restrict movement of residents as well as vehicles and also note down the purpose of people moving out of the MCZ.The Maharashtra Societies Welfare Association (MSWA) said putting the onus on the society will only create friction among members. “The government does not give any power to the society to penalise the offenders. In such circumstances few violators will spoil the entire harmony of the society,” said Ramesh Prabhu, Chairman, MSWA.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-govt-announces-sops-for-housing-societies-with-over-5-covid-19-cases-101618862312746.html
20-04-2021||Mumbai||Facing shortage of 20K Remdesivir injections: Maharashtra FDA minister||The state is facing a shortage of 18,000 to 20,000 vials of Remdesivir injections daily, according to Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) minister Rajendra Shingne, adding the pressure is due to the increase in the number of new Covid-19 cases.Most researches have shown Remdesivir, made affordable by India’s generics companies, and expensive by a thriving black market, to be largely ineffective in the treatment of the viral disease. “We need at least 60,000 doses of Remdesivir daily and are currently facing a shortage of 18,000 to 20,000 doses daily. Our problem is the number of patients is increasing daily,” said Shingne.He pushed for a mini lockdown in the state. “This will serve to reduce the number of patients and hence the pressure on this injection will decrease,” said Shingne.State health minister Rajesh Tope said the situation will improve in the coming days. “Five companies are producing Remdesivir injections and their production is being ramped up. In addition, we will give pharmaceutical companies in Maharashtra the permission to sub-contract the production of this injection,” said Tope.The situation in the state at ground level remains grim as relatives are frantically searching for injections. “My husband suffered from pneumonia apart from Covid-19 and we were told to get six vials of Remdesivir. We arranged two from a medical store in Dharavi, the next two were available at a medical store in Kalyan. We were lucky as the hospital arranged for the rest. We had to spend days to get them and we suffered lot of tension and stress,” said Sarika Mishra, whose husband was admitted to a private hospital at Malad.M H Saboo Siddique Hospital Medical at Bhendi Bazar received 200 vials on Saturday, which were exhausted within two hours. “More than 500 patients lined up for the injection, but we could not accommodate all,” said Owais Maniyar, owner of the medical store.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/facing-shortage-of-20k-remdesivir-injections-maharashtra-fda-minister-101618862193409.html

BMC said it has identified three locations for the same that includes Kanjurmarg, Malad and Sion. The additional beds are being created in the wake of cases increasing drastically in the city.According to BMC officials, by next month Kanjurmarg will have a jumbo centre ready, followed by Malad and Sion. 70% of the beds in these jumbo centres will be with oxygen facility while remaining will be intensive care unit (ICU) beds and beds with ventilator facility. Currently there are six jumbo centres —Dahisar jumbo centre, Kandarpada jumbo centre in Dahisar, NESCO jumbo centre at Goregaon, Bandra-Kurla Complex (BKC) jumbo centre, NSCI Worli jumbo centre and Mulund jumbo centre.According to BMC’s dashboard, bed occupancy in the city stands at 82% which means 17,005 of the total 20,608 beds are occupied. The occupancy rate for ICU beds is 98.44% for a total of 2,765 beds, followed by oxygenated bed with an occupancy rate of 93.53% for 10,227 beds and ventilator beds with 98.72% occupancy rate for 1,415 beds, as of Sunday. Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani said, “In the coming days, we will have around 5,300 additional beds in the city at three new jumbo centres. The one at Kanjurmarg will come next month followed by the ones at Malad and Sion. Also, currently there is no bed shortage... Our ward war rooms are giving 24-hour service to citizens to ensure every citizen gets a bed.”Apart from the jumbo centres, there are around 65,000 beds available in the city for quarantining mild and moderate cases. Overall, in the past 13 months, BMC has traced 49,622 citizens who have been high-risk or low-risk contacts of Covid-19 patients. Overall, five million tests have been conducted with a positivity rate of 11.50%.On Monday, 7,381 new cases and 58 deaths were reported in the city, pushing the tally to 586,867 and toll to 12,412. Mumbai’s recovery rate is 83.78% with 487,882 recoveries. Fatality rate is 2.11% and there are 85,321 active cases. Dr Siddarth Paliwal, a city-based physician, said, “It will always be better to be prepared with more ICU beds, ventilators as the second wave hits us, considering we were almost not able to cope up with the pressure. Though cases in the city have stabilised, I feel we should still be prepared for the third wave. In this case, being extra cautious will be good for controlling spread in the future.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-civic-body-to-set-up-3-new-jumbo-covid-centres-with-5-300-beds-101618862192738.html
20-04-2021||Mumbai||Over 90 million people from Maharashtra can get Covid vaccine||With the Centre allowing all above 18 years to get vaccinated from May 1, over 90 million from Maharashtra will be eligible for the vaccine shots. The state has welcomed the decision by the Modi government and said it will help contain the spread of the virus. About 73% of the population in Maharashtra is above 18 years old as per the 2011 Census. Maharashtra’s projected population is over 125 million. Maharashtra has inoculated 11.23 million people with 12.64 million doses till Monday evening. At least 60 million citizens or 50% of the population will now be added to the list of 33.8 million who are eligible for vaccination in the allotted categories of priority groups. In Mumbai, four million more will be added to the list of 4 million earmarked so far. “We are expecting to cover around 90 million people. This will help avert the potential third wave. Though the details are yet to come, vaccine manufacturers are allowed to supply 50% of their stock directly to the states. The stock will be again divided equally between private and government-run vaccination centres,” said Dr TP Lahane, director of Medical Education and Research. “As per data from My Family My Responsibility surveys, approximately 4 million more people in Mumbai will be eligible (for vaccination),” said Suresh Kakani, additional municipal commissioner, health, Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation. The state government is yet to ascertain the estimated cost they will have to bear for the inoculation and the period it would need to vaccinate the people. State health minister Rajesh Tope said that as the 18-44 age group is at high risk as their mobility rate is high. “The working class in this age group steps out of the house more than the others. The rate of the infection among them was on the rise. We hope they will overwhelmingly participate in the drive,” he said. Chief minister Uddhav Thackeray has thanked the central government for the decision. “I had requested Prime Minister Narendra Modi to allow all above 25 years for inoculation. I am happy that the PM positively considered our request. Maharashtra government will plan systematically to accommodate the younger lot. We expect adequate supply of the vaccine,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/over-90-million-people-from-maharashtra-can-get-covid-vaccine-101618862134836.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Patiala: 95% wheat harvested, only 50% purchased, 15% payments cleared||With 95 per cent of targeted wheat produce already there in mandis, shortage of bardana (gunny bags) has badly affected the procurement of the grain in chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh’s home district. Officials say over 50 per cent of the arrived produce is yet to be purchased. Also, of the crop procured till Monday evening, payments have been cleared for only 15 per cent. Farmers are protesting against the delay in purchase and payments for the last three days the long at different locations. On Monday, farmers blocked the Patiala-Cheeka road for more than three hours, while on Sunday they had blocked Patiala-Sirhind Road. Overall, there were protests in Bhadson Road, Patiala Rural, Sanaur, Patran, Nabha and every prominent grain market of Patiala in the last one week. “We are short of gunny bags. Against the requirement, I have got only 50 per cent of the packing material. How can I ensure smooth procurement?” said a government agency official, requesting anonymity. The procurement staff said that the decision to postpone procurement by 10 days was not a wise decision. “The harvesting in Patiala and Sangrur begins 10 days ahead of other parts of Punjab. The 10-day delay in procurement derailed the entire system,” said a Pungrain official. “There is chaos. No purchase. Official and commission agents are also helpless as they have no bardana. I am struggling to sell the crop. Such a thing never happened in the past for wheat crop,” said Nirmal Singh, who was among the protesters on Cheeka road. In all, different agencies have purchased about 5 lakh tonnes of wheat. “They purchased our crop only on papers and didn’t upload data online from where the payment is processed. Against due payments of ₹900 crore, only ₹149 crore was cleared till April 19. This reflects failure of the government,” said Angrej Singh, a farmer union leader.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/patiala-95-wheat-harvested-only-50-purchased-15-payments-cleared-101618862134312.html
20-04-2021||Other||Amid crisis, two Thane centres to get oxygen plants by Apr 30||On April 17, Waghbil resident Rajesh Shetty, 41, received a call from the private hospital where his uncle had been admitted. The hospital staff asked Shetty to either shift his uncle to another hospital or make provision for an oxygen cylinder, as the facility’s oxygen supply was depleting. With scarcity of beds in top hospitals and no information on oxygen providers, Shetty and his family had to run from pillar to post due to the situation. “We got a call in the afternoon that the present supply will last merely for two hours and we will either have to shift the patient to a different hospital or arrange for an oxygen cylinder. We did not know where to shift him on a Saturday evening as there is already shortage of beds. We had to call up many people to find a cylinder. By evening, we managed to find one, and the hospital had also found a cylinder. However, it’s a nightmare for common people to look for oxygen cylinder or shift their loved ones,” Shetty said. Most patients who need oxygen at various hospitals in the city are facing similar situation. On April 10, the Thane Municipal Corporation (TMC) had to shift around 30 patients from its parking plaza Covid-19 hospital to Global Hospital due to lack of oxygen supply in the parking facility. Though TMC claimed the problem would sustain only for one night, the parking facility continues to be devoid of oxygen supply. Another resident, Shyam Pillai, 38, was in a similar situation as Shetty on Sunday. “My friend’s mother was admitted to a hospital and needed oxygen. I had few numbers through different WhatsApp groups but when I tried contacting them, they quoted prices as high as Rs20,000 or Rs10,000 for one cylinder which is not priced beyond Rs1500. There seems to be a complete black marketing of oxygen cylinders. Finally an NGO arranged for a cylinder at the actual cost,” said Pillai. In Thane, of the 4,666 beds available within the city, 2,671 are oxygen beds. Of these, the 1,500 oxygen beds at the parking plaza and Voltas Company Covid-19 facility are lying vacant, as there is no oxygen supply. “We merely are getting 23 tonnes of oxygen at present while the requirement is 46 tonnes. At present, we have oxygen beds only at Thane Global Hospital where the 23 tonnes are supplied on a daily basis. We are unable to use the oxygen beds at parking plaza and Voltas facilities,” a senior TMC official said. The corporation has also planned to set up three oxygen plants in the city, two of which will be operational by April 30. “Thane Global Hospital and parking plaza facility will each get 20- tonne plants, which will supply oxygen to 175 cylinders in 24 hours. Apart from this, two oxygen tanks of 12 kilolitres, one each at an open place near Kharegaon in Kalwa and the other at Kausa in Mumbra are in pipeline. This will be liquid oxygen and permission needs to be taken from the Petroleum and Explosive Safety Organisation (PESO) to install them.” Thane guardian minister Eknath Shinde on Monday informed that with the three oxygen generator plants, Thane will be self-sufficient in its oxygen needs. “I had a meeting with deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar, where we have suggested that other districts should also plan for its own plants to deal with the oxygen shortage,” Shinde said. Meanwhile, private hospitals have approached the collector to help them with the oxygen shortage. Dr Santosh Kadam, president of Indian Medical Association, Thane chapter, said, “Private hospitals are reeling under shortage of oxygen. Last week, there were instances when due to lack of supply some patients were shifted to other hospitals on an emergency basis. It becomes difficult to coordinate and manage the oxygen supply at such times. We have requested the collector to keep emergency oxygen supply handy for such situations. This will ensure patients health remains priority.” (Inputs by Ankita Menon)||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/amid-crisis-two-thane-centres-to-get-oxygen-plants-by-apr-30-101618862072803.html
20-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra reports 58,924 Covid-19 infections||Maharashtra on Monday recorded 58,924 Covid-19 infections, pushing the count to 3,898,262, even as deputy chief minister Ajit Pawar decided to restrict timings of grocery shops for four hours between 7am and 11am every day. The state saw 351 deaths, taking the toll to 60,824. The surge has led to a sharp rise in active cases as its tally stood at 676,520. It comes to 17.35% of the total cases reported till date.The surge in Covid-19 cases has been on in Maharashtra for more than two months. For the past three days, it has been reporting its highest single-day spikes, including Sunday’s 68,631 infections. It has also recorded over a million cases (1,085,196) in the last 19 days and is likely to cross 1.5 million cases within a month, the officials said. Health experts, however, said the state is likely to hit a plateau in the next 10 days and a drop may start from the middle of next month.The stricter curbs imposed from April 14 have yet to show results, to which state health minister Rajesh Tope said they expect people to cooperate and strictly follow all restrictions. He also said that chief minister Uddhav Thackeray may take a decision on a complete lockdown if required.The decision was taken in a review meeting called to take stock of the situation. It was found people roam around unnecessarily the whole day in the name of buying groceries and the restriction in timings will prevent them from doing so, the officials said.An official order to this effect is yet to be issued.“The objective behind imposing stricter curbs is to break the chain of transmission, but for this, people’s cooperation is also needed. Now, directives have been issued to the police force for strict implementation of all restrictions. Today, in a meeting chaired by the deputy chief minister it was also decided to restrict timings of grocery stores,” the health minister said.“The state government will take a decision if it is found absolutely necessary,” Tope said, in response to a question over complete lockdown will be imposed.“Though there is no impact of the restrictions at present, in the next 10 days, the daily cases are likely to hit a plateau and by May 15 a decline in daily cases is expected. By June-end, daily cases are likely to come down reasonably. But to get the expected results, the state has to continue the stricter restrictions,” said Dr Subhash Salunkhe, state advisor on the Covid-19 and former director general of health services.In the last 24 hours, the state tested 221,626 samples and had a positivity rate of 26.58%. The overall positivity rate of the state stood at 16.19%. It has also reported recoveries of 52,412 patients on Monday, taking the tally of recovered patients to 3,159,240.Mumbai recorded 7,381 fresh cases in a day and its tally increased to 586,867. City’s active case count was 85,321. With 7,307 cases, Pune recorded the second highest cases across the state. Of them, Pune city and district recorded 4,616 and 2,691 respectively in a day.Meanwhile, the state inoculated 127,079 beneficiaries on Monday, taking the total of beneficiaries of the vaccination drive to 12,283,050 till date. The drive was conducted at 1,515 centres. “We are still receiving much fewer doses than what has been demanded from the Centre. The supply is not constant in numbers and also not as per our demand. We require 4 million doses a week to inoculate 500,000 beneficiaries a day, which is not possible to achieve if vaccine doses are not provided in adequate numbers,” said an official, wishing not to be named.Salunkhe said that the state needs to immunise at least 25 to 30% of its total population by June-end only by then it can avoid future troubles that are going to come because of this pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtra-reports-58-924-covid-19-infections-101618862013477.html
20-04-2021||Mumbai||Oxygen Express leaves, to be back in Maharashtra on Wed||The first ‘Oxygen Express’, a service of the railways carrying seven tankers that will get liquid oxygen to Maharashtra, departed from Central Railway’s Kalamboli yard on Monday evening. The seven tankers will ferry about 105 tonnes of liquid oxygen from Vishakhapatnam steel plant in Andhra Pradesh. The oxygen loaded tankers are expected to arrive in Maharashtra by Wednesday night, from where they will be transport using roll-on, roll-off (Roro) services. The train will move via Vasai Road, Jalgaon, Nagpur and Raipur Junction to Visakhapatnam steel plant siding in the East Coast railway zone. Further, the tankers will be loaded with liquid oxygen at the Visakhapatnam steel plant, put on the freight wagon and brought back to Kalamboli in Navi Mumbai. They will then head via road to different locations in Maharashtra. The railway ministry on Friday approved transportation of liquid medical oxygen in cryogenic tankers under its Roro model as a special case following request from the Maharashtra government. A green corridor with movement priority will be given to the Oxygen Express. “The express will be given priority. It will take nearly 35 to 40 hours to come back,” said a senior railway official. Transport minister Anil Parab said the responsibility to coordinate for the transport has been entrusted to his department. “The entire plan for transport oxygen is ready. The day the filled tankers return, a green corridor will be made to transport them on priority to districts that require them,” he said. State transport commissioner Avinash Dhakne said, “The tankers have been given the status of ambulances. There will be no toll for them, they need not stop anywhere, so it will be ferried faster.” Meanwhile, the government has pressed in its state transport bus drivers, as there is a shortage of drivers. “Some drivers have gone to their native places. In case there is a need, we will send ST drivers to transport oxygen tankers,” Parab said. Another similar Oxygen Express is also likely to be operated soon from Boisar railway yard in Palghar district of Maharashtra. Sumit Thakur, chief public relations officer, WR, said, “In Boisar, we are ready and waiting for the rakes.” The flat wagons being used can accommodate upto 32 tankers. Such trains are already being used for RoRo freight service of the Konkan Railway. “The Mumbai Railways division built a ramp overnight at Kalamboli yard to facilitate loading and unloading of tankers from flat wagons,” said Shivaji Sutar, chief public relations officer, Central Railway. Earlier, a meeting between railway board officials and state transport commissioners took place on the transportation of liquid oxygen.

The death toll has mounted to 1,190 after 13 patients died due to virus related complications. Of the new cases, highest 526 were recorded in Kangra. This is highest single-day spike ever in any district. Kangra has now replaced Shimla as worst-hit district. Kangra deputy commissioner (DC) Rakesh Kumar Prajapati said the situation has become alarming in the district. There is no big hotspot, but cases have been reported from entire district, he said. The DC said the situation may spiral out of control in three to four days if the surge doesn’t relent as the health facilities may run out of Covid beds. It is worth mentioning that Kangra also gets patients from surrounding districts of Chamba, Una, Mandi and Hamirpur. Meanwhile, Solan recorded 308 cases, Shimla 196, Mandi 185, Sirmaur 145, Kullu 88, Bilaspur 73, Una 68, Hamirpur 36, Kinnaur 35, Chamba 34 and Lahaul-Spiti two. Active cases shot up to 9,783 while recoveries reached 67,072 after 593 people recuperated. Kangra is the worst-hit district with 12,709 cases followed by Shimla having reported 12,451 infections to date and Mandi with 11,948 cases. Educational institutions to remain close till May 1 The Himachal Pradesh government has decided to keep all the educational institutions closed till May 1. Earlier, the schools and colleges were closed till April 21. The decision was taken in a high-level meeting presided over by chief minister Jai Ram Thakur to review the Covid-19 situation in the state. Teachers will also not attend their duties, it was decided. State government has also put complete ban on transfers of field functional staff. The state cabinet meeting would be held on April 22 wherein new curbs could be introduced. The CM directed the officials to enhance the bed capacity in hospitals and said that steps would be taken to ensure proper availability of oxygen and medical staff. He said that bed capacity would be enhanced in Nerchowk medical college, IGMC, Dharamshala zonal hospital, Tanda medical college, Sundernagar hospital and other health institutions. He said that health workers would be posted in appropriate number for care of Covid-19 patients. Strengthening mechanism of home isolation need of the hour: Jai RamHimachal chief minister Jai Ram Thakur on Monday said that strengthening the mechanism of home isolation was need of the hour as about 95% of the Covid-19 active patients were at homes. He appealed to doctors, medics, paramedics and Ashas to bring behavioural changes while treating and visiting infected people. He reviewed the Covid spread in Bilaspur district, and also assessed the drought-like conditions prevailing in the state. The CM said most of the doctors and other paramedical staff were working with great dedication to treat patients, but still greater commitment was required to ensure better results. He said effective data about the patients in home isolation must be collected and they should also be provided pulse oxymeter, hand sanitiser along other essential medicines. He said that active involvement of local pradhans in rural areas should be ensured to effectively coordinate with the family members of the patients. Effective mechanism must be evolved to regularly monitor health parameters of the patients in home isolation besides motivating the people, he added. Thakur urged the members of ‘vyapar mandals’ to extend support to the state government in its fight against the virus. He said the district administration must keep a watch on people coming back from religious congregations from other states. The CM said that a special campaign must be launched to ensure active participation of elected representatives of PRIs and urban local bodies, NGOs, mahila mandals, and yuvak mandals to strengthen the mechanism of home isolation. While reviewing the water situation in Bilaspur, Thakur said there was a need for rationing of water supply in a planned manner. He said that hand pumps could also be installed in areas which were facing severe water crisis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/himachal-logs-highest-daily-spike-in-covid-cases-1-695-test-ve-101618861953276.html

All of its 51 patients were on oxygen support and the only option was to discharge them to be accommodated in other facilities. Fortunately, a spare dura cylinder from Worli’s National Sports Club of India was brought to the Dharavi hospital just in time. “We were on the verge of making arrangements to shift out the patients,” said Dr Khalid Shaikh, the director of the Dharavi facility. “A delay of a few minutes could have put all our patients in danger,” he said. According to Dr Shaikh, earlier the dura cylinders used to be replaced thrice a day. But after the shortage hit, this process has been irregular. On Saturday night, even as the oxygen at the facility was fast depleting, it could manage getting only one empty cylinder replaced with a filled one. “The vendor was supposed to come back on Sunday morning, but he did not,” said Dr Khalid Shaikh. As Mumbai battles a lethal second wave of the pandemic, oxygen shortage has hit the city badly. Smaller hospitals, struggling to cope with the short supply, have been shifting out their patients to jumbo facilities. Many are spending hours calling vendors and fellow doctors in amid panic to arrange for oxygen cylinders. According to Dr Shaikh, his Dharavi facility has four dura cylinders. “We use three and keep one as a backup. But this was the first time that our back up was also getting exhausted,” said Dr Shaikh adding that the demand for oxygen beds has increased so much that he has to turn down more than 50 bed requests every day. “I am spending hours on the phone simply coordinating with vendors and other doctors to arrange for oxygen,” he said. One dura cylinder is equivalent to around 30 jumbo cylinders and one jumbo cylinder contains 7,000 litres of oxygen. With some patients requiring as high as eight to 10 litres of oxygen per minute, a jumbo cylinder can get exhausted in less than an hour. Mumbai has a little over 150 public and private hospitals managing Covid-19 patients. Their daily oxygen requirement had touched 235 metric tonnes in the ongoing second wave and with the rising number of patients, the demand for oxygen has risen further. “A lot of smaller hospitals have started admitting Covid-19 patients, without managing the oxygen back up,” said Dr Prince Surana, who is running a 75-bed Covid-19 hospital in Chembur and a 50-bed one at Malad. “We now know that oxygen is the key to saving the lives of Covid-19 patients. Just having a bed is not enough,” he said. At his Chembur facility, Dr Surana is currently utilising six dura cylinders per day, while the Malad facility needs 70 jumbo cylinders daily. “I am carefully managing with a buffer. But I have to refuse patients to manage the existing ones,” he said. Doctors across the city have formed WhatsApp groups to coordinate and loan cylinders at this time of emergency. For instance, Dr Surana sent five jumbo cylinders to a hospital in Ghatkopar where two cancer patients required oxygen urgently. “Most small facilities are running with such coordination and are alerting the groups when they have less than four hours of supply,” said Dr Deepak Baid, secretary of the Association of Medical Consultants. The shortage has left patients and relatives in a lurch. It took more than 50 hours for 73-year-old Mohammad Shaikh to get an oxygen bed. By the time he was shifted to the civic-run Bhabha Hospital in Kurla, his saturation had drastically fallen to 45%. “We were on the verge of a breakdown when we finally found the bed,” said Misbah Waghoo, Shaikh’s daughter-in-law. Shaikh was admitted to Kurla’s Arpan Hospital for treatment of bronchitis when he was diagnosed with Covid-19. While the hospital, a non-Covid facility, asked the family to shift him, panic struck when the facility exhausted their oxygen cylinders. “We managed an oxygen concentrator but it was not enough. His oxygen level kept dipping,” said Waghoo, adding that they spent hours coordinating with the civic war room, till they received a call for an oxygen bed. BMC run peripheral hospitals are the worst hit with the shortage due to the breakdown of the supply chain of their main distributor. On April 17, as many as 168 patients were shifted out after six hospitals -- Bhabha Hospital (Bandra), Bhabha Hospital (Kurla), Bhagwati Hospital (Borivli), Centenary Hospital (Govandi), MT Agarwal (Mulund), Trauma Hospital (Jogeshwari) -- ran out of oxygen. A day before, 46 patients were shifted out of Bhagwati Hospital to other jumbo centres.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/search-leaves-hospital-staff-kin-breathless-in-mumbai-101618861895746.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Rahiman Paani Rakhiye: 130 stepwells in rejuvenation mode in HP’s Dharamshala||With the unprecedented climate change affecting the glaciers on Dhauladhar mountain range and altering the rainfall patterns which would likely result in acute water crisis in future, Dharamshala authorities have turned focus to rejuvenate the old stepwells in the region.This month, Dharamshala block development office launched ‘Rahiman Paani Rakhiye’ project that is aimed at restoration of 130 stepwells in Dharamshala town and surrounding villages.Dharamshala is known for its temples, monasteries and waterfalls, but its ancient stepwells largely remained unnoticed, said Dharamshala BDO Abhineet Katyayan, who helms the ambitious project.These remarkable water bodies not only provide communities with water throughout the year, but also serve as active places of worship and are living heritage of Dharamshala.Katyayan said before outlining the project, the development office in collaboration with Centre for Urban and Regional Excellence (CURE), India, conducted a water assessment study in Dharamshala block covering nearly 200 stepwells. The eight-month study that completed in January this year has been submitted to University of Twente in the Netherlands and will feature in the European Union Programme for water conservation.The survey involved creating a GIS dataset of all stepwells mapping of discharge rate, use value and usage whether religious, agricultural or household.“More than 70 parameters relating to each stepwells were collected. During the study, it was also noticed that all villages covered experienced scarcity of water, particularly in summers,” said Katyayan, adding that the stepwells in the rural areas of Dharamshala are of two types — pool and flow.The pool type stepwell has broader surfaces, while the flow type is a narrow pipeline outlet. The streams in the region are also losing water and have become seasonal from perennial. Stepwells too have significantly lost discharge and quality of water has declined, pushing people to go to far-off places to fetch water.This eventually takes a toll on health and hygiene, animals, crop yield and burdens the family, especially women and children. On top of it, conflicts arise among the communities, he said. Katyayan said the current state of stepwells is also impacting the local ecology and biodiversity. It is a fact that stepwells contribute to the base flow in the streams, so depleting state of springs has led to depletion of flows in streams posing multiple water- related issues downstream, he added. “Our collective future depends upon how we address the issue of water and in order to do so, a pilot project, Rahiman Pani Rakhiye, has been launched,” Katyayan said.It involves restoration of one stepwell every month per panchayat. Many of the stepwells being renovated are closer to a century old.To ensure public participation, he said, special gram sabhas were organised in all 27 panchayats of Dharamshala block on March 22 and 130 stepwells were identified for the renovation.Under the project, four key factors will be taken care of — hydrological intervention, recharge intervention, storage and regulation.The activities to be undertaken in the restoration project involve reserving the source of stepwells, ensuring good connectivity; fencing; separating the bathing area and animal drinking space.The structures would also be covered. Besides, additional waste flowing water will be tapped by constructing a tank or soak pit nearby the stepwells.Proper drainage channels surrounding the wells will be constructed to minimise chemicals surface run-off. Plantation will be also done around the spring.The funds will be spent under MGNREGA in convergence with 15th finance commission.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rahiman-paani-rakhiye-130-stepwells-in-rejuvenation-mode-in-hp-s-dharamshala-101618861894674.html

He was convicted for planting one of the bombs which exploded at Matunga railway station, killing 28 people and injuring 122 others.“Ansari was on ventilator since the past few days as his condition deteriorated after getting infected with coronavirus. Doctors declared him dead on Monday afternoon,” said his lawyer, advocate Shahid Ansari.Ansari was arrested on July 20, 2006 for his role as a planter in the serial blast case wherein in a total of 188 people were killed and 816 injured. He was one of the convicts awarded capital punishment by the special court. The case is still pending before the high court for confirmation of capital punishment.Ansari, a resident of Bihar, grew up in poverty. He left his studies to help his family. Initially, he learned tailoring in his village at Basupatti. For better prospect, he left for Delhi where he worked at different garment companies. Then he left for training in Pakistan.As per prosecution case, Ansari was accused of providing aide to Pakistani nationals wanted in the blast case to reach Mumbai via Nepal. He also helped conspirators procure explosive materials. On July 11, 2006, seven blasts tore through first-class compartments of crowded local trains in a span of 11 minutes during the evening rush hour as millions of office-goers were heading home. The blast occurred between Khar Road-Santacruz, Bandra-Khar Road, Jogeshwari-Mahim Junction, Mira Road-Bhayander, Matunga-Mahim Junction and at Borivli.According to investigators, around 20kg of RDX were packed into pressure cookers, placed in bags and hidden under newspapers and umbrellas. The explosions were so powerful that they ripped through the double layered steel roof and sides of train compartments. Police said the suspects targeted local trains as they were crowded and security was not as tight. They divided themselves in seven teams, each consisting of a Pakistani national and an Indian national, and the bombs were taken to Churchgate station on July 11 by taxis.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/711-mumbai-train-blasts-death-row-convict-dies-of-covid19-101618861895168.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||‘There is no shortage of medicine or vaccine in J&K’||As J&K is witnessing a surge in Covid-19 cases, the Jammu and Kashmir administration has started to ramp up its infrastructure and add more Covid-19 beds. On Sunday, J&K had recorded 1,526 fresh infections, highest daily surge in last eight months. Currently, the Union territory’s case tally reached 1,46,692 and while death toll went up to 2,057. In April alone, 63 people have lost their lives to the disease. For the past six days, the UT has recorded above 1,000 cases. J&K had an all-time high of 1,698 daily cases on September 12, 2020.Even on Sunday, with 520 cases, Srinagar had the highest number of the new infections.Financial commissioner, health and medical education department, Atal Dulloo, said that they are ready to meet any challenge. “We are adding more beds to the hospitals across the UT. And, we don’t have any shortage of medicine or vaccine.”Kashmir director, health, Dr Mushtaq said that Jawahar Lal Nehru Memorial Hospital is the apex Covid hospital of the directorate and the oxygen generation capacity is being increased from 300 LPM (litre/minute) to 1,300 LPM.“Once complete, oxygen plant could be able to serve more high-risk Covid patients where high-flow oxygen is indicated,” he added. Currently, there are more than 11,000 active cases in J&K — the highest number of cases are in Srinagar and Jammu. Many experts, however, say if cases start going up further, then J&K administration could also face problems like other states.“We are prepared to some critical point beyond that capacity. So, everybody is praying that things remain under control in J&K,” said a senior doctor at Government Medical College, who is overseeing the Covid patients.Last week, Shri Maharaja Hari Singh hospital had designated six new wards for Covid patients due to fresh influx. “For us, this is a wake up call. If we make decisions this time, things can become easy,” said another doctor. The government had closed many Covid centres and hospitals and now, it is finding it difficult to get them open again, especially in Baramulla district.1,516 infections recorded in UTFor the second day in a row, Jammu and Kashmir’s daily Covid infections crossed 1,500 mark with 1,516 new cases, the highest single-day count since September 16, taking the Union territory’s case tally to 1,48,208.With six fresh fatalities — four in Kashmir and two in Jammu division — the toll reached 2,063, health officials said. Of the new cases, 748 are from Kashmir division while 768 are from Jammu. Among the Monday’s cases, 231 are travellers.So far, 69 people have lost their lives to the disease this month. This is for the seventh consecutive day that the UT has recorded over 1,000 cases. J&K had an all-time high of 1,698 daily cases on September 12, 2020.Officials said with 451 cases, Jammu had the highest number of new infections, followed by Srinagar with 383 cases, Baramulla 110, Reasi 102 (including 79 travellers),Udhampur 81, Anantnag 48 and Budgam 46. Four out of the 20 districts reported single-digit cases. The number of active cases, which has been rising steadily, reached 12,164, officials said. On Monday, 813 patients recovered, including 606 in Kashmir and 207 from Jammu. As many as 1,33,981 people have recovered so far, taking the recovery rate to 90.40% from the highest of around 98% which was seen in the first fortnight of February. Over 6.79 million Covid-19 tests have been conducted in the Union territory so far.Central University of Kashmir postpones some examsCentral University of Kashmir on Monday postponed some of the semester exams and rescheduled some other exams to ensure the attendance on the campus is thinner amid the surge in Covid-19 across the Valley. The university has also decided to impose a fine of ₹50 on students and ₹200 on employees if they are found without masks on the campus. The measures come a day after HT reported that students of the Central University of Kashmir have been demanding that their ongoing examinations should either be postponed or shifted online as the Covid cases were increasing. Alleging that the varsity officials are not even following Covid-19 protocols while calling them to campus for semester exams, the students said that this is putting their lives, and that of their families, at risk.Vice-chancellor of the varsity, Mehraj ud Din Mir, on Monday inspected the examination centres of the varsity across various campuses. “(He) expressed satisfaction over the arrangements made in view of the Covid-19,” said varsity PRO Arshad Meraj in a statement. The V-C was informed that strict Covid protocols are followed while conducting the examinations and “SOPs are followed in letter and spirit”. Mir, according to the statement, exhorted upon the employees of the health section of the university to take all necessary precautions and measures to ensure Covid-free examination.The statement informed that Tulmulla campus director Prof (Dr) Shahid Rasool, while accompanying the V-C at Tulmulla campus, informed him that Covid protocol officers have been designated in each department of the campus, who are given the responsibility to ensure full compliance with the SOPs issued by the government. He said that rapid antigen testing was conducted on Monday on the campus and the students and staff were tested on the spot for any possible case, but none was found infected. Posters and banners have been installed at entry points of departments and prominent places across the campus, informing the students, faculty and staff about the Covid SOPs. He further said a fine of ₹50 would be charged from a student and ₹200 from the employees found without wearing a mask on the campus at any time.Later, Prof Mehraj ud Din Mir chaired a meeting of the deans and discussed the issues related to re-emergence of Covid-19 cases. Some of the exams have been postponed and some rescheduled to ensure the attendance on the campus is thinner. The counselling of PhD aspirants for the recently held entrance test has also been postponed, the statement said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/there-is-no-shortage-of-medicine-or-vaccine-in-jk-101618861893450.html
20-04-2021||Other||‘Patients moved out of 6 Mumbai hospitals last week due to tech fault, not O2 shortage’||eeshanpriya@htlive.com Mumbai Additional municipal commissioner Suresh Kakani on Monday said that the patients moved out of six civic hospitals last week was not on account of oxygen shortage but due to a “technical fault”, even as officials of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) confirmed that the civic body will hire another oxygen supplier by the middle of the week to ensure a steady supply of liquid medical oxygen (LMO), needed to treat critical patients of the coronavirus (Covid-19) disease. The city, which had 43 ICU beds (out of 2762) and 20 ventilator beds (out of 1410) as of Monday night, has seen shortage of oxygen supply in many private and public hospitals. On April 17, the civic body had to shift 168 patients from six hospitals to jumbo Covid facilities and Rajwadi hospital, after the oxygen supply in these suburban hospitals ran out. Mumbai’s daily demand of 235MT oxygen is currently being met by two vendors who supply to the BMC. A third will be added by Wednesday to ensure that the supply does not fall short. “The problem we had three days ago was because of non-refilling of the existing cylinders on time. We have seen that the cylinder-based system is not completely workable,” Kakani said. He added that the problem did not arise due to a shortage of oxygen in the city. “There was a technical fault in the manufacturing plant [oxygen suppliers] due to which we were on short supply of oxygen,” Kakani said. Since the cases began rising in the city since mid-February, oxygen demand has increased by about 20%, official figures show. BMC uses oxygen that is available in cylinders which are re-filled from mega plants (cylinder-based system). Some facilities also use the oxygen directly from mega plants, such as the one at Seven Hills hospital, which the manufacturers fill. BMC is studying the cost implications of setting up an oxygen plant, as well as the availability of oxygen in the market versus demand to consider if it should set up its own treatment plant. “Oxygen manufacturing requires a specific ecosystem. Its power requirement is tremendous, and it requires an industrial area. In Mumbai, finding such an area is not possible. We are still examining the possibility [of setting up BMC-owned oxygen manufacturing plants within hospital premises or in the city limits], and no decision has been taken in this regard yet,” Kakani said. Private hospitals across the city are also facing a shortage of oxygen supply. “Private hospitals have their own vendors in the market from whom they directly purchase oxygen for their patients. Due to the recent short supply of oxygen in the market in general, some private hospitals have approached the BMC and asked for oxygen. BMC has provided it,” an official from the civic health department said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/patients-moved-out-of-6-mumbai-hospitals-last-week-due-to-tech-fault-not-o2-shortage-101618861832776.html
20-04-2021||Mumbai||How healthcare workers in Mumbai Metropolitan Region are coping with Covid second wave||On a balmy Sunday afternoon, 30-year-old Dr Vishal Rakh, a frontline worker at the city’s BYL Nair hospital, is taking a quick shower. All the while, he can hear his phone ring. In the 10 minutes he was away from his phone, he missed 12 calls and 15 text messages, none of which were personal. Over the next 20 minutes, Rakh patiently responded to messages and returned the calls, taking requests for bed, making allotments to patients, and helping relatives of Covid patients with contacts of pharmacists. Having tested positive for the virus last week, he himself is in quarantine, but he works remotely. Rakh, an assistant professor at Nair hospital, is responsible for the vaccination drive his hospital, as well as the allotment of beds to Covid-19 patients as part of the E ward’s war room. Nair hospital has allocated 104 undergraduate medical students—all supervised by Rakh—to the war room facilities of the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC). Each of the city’s 24 war rooms receives calls from incoming patients seeking a bed; the war rooms also reach out to Covid positive patients, once the BMC receives their reports. Apart from civic-run hospitals, the BMC also has command over all ICU beds and 80% of the other category of beds in private hospitals. In short, every allotment of a bed or a ventilator takes place through the war room. Hospitals are required to update the centralised dashboard signalling the number of beds, ventilators and ICU facilities, twice a day. Rakh’s job involves categorising the patients based on the severity of their symptoms using the triage method. He then allots beds accordingly to dedicated healthcare hospitals and Covid-care centres. A cool bath, a quiet dinner and uninterrupted sleep at night are luxuries that frontline workers, like Rakh can’t afford. On an average, Rakh fields around 500 calls a day but a single missed call notification can turn into a trigger for him. “Last year in May, I had confirmed a bed for patient coming from Chembur. However, upon reaching the hospital, he died waiting for his turn in the queue. So, I feel like every call I miss is one person I could have helped,” he said. Most healthcare workers can’t access their mobile phones in the Covid-19 wards because Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) gear makes it difficult for them to operate one. By the end of their eight-hour long shifts, the doctors we spoke to said that they often find close to 200 missed calls and countless messages seeking beds, oxygen or advice on Covid medication. During the first wave, several health care workers —doctors, nurses, technicians and support staff—pulled up to 12-hour shifts at a stretch and stayed quarantined from their family members; now as the second wave hits the country and stretches our health care infrastructure to its limit, frontline workers are facing the brunt again. Making frequent calls to see if there are any beds available for patients needing urgent attention has become the new normal for 47-year-old Smita Mohite, sister in-charge of the casualty department at Rukminibai civic hospital in Kalyan. These days her workday begins at 9am and goes well past 5pm. Two days ago, when a 50-year-old suspected Covid patient was breathless, Mohite looked frantically for a bed for him. However, when she managed to find a bed after two days, she finally decided against moving him, as his condition had deteriorated. “By the time I found a bed for him, the patient was gasping. So, then I had to find a more advanced set up for his treatment, but he died right in front of me. The worst part is that even though I found a bed, I could not help him,” said Mohite, who has been associated with the hospital for the past 24 years. “To see them (patients) in pain and not able to find a bed has been straining on my mental health but I have to keep trying,” said Mohite. Mumbai has been consistently recording around 8,500 cases on average a day. And while the city is inching towards a crisis in beds – the BMC dashboard that is updated daily, on Sunday showed an 82.5% occupancy of beds, and 98.4% occupancy of ICU beds – it is currently facing a severe shortage of oxygen. Last week, the BMC had to shift 168 patients out of six civic-run hospitals to jumbo centres; private hospitals aren’t immune either. What this means is that while hospital beds may be available, medical grade oxygen, needed for critical patients, may not be available. For a majority of health care workers, however, it’s a limitation to the care that they can provide – and that’s hitting many of them hard. Dr Jalil Parkar, a city-based pulmonologist consulting at Lilavati Hospital, said, “Doctors have always felt a moral obligation towards patients, but it has been heightened during the pandemic, so much so that it has started affecting our mental health. There’s a sense of guilt I feel for not being able to take a call.” “The work just doesn’t end. Treat Covid patients, go on rounds, perform procedures, teach students and the cycle repeats,” Parkar said. Doctors, nurses and support staff agree that the second wave is much more challenging that the first one. “We are dehydrated, exhausted and constantly worried of missing a life-saving call,” said Rakh. Taking a bathroom break is a hassle as it entails removal of PPE and changing into new ones. To minimise this hassle, they limit their liquid intake but profuse sweating under the layers of protective gear leads to severe dehydration. Along with Rakh, two more doctors from Nair hospital tested positive for the virus last week. They are among the 2,000-odd frontline workers at the hospital who are yet to receive the vaccination. Their names couldn’t be uploaded to the portal due to a technical glitch. The vaccination drive in Maharashtra kicked off on January 16 for healthcare and frontline workers, which was later extended to senior citizens and those above 45 years of age. As on Sunday, the BMC has administered 1.96 million doses. Among healthcare workers, 172,000 have received their first dose and 93,642 have received the second shot. “Paristhiti gambhir hai. Logon ko samajhna chahiye (The situation is grim. People must understand that),” Usha Jagtap, a scale-4 employee at the government-run Kasturba hospital, said in a fatigued voice. In the 13 years of her career, she has not seen a disease of this magnitude. Through the day, ward boys and caretakers end up making four to five rounds of the ward, distributing meals, at times feeding patients, filling water bottles, giving medication, ferrying patients in and out of wards, taking them for tests, and getting reports among a myriad of other tasks. “I think our biggest job is to help patients cheer up. In a gloomy ward, it is important to whisper positive thoughts into patients’ ears. Only if they eat well, take care, will they get well soon,” Jagtap said. Jagtap said she had no time to think about herself. “This is the worst outbreak of any virus that I have seen in my life. I can imagine how frightened the patients must be. So I tell myself that I must comfort them, for my sake and theirs,” said Jagtap, who is worried that she may contract the disease or worse, give it to her son and nephew, who reside with her. Tushar Parmar, Critical care specialist at Apollo hospital in Navi Mumbai, feels the burden of the pandemic more keenly. “Aside from treating patients, we have an added responsibility of being spokespersons. With family unable to be near them, it is our duty to convey their messages to the family. After the rounds, the next duty is to call each family member and convey about their condition and their messages,” Parmar said. “They are not mere patients anymore as I know much more about them. During the course of stay, we interact a lot and, in the process, start to know them even more. Since they don’t get to physically meet any family member, it becomes our responsibility to make them feel comfortable psychologically, too,” Parmar said. The longest stay one of the patients had stayed was for 90 days in the beginning of the pandemic. One of the toughest decisions that Parmar had to take was to send his eight-year-old daughter away to his parents in Gujarat as cases rose—something he had done last year as well. She had only returned to him and his wife in September last year and life was just about returning to normal. “She is safer there rather than with us as the situation is getting worse now,” said Parmar, whose wife is also a doctor. Rakh’s family in Beed —parents, grandparents and a younger sister— has seen him only once over the past year. “While we are proud of him, we miss him, too. He has little time, so we have very quick calls to see how he is doing,” says his father Ashruba. As the number of cases began to rise last year, the BMC increased the number of beds steadily – from 16,000 in June to 18,000 by October. The civic body also set up six jumbo centres in various locations: in September 2020, the number of beds available for moderate to serious patients in these facilities was 14,927; by April 17, 2021, the number has risen to 20,608. However, even as the health care infrastructure has seen an incremental increase, the caseload has grown tremendously. In the first wave, the city saw its highest single day peak on October 7 with 2848 cases; the highest single-day peak of 11,302 in the second wave was recorded on April 4. Rucha Salgaonkar, matron at Nair Hospital pointed out that health care is spread thin. “Manpower shortage is a major problem for us at the moment. Of the 580 nurses and staff we have on board, 90 are on leave for genuine reasons,” said hospital. While it is ideal to have one or two staff members per bed, now, health care personnel are spread thin to two staff per 20 beds.” Jibin TC, a home care nurse and president of the Maharashtra chapter of the United Nurses Association, said, “Ideally, there should be one nurse for six patients in a ward and one nurse for each critical patient. But now there is one nurse for 50 patients. How are we supposed to do justice to job of caregiving?” At a time when healthcare providers are dealing with a more infectious variant of the virus, the general public has done precious little to ease their burden. “Wearing a mask is the most efficient way of containing the spread of the virus. How difficult is it to wear one?” a furious Parkar asked. “Try wearing a PPE kit for an hour. You don’t have to do anything. Just sit. You’ll get a taste of what we are going through,” Jibin said.

20-04-2021||Other||Distribute 10,000 Remdesivir vials to Nagpur immediately: Bombay HC to state||The Bombay high court on Monday directed the Maharashtra government to supply at least 10,000 vials of Remdesivir to Nagpur city immediately, as well as ensure its fair and equitable distribution to dedicated Covid-19 hospitals through their in-house pharma units. As Remdesivir was not supplied on Sunday, and only 400 vials were supplied on Saturday to merely three hospitals, the Nagpur bench of HC on Monday afternoon directed its urgent supply to facilities in the city, while describing the situation as “very alarming” amid the steepest-ever rise in the number of Covid-19 patients. HC refused to accept the apparent “discriminatory and step-motherly” treatment to Nagpur patients who received insufficient quantity of Remdesivir as compared to those in districts like Thane and directed the immediate supply of the much-needed drug to the city by Monday night itself. Passing this important order, a division bench consisting of justice Sunil Shukre and justice SM Modak reminded the state of its “solemn obligation and constitutional duty to protect precious human life”. “There has been a disparity in the distribution of Remdesivir to various districts, and this life-saving injection is not being released in proportion to the requirements,” HC tersely observed. About the ongoing blame-game between the Maharashtra government and Centre over the supply of Remdesivir, the court directed the two authorities to place on record the details about the demand raised by the state and response of the Centre to facilitate its procurement. “Considering the patient load in Maharashtra, the state needs more quantity of Remdesivir, oxygen and other life-saving drugs,” the bench further stated. Amicus curiae (friend of court) Shreerang Bhandarkar and counsels for the interveners, Tushar Mandlekar and M Anil Kumar, informed HC that the Thane collector had allocated 5,328 vials for 2,664 patients, which is two Remdesivir injections for one patient, while at Nagpur, there was an allocation of 3,326 vials for 8,215 patients. As per protocol, six vials are required for the patients, including two vials on the first day, they stated, while demanding immediate respite to the patients who are already admitted. Besides, supply should be more for cities like Nagpur where spike is more. The amicus blamed the state for not paying the drug-manufacturing companies and cited it as a major reason for low supply. However the state, on behalf of its lawyers, vehemently denied the allegation and maintained that it was doing its best to procure life-saving drugs. About the oxygen shortage, HC directed the district collector and municipal commissioner to grant immediate permission to private hospitals which are ready to install oxygen-generating plants using air separation technique. The court also directed to make available 500 sq ft space required by some of these hospitals to install oxygen plants on payment at market value, if they apply for permission to use the adjoining place belonging to the state government or local authority. On the plight of the Covid-19 patients waiting outside Government Medical College and Hospital, Nagpur, and other hospitals, the court directed the municipal corporation and district administration to set up temporary healthcare facilities for such patients and use the district mining and district planning committee (DPC) funds with immediate effect. Meanwhile, as many as 6,364 fresh Covid-19 cases were reported on Monday in Nagpur district while 113 deaths were recorded, the highest single day deaths since the pandemic broke out last year.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/distribute-10-000-remdesivir-vials-to-nagpur-immediately-bombay-hc-to-state-101618861532730.html
20-04-2021||Mumbai||Maharashtra: Hold online exams or promote medical students, say parents||Days after state minister for medical education Amit Deshmukh and Maharashtra University of Health Sciences (MUHS) postponed second and third-year medical exams, social media is abuzz with mixed reactions. While many were happy with the state’s decision, especially in view of rising Covid-19 cases across the state and country, some feel this delay will once again affect the next academic year. “These exams were originally supposed to take place in January-February, but were delayed due to rising cases. Now the government has scheduled them from June 2, but there’s no guarantee the situation will be better by then as well,” said Sudha Shenoy, parent of an MBBS student. She added that instead of postponing exams any further, authorities should instead hold online exams or promote second and third-year students based on their performance through the year. Last week, several medical students had approached MUHS stating that at least 500 students from several medical colleges in Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Satara and Solapur are currently in quarantine after testing positive, while many have family members who tested positive recently and have to follow the two-week quarantine period. This exam affects between 40,000-50,000 students across the state. Delay in the exams also means there will be delay in completing the next academic year. For courses which are already reeling under delays of the last academic year, this means more chaos. “Every year, final-year MBBS students graduate and start internship by first week of May. If this delay persists, hospitals will have no interns coming in May 2022. Authorities need to keep this in mind as well,” said Brijesh Sutaria, a parent. Admissions to various professional courses were delayed this year and one of the worst affected lot were those aiming for undergraduate nursing courses in the state, admissions to which got over recently. “Every year hospitals get first-year nursing students as interns to help them, and this is important especially at a time when the country is in the middle of a pandemic. But due to the delay in admissions, no first-year intern has made it to hospitals, leaving the hospital staff overworked,” said Dr Ramling Mali, member of the Indian Nursing Council, and former president of Maharashtra Nursing Council.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/maharashtrahold-online-exams-or-promote-medical-students-say-parents-101618861472838.html
20-04-2021||Mumbai||Mumbai: With new academic year starting, complaints of fee hikes resurface||As some schools reopen for the new academic year this month while others gear up for it, complaints about fee hikes have resurfaced among parents of students from city schools. Over the past few days, parents of several schools have complained about the schools imposing a fee hike for the academic year 2021-22. For instance, nearly a thousand parents from Podar International School in Powai wrote to the school recently to revoke a fee hike put in place this year. “At a time when there are demands of reducing fees among parents across the country, the school has imposed a hike amid the pandemic. When parents resisted the hike and demanded a rollback, the school blocked access to e-books and student resources and also levied a fine of ₹200 per day for non-payment of advance fee,” said a parent. In its official response the school, however, said, “As a support to our parents, the school deferred the PTA (parent teacher association) approved fee hike from 2020-21 to 2021-22. The School remains in full compliance with all government and high court mandated fee guidelines. The school is providing comprehensive virtual classes and conducting online exams for all students irrespective of fee payment.”Last week, a Mira Road-based school was issued a notice by the education department asking the school if it had adhered to norms with respect to fee hike. “The process of approving fee hikes should be transparent and all norms with respect to the same should be followed,” stated the notice. Recently, the Maharashtra government had invited suggestions on amending the Maharashtra Educational Institutions (Regulation of Fee) Act, 2011 and received 2,825 suggestions, majority of which are from parents. The government-appointed committee will now examine the suggestions and will give its report in this regard.A government resolution (GR) released on May 8, 2020 stated that schools should stay all fee hikes for the current academic year and have to allow parents to pay fees in instalments. The GR was, however, stayed by the Bombay high court on June 26, 2020 in response to a petition by several organisations of private school owners. The court lifted the stay in March this year and said the state may initiate action against a school in case of complaints from parents or even take suo motu cognisance.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/mumbai-with-new-academic-year-starting-complaints-of-fee-hikes-resurface-101618861412788.html

The woman, Sangita Shirsat,34, was unable to locate her son while an express train was approaching along the track. Shelke ran towards the boy and picked him up before the train could approach and saved him. The video of the incident went viral following which railway minister Piyush Goyal applauded Shelke’s action in his tweet. On Saturday around 5pm, the boy was heading home with his mother. While walking on platform no. 2, they both lost the direction and the boy fell on the track along. A Central Railway official said, “At the same time we heard the horn of a fast train coming, but we were far from the spot. The woman was unable to locate her son. Shelke without thinking about his own safety ran towards the boy and within three seconds he managed to save boy and then jumped to the platform. He would have lost his life too if he was even a bit slower.” Goyal in a tweet said, “Very proud of Mayur Shelke, Railwayman from Vangani Railway Station in Mumbai who has done an exceptionally courageous act, risked his own life and saved a child’s life.” Shelke used to work as a pointman at Karjat for five years and was transferred to Vangani around eight months ago. He said, “We were waiting to send signal to Udyan Express towards Mumbai. I saw the visually-impaired woman and her son on the platform walking towards Karjat side. Suddenly the boy came to the corner of the platform and lost his footing and fell off. I was 60 metres away from them and saw the express approaching.” He added, “I realised that even though we will show the red flag, the express could not come to a halt immediately, as the distance between the boy and the train was too less and the speed of the train was high. I decided to save him at any cost. I ran towards him and put him on the platform. I was scared at the same time as the train was near me, but I gathered all my courage and jumped up. I was clueless what I had done and realised the impact only when everyone around me started appreciating.” He was felicitated by local GRP and passenger’s association for his bravery.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/mumbai-news/railway-staffer-risks-life-to-save-6-year-old-boy-near-mumbai-101618861172651.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Capital back in lockdown||A six-day lockdown will be in force in Delhi till the morning of April 26, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced on Monday, citing a relentless surge in Covid-19 infections that has risen by close to 600% in the last two weeks and has now inundated hospitals and triggered a shortage in critical medical supplies.Kejriwal said the city added 23,500 new cases in the last 24 hours, and that the curfew was necessary to allow enhancements in the numbers of beds and supplies of life-saving drugs and oxygen to catch up. The city, according to Delhi’s health bulletin on Monday, now has 76,887 active cases. It also registered a record 240 deaths -- the first time casualties were above 200 in a single day.“Delhi’s health system is now unable to take in more patients. It is now necessary to impose a lockdown in Delhi from 10 pm today to 5am on Monday (April 26). Essential services will remain open, food and medicine shops will be allowed to operate, weddings will be limited to 50 guests. A detailed order will be released soon,” he said.The decision was taken in a Covid-19 review meeting held between Delhi’s lieutenant governor Anil Baijal and Kejriwal on Monday morning. “The situation of Covid-19 in NCT of Delhi has again been reviewed and it has been observed that there has been a very sharp increase in Covid-19 cases along with very high positivity rate over the last few days and therefore, it is felt that in order to contain the fast spread of the virus, a curfew needs to be imposed in the territory of NCT of Delhi, except for essential activities/services, as an emergency measure, in order to break the transmission chain of Covid-19 virus and for the overall well being and safety of the people of Delhi,” said the order issued shortly afterwards by chief secretary Vijay Dev.While the restrictions are not entirely a curfew, movement will be prohibited unless someone is seeking or providing essential services, medical help, or has to go to a handful of exempted workplaces, such as government offices. People in some of these categories will require an e-pass from the government, the order added, while others will need to show an identity card. The rules are almost identical to those for the weekend and night curfews that have been in place in Delhi.According to HT’s dashboard, the average number of cases added in the Capital each day has risen 586% from April 4 till April 18. In this period, the average test positivity rate – a proxy for how large an outbreak may be beyond case numbers – has risen from 3.57% to 19.39%. The daily positivity rate, according to the Monday bulletin, was 26.12%.The Delhi government’s Delhi Corona mobile application showed that as of 10.30pm, only 26 Covid-19 ICU beds with ventilators (and an equal number without ventilators) were vacant in the city. More than 83% of the city’s nearly 20,000 hospital beds for Covid-19 patients were occupied, the app showed.This surge prompted a consensus among citizens to support a lockdown-like period of restriction. The Confederation of All India Traders (CAIT) said the decision was a “much-needed” step. “The CAIT was continuously demanding a lockdown in Delhi... We have urged the L-G and the CM to nominate five nodal officers dividing Delhi into five zones namely Central, East, West, North and South Delhi to collaborate with CAIT team leaders for ensuring smooth passage of supply of essential goods to Delhi people. According to our estimate, each day there will be a business loss of about ₹600 crore per day in Delhi during the curfew,” said Praveen Khandelwal, secretary general, CAIT.Some trader groups, who were initially opposed to restrictions because of their economic toll, on Sunday suggested they will voluntarily close some markers to arrest the surge.Also read: Delhi govt forms 12 oxygen audit committees to plug wastageThe Delhi government also issued a circular advancing the summer vacation in all schools. The vacation, earlier scheduled from May 11 to June 3, will now begin from April 20 and schools will remain shut till June 9.“Since the past 15 to 20 days we have been demanding a complete lockdown in Delhi as we had sensed the trouble when numbers started rising from March end. Now, the things have been delayed to such an extent that the entire system has collapsed with no beds, no ventilators, no oxygen, no medicines all over the city. The Delhi government must take extra caution on the issues which may lead to huge mortalities. It must act on war footing to save precious human lives. RWAs of Delhi will support the government in every possible manner,” said BS Vohra, president of east Delhi RWAs.The Delhi government and the L-G’s office also began efforts to discourage migrant workers from attempting to return to their cities in order to avoid the sort of crisis that took place during the nationwide lockdown one year ago. “I am requesting all migrant workers with folded hands to stay where they are. This is a small lockdown. It is just a matter of six days. If you leave, you’ll waste your time, energy and money in going and coming back only. I am there for you. We will take good care of you all. Please do not leave the city. I am hoping we will not need to extend this lockdown any further if all of you cooperate with us,” Kejriwal said at the briefing. Senior officials in the L-G office said Baijal has asked officials to strictly address the issue of migrant workers who might start congregating at transit points across the city to leave for their home states.“If you ask me, the lockdown became inevitable. The situation was getting out of hand; the medical system was collapsing. Patients were running from pillar to post to get a bed. It was also very difficult to get an RT-PCR test; you cannot wait for four to five days for a result when the disease course is of 10 days,” said Dr GC Khilnani, former head of the department of pulmonology at AIIMS. “A lockdown was required to curtail the transmission. Yes, there are economic consequences but this is a matter of life and death. The policymakers waited for the infection to get under control but it did not, so a lockdown had to be implemented,” said Khilnani, a former member of Delhi’s first committee on Covid-19 control and management.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/capital-back-in-lockdown-101618859919506.html
20-04-2021||Other||Kanpur hospitals also battle oxygen crisis||Like other parts of the state where cases of COVID-19 are rising, the crisis of oxygen, essential for treatment of positive patients, has reached a critical level in Kanpur.The demand for oxygen in Kanpur hospitals is about 75 tons against the availability of 18-20 tons. Long queues of people could be witnessed outside the gas plants in hopes of getting a cylinder, the cost of which is ₹13,000 for a 10 litre one.Only two types of cylinders are available, one is 4.5 litres for ₹9000 and other is 10 litres.At one gas plant in Dada Nagar about 1000 people nearly broke into late on Sunday night. Worse is the oxygen kit has disappeared from the surgical and medical stores.Enormity of crisis could be gleaned from the fact that most of the new Covid-19 hospitals are wary of admitting the patients. As of now four of them have started admitting while others continue to prepare for ‘admission’.“How can we admit people when there is no oxygen available with us; we cannot admit people to die, who will be responsible?” one of hospital owners said on condition of anonymity.“Oxygen suppliers are asking to bring cylinders for refill, they will not deliver. Pressure from officers on us is immense to admit but they aren’t able to provide oxygen,” said owner of another hospital.A team from government and food and drug department inspected these hospitals on Monday to assess the requirement of oxygen. Last night Kanpur received just 20 tons from Rae Bareli, but doctors said it was not going to solve the problem at hands.In LLR hospital on Sunday only 44 cylinders against 216 was given. The demand in the hospital is for 310 cylinders. “Never before I saw people pooling in money to bring oxygen concentrator to keep people alive, it happened in LLR,” said an employee.Four people, according to him, allegedly died in the hospital for want of oxygen.Three women who could not get admission in hospitals passed away as they could not get oxygen. One of them was Neelam Chaurasia, former chairperson of Ghatampur municipal body.Her husband Ajay Chaurasia said the hospital ran out of oxygen and it could not be arranged. “I saw her dying every minute,” he said choking with emotions.At present, Kanpur has 1340 beds, all of them are occupied, and another 890 are expected to be added once all the 19 new hospitals become functional. The crisis worsened when the drug department diverted oxygen to nearby districts on Sunday all of sudden. Chief medical officer (CMO) Dr AK Mishra blamed drug department for exacerbating the problem. He said FIR would be lodged after identifying the people for the goof up.Drug inspector Sandesh Kumar Maurya said the efforts were underway to maintain a good back up of oxygen. The industrial oxygen suppliers have been asked to provide it to the hospitals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/kanpur-hospitals-also-battle-oxygen-crisis-101618860092565.html
20-04-2021||Other||One-time lockdown in Punjab’s Mohali district on April 21||Punjab chief minister Capt Amarinder Singh on Monday announced a one-day lockdown in Mohali for Wednesday.It was the Chandigarh administration that had proposed this one-time measure across the tricity on the occasion of Ram Navami. UT adviser Manoj Parida approached the chief secretaries of both Punjab and Haryana with the proposal after discussions with the administrator on Monday. “Imposition of lockdown simultaneously in the tricity will help break the chain of infection. There is a public holiday on Wednesday, and government offices will be closed. So, I requested for the one-day lockdown. Even the weekend curfew would have been more successful if it were imposed in the entire tricity,” he said.However, awaiting the Haryana government’s response, the Chandigarh administration in the evening decided to take the final call during the Covid review meeting on Tuesday. “In case, the lockdown is not imposed in Panchkula, even we will not do so,” said Parida, while adding that no long lockdown is planned in the city. Later, Haryana home and health minister Anil Vij confirmed that the state government will not impose any lockdown on Ram Navami on Wednesday and will only strictly enforce the existing restrictions on gatherings in indoor and outdoor spaces. Repeated attempts made to get Parida’s comment on the fresh development proved futile.More curbs in the districtHowever, on the day Capt Amarinder Singh announced various curbs across the state, it also gave nod to the Wednesday lockdown in Mohali. Mohali deputy commissioner Girish Dayalan said the lockdown will begin at 12am on Wednesday and last till 12am on Thursday. Only shops providing essential items will remain open, while people have been advised to carry their identity cards while moving out for work and essential errands. All kinds of gatherings are also banned, said the DC.Meanwhile, the chief minister has ordered stricter restrictions across Punjab, beginning Tuesday, including extension of night curfew timings (8pm to 5am, instead of 9pm to 5am) and closure of all bars, cinema halls, gyms, spas, coaching centres, sports complexes. Restaurants will remain closed on Sunday and will provide only takeaway and home delivery from Monday to Saturday. “The new restrictions, which also include closure of all malls, shops and markets on Sundays, coupled with the ones imposed earlier will remain in effect till April 30. All weekly markets have also been ordered to be shut down,” said Dayalan.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/onetime-lockdown-in-punjab-s-mohali-district-on-april-21-101618858953110.html

20-04-2021||Other||Delhi: 31 community Covid care centres identified, to add 541 beds||New Delhi:District administrations on Monday identified at least 31 community Covid care centres as on Monday that would add 541 oxygenated beds to the city’s Covid health infrastructure. This comes two days after Delhi lieutenant governor Anil Baijal asked all district magistrates (DMs) to arrange oxygenated beds in residential colonies by roping in resident welfare associations (RWAs). “The response has been quite positive so far as DMs have identified 31 such sites with a total bed capacity of 541 as on Monday. Of these, at least 6 sites comprising 57 beds were opened and made operational on Monday itself. All the remaining sites will be operational by Tuesday,” said a senior government official involved in the project.The official added that the Central government has also taken note of this model and is likely to advise other states to do the same as well. On Saturday, the L-G had asked all 11 DMs to identify and create small facilities at the RWA level where a willing doctor from the local community could supervise the provision of oxygen to needy patients in the colony with an aim of assisting them in the critical period when their SpO2 levels start falling. “Such cases could then be addressed without going to hospitals that are already overburdened with more serious patients,” said a senior government official who attended the meeting the L-G and chief minister Arvind Kejriwal had with all DMs. On Sunday, the Delhi government issued guidelines for gated residential complexes, which want to set up Covid care centres and isolation facilities. The guidelines state that a doctor residing in the residential area concerned or one engaged by the RWA or NGO should act as the medical officer of such a facility and each patient will have to be clinically assessed for symptoms. The medical officer will also be entrusted with monitoring the health of each patient round the clock, even though there will be routine inspections by district medical officers and surveillance officers, said the guideline document.The guidelines bar the use of such facilities for patients with moderate and severe symptoms, the elderly, children below the age of 10 years, pregnant women, lactating mothers and patients with comorbidities. The guidelines further said that such facilities cannot allow “intermixing” of suspect and confirmed cases and each of them have to be mandatorily linked to the district surveillance teams and at least one ambulance service provider, the document said.Further, it states that such centres can be set up in community halls, common utility areas and vacant flats which are “location-wise” isolated. The centres need to have separate entry and exit passages, adequate ventilation, ACs to be maintained at the range of 24-30 degrees and relative humidity of 40-70%.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi31-community-covid-care-centres-identified-to-add-541-beds-101618858772409.html

The man seen in the video is purportedly heard saying that the unavailability of the drug has led to the price shooting up to ₹25,000 per vial.HT could not independently verify the contents of the sting video put out by the news channel.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/two-held-for-remdesivir-black-marketing-after-sting-operation-by-news-channel-101618858654593.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Rising Covid cases put pressure on health infra in Panchkula||Amid a steep rise in active cases, nearly 90% of beds dedicated to Covid-19 patients have been occupied at the four government facilities in Panchkula district. The number of active cases has gone up from 953 at the beginning of April to 2,176 on Monday. Critical cases are also on the rise, as 18 patients have succumbed to the virus in just 19 days this month, as compared to 12 in the first three months.With limited health infrastructure, the authorities are finding it challenging to treat the critical patients.According to data shared by the Panchkula health department, as on April 18, there were 252 beds for Covid patients at four hospitals, of which 226 beds were occupied. Also, 30 beds were occupied at Covid care centres.Meanwhile, of 35 beds with ventilators, 23 are occupied, and of 225 oxygen beds, 216 are occupied. However, according to the authorities, there are additional 106 isolation beds with oxygen, if needed.Dr Jasjeet Kaur, civil surgeon, Panchkula said: “The requirement of beds, especially for patients needing oxygen and ICU services, is increasing. All four Covid hospitals in Panchkula are under constant pressure for admission of serious patients not only from Panchkula but neighbouring areas too. Efforts are being made to add more beds.”According to the data, nearly 60% Covid-19 patients admitted in hospitals here are from outside Panchkula.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/rising-covid-cases-put-pressure-on-health-infra-in-panchkula-101618858654150.html
20-04-2021||Other||Only 19 ICU beds available for Covid patients in B’luru||Bengaluru Less than 20 intensive care unit (ICU) beds and those with ventilators are available in Bengaluru on Monday, according to data from the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike, showing the stretching of hospitals by the virus surge that has made it harder for critically ill Covid-19 patients in the city. According to the real-time bed availability portal of BBMP, out of the 608 beds allocated for Covid-19 treatment in government and private medical facilities with ICU/ICU-V (ventilators), 589 are occupied, leaving just 19 beds for critically ill persons. Data shows that out of the total 5,847 beds allocated across public and private medical facilities, 4,471 are full as of 6.23 pm on Monday, leaving 1,376 vacant. Though the Karnataka government has claimed that there are enough beds in Bengaluru, its own data says otherwise, painting a grave picture of the city’s crumbling and inadequate healthcare infrastructure amid a raging pandemic, experts and elected representatives said. Bengaluru is recording around 10,000 new Covid-19 positive cases a day and even if 5% of them require hospitalisation, the system could be overburdened, or could collapse, they said. Apart from the stress on the healthcare system, there are reports about blackmarketing of critical drugs like remdesivir and hoarding of oxygen tanks, which have added to the challenges in containing the pandemic. The situation in other parts of the state also continues to deteriorate. “For last 2 days, there is a huge shortage of #Remedisivir in BRIMS (Bidar Institute of Medical Sciences); 286 Covid patients urgently need this injection to save their life. What was the reason behind this shortage? Who will take responsibility if something wrong happened with patients?” tweeted Eshwar Khandre, the Congress working president and legislator from the border district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/only-19-icu-beds-available-for-covid-patients-in-bluru-101618858652426.html

This has resulted in the complete chaos & confusion in the State,” Siddaramaiah said in a second post.He added that the health crisis was worsening every day in the state.Karnataka continues to report a surge and its capital city, Bengaluru, is among the worst affected regions in the country.The active case count in Bengaluru stands at 103,178 while the state has 142,084 active cases at the moment.Bengaluru reported 97 fatalities in the 24 hours on Sunday that took the death toll across the state in a single day to 146, according to the daily bulletin of the state health department.Siddaramaiah said there were no hospital beds in government hospitals and there was no stock of oxygen cylinders.“There are no beds for coronavirus patients at government hospitals, (and) people cannot afford private hospitals, there is no oxygen stock and there is a shortage of life saving Remdesivir drug,” Siddaramaiah said.He alleged that the pandemic was used for corruption by the government.Karnataka Congress president DK Shivakumar said the government should earmark ₹30,000 crore for the health sector, stop all other activities and focus its resources on resolving the crisis on hand.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/siddaramaiah-asks-cm-to-release-covid-white-paper-101618858592328.html

It also sought help from doctors residing on campus to provide consultations.In an email sent to students, faculty and staff members on Monday, IIT-Delhi director V Ramgopal Rao said, “As you know, we are facing an unprecedented crisis. Medical infrastructure within the campus and outside is unable to cope with the rise in cases. Institute is working with the Delhi government to create a Covid centre within the campus which will be used strictly for Covid positive persons on the campus, including students. While those living in homes are allowed to isolate themselves, all Covid positive students living in hostels right now have to go to Delhi government Covid centres. This is causing huge issues for students. We are working with the local administration to see if we can create a facility on campus…hopefully, we will be able to work out something in the next day or two.”Also read| HC wants curbs in 5 UP cities; not possible: GovtIIT-Delhi currently has around 23 active Covid cases, of which 15 are students.The “unavailability of doctors” on campus is a major problem, Rao said. “Four of our own doctors are down with Covid and we do not have enough doctors for consultations. I am aware that spouses of many faculty, staff, and PhD students are registered medical doctors serving in various clinics and hospitals. Parents of many students are also doctors.”He appealed to these doctors to come forward and help. “If you have a doctor at home, and are willing to provide one hour a day for consultations to the IIT-Delhi community, please provide their contact details. Institute will contact them and connect them with the persons who need help and advice,” the director said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/iitdelhi-to-set-up-covid-care-facility-on-campus-for-its-residents-students-101618858536370.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Delhi govt forms 12 oxygen audit committees to plug wastage||The city administration on Monday constituted 12 “oxygen audit committees”, one in each Delhi government hospital meant for Covid-19 treatment, to plug wastage of oxygen and suggest ways to economise its usage. The audit committees, each comprising two doctors, have been formed a day after Union minister of commerce and industries Piyush Goyal said states must keep the “oxygen demand under control” and “stop its wastage”. “Oxygen is a critical ingredient in the management of certain categories of Covid-19 patients and its consumption has undergone a quantum increase with the admission of a large number of critically ill Covid patients who require oxygen support. This has led to an unprecedented demand for oxygen throughout the country leading to supply lines getting stressed. In such a situation, it is necessary that the stocks of oxygen, and its consumption, are closely managed and rationalised,” read the order issued by the Delhi health department on Monday.As per the order, the government has deployed a total of 24 doctors in 12 government hospitals. A team of two doctors has been deployed in each of the 12 hospitals, which include GTB hospital, Burari hospital, Lok Nayak hospital, Dean Dayal Upadhyay hospital, RGSS hospital and so on. It further stated that the committees will carry out an audit of daily stock receipts, consumption and balance stock of oxygen, both liquid medical oxygen (LMO) and cylinders. “It will ensure that the use of oxygen for management of Covid patients is rational and as per the prescribed treatment protocols. It will also identify areas of wasteful consumption and suggest means of economising consumption. The committees shall submit their reports to the nodal officer in-charge of the hospital, not later than 5pm every day,” read the order. On Sunday, Goyal told news agency ANI that states need to stop wastage of medical oxygen. “We need to use medical oxygen rationally and stop its wastage. Patients should be given the required amount of oxygen only. There are reports of oxygen wastage and about patients being given oxygen even when they don’t need it. We’ve urged state governments to keep an eye on this,” he had said. “State governments should keep demand (for medical oxygen) under control. The demand-side management is as important as the supply-side management. Containing Covid-19 spread is the responsibility of state governments and they should fulfil this responsibility,” Goyal had said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-govt-forms-12-oxygen-audit-committees-to-plug-wastage-101618858536986.html

To pre-empt any such attempt, the Bharatiya Kisan Union (Ugrahan) and Samyukta Kisan Morcha have called upon its members to reach Tikri Border from April 21 to intensify the agitation.Samyukta Kisan Morcha, a collective of over 40 farmer unions, announced a week-long “resistance week” beginning Tuesday and invited more farmers to reach the protest site with the slogan “phir Dilli chalo”.Also read: Deep Sidhu sent to jail for 14 days in R-Day case“Because it is the harvesting season, many farmers had returned to villages.

20-04-2021||Chandigarh||Containment zones remain on paper in Chandigarh||The Chandigarh administration on Monday declared 49 more micro-containment zones, taking the total to close to 200. Amid an unprecedented growth in Covid-19 cases, the Centre has been insisting on creation of localised containment zones to restrict the spread of infection.However, a reality check done by Hindustan Times on Monday revealed that unlike the first wave of pandemic, when strict perimeter control was observed across containment zones, this time around there is extreme laxity in enforcement. While affected houses in Sector 33 were barricaded and residents were not allowed to venture out by two district administration employees deployed there, in Sectors 22 and 23, there was no barricading or restrictions. According to the administration’s April 13 order, wherein these areas were declared micro-containment zones, the curbs are to last till April 30. One of the residents in Sector 23 even came out of the house to talk to this correspondent. When asked why there were no barricades, the resident, requesting anonymity, said: “We are no longer part of the containment zone.” A resident of the neighbouring house, also declared a micro-containment zone, said: “No barricades were erected here. Anyway, my parents have now tested negative; so there is no such requirement.” At houses in Sector 22, residents confirmed that there is no perimeter control. “But we don’t go outside the house as we have been told not to,” said one. During the first wave in September 2020, when active cases had peaked at 3,171, the administration was deploying police to strictly enforce the containment zone restrictions. Now, when the active cases stand at 3,804, there were zones in Sectors 22, 23 and 35 where not a single personnel, either from the administration or from police, was posted to enforce the curbs. Dr Rajesh Ahuja, former head of the department of community medicine and public health, PGIMER, said: “Strict perimeter control is very crucial to achieve full benefits of the containment zone.”According to the central guidelines, the local district, police and municipal authorities are responsible to ensure that the prescribed containment measures are strictly followed. There has to be strict perimeter control to ensure that there is no movement of people in or out of these zones, except for medical emergencies and for maintaining supply of essential goods and services. UT adviser Manoj Parida said: “It is the failure of officials concerned. We will get it checked and rectified. There should be strict perimeter control at containment zones.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/containment-zones-remain-on-paper-in-chandigarh-101618858475217.html

20-04-2021||Delhi||Summer break in schools starts early, to end June 9||The Delhi government on Monday ordered all public and private schools in the national capital to begin their summer vacation three weeks earlier than planned, given the unprecedented rise in Covid-19 cases. All schools will shut for the summer from April 20 to June 9. The direction, however, has not gone down well with several private schools.The order came on a day when chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a week-long curfew in Delhi to tackle the spread of Covid-19.Heads of schools have been asked to share the information among stakeholders. During the break, schools will be allowed to call in vacation staff as per the work requirement.Several private schools, however, said the reschedule would disrupt the teaching-learning process.Terming the order “wrong”, SK Bhattacharya, president of Action Committee of Unaided Recognised Schools, said, “The existing rules suggest that the education department cannot decide on the dates of summer vacation of private schools. Schools have the liberty to do that. We will have a discussion among ourselves on whether we will accept the notification or challenge it.”Tania Joshi, principal of The Indian School, said, “Private schools have had the autonomy to declare vacations as per their schedule. Earlier, the department issued guidelines and advisories but this order calls for strict compliance. We are waiting for some clarity to decide on online classes on Tuesday.”An education department official said private schools can continue online classes as long as “children are not called to the premises”.“Announcing summer vacations in all schools comes under the ambit of the directorate of education. What usually happens during summer vacations — activities or extra classes — may still be done provided children are not called physically,” the official said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/summer-vacations-advanced-delhi-schools-shut-from-today-till-june-9-101618858413084.html

Noida has started producing around 60 kg of biomedical waste daily which is generated on account of Covid-19, officials of the Noida authority said. In the beginning of March this year, the city was producing 10 kg of Covid waste that includes PPE kits, masks, and gloves, they said, adding that it’s a challenge to handle such waste produced in housing societies and other residential areas across the city. The officials said that it has laid down a system to handle the hazardous medical waste. “A private agency is tasked with collecting the biomedical waste in black dustbins placed in vehicles that collect waste from every household. The Covid waste quantity has increased rapidly this month to 60kg daily,” said SC Mishra, senior project engineer, Noida authority. After collecting the Covid waste, the authority hands it over to a private agency that treats it scientifically at a Meerut facility, said the officials. On Sunday, Gautam Budh Nagar had reported 700 new cases, pushing the overall tally of positive cases in the district to over 30,000-mark. According to the state’s Covid-19 bulletin, the district on Sunday also reported three deaths due to the infection, taking the number of fatalities to 103.In November last year, the production of Covid waste was about 30 kg daily when a daily average of 128 positive cases had been reported, said the authority officials. The authority is also taking help of apartment owners associations (AOAs) and other social groups in proper collection of Covid waste to contain the outbreak. “We are encouraging the social groups in societies to appeal to residents to dump the Covid waste only in designated bags so that it is disposed of scientifically,” said Rajiva Singh, president, Noida Federation of Apartment Owners Associations (NOFAA), an umbrella body of AOAs. Meanwhile, the Noida authority has decided to impose ₹5,000 fine on those, who were found dumping the Covid waste at undesignated places. “Dumping the waste at places, which are not meant for it, will invite fine. We appeal to citizens to cooperate in proper disposal of the waste,” said Mishra.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/as-covid-19-cases-increase-disposing-biomedical-waste-becomes-a-challenge-for-noida-authority-101618858293042.html

20-04-2021||Delhi||Video of couple without masks and e-pass abusing cops goes viral, arrested||A husband and wife, seen in a widely shared video purportedly “misbehaving, abusing and provoking” a police team in central Delhi’s Daryaganj, after being stopped for violating the weekend curfew and not wearing masks on Sunday, have been arrested, the Delhi Police said.According to the police, the couple was sent to jail after a court refused them bail.“Police personnel working on ground 24x7 have been sensitised to deal with the public in a humane manner, while enforcing the guidelines firmly. Their politeness is not a sign of weakness but a demeanour adopted to serve the people better. However, law breakers shall be firmly dealt with,” Chinmoy Biswal, Delhi Police spokesperson, said on Monday after the video was widely shared on social media.The police identified the couple as Abha and her husband Pankaj, both residents of Patel Nagar.According to the police, the couple was driving through Daryaganj on Sunday afternoon when a police team on the road signalled them to stop to check their movement pass.“Neither did they have a pass nor were they wearing masks. When we decided to fine them, they began misbehaving and abusing us,” Biswal said.Visuals showed the woman shouting at the policemen and daring them to act against them. Her husband intermittently took on the police, the video purportedly showed.“The two violators were arrested under the Indian Penal Code sections 186 (voluntarily obstructing public servant in discharge of public function), 188 (disobedience of order promulgated by public servant), section 269 (unlawfully or negligently does any act which likely to spread the infection or disease), section 353 (assault or use of criminal force against public servant in the execution of his duty) and a section of the Delhi Disaster Management Act,” the police spokesperson said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/video-of-couple-without-masks-and-e-pass-abusing-cops-goes-viral-arrested-101618858233828.html
20-04-2021||Noida||14% samples taken from GB Nagar in April test positive; 3 more die of Covid||NOIDA: Out of the nearly 35,000 samples collected for reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) tests from Gautam Budh Nagar in April 2021, approximately 5,000 people (14.28%) have tested positive for Covid-19. The test reports after April 16 are yet to come, said the officials.Meanwhile, taking a serious note of the surge in the cases in Gautam Budh Nagar, the district administration has extended the night curfew from 8 pm to 7am till April 30, which was earlier imposed till April 17.Suhas LY, district magistrate (DM), Gautam Budh Nagar, said that just like the previous order, all government and private educational institutes (except medical, paramedical and nursing), including coaching institutes, shall be barred from holding physical classes during this period. “However, all the examinations, including the practical tests shall be held as per the schedule, and are exempted from this order. There shall be an intensive enforcement of wearing masks and other Covid-19 protocols in public places, including workplaces, by the police, the incident commanders, and the departments concerned. The curfew restrictions will be effective between 8 pm and 7 am till April 30,” the DM said.Attributing the higher number of testing for the surge in the cases, the DM said that the total number of cases is always directly proportional to the number of tests done. “To have complete control on the viral spread, we are trying to detect as many cases as possible. Currently, the district administration’s main aim is to provide beds to the critically infected patients. For this, we have started 25 exclusive cells in the integrated Covid-19 control room in Sector 59 where 21 doctors and 31 administrative and police personnel have been deployed. While Dr Sunil Dohre will take care of patient allocation and admission, bed availability in the hospitals will be monitored by Dr Chandan Soni. The overall co-ordination between these cells will be monitored jointly by chief medical officer (CMO) Dr Deepak Ohri, chief development officer (CDO) Anil Kumar Singh, and a senior police officer designated by the Gautam Budh Nagar commissioner of police (CP),” the DM added.Providing the details of the standard protocol to be adopted in the containment zones to stop the spread of Covid-19 in the district, the DM said that special instructions have been issued for all the residential areas, including housing complexes and resident welfare associations (RWAs), that share spaces like gyms, swimming pools, banquet halls, parks, community centres, corridors, elevators and stairs, parking areas, cafeterias, meeting rooms, and conference halls among others.“As the viral infection can spread relatively faster among residents and visitors, all the people living in containment zones should inform the same to their societies and the RWA presidents / secretaries, and not go outside their homes till the containment zone is denotified. Only asymptomatic staff or visitors shall be allowed entry. Individuals must maintain a minimum distance of six feet in common places, as far as feasible, and use face covers or masks at all times,” he said.The DM also said that the entrances of housing complexes should have mandatory provisions for hand hygiene like sanitiser dispensers, thermal screening, and frequently touched surfaces be cleaned properly at least twice in a day. “The number of people in elevators shall be restricted, duly maintaining physical distancing — for which proper markings should be made on the floor of the elevators. Surveillance activities are allowed in containment areas to trace suspected patients, such as people suffering from influenza-like illnesses, those having symptoms of severe acute respiratory illnesses, and people having comorbid conditions. Besides, every RWA and housing complex will appoint a Corona vigilance officer for each building/ tower, who will report the positive cases with lab reports, and any violation made by Covid-positive people to the office-bearers of the apartment complex,” the DM said, adding that the residents can report their problems regarding Covid-19 on this link: tinyurl.com/GBN-COVID-HELP, or call on the helpline number: 18004192211.Also, following several messages on the social media platforms for many hours on Monday, eminent Hindi crime fiction writer Surendra Mohan Pathak, and his son Sunil Pathak were allocated beds in the Covid-dedicated facility in Sharda Hospital. CMO Dr Ohri said that the writer and his son had to wait as the bed allocation team was exploring the best possible option for them. “They had to wait for two hours due to some technical issues. Pathak and his son have been admitted to Sharda Hospital. We are providing them the best possible care, and pray for their quick recovery,” Ohri said.Meanwhile, with 425 fresh Covid-19 cases reported on Monday, the overall tally of the positive cases in the district has hit 30,955. The death toll has reached 106 with three deaths in the past 24 hours. With 3,386 active cases, Gautam Budh Nagar is on the ninth position among Uttar Pradesh districts recording maximum number of active cases.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/14-samples-taken-from-gb-nagar-in-april-test-positive-3-more-die-of-covid-101618858233147.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||CBI to probe ₹207 crore alleged ‘scam’ in DUSIB||The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) has registered a case against some unknown officials of Bank of Baroda and Delhi Urban Shelter Improvement Board (DUSIB) for alleged misappropriation of ₹207 crore, people familiar with the development said.DUSIB is an autonomous body under the Delhi government. To be sure, the agency has not named any individual as accused in its First Information Report (FIR), registered on April 16 under sections related to forgery and criminal breach of trust.The CBI conducted a surprise check at the accounts department of DUSIB on April 13 and found irregularities after scrutinising the documents.It is alleged that DUSIB has invested its surplus funds in the form of fixed deposit receipts (FDRs) in different banks and diverted the same into suspected fake account/FDRs.Also read: Can’t continue to obstruct others, SC tells farm leadersIn a statement, CBI spokesperson R C Joshi said, “It was alleged that during the year 2020-2021, DUSIB has transferred money from five different accounts of DUSIB maintained in Central Bank of India, Vikas Kutir, New Delhi to Bank of Baroda, Paharganj branch for the purpose of investing in FDRs, but the unknown officials of DUSIB in conspiracy with the unknown officials of Bank of Baroda diverted the said funds to the tune of ₹207.99 crore (approximately).”A Delhi government spokesperson did not comment on the matter,In a statement, DUSIB CEO Vijay Kumar Bidhuri said, “It’s a common practice in government departments to invest in FDs... This decision and procedure followed by the internal finance division is not directly handled by the CEO. Here, CBI is saying the FDs issued by Bank of Baroda are fake and only three are genuine. It’s a matter of investigation and DUSIB also wants that truth should come out at the earliest.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/cbi-registers-case-in-alleged-corruption-by-delhi-shelter-body-101618858232411.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Curfew announcement in Delhi leads to queues outside liquor shops||The announcement of a week-long curfew in the national capital on Monday resulted in long queues outside liquor shops throughout the day even as police struggled to ensure social distancing outside these shops.Similar to the lockdown last year, alcohol shops are not on the list of essential services that are allowed during the curfew. This essentially meant that residents would be able to buy alcohol in Delhi only after a week and so began the rush to stock up before the curfew kicked in on Monday night. Satyarth (goes by a single name), a lawyer who was among those who queued up at a shop in north Delhi’s Shalimar Bagh, said, “My flatmate and I stood in queue for over an hour before we bought enough bottles to last us through the week.” He said the shopkeeper did not put any limit on purchase per customer.Satyarth said he decided to step out despite the high risk of infection as he had to shell out more last year to purchase alcohol from bootleggers during the lockdown.Vinod Giri, director general, Confederation of Indian Alcoholic Beverage Companies (CIABC), termed the rush a “panic reaction”, “driven by people’s memory of lockdown extensions last year”.“For lakhs of people all over India, alcohol is a part of their regular consumption basket and they do not wish to be deprived of it. While we hope that the public and shopkeepers in Delhi adhere to Covid appropriate behaviour, steps to reassure public would also help. The decision of Maharashtra (government) to allow home delivery of liquor, for example, has helped contain panic buying there. We urge the Delhi government to think of similar steps,” he said.Police officers said they deployed more personnel outside liquor shops when they learnt of the long queues. “We acted against shopkeepers and customers wherever we felt that social distancing norms were being flouted. In New Friends Colony, for example, we registered a case against the owner of the shop. We also prosecuted some customers,” said RP Meena, deputy commissioner of police (south-east).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/curfew-announcement-in-delhi-leads-to-queues-outside-liquor-shops-101618858173510.html
20-04-2021||Noida||Ghaziabad: People wait in queues, complain of ‘missing’ samples and reports||Ghaziabad: Many people who arrived for Covid-19 test reports at the government testing centre at MMG Hospital on Monday complained of “missing samples and test reports”. According to them, they were “asked to give their swab samples again”. People, who joined a long queue at the centre as early as 7am on Monday, waited till 1 pm for the submission of the samples, they said.At present, the district government is conducting Covid-19 tests at about 30 locations in Ghaziabad. Of the 30 centres, 13 are static booths where residents can walk-in and get themselves tested for free. The Covid-19 centre at MMG Hospital is one of the static testing centres. HT visited the site on Monday and noticed both men and women standing in long queues, and they hardly maintained social distancing.Nisheeth Nigam, a resident of Vasundhara, who has been suffering from a recurrent fever for the past few days, came to the testing centre on Monday morning. “I came here on Sunday as well, and my rapid antigen report was negative. They had asked me to come on Monday for the RT-PCR test. Today, when it was my turn, they said that the process for RT-PCR testing was done, and they conducted another rapid antigen test. I tested positive... I waited for someone to call me and suggest some medicines, or take stock of my health conditions, but nobody called. It did not get any medicine till now,” he said.As per the recent directions, Covid-positive patients are to be provided with medicine pouches at testing centres.Manish Kumar, a resident of Govindpuram, arrived for collecting his test report on Monday, but was told that samples he gave earlier were missing. “I had given my samples at the testing booth in Sanjay Nagar hospital on April 13. On Monday, I came to collect my report, but I was told that the samples might have been misplaced. They asked me to stand in a queue again and submit my swab samples again. I waited for more than two hours, but the queue did not move fast,” he added.Like others, Philip Abraham from Bagu Colony in Vijay Nagar also stood in the queue since early Monday morning, and it was not his turn till 1 pm. “The staff testing the people came here at 10.30 am, while we have been waiting in the line from as early as 7 am. I had given my samples on April 16, and they asked me to come on April 19. When I came here, they told me that my report got misplaced somehow,” Abraham said.When the issue faced by the people at the testing centre in MMG Hospital were taken up with Dr RK Gupta, district surveillance officer, he said that he will get it checked, and conduct an inquiry about the “misplaced reports and samples”. “There may be some shortcomings at the centre, and we will get these inquired, and sort it out. At present, a lot of people are coming to get tested, and this is a big issue for the staff and the infrastructure... However, we are conducting tests as per the given target, and our daily average is about 5,500 to 6,000 samples,” said Dr NK Gupta, chief medical officer (CMO).As per the directions last week, the Uttar Pradesh government directed the health authorities in Ghaziabad to conduct 3,500 rapid antigen tests, and another 1,700 RT-PCR tests on a daily basis.Ajay Shankar Pandey, district magistrate, did not comment on this.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/ghaziabad-people-wait-in-queues-complain-of-missing-samples-and-reports-101618858172337.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Beds replace blackboards as 4 schools turn hospitals||To augment bed strength in view of the unprecedented surge in Covid-19 cases, at least four government schools in the national capital will be converted into Covid hospitals.Apart from linking these schools to hospitals in their respective districts, the government has also tied up with several non-government organisations (NGOs) to provide the schools with food, oxygen, beds, medicines, and PPE kits for all health care staff.On Sunday, chief minister Arvind Kejriwal and deputy chief minister Manish Sisodia visited Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya Rouse Avenue on Deen Dayal Upadhyay Marg to inspect the 125-bed hospital set up in around 14 rooms of the school, including classrooms and the auditorium.The premises has been divided into two zones. Patients will be in the red zone, and the administrative work by medical staff and school authorities will be done in the green zone.The school’s principal Devendra (who goes by one name) said, “The classrooms still have drawings by our children and it is a little unsettling to see desks getting replaced by beds. But we have to focus on helping people during this pandemic. While one part of the school will function as a hospital, the other part will be for urgent administrative work.”The Rouse Avenue school auditorium has around 45 beds, with oxygen concentrators and oxygen cylinders.The makeshift hospitals will have separate zones for men, women, and children. Upon entering the hospital, triage will be done by the medical staff and basic details of the patients will be recorded. Dr Ravikant Singh, the founder of Doctors For You (DFY), said they will maintain the facility at Rouse Avenue along with hospitals at two stadiums and a banquet hall.Three other schools in north-east district have been attached to Rajiv Gandhi Super Specialty Hospital in Tahirpur and Guru Tegh Bahadur Hospital. However, beds and other infrastructure are yet to be set up in these schools.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhiat-least-four-govt-schools-to-be-converted-into-covid-hospitals-101618858112354.html
20-04-2021||Noida||Lockdown fears: Huge rush at ISBT Kaushambi as migrants leave for home towns||Ghaziabad: Panic gripped daily wagers and labourers on Monday, as they swarmed the Kaushambi Interstate Bus Terminal (ISBT) in Ghaziabad hours after Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal announced a six-day lockdown in the national capital. The Kaushambi ISBT was a hotbed of large-scale migrant labourers in 2020, when the coronavirus-induced lockdown was imposed.Thousands of migrants, all natives of Uttar Pradesh, have been returning to the state since Monday afternoon, and the officials of the Uttar Pradesh State Road Transport Corporation (UPSRTC) said that they expect a massive gathering till late night. Majority of the people at the ISBT were, however, heading to their homes. They said that the lockdown could be extended, like the one imposed last year, and that they do not want to wait for six more days to know whether the lockdown will be lifted or not.Delhi is already under a weekend curfew, and now, a 10 pm to 5 am restrictions are in place till April 30.“My wife died due to tuberculosis during the lockdown last year. So, I had sent my minor daughter home, and now I’m returning to my hometown with my minor son. The eatery where I worked and prepared rumali roti will also remain closed... I hope to go back to work as soon as possible. Otherwise, all the money I have will be spent during the lockdown,” said 32-year-old migrant worker Mohammad Adil. Adil, who is a native of Bareilly in Uttar Pradesh, lives in Delhi’s Shastri Park.Hemant Kumar, 22, also rushed to the ISBT in search of a bus to his home in UP’s Auraiya. “In 2020, the daily wagers suffered irreparable losses due to lockdown. Many waited for a month, but the lockdown was extended for three months. So, we are not taking any chance this time. I had come here in search of a job and was staying with my brother in Seelampur. Now, I’m returning home. There was a weekend lockdown for two days, and now, another announcement of a week-long lockdown,” Hemant said.On Monday, the sole foot over bridge connecting the ISBT in Anand Vihar was fully packed with migrants. “It took me more than 30 minutes to cross the foot over bridge and reach the bus station. There was a mad rush towards the bus station, and no one adhered to social distancing. Nobody maintained Covid-19 protocols... I had joined a call centre in Delhi’s Laxmi Nagar three months ago. I earned ₹10,000 per month. I called my parents after the announcement of the lockdown today. They have told me to return home. I resigned from my job today,” said Prince Dubey, who is a native of Etawah.Meanwhile, the private bus operators made hay by overcharging passengers amid the Monday chaos. Suraj Kumar, attendant of one of the private buses, was seen searching for passengers at the ISBT though their buses operate from EDM Mall near the Delhi-Ghaziabad border. “The seats are full, and there is a huge demand for buses. We are charging ₹2,200 for Gorakhpur, and ₹1,400 for cities like Kanpur and Lucknow,” Suraj said.The UPSRTC officials said that the fare of government buses for Gorakhpur is about ₹1,400, and about ₹650 for Lucknow. “We can’t intervene much as the area is under jurisdiction of Delhi. We dispatched around 600 buses from Kaushambi, and 150 from ISBT in Anand Vihar by Monday evening. We expect to dispatch around 1,200 buses by Monday late night. We are also making arrangements for another 1,000 buses that will be dispatched throughout the night. We are trying to maintain Covid-19 protocols, but there’s a huge crowd which is likely to increase till late night,” said AK Singh, regional manager, UPSRTC.On a normal day, the UPSRTC operates around 600 buses from Kaushambi — which also includes around 250 buses on local routes like Hapur and Meerut, among others, according to the officials. “Generally, the occupancy in 52-seater buses is about 50-60%. Today, we have full occupancy in buses departing to various districts in Uttar Pradesh,” said another UPSRTC official, adding that only 60 buses departed from Kaushambi on Sunday due to the weekend lockdown in Delhi.District magistrate Ajay Shankar Pandey did not respond to the calls.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/noida-news/lockdown-fears-huge-rush-at-isbt-kaushambi-as-migrants-leave-for-home-towns-101618858052369.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Desperate for help, patients dial police for oxygen, hospital beds||From arranging beds and oxygen for Covid-19 patients to sending patients to hospitals and the dead to crematoriums, Delhi Police has been handling a multitude of requests from across the city over the past few days. Police sources say the tasks they are performing now are vastly different from a year ago, when they only had to arrange meals and masks, apart from their regular duties.In less than a week, police have arranged oxygen for a critically short outer Delhi hospital, sent the antiviral drug Remdesivir to patients in other states, turned a public park into a hospital for an ailing woman and rushed an elderly patient to hospital in the absence of any relative, among others.Police said while much of these duties are beyond their purview, they are expecting such requests to mount in the coming weeks. “People believe that the police can help them in times of need. We are working hard to do whatever we can to save lives and ease the troubles of patients,” said Anto Alphonse, deputy commissioner of police (north Delhi).While social media sites are the primary go-to option for most people seeking medical help, the police say they too are being bombarded with calls for help.“Several requests for hospital beds, oxygen and medicines are being received by police stations. My office too received about 15 different kinds of requests for medical help on Sunday. We are tying up with hospitals and individuals to help as many people as we can,” said RP Meena, DCP (south-east).One task successfully executed by Meena’s team was to arrange Remdesivir for a critically ill patient in Madhya Pradesh on Sunday.Also read: Beds filling fast, city can’t keep up with ICU, oxygen demandIn central Delhi’s Rajender Nagar, the police on Sunday had to shift an 80-year-old infected man from his home to hospital after his daughter called them for help. “The daughter couldn’t tend to her father since he was infected. So, we stepped in,” said Jasmeet Singh, DCP (central). As it turned out, the elderly man had put up a notice outside his house asking that his body be handed over to the police in case he died.DCP Singh said several individuals and organisations working to help people with oxygen and hospital beds are aware that victims in distress often reach out to police. “So, these people are approaching us with their willingness to help and we are the bridge between them and patients,” said Singh.Otherwise, at their level and within the department, it is the chowki (police post) in-charges and personnel deployed at hospitals who are being approached for liaising when requests for help pour in, said Santosh Meena, DCP (north).On Sunday, his colleagues in Dwarka had to step in after a family couldn’t find a vehicle to move their loved one’s body -- he had died of Covid-- to the crematorium. On Sunday, Meena received about 10 requests for help with hospitals and medicines.The police are also catering to a lot of requests for plasma. “Since many personnel got infected and recovered, relatives of patients believe that we are in a position to help. My colleagues who are eligible to donate plasma are doing so when we receive requests,” said a police officer, who asked not to be named.More than 8,000 Delhi Police personnel have been infected so far and 35 of them have died. But nearly 90% of them have also received the first dose of the vaccine.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-police-help-bridge-the-gap-between-distressed-patients-and-aid-101618857994026.html
20-04-2021||Chandigarh||No platform to check live status of Covid beds in Chandigarh||At a time when the number of active Covid-19 cases in Chandigarh has reached an all-time high with around 3,800 being currently infected, the UT administration has failed to come up with a transparent platform where patients can check real-time availability of beds in dedicated hospitals in the city.As of now, three hospitals have been identified for treatment of severe virus patients in Chandigarh.Though the administration has a platform to publicise orders concerning Covid, critical information required by patients in emergency situations is not available. Even the daily bulletin released by the UT health department comprises only virus cases and fatalities with no data on the availability of medical infrastructure for such patients in the city.While only a few states are providing data on bed occupancy in their daily Covid bulletins, the Delhi government has created an online platform that gives information regarding the availability of beds for Covid-19 patients.Residents seek online portal on lines of Delhi“The administration should be transparent about bed occupancy in the hospitals at the time when there is so much fear and anxiety among infected persons. The process should be hassle-free and if someone requires hospitalisation, the person should be able to check the availability,” RK Garg, a social activist and president of Second Innings Association, said.“In these challenging times, an infected person feels harried and clueless about the availability of a hospital bed before leaving the house. To help them, bed vacancies in both government and private hospitals in the tricity should be displayed on a public portal, on the Delhi pattern. Such a portal should be updated every six hours,” said SC Luthra, senior vice-president of Resident Welfare Association, Manimajra Housing Complex.A senior UT official, wishing anonymity, said the administration was keen on developing such a platform, but the idea was dropped in view of influx of patients from neighbouring states.Over 60% patients from neighbouring states“At present, over 60% Covid patients in the city hospitals are not Chandigarh residents. To help the native patients, helplines have been set up,” the official said.Claiming that an adequate number of beds were available for Covid patients, UT adviser Manoj Parida said those requiring hospitalisation can go to Government Multi-specialty Hospital, Sector 16, and Government Medical College and Hospital, Sector 32, if their health deteriorates.PGIMER adds 30 Covid beds, nurses demand extra workforcePost Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, has added 30 more beds for Covid-19 patients after its initial capacity was fully occupied. However, the nurses’ association has written to the institute administration demanding more health workers for better management of patients. The institute earlier had 253 beds which have now been increased to 283. These include 53 beds with ventilator support.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/chandigarh-news/no-platform-to-check-live-status-of-covid-beds-in-chandigarh-101618857993574.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Religious places to open, but no visitors allowed||Religious places in Delhi will stay closed to visitors for the next week in accordance with the curfew order issued on Monday.The curbs have been imposed at a time when the devotees are observing Navratras and Ramzan, wherein they fast and participate in special prayers.Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the shahi imam of Jama Masjid, said the mosque will remain closed and only the staff residing on its premises will be allowed to participate in prayers. “I have requested other mosques to not allow the faithful and encourage them to pray at home,” he said.The managements at Kalkaji Mandir and Hanuman Mandir also said they will continue the daily prayers but without devotees. Surendra Nath Avdhoot, mahant (head priest) Kalkaji Mandir, said, “None will be allowed to participate in daily prayers except for priests and staff living on the premises.”Manjinder Singh Sirsa, elected member of Delhi Sikh Gurdwara Management Committee, said he has appealed to all gurdwaras to follow the curfew guidelines.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/delhi-news/delhi-curfew-religious-places-to-remain-closed-to-visitors-101618857992374.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Good Samaritans step up to make food deliveries, co-ordinate resource availability||At a time when social media are flooded with desperate pleas for help to find vacant hospital beds, ventilators, oxygen, and other facilities, concerned citizens are stepping in to provide resources ranging from oxygen cylinders to cooked meals to families battling the infection.Anupriya Singh (Anna), a 42-year-old designer who doubles up as an aggregator of home chef services, recently formed another network of home chefs operating through WhatsApp groups to cater to Covid-affected families. “Right now, everyone knows someone or the other who is down with Covid. Seeing the situation, I started reaching out to home chefs so that we could cater to more people and save on crucial delivery time and expenses. As of today, we have over 120 chefs who are serving Covid-affected families. Every day, I create a new list of home chefs who can provide services in different parts of Delhi,” said Singh. She said nearly 40 chefs are joining the network on a daily basis, with requests for food pouring in from different quarters. “We are not allowing the chefs to price their thalis above ₹150. Some chefs are ready to deliver food for free, but recipients insist on paying for it. Money from such services will be used to start a fund through which we plan to support the needy,” said Singh. Within the neighbourhood, chefs are relying on services of friends or security guards to deliver food to families whereas services of app-based aggregators are being availed of to deliver food to far-off addresses. “Some chefs are also sending their family members to deliver food. People are stepping out to make deliveries themselves despite the severity of the prevailing situation,” said Singh. Ankit Gupta, 28, an Urdu poet who has been living in Delhi for the past year, has been using Twitter to connect those seeking Covid-related help. Gupta said concerned individuals have been using Twitter as a platform to respond to calls for help. “Through social media, we have formed a network of volunteers who are reaching out to hospitals and government officials so that patients can be admitted or provided services at the earliest,” said Gupta.Besides queries related to hospitalisation, Gupta has also been receiving requests from those who are hassled by the curfew restrictions. On Monday, Gupta delivered packets of cooked meals to around 1,000 people near Kashmiri Gate. “Due to the lockdown restrictions, people have lost jobs and are unable to pay for food or rent. Through social media, we raised money and were able to help such people,” said Gupta. Aryaman Bhatnagar, a resident, is among those who are using social media to verify crucial information and compile resources. Bhatnagar said the network was started on WhatsApp by citizens. “We provide verified leads and credible information -- pertaining to bed availability, oxygen, and medicines -- to those in need. There is a lot of information doing the rounds of WhatsApp and other platforms but, most often, the information is either false or the numbers are not working.

20-04-2021||Delhi||Resident, market bodies say will step up to enforce curbs||Resident groups and market associations across the national capital on Monday said they will strictly follow the six-day curfew imposed by the Delhi government on Monday, even as stakeholders across markets in the city expressed concerns over the impact of the curbs on their businesses.Delhi’s resident welfare associations (RWAs) said they will take several steps to ensure the curbs are implemented successfully, including putting in place measures such as shutting most gates of a colony; blocking entrances to restrict movement; restricting the entry of domestic help, drivers, and other workforce; allowing in only a select few vegetable and fruit vendors; and prohibiting all construction.Sanjay Rana, president of the Greater Kailash 2 RWA, said they have asked police to install barricades at all of the locality’s entry and exit points for the duration of the lockdown.“Only one entry and exit point, which opens from M Block on to the main road, will stay open for residents’ movement. We will not allow domestic help, drivers, and other staff to enter for a week. Only medical help for patients or elderly residents will be let in. We will also set fixed timings for vegetable and fruit vendors.”Also read: Public transport services to be open only for workers in essential servicesRWAs of other areas, including Lajpat Nagar 3, Vasant Kunj, and Sundar Nagar said they will not allow domestic help and drivers to enter the colonies.Amit Agarwal, president of the Vasant Kunj Sector A RWA, said, “All gates will be closed, and only e-pass holders and government officials with valid ID cards will be allowed to enter and exit the area. We have told residents to avoid calling their domestic help during the curbs.”Amarjeet Singh, president of the Lajpat Nagar 3 RWA, said only two of the 15 gates will remain open in the neighbourhood. “Only vegetable and fruit vendors will enter the area. Domestic help, drivers, and other staff will not be allowed in for a week,” he said.In Sundar Nagar, RWAs have decided to make arrangements for security guards to live in the area for a week.While market bodies said they will also follow all restrictions as laid down by the state government, many said they hoped the curbs would not be extended.Ashok Randhawa, president of the Sarojini Nagar market association, said, “We will strictly follow the government guidelines. But this will be another blow for traders, who have still not recovered from last year’s losses. We hope it [the lockdown] isn’t extended.”Some associations also demanded that the government extend support to help them tide over their losses for the period of the coming lockdown.Atul Bhargawa, president of the Connaught Place market association, said, “With any such decision, the government should also announce some relaxations for traders at least in rent and electricity charges,” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-rwas-vows-to-strictly-follow-week-long-curfew-101618857752921.html
20-04-2021||Delhi||Public transport services to be open only for workers in essential services||All regional transport offices (RTOs) will be shut during the six-day lockdown in Delhi -- from Monday 10pm to 5am next Monday (April 26) -- and public transport will be available only for those engaged in essential services, senior transport officials said.While the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) said trains will operate at a frequency of 30 minutes during peak hours, and one hour during off-peak hours, auto-rickshaws, e-rickshaws, taxis, gramin sewas and phat phat sewas will be allowed only with two passengers in each vehicle. Five passengers will be allowed in maxi cabs, and RTVs will be allowed to carry up to 11 passengers, the officials said.The Delhi Metro and the state-run DTC and cluster buses are already running at 50% capacity.Anuj Dayal, executive director (corporate communications), DMRC, said Metro services during the morning (8am to 10 am) and evening (5pm to 7pm) peak hours across the network will be available with a headway of 30 minutes. “For rest of the hours, services across the network will be available with a frequency of 60 minutes only. Metro services during this period can be availed only by the exempted category of people on production of the valid IDs,” he said.The Delhi Disaster Management Authority (DDMA), in Monday’s order imposing the curfew, imposed fresh restrictions on the movement of people and public transport -- largely in line with the weekend curfew that was in place from late on April 16 to early April 18.Officials said the announcement left some confused about scheduled appointments for transport-related services such as driving licence tests. But Delhi transport commissioner Ashish Kundra clarified that all RTOs in the Capital will remain shut during curfew period.“Apart from all RTOs being shut, all appointments that were given for this week will be cancelled. People will have to apply for fresh applications once the lockdown is lifted. However, an extension will be given to all the learners’ licenses that expire during this period,” said another senior transport official.The third official said those travelling by road from other states will not be allowed entry into the Capital unless they fall in the essential services category, or have a medical emergency, with valid papers such as e-passes. However, interstate bus terminals will operate as usual, and only passengers with valid tickets will be allowed to travel to and from the terminals.“Anyone who has a valid ticket on any public transport heading outside Delhi will be allowed to travel upon presenting a valid ticket,” the official added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/delhi-curfew-fresh-curbs-on-autos-e-rickshaws-taxis-101618857752272.html
20-04-2021||Pune||Pune district Covid positivity rate may have hit a plateau: Rao||Pune: The positivity rate of Pune district for the last week (April 12-April 18) has slightly decreased as compared to the week earlier. The positivity rate for last week stood at 25.54% as total 290,007 samples were tested and 74,083 positive cases were reported in the district during April 12-April 18. Pune divisional commissioner Saurabh Rao admitted that the Covid positivity has stabilised in the last two weeks. “It looks like Pune has reached a plateau. We discussed this in the state meeting on Monday. The trend clearly indicated downward graph. Particular this week has been very promising as the positivity rate has gone down. It is just the matter of couple of weeks to further consolidate this trend,” Rao said. “There is a slight decrease in the positivity rate of Pune district. We have increased tests and are trying our best to improve the facilities,” said Rajesh Deshmukh, Pune district collector. The highest positivity rate of 41% so far in the current month was recorded on April 4. After stricter curbs were placed in the district, the positivity rate has dropped. Positivity rate reflects the spread of the infection and the number of positives reported for every 100 tests. The positivity rate for the week earlier (April 5-April 11) was 27.10%. Around 271,376 samples were tested and 73,564 positive cases were reported during this period. The highest positivity rate of last week was recorded on Sunday at 28.82 % as the district reported 12,707 cases and 44,090 samples were tested. The lowest positivity rate was recorded on Wednesday (April 14) at 20.69% as on this day 7,888 cases were reported in Pune district and 38,120 samples were tested. The total number of tests has also been increased as compared to the earlier week. On April 17, the highest number of samples were tested in the week. While 47,276 samples were tested on April 17 and 12,836 were reported positive in the district.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/pune-district-covid-positivity-rate-may-have-hit-a-plateau-rao-101618852472020.html
20-04-2021||Pune||Cremation figure belies PMC count||PUNE: Even as the Pune Municipal Corporation has reported around 50 Covid fatalities in the city on Sunday, the bodies that arrived at various crematoriums actually outnumbered the figure shared by the civic body. According to officials involved in looking after crematoriums, the last three-four days have seen more than 100 cremations of Covid bodies happening each day. This at a time when PMC has reported 53 deaths on Sunday and 54 on Saturday. The state health department puts the fatalities in the city on Sunday and Saturday at 36 and 25 respectively. Shrinivas Kandul, PMC electric department head and incharge of crematoriums tasked with coordination for last rites of Covid-19 bodies, said, “It is true that for last few days there is more burden and waiting period for ambulances carrying bodies have extended up to five hours at various crematoriums.” On being asked about the mismatch of figures shared by PMC and number of bodies arriving at crematoriums, Kandul said, “It could possibly be because some people are bringing their dead at homes and registration at PMC may be happening later. “Along with hospitals, bodies of those passed away at homes are also coming to crematoriums. For the past two days, around 150 cremations have happened in the city,” said Kandul, adding that PMC has allowed cremating bodies traditionally using wood though previously they were allowed only at electric crematoriums. The municipal administration has also decided to open all the 21 crematoriums in the city for performing the final rites. As the fatalities have started increasing, Pune Municipal Corporation has appealed to various organisations to help them in performing the final rites. PMC official said the civic body has appealed to various organisations to come forward for cremation work. “We are training 30 Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh members on how to cremate bodies. They will carry out cremation at Vaikunth and we are planning to send bodies from Sassoon General hospital at Vaikunth,” said Kandul. Another PMC official on anonymity media, “Situation is very bad on the ground. To avoid the waiting period, we are transporting bodies from one crematorium to another where there is less rush, but some elected members are opposing to send the bodies from other areas. Many a times, resident of one area may be taking treatment at a hospital far from his home. If death happens at the hospital, we try and send it to a nearby crematorium though relatives or some elected members have been opposing it and demanding the bodies to be brought to the crematoriums located in their areas, leading to mismanagement. We are requesting all to look it as a city and not take an area- specific approach.” Rashid Khan, who is a Shiv Sena leader and helping PMC for last one year in carrying out cremation of Covid death victims, said, “For last one week, it’s a really bad situation. We are working round the clock. From 8am t0 midnight we are performing final rites. Earlier we were doing only for Muslims and Christians, but are now helping to do final rites on Hindu bodies too.” Khan said, “At least seven to eight bodies are waiting at various hospitals to be picked up.” Ambulance driver Anita Gosavi who is helping to carry Covid death victims said, “On Monday I waited for three hours at Bhosari crematorium to drop the body as earlier ambulances were in queue. As there is rush at crematoriums, we cannot reach hospitals on time to pick up next body.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/cremation-figure-belies-pmc-count-101618851811893.html
20-04-2021||Pune||Situation worse than last year at crematoriums in Pune||Pune: With the sudden surge in Covid deaths in Pune and Pimpri-Chinchwad municipal corporations, NGOs and body disposal officers are struggling to cremate bodies.“The situation is worse than last year. Daily more than 100 bodies are coming for cremation and last rites are performed round the clock,” said Javed Khan, founder-president of social organisation Ummat.“Pune Municipal Corporation has called us for assistance because of the rise in deaths and our members are cremating bodies,” said Khan, under whom 40 members are working for the cause.Khan had divided the members of the social organisation as per zones across the city.“We have divided hospitals among our members. Once PMC informs us about deaths, we keep things ready at the crematoriums and bodies are cremated as per rites by our members after the ambulance arrives with the bodies,” said Khan.PMC has provided adequate PPE kits, hand gloves, surgical masks and other requirements and have addressed the shortfalls faced during the first wave.“PMC is providing everything on time to all the body disposal officers and the NGOs. Since there is a heavy rush of bodies in all the crematoriums, the process is taking time,” said Khan, whose NGO performs last rites for free.Arun Jangam, a body disposal officer with Pune Municipal Corporation said, “Since last 10 days, the workload has increased.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/pune-news/situation-worse-than-last-year-at-crematoriums-in-pune-101618850251913.html
20-04-2021||Other||Sealing orders cast shadow over Ashtami & Navmi celebrations in Ludhiana’s Urban Estate||Confined to their homes since the sealing orders came into effect on Sunday, residents Urban Estate Phase 1 and Phase 2, Dugri, are in a tizzy over how to go about with the Ashtami and Ram Navmi celebrations.Traditionally, girl children are invited home for the prayer ceremonies and rituals but the restrictions and risk of infection have cast a shadow on the celebrations. Mamta Goyal, a resident of Urban Estate Phase II, said, “We don’t know who is carrying the infection. It is being said that children are the carriers of infection. In such a situation, inviting children home for the prayer ceremony may prove risky. This time, my mother-in-law has told me to perform the ceremony at home with just family members, and then distribute sweets among other children.”Parents of girl children, too, are hesitant to send them out for the prayer ceremonies. “We have decided that we won’t send our children anywhere. We have no way of knowing who may be carrying the infection. If my children visit a house where someone is infected, they will also catch the infection,” said Rajiv Kapoor.Due to the surge in infections, even temples, which earlier used to remain crowded during navratras, are wearing a deserted look this time around.Priests get frantic calls about ritualsAkhilesh Kumar Sharma, priest of Ma Durga temple in Dugri, said he has been receiving frantic calls from residents, asking him about what other rituals they can perform now. “We are going through a tough time so we are to adapt to the situation accordingly. There are problems due restriction, but presently that is the safest option. I would suggest people to stay indoors and perform their rituals at home itself,” said Akhilesh Sharma.Residents unhappy with restrictionsRupesh Kumar, a resident of one of the sealed areas, said that instead of announcing a complete ban on movement, the authorities must crack a whip on defaulters who encourage violations. “The chopaties (eateries) have turned into a breeding ground of infection. I had recently visited Fountain Chowk and Dandi Swami Road with my family and was shocked to see a huge crowd gathered at the ice-cream parlours. But no action was taken against such establishments. Instead the entire Dugri area has been sealed,” said Rupesh Kumar.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/cities/others/sealing-orders-cast-a-shadow-over-ashtami-navmi-celebrations-101618836691125.html
20-04-2021||World||US general says has grave doubt about Taliban's reliability||A top U.S. general said on Tuesday that he had grave doubts about the Taliban's reliability as a negotiating partner, as the United States is set to remove all its troops from Afghanistan in the coming months and focus on diplomacy.Last week President Joe Biden said all U.S. troops will be withdrawn from Afghanistan starting May 1, to end America's longest war, rejecting calls for them to stay to ensure a peaceful resolution to that nation's grinding internal conflict."I have grave doubts about the Taliban's reliability ... but we need to see what they're going to do here," Marine General Frank McKenzie, the head of U.S. Central Command, said in a House Armed Services Committee hearing."If they want any form of future international recognition for Afghanistan ... they're going to have to keep the agreements that they've made," McKenzie said, adding the U.S. military would still be able to observe them and verify their actions.The Taliban ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001, when they were ousted by U.S.-led forces. Since then they have waged a long-running insurgency and still control wide swathes of territory.The foreign troop withdrawals have raised concerns that the country could erupt in full-scale civil war, providing al Qaeda space in which to rebuild and plan new attacks on U.S. and other targets.A United Nations report in January said there were as many as 500 al Qaeda fighters in Afghanistan and that the Taliban maintained a close relationship with the Islamist extremist group. The Taliban denies al Qaeda has a presence in Afghanistan.Announcing his decision to withdraw troops, Biden said the United States would monitor the threat, reorganize counter-terrorism capabilities and keep substantial assets in the region to respond to threats to the United States emerging from Afghanistan.McKenzie said he would provide the defense secretary a plan for counter-terrorism forces outside of Afghanistan by the end of the month. He cautioned that the loss of the current U.S. military network in Afghanistan, and the intelligence capability it allows, would have an impact."If you're out of the country and you don't have the ecosystem that we have there now, it will be harder to do that. It is not impossible to do that. It will just be harder to do it," he said.A top White House official said on Sunday that no one could offer guarantees about Afghanistan's future after U.S. troops leave, even as he stressed the United States would stay focused on threats emanating from the country.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-general-says-has-grave-doubt-about-taliban-s-reliability-101618939205689.html
20-04-2021||World||Bangladesh eyes Sputnik vaccine to overcome supply shortage from India||Russia has proposed to manufacture its 'Sputnik V' Covid-19 vaccine in Bangladesh in collaboration with local pharmaceutical firms under a co-production arrangement while Dhaka is searching other sources apart from India amidst a spike in infections in the country, according to Foreign Minister AK Abdul Momen."We agreed with them (Russia) on coproduction (of vaccine) … though it's not finalised yet," Momen told the official BSS news agency.Russia has invited Bangladesh to be a vaccine co-producer with its technology, saying currently the country lacks the production capacity to export its vaccine to Bangladesh.As per the proposal, Russia will give the technology and Bangladeshi pharmaceutical companies will produce the Sputnik vaccine here, he said.“If things go well … It will be cheap and hopefully it will be better,” he added.Bangladesh so far was dependent on India’s Serum Institute. But as India was facing vaccine shortages amid an intensifying second wave of the deadly Covid-19 virus, the Pune-based vaccine producer has not been able to supply the doses to Bangladesh and other countries.A Bangladeshi health ministry official meanwhile said the government constituted a five-member committee to explore newer vaccine sources and asked it to submit a report to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's office in the next seven days."The committee has been formed as availability of vaccines appeared uncertain," director general of health services Professor Dr Abul Bashar Mohammmad Khurshid Alam told newsmen.Dhaka started vigorously hunting for other sources, including China, for getting the high demanded inoculation fearing India could get run out of vaccines for its own citizens.Momen said Bangladesh earlier did not show much interest in the Chinese vaccine as their vaccine was yet to get the World Health Organisation (WHO) approval.“But, now we are keeping open all options to get vaccines,” Momen said.Momen said China, however, informed Bangladesh that they would not be able to export any vaccine before December as they already gave commitments to other countries to supply their vaccine.Besides, he said, the World Bank recently informed Bangladesh to provide 80 lack doses of vaccine under COVAX by next month. “We are hopeful to get those vaccines under COVAX,” he said.Bangladesh purchased 30 million doses of India-made vaccine under a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) signed on November 5 and a subsequent agreement on December 13 among Bangladesh government, Beximco Pharmaceuticals Ltd (BPL) and the Serum Institute of India (SII).As per the agreement, Bangladesh is supposed to receive 5 million doses in each month, but after the first consignment of 5 million, Dhaka is yet to receive the second consignment of 5 million that was scheduled to arrive here by March.Bangladesh received 21.5 million vaccine doses from the Indian government as a gift apart from the commercially procured ones.“They (India) have been telling us that they would send the vaccines... they never said that they couldn’t,” Momen said, adding that Dhaka keeps confidence in Indian assurance and is hopeful to get all the 30 million doses of vaccine within the timeframe of the agreement.However, the minister said, Dhaka feared that Indian vaccine production is not enough considering their internal demand and international commitment.Momen said the government has also been considering engaging the private sector in importing and marketing commercially expensive vaccines like the Pfizer-BioNTech one in the Bangladesh market to meet the demand.He said the government aims to vaccinate 80 per cent of the total population free of cost to check the spreading of the deadly virus.In Bangladesh, so far, nearly 5.5 million people have received the first dose of the vaccine while around seven million more registered for the vaccination.Bangladesh is among the nations which has continued to witness a sharp surge in the cases of coronavirus, with right now 727,780 cases and 10,588 deaths caused by the disease, according to media reports.Bangladesh recorded 91 deaths and 4,559 new infections in the 24 hours, according to government figures released on Tuesday.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/bangladesh-eyes-sputnik-vaccine-to-overcome-supply-shortage-from-india-101618927154228.html
20-04-2021||World||Japan says Chinese military likely behind cyberattacks||Tokyo police are investigating cyberattacks on about 200 Japanese companies and research organizations, including the country’s space agency, by a hacking group believed to be linked to the Chinese military, the government said Tuesday.Police have forwarded the case involving attacks on the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency to prosecutors for further investigation, Chief Cabinet Secretary Katsunobu Kato told reporters.Police believe a series of hacks of JAXA were conducted in 2016-2017 by “Tick,” a Chinese cyberattack group under the direction of a unit of the People’s Liberation Army, Kato said.A suspect in the JAXA case, a Chinese systems engineer based in Japan, allegedly gained access to a rental server by registering himself under a false identity to launch the cyberattacks, Kato said, citing the police investigation.NHK public television said another Chinese national with suspected links to the PLA unit who was in Japan as an exchange student was also investigated in the case. Both men have since left the country, it said.Police are investigating the attackers’ intent and methods, while also pursuing scores of other cyberattacks that they suspect are linked to China’s military, Kato said.“The involvement of China’s People’s Liberation Army is highly likely,” Kato said. He added that no actual data leak or damage has been found so far but police are urging the companies to strengthen their protection.Japan's Defense Ministry says cyberattacks are part of rising security threats from China as it becomes more assertive in the region — a shared concern discussed in April 16 talks at the White House between U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga.In Beijing, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin said cyberattacks are a common challenge faced by all countries and warned Japan against wrongly accusing China.“Groundless speculation should not be allowed. China is firmly opposed to any country or institution using cyberattacks to throw mud at China or to serve the despicable political purposes with cybersecurity issues," he said. "China is willing to strengthen dialogue and cooperation with all parties to jointly address cybersecurity threats.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/japan-says-chinese-military-likely-behind-cyberattacks-101618925322865.html

The government introduced the Colombo Port City Economic Commission draft bill in parliament this month.For parliamentarian Harsha de Silva, a member of the main opposition Samagi Jana Balawegaya, the move to allow the president to appoint the board and chief executive officer of the commission adds to Rajapaksa’s authority. The president last year succeeded in a bid to amass executive powers for his office after his government won a super majority vote to amend the constitution.The port city “will catalyze the next phase of growth, however for this to work, we want to make sure that it is done right,” said de Silva, who was involved in developing a first draft for a law administering the Colombo Port city when in government.Meanwhile, the Sri Lanka Bar Association in its challenge said the bill infringes on judicial functions and may violate articles of the constitution dealing with the unitary state and sovereignty of the people. Some lawmakers and Buddhist clergy linked to Rajapaksa’s party have also opposed the Commission, calling it an attempt to form a Chinese colony.Sri Lanka has been one of the countries drawn to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. The port city in Colombo, being built by China Communications Construction Co., also has a plan to build a financial district -- pitched as a new hub between Singapore and Dubai -- with a marina, a hospital, shopping malls, and 21,000 apartments and homes.Concerns over the port city being a Chinese colony are misplaced, and the project will be a source of non-debt inflows that will help drive growth by reducing red-tape faced by investors, said State Minister for Money and Capital Markets Nivard Cabraal.The Colombo port city has been exempted from a number of laws and agencies to improve the ease of doing business, Cabraal said, although it’s kept rules against money laundering.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinabuilt-port-city-plan-challenged-in-sri-lanka-s-top-court-101618908099257.html
20-04-2021||World||Biden praying for 'right verdict' in Chauvin trial, says evidence 'overwhelming'||President Joe Biden said Tuesday that he is “praying the verdict is the right verdict” in the trial of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin and that he believed the case, which has gone to the jury and put the nation on edge, to be “overwhelming.”Biden, ahead of a meeting with lawmakers in the Oval Office, told reporters that he was only weighing in on the trial into the death of George Floyd, who died with Chauvin's knee on his neck, because the jury in the case had been sequestered. He confirmed that he called Floyd's family on Monday to offer prayers and said he “can only imagine the pressure and anxiety they’re feeling.”“They’re a good family and they’re calling for peace and tranquility no matter what that verdict is,” Biden said. "I’m praying the verdict is the right verdict. It’s overwhelming, in my view. I wouldn’t say that unless the jury was sequestered now.”The president has repeatedly denounced Floyd's death but had previously stopped short of weighing in on the trial itself. His comments came as his administration has been privately weighing how to handle the upcoming verdict, including considering whether Biden should address the nation and dispatching specially trained community facilitators from the Justice Department, aides and officials told The Associated Press.The jury resumed deliberations Tuesday morning after spending a few hours Monday discussing the case behind closed doors. In closing arguments earlier in the day, a prosecutor told jurors that Chauvin “had to know” he was squeezing the life out of George Floyd as he cried over and over that he couldn’t breathe and finally fell silent. Chauvin faces murder and manslaughter charges.The plans for possible presidential remarks are still fluid, with the timing, venue and nature of the remarks still being considered, in part depending on the timing of the verdict, according to two White House aides who were not authorized to speak publicly about private conversations and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The White House has been warily watching the trial proceed in Minneapolis — and then another shooting of a Black man by a white police officer last week — and are preparing for the possibility of unrest if a guilty verdict is not reached in the trial. Biden may also speak after a guilty verdict, the White House aides said.Floyd’s brother, Philonise Floyd, told NBC's “Today” show that Biden “knows how it is to lose a family member ... so he was just letting us know that he was praying for us and hoping that everything would come out to be OK.”The verdict — and the aftermath — will be a test for Biden, who has pledged to help combat racism in policing, helping African Americans who supported him in large numbers last year in the wake of protests that swept the nation after Floyd’s death and restarted a national conversation about race. But he also has long projected himself as an ally of police, who are struggling with criticism about long-used tactics and training methods and difficulties in recruitment.Psaki said Monday that the White House has had a “range of conversations” about preparations for the upcoming verdict and added, “Our objective is to ensure there is space for peaceful protest."“Of course we’ll let the jury deliberate and we’ll wait for the verdict to come out before we say more about our engagements,” Psaki said.Psaki said administration officials have been in contact with leaders in Minnesota and in other cities and states that saw unrest after Floyd’s death last year.She declined to answer if Biden would be “disappointed” if a not guilty verdict was reached. She said that Americans could expect to hear from the president soon after the verdict, no matter what it is.Judge Pete Cahill said on Monday after closing argument were done, rejecting a defense request for a mistrial based in part on comments from California Rep. Maxine Waters, who said “we’ve got to get more confrontational” if Chauvin isn’t convicted of murder. He framed it as politicians in general.“I wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function," said Cahill. "I think if they want to give their opinions, they should do so in a respectful and in a manner that is consistent with their oath to the Constitution to respect a coequal branch of government. Their failure to do so, I think, is abhorrent."Meanwhile, the FBI and the U.S. attorney’s office in Minnesota have been working with local officials to support law enforcement as they prepare for the possibility of unrest after the verdict, officials said.And the Justice Department has also dispatched specially trained community facilitators ahead of a verdict, according to a senior Justice Department official. The official could not discuss the plans publicly and spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity.The officials, part of the Justice Department’s Community Relations Service, tout themselves as “America’s Peacemaker” by mediating disputes in communities and holding listening sessions to help prevent future conflicts.A federal civil rights investigation, separate from the trial, remains ongoing. Several witnesses were subpoenaed earlier this year to appear before a federal grand jury considering charges against Chauvin.The Justice Department’s civil rights investigation has been focused on Chauvin and some of the witnesses, including other officers who worked with Chauvin, people familiar with the matter have told the AP.Chauvin was prepared to plead guilty to third-degree murder in George Floyd’s death before then-Attorney General William Barr personally blocked the plea deal last year. Barr rejected the deal in part because he felt it was too soon, as the investigation into Floyd’s death was still in its relative infancy, law enforcement officials said.Across the country, police departments are also preparing for the possibility of rioting or other unrest, with some canceling vacation time and increasing the number of officers available for shifts. The federal government hasn't detailed its plan in the event of widespread or sustained civil unrest.Pentagon spokesman John Kirby said Monday that there has been a request from officials in Washington, D.C., for D.C. National Guard forces in the event there is civil unrest in the nation's capital, and it is currently being reviewed by the Army. He said the Army secretary has the authority to approve any request for D.C. National Guard but did not have details on the request.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/biden-praying-for-right-verdict-in-chauvin-trial-says-evidence-overwhelming-101618936626683.html

But it has faced occasional criticism over issues such as complaints of battery fires.Monday's incident led state broadcaster CCTV to call for an investigation of reported brake problems on Tesla cars, while China's anti-graft watchdog weighed in with a commentary saying such disputes should be resolved within the rule of law."Individuals should not take extreme measures, and enterprises should not be arrogant and unreasonable," the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection said late on Tuesday.Tesla said on Monday that the woman was a vehicle owner who had been involved in a collision earlier this year. It cited "speeding violations" for the crash, adding in a social media statement that it had been negotiating with her about returning the car, but the talks had stalled over a third-party inspection.Zhang and Li could not be contacted for comment.The incident continued to attract social media attention on Tuesday, accounting for two of the top 10 trending topics on the Twitter-like Weibo platform.Last month, Tesla came under scrutiny in China when the military banned its cars from entering its complexes, citing security concerns over cameras in its vehicles, sources told Reuters.That prompted founder Elon Musk to say that if Tesla used cameras to spy in China or anywhere, it would be shut down. Earlier this month, Tesla said cameras in its cars are not activated outside of North America.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinese-woman-s-tesla-protest-prompts-5-day-detention-company-apology-101618936619706.html
20-04-2021||World||Canada-US land border restrictions, hotel quarantine extended||Canada and the United States on Tuesday extended a land-border closure for non-essential travelers, and air passengers arriving in Canada will continue to be tested for Covid-19 ahead of a hotel quarantine period, authorities said.The land-border restrictions, imposed in March 2020, have been extended to May 21. Now in place for 13 months, they are being renewed month by month. Mexico said late on Monday it was maintaining some of its border restrictions, too."We are guided by science and public health data and engaged in discussions with Canada and Mexico about easing restrictions as health conditions improve," the U.S. Department of Homeland Security said on Twitter.The restrictions have hit many border communities and businesses hard. Many U.S. lawmakers have urged loosening the restrictions or setting a road map to resuming normalized travel.Canada continues to lag the United States on vaccinations, and much of the country is now fighting a virulent third wave of the disease with school and business closures.Canada's required three-day hotel quarantine following testing at airports, which was introduced as a temporary measure to discourage spring break travel, was also extended to May 21, health authorities said.Canada began testing international air arrivals in February, and requiring them to pay for a three-day hotel quarantine themselves, a measure criticized by airlines hit hard by the pandemic.Air travelers are also are required to have had a test within three days of departure. If the airport text comes back negative, they can finish a 14-day quarantine at home.However, data obtained by Reuters showed that more than 1,000 passengers, or 1.5% of those who arrived from Feb 22 to March 25, tested positive for Covid-19, casting doubt over a broad easing of restrictions before the summer travel season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canadaus-land-border-restrictions-hotel-quarantine-extended-101618936610699.html
20-04-2021||World||Mexico president touts 'no risks' as he receives AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine||Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador received the AstraZeneca shot against Covid-19 on Tuesday, urging trust in vaccines after several countries limited the use of AstraZeneca due to suspected links to rare blood clots.Lopez Obrador, 67, has said the benefits of getting inoculated outweighed the risks of the low-cost shot, which is a core pillar of Mexico's vaccination strategy.Ahead of rolling up his sleeve for the shot at the end of his regular daily news conference, Lopez Obrador said he wanted to encourage all older adults to also get their shots to be protected from the coronavirus."We're sure there is no risk, no danger, that there are no serious side effects," he said, without specifically naming AstraZeneca.He added that his government is tracking vaccine studies being carried out worldwide.Lopez Obrador said he would sit for 20 minutes after receiving the jab, as recommended by a healthcare worker who administered the shot to the president on live television and social media."It didn't hurt," Lopez Obrador said. "Right now I'm feeling very good."Mexico's health regulator said earlier this month that it did not plan to limit the use of the two-shot vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca, but was looking into information from Britain's vaccine advisory committee.The committee has said an alternative to AstraZeneca should be given to people under 30 where possible.Mexico began vaccinations late last year and has so far fully inoculated nearly 4 million people, most of whom are adults over 60, out of a total population of 126 million.Officials plan to soon roll out vaccinations for adults over 50 and teachers, just as infection rates in 10 states start to trend higher following Easter week celebrations.Mexico as of February had agreed to buy 77.4 million AstraZeneca doses, making the drugmaker its top vaccine provider. It will also receive AstraZeneca shots through the COVAX vaccine-sharing program, which will supply a total of 51.5 million doses from various manufacturers.Additionally, Mexico has agreed to bottle AstraZeneca shots using vaccine material produced in Argentina, with an initial supply of 150 million doses to be distributed in Latin America.A Mexican official said in March that the first doses were expected to be shipped the first week of May.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/mexico-president-touts-no-risks-as-he-receives-astrazeneca-covid-19-vaccine-101618934747656.html
20-04-2021||World||British PM Boris Johnson launches search for Covid-19 antiviral treatments||Britain is launching a search for antivirals to treat Covid-19 with the aim of having at least two effective at-home treatments by the end of the year, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday.Johnson has hailed the advent of Covid-19 vaccines and regular testing as the keys to restoring normality by summer, but his government is also supporting research into therapeutics to help in the fight against the pandemic."Our new Antivirals Taskforce will seek to develop innovative treatments you can take at home to stop Covid-19 in its tracks," Johnson said."These could provide another vital defence against any future increase in infections and save more lives."The government hopes that new treatments could be taken at home after a positive test or exposure to the coronavirus in order to reduce transmission and speed up recovery, and they would further bolster a range of therapeutics already available.Research by British scientists has established that both steroid dexamethasone and tocilizumab, an arthritis drug developed by Roche, reduced the risk of death in patients with severe Covid-19.Patrick Vallance, the government's Chief Scientific Adviser, said that antivirals in tablet form could help protect people who could not have vaccines, and be a layer of defence in the face of new coronavirus variants of concern.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/british-pm-boris-johnson-launches-search-for-covid-19-antiviral-treatments-101618934752680.html
20-04-2021||World||Pilot views obstructed, alerts missing in midair plane crash||The pilots of two Alaskan sightseeing planes that collided in midair couldn't see the other aircraft because airplane structures or a passenger blocked their views, and they didn't get electronic alerts about close aircraft because safety systems weren't working properly.That's what the staff of the National Transportation Safety board found in their investigation of the May 2019 crash, which killed six people.The board is meeting Tuesday in Washington to determine a probable cause of the crash and make recommendations to prevent it from happening again.Mountain Air Service pilot Randy Sullivan and his four passengers, and a passenger in a plane owned by Taquan Air were killed. Ten people suffered injuries when the aircraft converged at 3,350 feet (1,021 meters).The Ketchikan-based floatplanes carrying passengers from the same cruise ship, the Royal Princess, were returning from tours of Misty Fjords National Monument.Mountain Air’s single-engine de Havilland DHC-2 MK 1 Beaver and Taquan’s larger turboprop de Havilland DHC-3 Otter collided just after noon over the west side of George Inlet.Aircraft rely on “see and avoid” by pilots to prevent midair crashes, the staff said. But the crash occurred on a clear day in the afternoon.Vice Chairman Bruce Landsberg said the “see and avoid” system doesn’t work well in high traffic areas where the sight-seeing planes were traveling.Chairman Robert Sumwalt read a statement of probable cause, which has not yet been approved by the board. He said the pilots didn’t see each other in time to avoid a collision. Contributing factors included “preoccupation with matters unrelated to duties such as attempting to provide passengers with a scenic view and physiological limits on the human vision, reducing the time opportunity to see-and-avoid other aircraft,” he said.Staff members told the board the Otter pilot recalled seeing a white and red flash, then a tremendous collision.The Beaver pilot’s view would have been obstructed by the airplane’s structure and a passenger seated to his right during the critical moments before the crash. The Otter pilot’s view was obscured by a window post, the staff said.William Bramble, the NTSB’s human performance specialist, told the board that both planes were equipped with systems that track other planes, but visual and audible alerts weren’t working in either plane due to malfunctions.“The Otter pilot seemed to miss seeing the target (the other plane) on the display because he last recalled looking at the display about four minutes before the collision,” Bramble said.Documents released earlier by the NTSB show the propeller of the Taquan Otter hit the other aircraft, leaving deep cuts later documented by investigators. The tail of the Mountain Air plane hit the left side of the Taquan aircraft, popping open a door.The leg of a passenger sitting near the door was sucked outside the plane as other passengers held him in place, witnesses said.Otter Pilot Lou Beck estimated his plane took five seconds to hit the water 10 miles (16 kilometers) northeast of Ketchikan.At least three people could be heard saying, “brace brace brace,” on a camera recording audio before the Taquan plane hit the water.The Mountain Air Beaver plane broke up in flight, scattering debris across 3,000 feet (914 meters).Mountain Air Service closed after the accident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pilot-views-obstructed-alerts-missing-in-midair-plane-crash-101618933697693.html
20-04-2021||World||US unveils plan to protect power grid from foreign hackers||The White House unveiled on Tuesday a 100-day plan intended to protect the US power grid from cyber-attacks, mainly by creating a stronger relationship between US national security agencies and the mostly private utilities that run the electrical system.The plan is among the first big steps toward fulfilling the Biden administration’s promise to urgently improve the country’s cyber defenses. The nation’s power system is both highly vulnerable to hacking and a target for nation-state adversaries looking to counter the US advantage in conventional military and economic power.“The United States faces a well-documented and increasing cyber threat from malicious actors seeking to disrupt the electricity Americans rely on to power our homes and businesses,” Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm said.Although the plan is billed as a 100-day sprint -- which includes a series of consultations between utilities and the government -- it will likely take years to fully implement, experts say. It will ask utilities to pay for and install technology to better detect hacks of the specialized computers that run the country’s power systems, known as industrial control systems.While an early draft had proposed helping small utilities and rural co-ops pay for the new monitoring, the final version is more vague about whether the money will come from the federal government or be passed to customers in the form of higher utility bills. Large utilities often have sophisticated security teams and pay for cutting edge monitoring technology, but it’s unclear how enthusiastically smaller utilities will take on the cost of additional security.The government will take suggestions from utilities within 21 days about ways to incentivize participation in the voluntary effort, according to details of the plan described by a person familiar with it.The final plan also drops the draft’s proposal for enhancing supply chain security for grid components by calling for a list of recommended equipment vendors. Now, the administration plans to ask utilities for suggestions for improvement.Experts say initiatives to enhance the security of the US electrical grid are years behind better-known efforts to shield data centres and corporate systems. At the same time, hackers from Russia, China, Iran and North Korea are launching increasingly aggressive attacks on US power companies, hoping to install malware that could leave cities and towns in the dark.Under the new plan, owners and operators of electricity networks are now expected to “enhance their detection, mitigation and forensic capabilities,” according to the Department of Energy statement. They would also need to share information with the federal government if something happens to their systems. Priority sites will need to identify and report their technology capabilities, gaps and requirements within 45 days of the launch.CISA, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, will establish a team of government and agency representatives to coordinate analysis between the government and private sector.“The safety and security of the American people depend on the resilience of our nation’s critical infrastructure,” said acting CISA director Brandon Wales, in a statement. The partnership would “prove a valuable pilot as we continue our work to secure industrial control systems across all sectors.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-unveils-plan-to-protect-power-grid-from-foreign-hackers-101618931230684.html
20-04-2021||World||Tokyo to ask Japanese govt to declare state of emergency due to Covid-19: Report||Tokyo has decided to ask the Japanese government to declare a state of emergency, Mainichi newspaper reported, as authorities step up restrictions to contain a surge in coronavirus infections ahead of an Olympics just three months away.Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike has told ruling Liberal Democratic Party Secretary General Toshihiro Nikai she plans to seek the designation for the capital, the report said, without saying where it obtained the information. The city will make the final decision after a virus panel meeting on Thursday, it said. Covid-19 cases in the city have in recent days surged to levels not seen since late January, when the capital was under its second state of emergency.Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga’s government stepped up restrictions this month in Tokyo, Osaka and other regions to slow the spread, imposing measures that call on bars and restaurants to close by 8 p.m., and those that fail to comply face fines.Tokyo may be looking to ratchet up restrictions even more by asking restaurants to close if a state of emergency is declared, TV network TBS reported, without saying where it obtained the information. This would be the strictest measure under an emergency so far in Japan, but such a move could raise the risk of a double dip recession and deal a heavy blow to thousands of eateries struggling to survive.Civil liberties enshrined in the Japanese Constitution prevent imposing a lockdown backed by police action, as has been seen in other nations.Tokyo’s single-day virus cases jumped by 70% in just two weeks to 759 on Saturday, a sign the capital is following Osaka, the second largest metropolitan area where daily cases have hit record highs this month. There is no law that prohibits the Olympics from taking place under an emergency, but it will likely impact the number of domestic spectators allowed, a decision that’s expected this month. Overseas fans are already banned from the event.The surge in cases has further soured Japanese public support for the Olympics, which would be one the biggest global events of the pandemic era, with more than 70% surveyed by broadcaster ANN over the weekend saying they were against holding the Games in July.Japan’s vaccine rollout will be far from complete before the Olympics, which will draw more than 60,000 athletes, coaches, national team staff, media and other essential workers from more than 200 countries. Immunizations of people aged over 65, which began this month, might not be finished until next year due to insufficient cooperation from medical personnel in some regions, the Nikkei newspaper cited ruling Liberal Democratic Party lawmaker Hakubun Shimomura as saying Monday.Despite the rising numbers in Japan, the country has by far the fewest recorded Covid-19 cases of any Group of Seven country. Its death tally has also been among the lowest in the group at about 9,650, well below the some 128,000 in the UK, which has a population about the half the size of Japan’s.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/tokyo-to-ask-japanese-govt-to-declare-state-of-emergency-due-to-covid-19-report-101618926798392.html

In about a week, they are expected to reach a combined force of over 120,000 troops," Kuleba told an online news conference."This does not mean they will stop building up their forces at that number," Kuleba said, warning of what he said was Moscow's unpredictability although he said Ukraine did not want conflict with Russia.The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, said on Monday that Russia had concentrated more than 150,000 troops on Ukraine's border and in Crimea.Kuleba also called for Moscow to re-commit to a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine, where Russia has supported separatist forces in a conflict that began in 2014.Russia has said the build-up is a three-week snap military drill to test combat readiness in response to what it calls threatening behaviour from NATO. It has said the exercise is due to wrap up within two weeks.Kuleba attended a video conference with EU foreign ministers and said he openly "called on colleagues to start considering a new round of sectoral sanctions against Russia".He said he did not feel EU ministers were ready for such a move but he told them that individual sanctions on Russian officials were insufficient.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/russia-will-soon-have-over-120-000-troops-on-ukraine-s-borders-kyiv-says-101618927206637.html

20-04-2021||World||Europe regulator to rule on J&J shot as EU vows increased Covid-19 doses||Europe's drug regulator was expected to rule Tuesday on the safety of the Johnson & Johnson Covid-19 vaccine after fears it could be linked to extremely rare blood clots, as the US drugmaker said it was "very confident" in its shot.The announcement was expected as an EU official promised to have enough vaccines in hand to inoculate the majority of European adults by the summer -- a boon for the continent's sluggish rollout.The United States is also expected to announce its decision on the single-shot J&J vaccine by Friday, as nations around the world try to accelerate their rollouts and revive their pandemic-ravaged economies.The American drugmaker said Tuesday it was "very confident" in its vaccine, speaking ahead of a European Medicines Agency (EMA) briefing about very rare cases of blood clots reported among people who got the J&J shot.The number of reported clots were "extremely small" compared with the millions of J&J shots administered worldwide, the EMA has said.That comparison echoes the comments by top US pandemic advisor Anthony Fauci, who described the clots as "an extraordinarily rare event".Fauci said this week he believed the US would resume use of the jab, possibly with some restrictions or warnings.A top Johnson & Johnson executive said Tuesday he was confident in the jab and that he hopes for a speedy resolution to the current pause."We remain very confident and very hopeful that the benefit-risk profile will play out," J&J Chief Financial Officer Joseph Wolk told CNBC.The company hopes "very shortly ... perhaps as early as the end of this week, to have some resolution with how we are going to proceed," he added.The J&J vaccine concerns follow similar reports of blood clots in a very small number of people who received the AstraZeneca shot.The EMA described those clots as a "very rare" side effect, stressing that the AstraZeneca jab's benefits outweigh the risks.The leaders of Europe are keen to accelerate vaccinations and expand availability after facing intense criticism over a sluggish rollout and with the public desperate for a return to some degree of normality.A senior EU official said Tuesday the bloc will have enough vaccine doses in hand to cover 70 percent of its adult population by mid-July, after the bloc struggled to secure supplies from drugmakers."I am now certain of how many doses are currently in production and I know how many millions will be delivered each week," internal markets commissioner Thierry Breton told French daily Le Figaro in an interview."This allows me to assure you that we well have by mid-July the number of doses necessary for vaccinating 70 percent of the European Union's adult population."- Crisis in India -India, home to 1.3 billion people, is battling a worrying surge, with record daily case numbers overwhelming already stretched hospitals and medical supplies.Its capital New Delhi was locked down Monday for a week, and the government said all adults would be eligible for a vaccine from May as it tries to get a grip on the spike.The Delhi lockdown follows the strict restrictions already imposed in other Indian states.The US Centers for Disease Control on Monday advised against all travel to India because of the Covid-19 crisis, and the UK imposed restrictions on arrivals from the country.The brutal wave has dramatically increased the workload for crematoriums and gravediggers, with social media and newspapers flooded with horrifying images of row upon row of burning pyres.The chimney of one electric furnace in the western city of Ahmedabad cracked and collapsed after being in constant use for up to 20 hours a day for the past two weeks.And the iron frames inside another in Surat melted because there was no time to let the furnaces cool.At a cemetery in New Delhi, gravedigger Shamim told AFP: "At this rate, I will run out of space in three or four days."Concerns about a spike were growing in Japan too, where its third-most populated region Osaka on Tuesday will ask the central government to impose a state of emergency.Tokyo and several other areas are expected to follow suit, hoping to avoid the crisis in Osaka, where hospital beds for coronavirus patients in severe condition have run out.- Vaccine inequality -There are concerns that vaccine inequality between wealthy and poor nations will further complicate and prolong the pandemic.Climate activist Greta Thunberg became the latest high-profile figure to criticise the lopsided distribution, describing vaccine inequity as a "tragedy".Mass vaccinations are considered key for resuming regular life and economic activity, especially travel.But the World Health Organization's emergency committee said it was against international passengers being required to have proof of vaccination -- a proposal being mulled by numerous countries.The committee said such requirements would "deepen inequities and promote differential freedom of movement" because of the uneven global vaccine rollout.But the threat of the virus being spread by international travellers was brought into sharp focus in Hong Kong, where at least 53 passengers on a single flight from India tested positive.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/europe-regulator-to-rule-on-j-j-shot-as-eu-vows-increased-covid-19-doses-101618925302863.html
20-04-2021||World||US takes steps to protect electric system from cyberattacks||The Biden administration is taking steps to protect the country's electric system from cyberattacks through a new 100-day initiative combining federal government agencies and private industry.The initiative, announced Tuesday by the Energy Department, encourages owners and operators of power plants and electric utilities to improve their capabilities for identifying cyber threats to their networks. It includes concrete milestones for them to put into use technologies so they can spot and respond to intrusions in real time.The department is soliciting input from electric utilities, energy companies, government agencies and others for recommendations about how to safeguard the energy system supply chain.The effort underscores the heightened concern about the prospects for cyberattacks that disrupt the nation's power supply. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, said in an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month that the administration was undertaking a new effort to help electric utilities, water districts and other critical industries protect against potentially damaging attacks.The U.S. “faces a well-documented and increasing cyber threat from malicious actors seeking to disrupt the electricity Americans rely on to power our homes and businesses,” Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said in a statement.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-takes-steps-to-protect-electric-system-from-cyberattacks-101618920253596.html
20-04-2021||World||China ties with Japan, Korea to deepen amid new focus: Moody’s||China’s strategy to boost technological self-reliance won’t stop its economic integration with Japan and South Korea, but the inward shift increasingly will put it in competition with its key trading partners, according to Moody’s Investors Service.Booming trade has helped power China’s development since it joined the World Trade Organization in 2001. For the next phase of the country’s development, President Xi Jinping proposed a “dual circulation” strategy last year under which “internal circulation” will be the mainstay of the economy, with “external circulation” as a complement.The recent five-year plan fleshes out the strategy, aiming to boost R&D spending by at least 7% per year over the next five years and raise the contribution from core digital economy industries to 10% of gross domestic product by 2025, from 7.8% last year.China already is South Korea’s top export destination -- taking one-quarter of the country’s shipments in 2019 -- and the second largest for Japan, absorbing 20% of its exports, according to Moody’s.At least initially, the dual-circulation strategy will mean greater access for Japanese and Korean companies in high value-added sectors, Moody’s wrote in a research note. Coupled with China’s huge market potential, that will further deepen the countries’ economic integration.“We expect China to continue to increase its imports for some critical technology goods or attract direct investments from Korea and Japan to localize production intended for the Chinese market,” analysts led by Lillian Li wrote.Cooperation and CompetitionCloser economic ties could help all three countries address structural issues such as aging populations, rising labor costs and slowing productivity. Japan’s and South Korea’s security ties with the U.S. could cause friction, but “even if heightened geopolitical tensions complicate the relationship between the three countries, it will not reverse the ongoing economic integration,” Moody’s wrote.Longer term, though, China’s reliance on imported components is expected to decline. Key sectors the government wants to enhance include integrated circuits, advanced machinery, medical and transportation equipment, aviation and robotics -- areas where China could be in direct competition with South Korea and Japan over the next five to 10 years, both locally and in other export markets.“Japanese and Korean companies in some high-tech sectors will benefit from China’s growing demand for their products but competition is likely to grow from Chinese companies, which enjoy strong policy support from the government,” Moody’s wrote.For more articles like this, please visit us at bloomberg.com©2021 Bloomberg L.P.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-ties-with-japan-korea-to-deepen-amid-new-focus-moodys-101618908251584.html

The central bank expects the economy will expand by around 3% in the year to June, after a rare contraction in the previous 12 months.Qureshi started a three-day official visit to the UAE on Saturday, while his Indian counterpart Subrahmanyam Jaishankar was due to arrive in the nation on Sunday, government officials said. The two were due to meet separately with their Emirati counterpart Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, weeks after it was revealed the Gulf monarchy had brokered secret talks between the rivals.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/pakistan-gets-payment-relief-as-uae-rolls-over-2-billion-loan-101618923268619.html

In state-to-state relations, the principles of equality, mutual respect and mutual trust must be put front and centre, Xi said.“Bossing others around or meddling in others’ internal affairs would not get one any support,” Xi said, addressing the annual Boao Forum for Asia (BFA) over video link.Xi criticised efforts by some countries - without naming any - to “build barriers” and “decouple”, which he said would harm others and benefit no one.“Big countries should behave in a manner befitting to their status and with a greater sense of responsibility,” Xi added.“The Covid-19 pandemic has made it all the more clear to people around the world that we must reject the Cold War and zero-sum mentality and oppose a new Cold War and ideological confrontation in whatever forms,” Xi said.Notwithstanding a patch of common ground on the fight against the climate crisis, US President Joe Biden has been working on uniting allies such as the UK, the EU and Japan on countering China. Last month, Biden held the first summit of the Quad, comprising the US, India, Australia and Japan.Marking the 20th anniversary of the BFA, referred to as Asia’s answer to the World Economic Forum in Davos, this year’s annual conference is themed “A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation”.The Chinese president said his country will never enter an arms race.“China will continue to carry out anti-Covid cooperation with the World Health Organization and other countries, honour its commitment of making vaccines a global public good, and do more to help developing countries defeat the virus. However strong it may grow, China will never seek hegemony, expansion, or a sphere of influence. Nor will China ever engage in an arms race,” Xi added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/in-a-dig-at-west-china-s-xi-warns-against-bossing-and-meddling-101618925918264.html
20-04-2021||World||Facebook Messenger users hit by scammers in over 80 countries: Report||Group-IB, a global threat hunting and adversary-centric cyber intelligence company have detected a large-scale scam campaign targeting Facebook Messenger users all over the world.Group-IB Digital Risk Protection (DRP) analysts have found evidence proving that users in over 80 countries in Europe, Asia, the MEA region, North and South America might have been affected, the company said in a release. "By distributing ads promoting an allegedly updated version of Facebook Messenger, cybercriminals harvested users' login credentials," the company said.The cyber intelligence company has discovered about 1,000 fake Facebook accounts distributing links to an allegedly updated version of Facebook Messenger. Users who followed the link would then be redirected to a fake Facebook Messenger website with a login form, through which cyber criminals harvested users' credentials.According to the intelligence company, scammers used official Facebook logos and shortened link names that resembled the real ones. Group-IB said that the social media giant itself has nothing to do with the scheme.The scale of the scam has grown substantially over the past several months, the company noted. As of April, investigative team found 5,600 Facebook posts inviting users to install the fake "latest Messenger update," Sputnik reported.Group-IB's DRP analysts have found scam ads targeted at users in at least 84 countries worldwide, including Canada, the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Singapore, Malaysia, and South Africa.Users who fell victim to this scheme risk leaking their personal data and have their account hijacked, the company said."Scammers, in turn, are likely to use the compromised account to either blackmail the victim, pushing them to pay a ransom to have access to their account restored, or further scale up the scheme using the Facebook profile to distribute scam ads," the release said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-messenger-users-hit-by-scammers-in-over-80-countries-report-101618925448408.html
20-04-2021||World||Killer in Indianapolis FedEx shooting browsed white supremacist websites: Police||The gunman who killed eight workers at an Indianapolis FedEx facility appeared to browse white supremacist websites about a year before the attack, police said.The attacker, Brandon Hole, also killed himself in last Thursday's attack, and four of his victims were members of the Sikh religious community.In March 2020, Hole's family asked police to intervene when he purchased a gun and threatened to commit suicide."I am going to point this unloaded gun at the police and they will shoot me," he told his mother, according to Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department's incident report.When the police arrived at their home, one of the officers said he had noticed that Hole had white supremacist websites opened on his computer.The police report said an officer "clearing the upstairs and securing the shotgun observed what through his training and experience indicated was white supremacist websites."Police then seized Hole's gun, and he was sent to a local hospital for mental health assessment.Police had said previously that Hole legally bought two semiautomatic rifles used during last week's shooting, months after he had been in psychiatric detention.Authorities are continuing to investigate the incident and Hole's motivation.A trace by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives turned up the two legal purchases last July and September by Hole, 19, a former employee at the FedEx facility.Prosecutors had not used Indiana's red-flag law, intended to prevent people from buying or possessing firearms if they are found to be an imminent risk to themselves or others, since Hole had surrendered the gun and there had been no overt violent act, said Ryan Mears, prosecutor for Marion County, which includes Indianapolis.Mears said gaps in the red-flag law in effect negated efforts to keep guns out of shooters' hands, Fox-affiliated television station Fox 59 reported https://fox59.com/news/marion-county-prosecutor-discusses-red-flag-status-of-fedex-shooting-suspect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/killer-in-indianapolis-fedex-shooting-browsed-white-supremacist-websites-police-101618920280634.html
20-04-2021||World||France urges rebuke for Syria over chemical weapons use||A group of 46 nations called Tuesday on member states of the global chemical weapons watchdog to diplomatically rebuke Syria for using toxic gas and nerve agents in the country's decade-long civil war.French Ambassador Luis Vassy proposed stripping Syria of its voting rights at the annual meeting of members of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons.“We owe this to the Syrian people,” Vassy said.The proposal, which has support from countries that include the United States, Britain, Canada and Australia, is expected to be put to a vote Wednesday morning.Vassy said Syria's use of prohibited chemical weapons was “irrefutable,” and he urged OPCW member states to back his attempt to strip Damascus of its rights, saying “we cannot let indifference win.”Syria, which joined the organization in 2013 after being threatened with air strikes in response to a chemical attack on the outskirts of the country's capital, denounced the move as a “propaganda tool” and denied using chemical weapons.After joining the OPCW, Syria declared its stockpile of chemical weapons and precursor chemicals, which were then removed from the country. Questions have remained, however, about chemicals and production facilities that may not have been identified.An investigation mechanism set up by the OPCW has twice blamed Syrian government forces for chemical attacks.Last week, the organization said its investigative team found “reasonable grounds to believe” that a Syrian air force military helicopter dropped a chlorine cylinder on a Syrian town in 2018, sickening 12 people.The team found last year reasonable grounds to believe that the Syrian Arab Air Force was responsible for attacks using chlorine and the nerve agent sarin in March 2017 in the town of Latamneh.The investigative team was established after Russia blocked the extension of a joint investigation mechanism set up by the United Nations and OPCW in 2015. That team accused Syria of chemical weapons attacks, including unleashing sarin in an aerial attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in April 2017 that killed about 100 people.Meanwhile, a group of Syrians living in Sweden have joined with an international human rights organization to file a criminal complaint against the Syrian government for war crimes and crimes against humanity.In a statement, they said the government used sarin gas against civilians in 2013 and 2017 and that “hundreds were killed and many more received serious injuries, including children.”Syrian victims and civil society organizations Civil Rights Defenders, Syrian Center for Media and Freedom of Expression (SCM), Syrian Archive and the Open Society Justice Initiative brought the criminal complaint.“The government has strategically used chemical weapons as a tool to wear out the civilian population living in opposition-controlled areas and to suppress any resistance against the regime,” Aida Samani, a legal adviser at Civil Rights Defenders, said. “It is unacceptable that those responsible for these heinous attacks are enjoying absolute impunity.”____Associated Press writer Jan M. Olsen in Copenhagen, Denmark contributed to this report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/france-urges-rebuke-for-syria-over-chemical-weapons-use-101618921873214.html
20-04-2021||World||China censors ex-premier's article ahead of Communist Party anniversary||Chinese internet firms blocked users from sharing a lengthy article written by former Premier Wen Jiabao in tribute to his late mother, censoring a senior member of the ruling Communist Party, possibly because he spoke out of line.The obituary-style article written by Wen about his mother, who died recently, appeared in a small weekly newspaper called the Macau Herald on Friday and was posted on a public account on Chinese chat app WeChat on Saturday, but was swiftly restricted.The heartfelt tribute includes details of Wen's mother's struggle during periods of upheaval in China, including the second Sino-Japanese War and the political purges of the Cultural Revolution."In my mind, China should be a country full of fairness and justice, always with a respect for the will of the people, humanity, and human nature," said Wen's article, which did not directly discuss China's current political environment.China's ruling Communist Party (CCP) has sought to tighten control over how netizens discuss history on the country's heavily controlled internet in the run-up to the 100th anniversary of the party's founding, in July.Under President Xi Jinping, the space for dissent in China has narrowed, while censorship has expanded.Wu Qiang, an independent political analyst in Beijing, said the article represented an "alternative voice from within the party" that is out of step with efforts of the last few years to stifle dissent."The power of this article by Wen is that it challenges that, and this is the main reason why it has been banned from being shared," he said, noting the party's sensitivity around its anniversary.Last week, an arm of China's cyber regulator launched a hotline for netizens to report "illegal" comments that "distorted" the Party's historical achievements and attacked the country's leadership.When users tried to share Wen's article, a notice appeared saying that the content went against WeChat's regulations and could not be shared, a common censorship measure in China that is one step below purging articles completely.On Weibo, the Chinese social media site similar to Twitter, there was scant mention of the article, and comments and sharing functions had been disabled. Links to articles on Wen's tribute posted on Weibo returned "404" messages on Tuesday morning, indicating they had been deleted.The operators of WeChat and Weibo, as well as China's internet regulator, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Former Chinese leaders and high-profile politicians rarely cultivate public personas or share detailed biographical information in their retirement, and are expected to slip gracefully from the limelight.Since assuming power in 2012, Xi's signature policies have been cemented in the party constitution and term limits abolished, putting him almost on par with Communist China's founder Mao Zedong in the pantheon of its leaders.Wen, who was premier under former Chinese leader Hu Jintao, was a leading figure behind the country's economic policies in the 2000s, and left office in 2013 when he was succeeded by current Premier Li Keqiang.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-censors-ex-premier-s-article-ahead-of-communist-party-anniversary-101618919646424.html
20-04-2021||World||China's Xi says US should not 'boss' and 'meddle' in other's internal affairs||Chinese President Xi Jinping on Tuesday hit out at the US, saying there should be no "bossing" and "meddling" in the internal affairs of other countries as Beijing is increasingly coming under pressure from Washington and its allies over issues of human rights violations, Taiwan and Hong Kong."Bossing others around or meddling in others’ internal affairs would not get one any support. We must advocate peace, development, equity, justice, democracy and freedom, which are common values of humanity, and encourage exchanges and mutual learning among civilizations to promote the progress of human civilization," Xi said, without directly referring to the US."What we need in today's world is justice, not hegemony," he said addressing the annual Boao Forum for Asia (BFA), a China promoted influential think tank based in Hainan via video link."Big countries should behave in a manner befitting to their status and with a greater sense of responsibility," he said.His snide remark against Washington came as US President Joe Biden vigorously pursued a strong China containment policy initiated by his predecessor by Donald Trump.Biden united US allies like the UK, the EU and Japan over his China policy. He also held the first quadrilateral summit of the emerging alliance called Quad which included US, Australia, Japan and India.The US, the European Union, Britain and Canada have imposed coordinated sanctions on China over alleged human rights violations against Uygur Muslims in Xinjiang, a charge Beijing denied.These countries have also taken united position on China firming up its control over Hong Kong with its new national security law subduing the massive pro-democracy agitation in the former British colony.Those who attended BFA meeting including Apple’s CEO Tim Cook, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Blackstone’s Stephen Schwarzman and Bridgewater’s Ray Dalio, the Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.Xi, in his address, also called on all countries in Asia and beyond to answer the "call of our times," defeat the pandemic through solidarity, strengthen global governance, and keep pursuing a community with a shared future for mankind.Marking the 20th anniversary of the BFA, this year's annual conference is themed "A World in Change: Join Hands to Strengthen Global Governance and Advance Belt and Road Cooperation.""Global governance should reflect the evolving political and economic landscape in the world, conform to the historical trend of peace, development and win-win cooperation, and meet the practical needs in addressing global challenges," Xi said.On creating a future of health and security with solidarity and cooperation, Xi said the key role of the World Health Organization (WHO) must be given full play in the ongoing fight against COVID-19.On climate change, Xi stressed the importance of following the philosophy of green development, advancing international cooperation and doing more to implement the Paris Agreement.Efforts should also be made to boost the digital economy, and step up exchanges and cooperation in areas such as artificial intelligence, biomedicine and modern energy, to turn the fruits of scientific and technological innovation into greater benefits for people in all countries, he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chinas-xi-says-us-should-not-boss-and-meddle-in-other-s-internal-affairs-101618917834594.html

The cause of death was not yet clear.Army spokesman Azem Bermendao Agouna announced his death in a broadcast on state television, surrounded by a group of military officers he referred to as the National Council of Transition."A call to dialogue and peace is launched to all Chadians in the country and abroad in order to continue to build Chad together," he said."The National Council of Transition reassures the Chadian people that all measures have been taken to guarantee peace, security and the republican order."Western countries have seen Deby as an ally in the fight against Islamist extremist groups, including Boko Haram in the Lake Chad Basin and groups linked to al Qaeda and Islamic State in the Sahel.Deby was also dealing with mounting public discontent over his management of Chad's oil wealth and crackdowns on opponents.His election victory had given him a sixth term in office but the April 11 vote was boycotted by opposition leaders.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/chad-president-idriss-deby-killed-on-front-lines-says-army-soon-after-poll-win-101618917652304.html

This number is increasing on a daily basis."He did not identify the 12 member states or say which countries were less comfortable with the 70% figure.An announcement last week that EU countries will receive 50 million more vaccines produced by Pfizer and BioNTech this quarter has given the executive additional comfort on its delivery targets, Breton said.It has also provided "room for manoeuvre" to cope with Breton's expectation that the bloc will initially have fewer Johnson & Johnson shots than hoped.He said he was also confident AstraZeneca will be able to deliver its reduced second quarter target of 70 million vaccines.Breton, who expressed hope recently that Europe will have a summer tourist season this year, said the vaccine target was important to provide "light at the end of the tunnel" before the holiday season.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/at-least-12-eu-member-states-confident-of-july-vaccination-target-official-101618915565943.html

The drugs were being illegally brought into the country from the US - primarily from California - and also from India.York Regional Police (YRP), which led the investigation and the subsequent crackdown, said multiple agencies worked on the operation that “dismantled a large-scale international drug trafficking network that extended to western Canada, the United States and India”.Other law enforcement agencies that were part of the operation were from Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Peel Regional Police, and the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).The investigation, named Project Cheetah, began in May last year and penetrated “a robust network” involved in importing large quantities of banned drugs into Canada. “The drugs were then distributed across the country through a sophisticated system run by the traffickers,” YRP said.On April 8, police in the Canadian provinces of Ontario and British Columbia as well as in California executed over 50 search warrants, resulting in 33 people being charged with over 130 offences.Among them, 27 were arrested and charged in the Greater Toronto Area, with 19 of them hailing from the town of Brampton. Of these, 23 are of Punjabi origin. One suspect, Gurbinder Sooch, remains at large. In a video statement, inspector Ryan Hogan of the Organised Crime Enforcement Bureau of YRP, said Project Cheetah was a “transnational investigation into the importation and distribution of cocaine, heroin, opium and ketamine into Canada both from India and from California”. The charges include drug trafficking, conspiracy to traffic drugs and possession of proceeds from criminal activities.During the course of the operation, officers seized about 2.3 million Canadian dollars (US$1.84 million) worth of drugs that included 10kg of cocaine, 8kg of ketamine, 3kg of heroin and 2.5kg of opium. Investigators also seized 48 firearms and 730,000 Canadian dollars (US$582,882) in cash.“This drug trafficking network was active throughout the Greater Toronto Area and negatively impacted our communities,” said superintendent Dermot Coughlan of Peel Regional Police’s intelligence operations.Inspector Marwan Zogheib, officer in charge of RCMP’s Toronto West Detachment, said, “RCMP’s resources across Canada and overseas and our partnership with YRP provide a multiplier effect to our collective efforts to dismantle such criminal networks.”The Criminal Intelligence Service Ontario also supported this joint-forces investigation.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/canada-busts-major-drug-trafficking-ring-indo-canadians-among-dozens-charged-101618915537615.html

Bush said that he was “shocked” by people’s reaction over his friendship with former first lady Michelle Obama. During a CBS Sunday Morning show, Bush, a Republican, reflected on his across-the-aisle relationship with Michelle Obama as he recalled the memorable moment of the duo embracing at the opening of the National Museum of African American History and Culture.They also grabbed headlines when Bush handed cough drops to Obama at the memorial service for late Senator John McCain and at the funeral for his father George H.W. Bush.“It shocked me,” the former president said, stressing that the polarisation among Americans has impacted their imagination."We got in the car and I think Barbara or Jenna said, 'Hey, you're trending!' The American people were so surprised that Michelle Obama and I could be friends. I think it's a problem that Americans are so polarised in their thinking that they can't imagine a George W. Bush and a Michelle Obama being friends," he added.Also Read: Trump shuns 'ex-presidents club' — and the feeling is mutualWhile Donald Trump made anti-immigrant rhetoric a centrepiece of his presidential campaign, Bush supports the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants in case they pass background checks and pay back taxes. He told CBS Evening News anchor Norah O'Donnell that a more respectful attitude to those who come to the United States will help lead to reform of the immigration system.Michelle Obama had earlier opened up about her friendship with Bush, saying she found common ground with the former president despite contrasting views. In an interview with Jenna Bush Harger, Bush’s daughter, Obama said that they disagree on policy but not on humanity. "Our values are the same," she said."We disagree on policy but we don’t disagree on humanity. We don’t disagree about love and compassion. I think that’s true for all of us...I had the opportunity to sit next to your father at funerals – the highs and lows...We shared stories about our kids and about our parents," Obama added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/george-w-bush-shocked-by-reaction-over-his-friendship-with-michelle-obama-101618914056792.html

The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that ministers would be making an announcement “shortly, taking into account the latest advice from the Climate Change Committee.”British Prime Minister Boris Johnson is due to host a major global climate summit, known as COP26, in Glasgow in November.Britain has already pledged to slash emissions by 68 per cent by 2030, one of the most ambitious targets among developed nations.The government's Climate Change Committee recommended the 2035 target last year, and said achieving it would require more electric vehicles, expanded wind power capacity and a reduction in meat and dairy consumption.Rebecca Newsom of Greenpeace UK welcomed the commitment, but said “targets are much easier to set than they are to meet, so the hard work begins now.”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/uk-to-toughen-climate-target-before-us-president-joe-biden-s-summit-reports-101618914032390.html

20-04-2021||World||Iran says 60% enrichment meant to show nuclear prowess, is reversible||Iran began enriching uranium to 60% purity in order to show its technical capacity after a sabotage attack at a nuclear plant, and the move is quickly reversible if the United States lifts sanctions, the Iranian government said on Tuesday.Talks in Vienna aimed at bringing the United States and Iran back to full compliance with a 2015 nuclear deal have been further complicated by an explosion at Iran's main uranium enrichment facility at Natanz.Iran has responded by saying it is enriching uranium to 60% fissile purity, a big step towards weapons-grade from the 20% it had previously achieved. The 2015 pact between Iran and world powers had capped the level of enrichment purity at 3.67% - suitable for generating civilian nuclear energy. Iran denies seeking a nuclear weapon."The start of 60% enrichment in Natanz was a demonstration of our technical ability to respond to terrorist sabotage at these facilities," Iranian government spokesman Ali Rabiei told reporters in Tehran."As in previous steps (in curbing Iran's commitment to the 2015 nuclear deal), ... this measure can quickly be reversed for a return to the agreed enrichment level in the nuclear accord if other parties commit to their obligations," Rabiei said, in remarks streamed live on a state-run website.Tehran says the Natanz blast was an act of sabotage by Israel, and on Saturday Iranian authorities named a suspect. Israel has not formally commented on the incident.Iran responded to the explosion by saying it is enriching uranium to 60%.Iran and world powers have made some progress on how to revive the 2015 nuclear accord later abandoned by the United States, and an interim deal could be a way to gain time for a lasting settlement, Iranian officials said on Monday.In Jerusalem, Israeli Foreign Minister Gabi Ashkenazi told visiting British Cabinet Office Minister Michel Gove that Iran should not be permitted to obtain a nuclear weapon."Iran is undermining stability in the entire Middle East and the international community must act to prevent Iran from achieving nuclear weapons capability. Not today and not in the future," an Israeli statement quoted Ashkenazi as saying.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/iran-says-60-enrichment-meant-to-show-nuclear-prowess-is-reversible-101618911741486.html

Downloads of the Clubhouse app, which is only available on Apple's iOS devices, suffered an estimated 70% decline in downloads in March from February when it hit a high.Zuckerberg said the world's largest social media network planned in the coming months to launch features including short-form audio clips called "Soundbites" and ways to create sound effects or improve audio quality. Facebook said in a blog post https://bit.ly/3e8FGsc it would begin to test live audio rooms, which would launch by the summer.Zuckerberg said Facebook was looking to "treat audio as a first-class medium in the way that we would photos or video" in an interview on Discord with Casey Newton, editor of newsletter Platformer.The rapid growth of the year-old app Clubhouse has demonstrated the potential of audio chat services.What is not clear is if Clubhouse, which just closed a new round of Series C funding in which a source said it was valued at $4 billion, will have staying power as installs decline.The app, which is not yet available on Android, faces competition from multiple companies working on Clubhouse clones. Twitter Inc is testing its live audio feature Spaces, along with new features from Discord, Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, Slack and Spotify Technology.Reddit also unveiled a preview of its "Reddit Talks" product to moderators on Monday.Analytics firm Sensor Tower estimated Clubhouse had a 72% decline in growth from about 9.6 million February installs to about 2.4 million in March.Facebook, which has long been criticized for its handling of problematic content across its products, will face the challenges of moderating live and recorded audio content.Facebook said its live audio rooms would be available on its Messenger product and in its main app. It said it would test the rooms with public figures as well as in Groups - a product the company has vigorously promoted as providing places for people with common interests but which have also been used to spread misinformation and organize extremist activity.As part of the announcements, Zuckerberg also said Facebook is working with Spotify on "Project Boombox" to share and listen to music on its platform.Facebook said users would be able to send donations, or tips, to creators in live audio rooms through "Stars". After launch, it will offer other types of monetization like single-purchase access or subscription for rooms. It also announced an audio creator fund for Soundbites.The company is working to attract more creators who are accustomed to receiving tips and other direct payments from fans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/facebook-takes-on-clubhouse-unveils-upcoming-audio-products-101618911041283.html

Alaska was the first state to lower statewide eligibility to age 16 and was followed by states including Georgia, Texas and California.Earlier in April, U.S. President Joe Biden had directed states to widen the vaccine eligibility to people aged 18 or above by April 19. No Covid-19 vaccine is authorized yet for those under 16, although testing is underway.More than half of U.S. adults have received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose, according to CDC.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-cdc-expands-covid-19-vaccine-eligibility-to-16-and-older-101618911032619.html

The extremist group has been leading an anti-France campaign for months over President Emmanuel Macron’s defence of the right of Charlie Hebdo magazine to republish cartoons depicting the Prophet Muhammad, an act considered blasphemous by Muslims.Pakistan watchers in India said the National Assembly’s recommendation to expel the French ambassador was a foregone conclusion since the political class in Islamabad would not want to anger the TLP.The radical group, formed in 2016, has emerged as one of Pakistan’s most hardline Islamist parties and has been pushing for strict implementation of Islamic sharia laws and death for blasphemers. PM Khan banned the group after it led street protests against the arrest of their leader, cleric Saad Rizvi. News agency AP said the TLP wants the government to expel the French ambassador under an agreement signed between the government and Rizvi’s party in February.To be sure, PM Khan sought to reach out to the protesters on Monday, underlining that he and the TLP shared the ultimate objective to end incidents of blasphemy across the world but had adopted a different approach. He tried to reason that expelling the French envoy would hurt Pakistan and would not help stop such incidents.“When we send the French ambassador back and break relations with them it means we break relations with the European Union,” he said in a televised address, according to a Pakistani newspaper, Dawn. “Half our textile exports go to the EU, so half our textile exports would be gone.”That appeal, which was also aimed at clarifying his government’s stand to the international community, however, couldn’t convince the TLP to back down. Over the last few weeks, the group has blocked highways, railways and access routes to major cities.Four police officers were killed, almost a dozen were taken hostage and more than 800 wounded, many of them seriously, during the clashes that followed.But Pakistan watchers in New Delhi said it was Imran Khan who lit the fire last October that had singed PM Khan’s credibility and encouraged groups that are challenging his authority. PM Khan was one of the few leaders in Muslim-majority countries to lead a campaign against President Macron for comments defending the “right to blaspheme” under freedom of expression; Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan was another.PM Khan, who was then seen to be aspiring for a leadership position in a new alliance of Islamic countries along with Turkey and Malaysia, wrote to leaders of Muslim-majority countries, asking them “to act collectively to counter growing Islamophobia in non-Muslim states”.Analysts said this initiative to placate the ultra-conservative groups in Pakistan and project himself as a defender of Islam abroad started to boomerang on him soon after.“I think the prime minister has realised that appeasing the radical forces isn’t an easy task because when you try to please them they demand more and more,” security analyst Amir Rana told news agency AFP. “So far he has failed to maintain the balance.”PM Khan, Indian officials suggest, isn’t the first one to play to the hardline extremist groups. Back in the eighties, military dictator President Zia-ul-Haq who ruled Pakistan for a decade tried the same strategy with equally disastrous results.“The Pakistani state has, over decades, actively fostered the ideology that led to the TLP and that leads many in the population to sympathise with the TLP,” said Madiha Afzal, a Brookings Institution fellow, said, according to AFP.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/imran-khan-feels-the-bite-asks-parliament-to-decide-french-envoy-s-expulsion-101618910077328.html
20-04-2021||World||Navalny's personal doctor denied access to hospital where he is being treated||A team of medics including ailing Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny's personal doctor were denied access Tuesday to a penal colony where he is being treated at a prison hospital.Navalny, 44, launched a hunger strike on March 31 and his medical team over the weekend warned that his health was failing so rapidly he could die at "any minute".Russia's prison service, which has repeatedly prevented Navalny's doctors from visiting him, on Monday moved him from his penal colony in the Vladimir region some 100 kilometres (60 miles) east of Moscow to a medical facility at another colony in the same region.A team of physicians including his personal doctor Anastasia Vasilyeva has made multiple attempts to see him but been rejected each time.On Tuesday morning the team was once again barred from seeing him, but was told to try again later in the day."This is super disrespectful to people who came to fulfil their human duty, a medical duty to help a patient," Vasilyeva told AFP outside the colony."We are talking now only about health and life."Navalny's lawyers also arrived at the penal colony on Tuesday and were allowed in, an AFP journalist at the scene reported.Navalny is serving a two-and-a-half-year sentence for violating parole terms on old fraud charges he says are politically motivated.The opposition politician was arrested on his return to Russia in January from Germany, where he had spent months recovering from a poisoning attack with the Novichok nerve agent.Navalny blames the attack on President Vladimir Putin, a claim the Kremlin has repeatedly denied.The European Union and the United States have imposed sanctions on Russia over the poisoning, and on Monday threatened Moscow with further penalties in the event of Navalny's death.The opposition figure launched his hunger strike last month demanding proper medical treatment over severe back pain and numbness in his limbs.His team over the weekend said a blood test had shown showed high potassium levels and elevated creatinine, indicating Navalny could be suffering from impaired kidney function and risked cardiac arrest.Russia's prison service on Monday insisted his condition was "satisfactory", despite moving him to the medical facility, and said he was taking vitamin supplements as part of medical treatment.Navalny's team has called on supporters to take to the streets on Wednesday -- when Putin is due to deliver his annual state of the nation address -- to protest how he is being treated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/navalnys-personal-doctor-denied-access-to-hospital-where-he-is-being-treated-101618909438913.html

Covid-19 infections and hospitalisations are down sharply.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/israel-logs-indian-covid-19-variant-sees-some-vaccine-efficacy-against-it-101618908432445.html
20-04-2021||World||EU expands sanctions against Myanmar military, companies controlled by army||The European Union expanded its sanctions against Myanmar’s military leaders and army-controlled companies ahead of a regional meeting to discuss the worsening crisis after army leaders deposed the elected government.The Council of the European Union's latest sanctions target 10 individuals and two military-controlled companies already subject to sanctions by the US, Britain and other governments.It is unclear if such moves are having any impact as the military escalates its efforts to crush opposition to its seizure of power. Myanmar's economy is already in crisis, worsened by the coronavirus pandemic and by the mass civil disobedience movement that arose following the Feb. 1 coup.The EU said the number of individuals sanctioned was expanded to 35 people it said were responsible for undermining democracy and the rule of law, for repressive decisions and for serious human rights violations.The two military-controlled companies, Myanma Economic Holdings Public Company Ltd. (MEHL) and Myanmar Economic Corp. (MEC), have vast holdings in many industries and help to fund the military.All are subject to having their assets frozen, travel banned and other measures. EU citizens and businesses are banned from doing business or providing funds to them without special permission.“Today’s decision is a sign of the EU’s unity and determination in condemning the brutal actions of the military junta, and aims at effecting change in the junta’s leadership," the EU said in a statement.“Today’s decision also sends a clear message to the military leadership: continuing on the current path will only bring further suffering and will never grant any legitimacy," it said.Since the coup, security forces have killed at least 738 protesters and bystanders, according to the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners, which monitors casualties and arrests. It says more than 3,200 people are still detained, among the nation's deposed civilian leader Aung San Suu Kyi and President Win Myint.The EU already had an embargo on sales to Myanmar of arms and equipment that can be used for internal repression; an export ban on dual-use goods for use by the military and border guard police; export restrictions on equipment for monitoring communications that could be used for internal repression, and a prohibition on military training for and military cooperation with the army.Last week, the US S&P 500 said it was removing India's Adani Ports and Special Economic Zone Ltd. from its sustainability index due to its alleged dealings with Myanmar authorities. Adani did not respond to a request for comment on that move.Former UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Monday exhorted the UN Security Council to act immediately to halt the violence and protect civilians. So far, the council has not taken such action, which would likely be blocked by China and Russia.The Association of Southeast Asian Nations — which is holding a summit on Myanmar this month — maintains a policy of “non-interference'' in each others' political matters and has rejected the idea of imposing sanctions against the junta.Ban urged ASEAN to send a high-level delegation to Myanmar. He said he had tried unsuccessfully to make a diplomatic visit himself.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/eu-expands-sanctions-against-myanmar-military-companies-controlled-by-army-101618908436675.html

He underlined that there needed to be respect for mutual concerns and sensitivities and for each other’s priorities,” a tweet by the Indian consulate general in Guangzhou said on the event.India and China have held several rounds of diplomatic and military talks to resolve the nearly year-long friction along the Line of Actual Control (LAC) in eastern Ladakh.The 10th meeting of the senior military commanders was held on February 20 after the two sides completed the withdrawal of frontline troops with armoured formations and artillery from the banks of Pangong Lake.However, the two sides were unable to make progress on efforts to disengage at other friction points such as Gogra, Hot Springs and Depsang Plains.The 11th round of military talks held on April 9 failed to resolve the differences.At the end of the 11th round, Beijing said the Chinese military will maintain diplomatic communication with its Indian counterpart to jointly safeguard peace and stability in the border region.“China hopes the Indian side can cherish the positive trend of de-escalation in the region and uphold the consensus reached by previous meetings, and work together with China to safeguard peace and tranquility in the area,” colonel Long Shaohua, who is with PLA’s western theatre command, was quoted as saying in a readout.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/china-deploys-advanced-rocket-launchers-in-western-theatre-command-101618901497262.html
20-04-2021||World||Memorial created in Ottawa to remember Indian diplomat K Sankara Pillai||A memorial has been created at the Indian high commission in Ottawa in memory of K Sankara Pillai, who was widely considered the first diplomat “martyr” of independent India.Pillai was assassinated on April 19, 1961 in Ottawa and the memorial marked the 60th anniversary of that tragedy. The consular waiting area at the high commission in the Canadian capital has been named after him as the K Sankara Pillai Memorial Hall. A sapling was planted on the high commission premises in his memory as well.Pillai was serving as the first secretary at the high commission in Ottawa when he was killed by Shani Ferizi, who was of Yugoslavian origin. Pillai had just finished lunch and had gone to greet Ferizi when he was gunned down. Ferizi had earlier been denied a visa to travel to India as he was blacklisted in the country.Pillai was 38 when he was killed and was survived by his pregnant wife and two children. He belonged to the first batch of the Indian Foreign Service (IFS) and his death was condoled in the Indian Parliament by then PM Jawaharlal Nehru.A virtual memorial meeting was also organised by the high commission, with India’s envoy Ajay Bisaria saying the effort was to create a “permanent institutional memory” so that the late diplomat was not forgotten.In a message, India’s foreign secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said the recognition of Pillai’s “sacrifice” had been “long overdue”. External affairs minister S Jaishankar, a former IFS officer, tweeted in remembrance and said the high commission had “appropriately named a hall in his memory”.The virtual memorial meeting was attended by Pillai’s three children as well as retired diplomat TP Sreenivasan, who triggered the commemoration with an article on the episode last year. A film on Pillai’s life and his shocking demise was featured at the event.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/memorial-created-in-ottawa-to-remember-indian-diplomat-k-sankara-pillai-101618897236801.html

They were due to resume Tuesday morning.After closing arguments were done, Judge Peter Cahill rejected a defense request for a mistrial based in part on comments from California Rep. Maxine Waters, who said “we've got to get more confrontational” if Chauvin isn't convicted of murder.The judge told Chauvin's attorney: “Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned.” He called her comments “abhorrent” and "disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch.”Chauvin, 45, is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, all of which require the jury to conclude that his actions were a “substantial causal factor” in Floyd’s death and that his use of force was unreasonable.The most serious charge carries up to 40 years in prison.“Use your common sense. Believe your eyes. What you saw, you saw,” prosecutor Steve Schleicher said in closing arguments, referring to the bystander video of Floyd pinned to the pavement with Chauvin's knee on or close to his neck for up to 9 minutes, 29 seconds, as onlookers yelled at the officer to get off.Chauvin attorney Eric Nelson countered by arguing that Chauvin did what any reasonable police officer would have done after finding himself in a “dynamic” and “fluid” situation involving a large man struggling with three officers.As Nelson began speaking, the now-fired Chauvin removed his Covid-19 mask in front of the jury for one of the very few times during the trial.With the case drawing to a close, some stores were boarded up in Minneapolis. The courthouse was ringed with concrete barriers and razor wire, and National Guard troops were on patrol. Floyd's death set off protests last spring in the city and across the US that sometimes turned violent.The city has also been on edge in recent days over the deadly police shooting of a 20-year-old Black man, Daunte Wright, in a nearby suburb on April 11.About 300 protesters marched in the streets outside the courthouse shortly after the jury got the case, lining up behind a banner reading, “Justice 4 George Floyd & all stolen lives. The world is watching.”Prosecutor Jerry Blackwell had the final word Monday, offering the state's rebuttal argument. The prosecutor, who is Black, said the questions about the use of force and cause of death are “so simple that a child can understand it.”“In fact, a child did understand it, when the 9-year-old girl said, ‘Get off of him,’” Blackwell said, referring to a young witness who objected to what she saw. "That’s how simple it was. `Get off of him.' Common sense.”Under the law, police have certain latitude to use force, and their actions are supposed to be judged according to what a “reasonable officer” in the same situation would have done.Nelson noted that officers who first went to the corner store where Floyd allegedly passed a counterfeit $20 bill were struggling with Floyd when Chauvin arrived as backup. The defense attorney also pointed out that the first two officers on the scene were rookies and that police had been told that Floyd might be on drugs.“A reasonable police officer understands the intensity of the struggle,” Nelson said, noting that Chauvin’s body camera and badge were knocked off his chest.Nelson also showed the jury pictures of pills found in Floyd’s SUV and pill remnants discovered in the squad car. Fentanyl and methamphetamine were found in Floyd’s system.The defense attorney said the failure of the prosecution to acknowledge that medical problems or drugs played a role “defies medical science and it defies common sense and reason.”During the prosecution's argument, Schleicher replayed portions of the bystander video and other footage as he dismissed certain defense theories about Floyd's death as “nonsense." He said Chauvin killed Floyd by constricting his breathing.Schleicher rejected the drug overdose argument, as well as the contention that police were distracted by hostile onlookers, that Floyd had “superhuman” strength from a state of agitation known as excited delirium, and that he suffered possible carbon monoxide poisoning from auto exhaust.The prosecutor sarcastically referred to the idea that it was heart disease that killed Floyd as an “amazing coincidence.”"Is that common sense or is that nonsense?” Schleicher asked the jury.Blackwell, his fellow prosecutor, likewise rejected the defense theory that Floyd died because of an enlarged heart: “The truth of the matter is that the reason George Floyd is dead is because Mr. Chauvin’s heart was too small.”Earlier, Schleicher described how Chauvin ignored Floyd’s cries and continued to kneel on him well after he stopped breathing and had no pulse. Chauvin was “on top of him for 9 minutes and 29 seconds and he had to know,” Schleicher said. “He had to know.”He said Chauvin heard Floyd, “but he just didn't listen.”The prosecutor said Floyd was "not a threat to anyone" and was not trying to escape when he struggled with officers but instead was terrified of being put into the tiny backseat of the squad car.He said a reasonable officer with Chauvin’s training and experience — he was a 19-year Minneapolis police veteran — should have sized up the situation accurately.Chauvin, wearing a light gray suit with a blue shirt and blue tie, showed little expression as he watched himself and the other officers pinning Floyd to the ground on bodycam video played by his attorney. He cocked his head to the side and occasionally leaned forward to write on a notepad.An unidentified woman occupied the single seat set aside in the pandemic-spaced courtroom for a Chauvin supporter.Floyd’s brother Philonise represented the family in court, as he often has during the trial.Schleicher also noted that Chauvin was required to use his training to provide medical care to Floyd but ignored bystanders, rebuffed help from an off-duty paramedic and rejected a suggestion from another officer to roll Floyd onto his side.“He could have listened to the bystanders. He could have listened to fellow officers. He could have listened to his own training," Schleicher said. “He knew better. He just didn’t do better."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/murder-case-against-ex-cop-in-floyd-s-death-goes-to-the-jury-101618887200831.html
20-04-2021||World||Walter Mondale, former US Vice President, dies at 93||Former US Vice President Walter Mondale, a liberal icon who famously told voters to expect a tax increase should he win the presidency, died Monday, US media reported. He was 93 years old.No cause was given for Mondale's death, according to reports citing a statement from his family.Mondale served as vice president under President Jimmy Carter, from 1977-1981."Today I mourn the passing of my dear friend Walter Mondale, who I consider the best vice president in our country's history," Carter said in a statement, extending his condolences to his former number two's family."He was an invaluable partner and an able servant of the people of Minnesota, the United States, and the world."Prior to his stint at the White House, Mondale had served as attorney general to his home state of Minnesota from 1960-1964, and then as US senator from that state from 1964-1976.After Carter left office, Mondale went on to serve as ambassador to Japan between 1993 and 1996.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a fellow Minnesotan, mourned Mondale's passing, calling him "kind and dignified to the end.""Walter Mondale was a true public servant and my friend and mentor," she said on Twitter."He set a high bar for himself and kept passing it and raising it."Walter Frederick "Fritz" Mondale was born on January 5, 1928 in the tiny town of Ceylon, Minnesota. The son of a Methodist minister and a music teacher, he moved through several small towns in the southern part of the state throughout his childhood.At age 20, Mondale became a congressional district manager for US politician Hubert Humphrey's successful Senate campaign. Humphrey would later become Mondale's political mentor.Mondale began his national political career in 1964, when he was appointed to fill Humphrey's Senate seat, the latter having resigned to become vice president.An outspoken supporter of civil rights, Mondale advocated throughout his Senate career for education, housing, migrant worker rights and child nutrition.He made his own bid for the White House 1984, facing off against Republican Ronald Reagan. Mondale picked US Representative Geraldine Ferraro as his running mate, making him the first major-party presidential nominee to put a woman on the ticket.During his campaign, he infamously told voters to expect a tax increase if he won, which would later go on to define the race.On Election Day, Mondale won only Minnesota and the District of Columbia."I did my best," he said the day after the vote.Mondale served as the US ambassador to Japan under Bill Clinton, and he sought to increase trade between the two countries.He kept up his relationship with the Clintons and in 2008 initially endorsed Hillary Clinton for president. He changed his endorsement once Barack Obama secured the nomination.Mondale married his wife, Joan Adams Mondale, in 1955. The couple had three children: sons Ted and William, and daughter Eleanor.Ted and William followed their father into politics and public service, while Eleanor became a broadcast journalist.Joan died in 2014 after an extended illness, and Eleanor died in 2011 from brain cancer.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/walter-mondale-former-us-vice-president-dies-at-93-101618885909323.html

"Even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading variants and should avoid all travel to India. If you must travel to India, get fully vaccinated before travel," the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said in an advisory.This comes a day after the US state department said that it would issue specific warnings against travelling to roughly 80% of the world's countries due to pandemic risks. It also asked Americans to reconsider their international travel plans before proceeding in view of the viral infection resurfacing in many countries. "The Covid-19 pandemic continues to pose unprecedented risks to travelers. In light of those risks, the Department of State strongly recommends US citizens reconsider all travel abroad," it said.However, the department has not revealed which countries will fall under which category. That will become known as guidance is issued individually for each country in the coming week.The United States hasn't had a global advisory warning against international travel since August when guidance was revoked by the Trump administration. The state department's assessments for classification of the countries include Covid-19 infection rates as well as the availability of local testing and treatment.The number of active cases in India crossed the two million mark as the country continued to record a mammoth surge in daily cases of the coronavirus disease. The number has doubled in just 10 days, marking a grim milestone in the fight against the pandemic. Active cases in the country crossed the 1 million active cases mark on April 10.Active cases are those in which Covid-19 patients are still carrying the virus and thus under treatment. It is a crucial metric representing the country’s battle against the coronavirus disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in a region.

Recode reported earlier on Facebook’s plans. “We have seen a massive rise of audio experiences” during the pandemic, Simo said, including an increase in voice calls and audio messages on Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp, which spurred the company to build the new products. Audio has become an important format with many people stuck at home due to the pandemic.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/fb-pushes-into-audio-to-compete-with-twitter-clubhouse-101618885008040.html
20-04-2021||World||Nasa’s Ingenuity chopper performs first flight from Mars||Nasa’s miniature robot helicopter Ingenuity performed a successful takeoff and landing on Mars early on Monday, achieving the first powered, controlled flight by an aircraft over the surface of another planet, the US space agency said.The twin-rotor whirligig’s debut on the Red Planet marked a 21st-Century Wright Brothers moment for Nasa, which said success could pave the way for new modes of exploration on Mars and other destinations in the solar system, such as Venus and Saturn’s moon Titan.Mission managers at Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles burst into applause and cheers as engineering data beamed back from Mars confirmed that the 1.8-kg solar-powered helicopter had performed its maiden 39-second flight as planned three hours earlier.Altimeter readings from the rotorcraft showed that it became airborne at 3.34am EDT (0734 GMT), climbed as programmed to a height of three metres, then hovered steadily in place over the Martian surface for half a minute before touching back down safely on its four legs, Nasa said.During Nasa’s presentation of the event livestreamed from JPL headquarters, mission managers also displayed its first images from the flight.A black-and-white photo taken by a downward-pointing onboard camera while the helicopter was aloft showed the distinct shadow cast by Ingenuity in the Martian sunlight onto the ground just below it.And a snippet of colour video footage captured by a separate camera mounted on the Nasa’s Mars rover Perseverance, parked about 200 feet away, showed the helicopter in flight against the orange-coloured landscape surrounding it. “We can now say that human beings have flown an aircraft on another planet,” said MiMi Aung, Ingenuity project manager at JPL.Despite the flight’s brevity, it marked a historic feat in interplanetary aviation, taking place on an “air field” 173 million miles from Earth on the floor of a vast Martian basin called Jezero Crater. Nasa likened the achievement to the Wright Brothers’ first controlled flight of their motor-driven airplane near Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in December 1903 — a takeoff and landing that covered just 37 metres in 12 seconds.Paying tribute to that modest but monumental first flight, Nasa engineers affixed a tiny swath of wing fabric from the original Wright flyer under Ingenuity’s solar panel before sending it on its way to Mars.“Ingenuity is the latest in a long and storied tradition of NASA projects achieving a space exploration goal once thought impossible,” acting NASA chief Steve Jurczyk said in a statement. “Today’s results indicate the sky - a least on Mars - may not be the limit.”The tiny rotorcraft was carried to the Red Planet strapped to the belly of the Mars rover Perseverance, a six-wheeled astrobiology lab that touched down in Jezero Crater on Feb. 18 after a nearly seven-month journey through space.Ingenuity was developed as a technology demonstration, separate from Perseverance’s primary mission to search for traces of ancient microorganisms and collect samples of Martian rock for eventual return to Earth for further analysis.With the helicopter’s first outing deemed a success, Nasa plans to send the aircraft on several additional, progressively more ambitious flights in the weeks ahead.Building a helicopter that could fly on Mars posed a major challenge for JPL engineers.While Mars possesses much less gravity to overcome than Earth, its atmosphere is just 1% as dense, making it especially difficult to generate aerodynamic lift. To compensate, engineers equipped Ingenuity with rotor blades that are larger (four feet long) and spin far more rapidly than would be needed on Earth for a similar aircraft of its size. The design was successfully tested in vacuum chambers built at JPL to simulate Martian conditions, but it remained to be seen whether Ingenuity would actually fly on the fourth planet from the sun, until Monday.Because of the enormous distances involved, Ingenuity was designed to execute pre-programmed flight instructions autonomously, using sophisticated onboard pilot and navigation systems. The small aircraft also had to withstand punishing cold, with nighttime temperatures dropping as low as 130 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (minus 90 degrees Celsius), using solar power alone to recharge and keep its internal components properly heated.The planned flight was delayed for a week by a technical glitch on April 9.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/nasas-ingenuity-chopper-performs-first-flight-from-mars-101618883857314.html

20-04-2021||World||US Supreme Court likely to bar some 'green card' applicants||The Supreme Court appears ready to prevent thousands of people living in the US for humanitarian reasons from applying to become permanent residents.The justices seemed favourable, in arguments via telephone, to the case made by the Biden administration that federal immigration law prohibits people who entered the country illegally and now have Temporary Protected Status from seeking “green cards” to remain in the country permanently.The designation applies to people who come from countries ravaged by war or disaster, protects them from deportation and allows them to work legally.The case pits the administration against immigrant groups that contend federal law is more forgiving for the 400,000 people who are TPS recipients.Many have lived in the US for many years, given birth to American citizens and have put down roots in this country, their advocates say.The Justice Department says it is maintaining a position held consistently for 30 years by administrations of both parties.President Joe Biden supports changing the law to put TPS recipients, among other immigrants, on a path to citizenship.Legislation that would allow people who are here for humanitarian reasons to adjust their immigration status has passed the House, but faces uncertain prospects in the Senate.Justice Brett Kavanaugh said the court should be “careful about tinkering with the immigration statutes as written,” especially when Congress could act.“But just kind of big picture, why should we jump in here when Congress is very focused on immigration?” Kavanaugh asked.The case turns on whether people who entered the country illegally and were given humanitarian protections were ever “admitted” into the United States under immigration law.Justice Clarence Thomas said “they clearly were not admitted at the borders. So is that a fiction? Is it metaphysical? What is it? I don't know.”The case before the court involves a couple from El Salvador who have been in the country since the late 1990s. In 2001, the US gave Salvadoran migrants legal protection to remain in the US after a series of earthquakes in their home country.People from 10 other countries are similarly protected. They are: Haiti, Honduras, Nepal, Nicaragua, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-supreme-court-likely-to-bar-some-green-card-applicants-101618877401210.html

"This does not change the fact Officer Sicknick died in the line of duty, courageously defending Congress and the Capitol."The medical examiner's office determined that Sicknick suffered two strokes and classified him dying of natural causes.Two persons, Julian Elie Khater and George Pierre Tanios, were arrested on March 14 and charged with assaulting Sicknick and two other officers with a chemical spray on January 6.Federal prosecutors allege that Khater and Tanios were carrying Frontiersman bear spray, which is manufactured by Sabre, a company that makes self-defense products including pepper spray and stun guns. Though made from the same ingredient, bear spray can be many times more powerful than pepper sprays sold for self-defense and is not meant for use on humans.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-capitol-police-says-officer-assaulted-in-jan-6-riot-died-of-natural-causes-101618877606493.html
20-04-2021||World||US agencies probe fatal Tesla crash believed to be driverless||Two US agencies on Monday said they were investigating a Tesla crash in Texas on Saturday that left two dead and which local police said appeared to have occurred with no one in the driver's seat.The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which regulates vehicle safety, and the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) both said they would investigate the crash.The NHTSA said it "has immediately launched a Special Crash Investigation team to investigate the crash. We are actively engaged with local law enforcement and Tesla to learn more about the details of the crash and will take appropriate steps when we have more information."Just hours before the crash, Tesla Inc chief executive Elon Musk tweeted to his more than 50 million followers, "Tesla with Autopilot engaged now approaching 10 times lower chance of accident than average vehicle."Tesla, whose shares were down 3.4% Monday, did not immediately comment.The crash occurred as scrutiny is increasing over Tesla's semi-automated Autopilot driving system following recent crashes.Autopilot was operating in at least three Tesla vehicles involved in fatal U.S. crashes since 2016. NHTSA has sent teams to at least three other Tesla crashes in recent weeks that were believed to have been tied to Autopilot use.In Saturday's accident, the 2019 Tesla Model S was traveling at high speed near Houston when it failed to negotiate a curve and went off the road, crashing into a tree and bursting into flames, local television station KHOU-TV said.After the fire was extinguished, authorities located two occupants in the vehicle, with one in the front passenger seat and the other in the back seat of the Tesla, KHOU-TV said, citing Harris County Precinct 4 Constable Mark Herman.Tesla advises drivers to keep their hands on the steering wheel and pay attention while using Autopilot. However, some Tesla drivers say they are able to avoid putting their hands on the wheel for extended periods when using Autopilot.Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Democrat, wrote on Twitter that "using Tesla’s driverless system — or any other — shouldn’t be a death risk. Advancements in driving technology must first & foremost be safe."He added that "comprehensive oversight" by the NHTSA "is paramount to prevent future semi-automated driving deaths."Last month, NHTSA told Reuters it had opened 27 special investigations into crashes of Tesla vehicles, 23 of which remain active, and that at least three of the crashes had occurred recently.The NTSB, which makes safety recommendations but cannot compel recalls, said it would send two people to conduct a safety investigation into the Texas crash focusing "on the vehicle’s operation and the post-crash fire."The NTSB last criticized the NHTSA’s approach to oversight of automated vehicles as "misguided, because it essentially relies on waiting for problems to occur rather than addressing safety issues proactively." It added that NHTSA has "taken a nonregulatory approach to automated vehicle safety."||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-agencies-probe-fatal-tesla-crash-believed-to-be-driverless-101618876787613.html

20-04-2021||World||US under Biden will no longer call migrants 'illegal aliens'||Employees of the two main U.S. immigration enforcement agencies were directed Monday to stop referring to migrants as “aliens,” a dated term that many people consider offensive.Memos issued by Customs and Border Protection, as well as Immigration and Customs Enforcement, recommend agents instead use the words “non-citizen” or “migrant." The change reflect guidelines set by the Biden administration, which is reversing many of the anti-immigrant policies of former President Donald Trump.Instead of “illegal aliens,” which was still being used by some government officials in press releases and elsewhere, the employees of CBP and ICE should instead use “undocumented noncitizen” or “undocumented individual,” according to the memos.Acting CBP Commissioner Troy Miller said the directives were necessary to “set a tone and example” at an agency that includes the Border Patrol.“We enforce our nation’s laws while also maintaining the dignity of every individual with whom we interact,” Miller said. “The words we use matter and will serve to further confer that dignity to those in our custody.”Administration critics dismissed the new language guidelines.“We use the term ‘illegal alien’ because they’re here illegally,” said Sen. Tom Cotton, a Republican from Arkansas. “This kind of weakness and obsession with political correctness is why we’re having a crisis on the border in the first place.”As recently as last Thursday, CBP issued a press release out of Texas that described a Border Patrol operation in the Rio Grande Valley "resulting in the apprehension of ten illegal aliens.”But a release Monday from California seemed to comply with the memo, describing the rescue of a “lost undocumented noncitizen” near Ocotillo, California.The change in language comes as the Biden administration deals with a record number of children and teens, mostly from Central America, seeking to enter the U.S. at the southwest border.Under the new guidelines, “unaccompanied alien children” would be referred to as “unaccompanied noncitizen children,” according to the memos. Employees are also directed to describe the “assimilation” of refugees and immigrants as “civic integration.”CBP is turning away most adult migrants attempting to enter the U.S. under a public health order issued at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. But the Biden administration is allowing unaccompanied minors and some families to remain, at least temporarily, while authorities determine whether they can stay through the asylum process or under some other legal category.Biden administration officials blame the rising number of migrants at the southwest border on a number of factors, including two recent hurricanes that struck Central America and the economic ravages of Covid-19 in the region.Critics blame the administration's moves to reverse some of the hundreds of measures taken under President Donald Trump to curb both legal and illegal immigration and support for legislation that would enable some already in the country to remain.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/us-under-biden-will-no-longer-call-migrants-illegal-aliens-101618868180287.html
20-04-2021||World||Jaishankar and Blinken discuss multiple issues||External affairs minister S Jaishankar and his US counterpart Antony Blinken discussed developments in the region and health cooperation against the backdrop of the planned withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and the Covid-19 crisis.“Spoke to my US counterpart Secretary of State @SecBlinken this evening. Conversation covered recent developments in India’s immediate and extended neighbourhood. Exchanged views on the UNSC agenda. Also discussed issues pertaining to our health cooperation,” Jaishankar said in a tweet without giving details.There was no official word from both countries on the conversation. People familiar with developments said on condition of anonymity that the situation in Afghanistan and the US embargo on exports of raw materials needed for Covid-19 vaccines had figured in the discussions.The Biden administration invoked the US Defence Production Act in February to curb the export of raw materials for vaccine production. The Serum Institute of India’s (SII) ability to make some 160 million doses of Covid-19 vaccine a month could be hit in the coming weeks if the US doesn’t lift the embargo on supplies of 37 critical items, reports have said. On April 16, SII CEO Adar Poonawalla raised the issue in a tweet addressed to US President Joe Biden.Foreign secretary Harsh Shringla said last month that the issue had been officially raised with the US through the Indian ambassador in Washington.Participating in an online discussion on Monday, Jaishankar referred to the matter indirectly when he said he was “pushing other countries, particularly some big countries, [to] please keep the raw materials flowing for vaccines to be made in India”.Also read: French police warn Prez Emmanuel Macron about rising levels of street violenceResponding to a question on criticism of India’s exports of Covid-19 vaccines amid growing domestic demand, Jaishankar noted that the vaccine being produced in India in the largest quantity – the AstraZeneca jab made by SII – is a “co-creation” and an international product. “Can I, on one hand, go round the world and say, guys, keep your supply chain flowing towards me, and by the way... I am asking you for raw material but I am not going to give you the vaccine?” he asked.He added, “As things got tough we spoke to the world very honestly and said look, we have done our best to live up to commitments – contractual commitments of producers, COVAX commitments – but right now please understand that I have this very serious situation at home and I think most countries understand that.”On the US exit from Afghanistan, Jaishankar said India has always played an active role in that country. “Afghanistan is a doorstep away. So how can we not have a role, influence, presence [and] activity out there?” he said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/jaishankar-and-blinken-discuss-multiple-issues-101618858131858.html
20-04-2021||World||‘2020 saw 1.2 degrees Celsius rise in global temperature’: Report||The global average temperature was about 1.2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels despite the cooling effect of La Nina ocean-atmosphere phenomenon in 2020, the World Meteorological Organisation confirmed on Monday in its State of the Global Climate 2020 report. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had warned that a 1.5 degree C warming will mark a menacing milestone in the warming of the planet.UN Secretary-General, Antonio Guterres who released the report on Monday said the UN is building a global coalition to reach net-zero emissions by 2050. “2020 was 1.2 degrees Celsius hotter than pre-industrial times. We are getting dangerously close to the 1.5-degree Celsius limit set by the scientific community. We are on the verge of the abyss. To avert the worst impacts of climate change, science tells us that we must limit global temperature rise to within 1.5 degrees of the pre-industrial baseline. That means reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 and reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. We are way off track. This must be the year for action,” he said adding that all countries should phase out coal by 2040.Last year was one of the three warmest years on record; the six years since 2015 have been the warmest on record and 2011-2020 was the warmest decade on record, the report highlighted adding that decrease in the annual growth rate of CO2 concentration due to the Covid 19 lockdown will be practically indistinguishable.Globally averaged carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations have already exceeded 410 parts per million (ppm), 148% of pre-industrial levels, and if the CO2 concentration follows the same pattern as in previous years, it could reach or exceed 414 ppm in 2021, according to the report.“Developed countries must lead in phasing out coal -- by 2030 in Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, and 2040 elsewhere. No new coal power plants should be built.” Guterres also called for an agreement among all countries to follow a common direction of travel. “The United Nations is building a global coalition committed to net zero emissions – to cover all countries, cities, regions, businesses and financial institutions. Second, the next 10 years need to be a decade of transformation. Countries need to submit ambitious new NDCs -- the nationally determined contributions to the Paris Agreement – which are their climate plans for the next 10 years,” he said.The report comes ahead of the April 22-23 Virtual Leaders’ Summit on Climate convened by the United States of America. The Summit will have participation from 40 world leaders and one of its aims is “Galvanizing efforts by the world’s major economies to reduce emissions during this critical decade to keep the goal of limiting warming to 1.5 degree Celsius within reach,” according to the US department of state.United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate, John Kerry had met Prime Minister Narendra Modi and environment minister Prakash Javadekar earlier this month regarding increasing climate ambition ahead of COP 26 in Glasgow this November. Minister for Europe and Foreign Affairs of France, Jean-Yves Le Drian had also met Javadekar and said all countries should be on track to achieve carbon neutrality and start phasing out coal.Javadekar had said India will not raise its climate ambition at the behest of or under pressure from developed countries. India has the right to develop and its poor have the right to grow and that countries should respect the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities (CBDR). (CBDR, a principle under the Paris Agreement requires richer countries to lead and take historical responsibility for the emissions caused in the past by them.)According to Climatewatch’s net-zero tracker, 59 countries representing 54% of global emissions have announced net-zero targets. Only 6 parties have legislations on net-zero emissions. India is among 6 countries that are compliant with the Paris Agreement’s 2-degree target including Bhutan, Costa Rica and the Philippines according to Climate Action Tracker. 7 countries are “critically insufficient” and their pledges will lead to 4+degree C warming including the US and the Russian Federation.Temperatures reached 38.0 degrees C at Verkhoyansk, Russian Federation on June 20, the highest recorded temperature anywhere north of the Arctic Circle. The Arctic minimum sea-ice extent in September 2020 was the second-lowest on record. The sea-ice retreat in the Laptev Sea was the earliest observed in the satellite era. Some 9.8 million people were displaced largely due to hydrometeorological hazards and disasters, and were recorded during the first half of 2020. Annual precipitation totals in monsoon in North America, Africa, South-West Asia and South-East Asia were unusually high in 2020. Monsoon seasonal totals in India were 109% of the long-term mean, the third-highest seasonal total after 1994 and 2019.“2020 was one of the warmest years despite having a La Niña with cool waters in the east Pacific. La Niñas typically has a cooling effect on global temperatures, but this is now offset by global warming due to greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, La Niña years now are warmer than years with El Niño events of the past,” Roxy Mathew Koll, a climate scientist at the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM), Pune.“International agreements on climate change aim to keep global warming within the safe range of 1.5C to 2C, but few people realise that the world’s average temperature is already more than a degree warmer than it was 200 years ago. Parts of the world like the Himalayas are warming even faster. This is a serious concern for India because climate change could have a compounding effect on existing scarcities, stresses and extreme events. For example, in 2020, even as we were fighting the Covid-19 pandemic, we also had to face Cyclone Amphan, which intensified rapidly in a warmer ocean. It is crucial that all countries invest in adaptation to climate impacts, especially to protect those who are most vulnerable to extreme events. At the same time, we need to accelerate policies and technologies to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions as rapidly as possible,” said Ulka Kelkar, director of climate programme at the World Resources Institute, responding to the WMO report.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/2020-saw-1-2-degrees-celsius-rise-in-global-temperature-report-101618858476797.html

The data from Johns Hopkins University showing a 12% increase in infections from a week earlier casts doubt on the hope that the end of the pandemic is in sight.The weekly increase surpassed the previous high set in mid-December. While infection rates have largely slowed in the US and UK, countries in the developing world - India and Brazil in particular - are shouldering surging caseloads.The global death toll from the deadly disease is also resuming momentum. Covid-19 fatalities have increased for the past month and were about 82,000 the week ended April 18, an average of almost 12,000 a day.That’s up from just over 60,000 in the week ended March 14, or about 8,600 a day, the most recent low.Hugs, tears as bubble opens between Aus, NZFamilies reunited in emotional scenes on Monday as Australia and New Zealand launched a quarantine-free travel bubble that opened the border almost 400 days after its closure. There were ecstatic welcomes at airport terminals on both sides of the Tasman Sea. The bubble followed months of negotiations between the two neighbours.Travellers between the two countries had been previously required to quarantine for at least two weeks upon arrival at their destinations.Oxford study to reinfect recovered patientsPeople who have fought off Covid-19 will be reinfected in a first-of-its-kind trial at University of Oxford, potentially illuminating how to develop more effective vaccines against the virus.Researchers are looking for 64 healthy, previously-infected volunteers aged 18 to 30 years to be studied under controlled conditions.

It’s clear that it’s a matter of concern when you deploy a lot of troops,” Borrell said. “Well, a spark can jump here or there.” Borrell declined to say where he got the 150,000 Russian troop figure from. But it is bigger than the 110,000 estimate provided by Ukrainian defence minister Andriy Taran on Wednesday.More than 14,000 people have died in seven years of fighting between Ukrainian forces and Russia-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine that erupted after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula. The EU has steadfastly opposed the annexation but has been unable to do anything about it.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/world-news/150k-russian-soldiers-at-ukraine-s-borders-eu-101618856881548.html

EVMs are stored across 75 strong rooms across Tamil Nadu including three in Chennai. “Even if something happens in four out of the 75 strong rooms, it means there is wrongdoing in all the 75 so we cannot be callous,” said Haasan.Sahoo did not respond to calls and messages.

20-04-2021||India||UK, US, Hong Kong and Singapore tighten travel curbs on India amid Covid-19 surge||New Zealand, the UK, the US and Singapore are among the countries that have imposed fresh restrictions on travellers from India against the backdrop of a massive spike in Covid-19 infections.On Monday, the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised Americans to avoid all travel to India even if they are vaccinated. CDC placed India among “level 4” countries, or those with “very high” levels of Covid-19 cases.“Because of the current situation in India even fully vaccinated travellers may be at risk for getting and spreading Covid-19 variants and should avoid all travel to India,” the CDC said.On Monday, India recorded nearly 274,000 new infections and the total number of confirmed cases was more than 15 million. Countries around the world have watched warily as the number of cases has grown, especially in the past two weeks, and high-profile visits and summits have been called off. Also read: ’India gasping for oxygen’ - Rahul Gandhi jabs Centre on Covid-19New Zealand, which has worked assiduously to keep infection rates low, was the first country to act as cases increased in India. On April 8, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced New Zealand was temporarily suspending the entry of travellers from India, including its own citizens, for two weeks.The move followed New Zealand recording 23 new positive cases at its borders, including 17 from India.Singapore’s health ministry announced on Tuesday that Covid-19 border measures will be tightened for travellers from India, who will have to stay at home for an additional seven days after the mandatory 14-day stay at dedicated facilities. The new rule will come into force from Thursday.Singapore will also reduce entry approvals for non-citizens and permanent residents due to the worsening Covid-19 situation in India and the emergence of the new Coronavirus variant, the ministry said.Hours after the cancellation of UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s visit to India on Monday, India became the 40th country to be included in Britain’s travel “red list”. Most travellers, except British and Irish passport-holders, coming from or transiting through India won’t be allowed to enter the UK from April 23. Many experts believe the UK had held off on including India in the red list because Johnson planned to go ahead with his visit on April 25. Britain’s decision also followed the detection of more than 100 cases of the Indian “double mutant” variant of Covid-19.Pakistan on Monday put a ban on travellers from India for two weeks, citing the spread of the new Coronavirus variant. The National Command and Operation Centre placed India in the “list of Category C countries” and said there would “be a ban on inbound passengers coming from India via air and land routes”.Hong Kong suspended flights from India, Pakistan and the Philippines from Tuesday for two weeks after a mutant Covid-19 variant was detected in the financial hub for the first time. The three countries were classified as “extremely high risk” after multiple cases of travellers carrying the strain into Hong Kong in the past fortnight.Authorities in Hong Kong said on Tuesday that 53 passengers on a flight from New Delhi to the city had tested positive for Covid-19. The passengers flew into Hong Kong on a Vistara flight on April 4.Flights from India continue to be Canada’s top source of international passengers testing positive for Covid-19, Toronto Sun reported on Tuesday. Data from Health Canada showed nearly all of the twice-daily flights between Delhi and Toronto carried passengers infected with the Coronavirus. Thirty of the 106 flights carrying infected passengers into Canada since March 4 originated from Delhi, the report said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/uk-us-hong-kong-and-singapore-tighten-travel-curbs-on-india-amid-covid-19-surge-101618939658885.html

The state grappled with an acute scarcity of vaccines for the second consecutive day, as per the official data. In the last 24 hours, 112,221 tests were conducted in the state and at least nine districts recorded more than 1,000 cases. Ernakulam topped the list with 3,212 cases and many areas in the district were declared containment areas. Active caseload also touched an all-time high of 1,18,673, according to the data released by the state health ministry. With 28 fatalities, the death toll went up to 4978. Despite the grim scenario, the state health ministry claimed there were enough ICU beds and oxygen supply was satisfactory. Though many hospitals were packed to the brim, health officials said the situation was under control. Hospitals were strictly told to admit those in serious condition to ease the pressure. Amid mounting cases, the state reported an acute shortage of Covid-19 vaccine forcing health authorities to shut many vaccination centres. In capital city Thiruvananthapuram, out of 150 centres, only 26 operated while in Ernakulam, one of the worst-affected districts, only two dozen centres functioned. Health authorities said the public was informed about the shortage but several beneficiaries were caught unaware and crowded centres. The state government sent another SOS to the Union health ministry on Tuesday. Last week also it wrote to the ministry seeking 50 lakh doses of the vaccine. A senior health ministry official said by Wednesday the state will be getting 10 lakh vials that will help tide over the present shortage. Mass vaccination campaign launched by the government was also affected due to the paucity of doses. Though a large number of vaccines were wasted by some states, Kerala reported almost nil wastage. Tamil Nadu topped the list with 12% followed by Haryana at 9.74%, as per the Union health ministry data. As Covid-19 cases galloped, the state has strengthened containment measures. Night curfew will be in force from Tuesday night for two weeks. RT-PCR test was made mandatory for all domestic travellers and those coming from abroad. On Monday, the government decided to hold Thrissur Pooram, the mother of all temple festivals, sans spectators. Meanwhile, state health minister KK Shailaja entered into quarantine after her son and daughter-in-law tested positive for the virus. She said she will remain in quarantine for the next two weeks.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/situation-grim-as-kerala-reports-highest-single-day-spike-in-covid-19-cases-101618935218781.html

In October 2018, a 737 Max plane operated by Lion Air crashed in Indonesia killing 180 people.On the 737 Max plane, the European Union’s Aviation Safety Agency expressed concerns about the requirements of pilot training as well as on malfunction of the “angle of attack” system which triggered an anti-stall system linked to the aforementioned two crashes.“This order applies to all persons operating the Boeing Company Model 737-8 and Boeing Company Model 737-9 airplanes in the territory of Republic of India, and to Indian/ foreign operators permitted by India to conduct flights with Boeing Company Model 737-8 and Boeing Company Model 737-9 airplanes,” the DGCA said.The regulator said the ban imposed on March 13, 2019, would not apply to foreign-registered 737 Max plane that wants to overfly “the Indian airspace”. However, such an aircraft must have permissions from the “regulatory authority of the state of registry” as well as the DGCA.On March 13, 2019, budget carrier SpiceJet had to ground 12 Max planes, forcing it to cancel a significant number of flights on that day as well as on the next day. Jet Airways also had five Max planes in its fleet but they were already grounded as due to non-payment of dues to lessors. A month later, the full-service carrier had shut down its operations due to a lack of funds.In March 2019, the 737 Max plane was banned by the regulators of several countries, including India. “This Order supersedes the Order No. DGCA-15018(21)/9/2018-DAS dated 13th March 2019, regarding operation of Boeing 737 Max aircraft,” the DGCA order said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dgca-allows-banned-boeing-737-max-to-fly-over-india-101618930778255.html

The government should ensure that such provocative videos propagating falsified information should be admonished.""On behalf of the medical fraternity, and all healthcare and frontline workers we demand strongly that strictest steps be taken against his inappropriate conduct at the earliest to prevent unrest amongst doctors and anxiety amongst the affected patients and their family," the RDA letter stated.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/aiims-rda-writes-to-amit-shah-demands-strict-action-against-comedian-sunil-pal-for-nefarious-remark-101618927795351.html

Of them, 202 families went to Bongofapara and the rest went to Haduklau on Monday,” said Kanchanpur sub divisional magistrate Chandni Chandran. More families are expected to move to their newly-allotted permanent residences in the second batch on Thursday, she added.This day was made possible due to the breakthrough agreement signed last January between the Union home ministry, governments of Tripura and Mizoram and the Bru migrants, who remained in Tripura after repatriation of over 5,000 community members in nine phases since 2009.The agreement also assigned ₹600 crore for the community’s resettlement.The agreement last year led to several protests by few local organizations alleging it would effect a change in the demography of the 15 areas identified in the six districts of Tripura for the community’s resettlement. Two persons, including a fireman, were killed and 20 others were injured in the clashes.As the new chapter in their lives begin, the community members have been enrolled for Aadhar making them eligible to receive benefits under different schemes, including those announced for their resettlement. All the families were being given a temporary house with provision for water and ration supplies.The Brus fled from Mizoram after clashes with the Mizo tribe in the state and are currently spread across Tripura, Mizoram and parts of southern Assam. Also known as Reangs in the state, they are one of the 19 scheduled tribes of Tripura and have their own language and dialect.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bru-migrants-move-to-permanent-homes-in-tripura-23-yrs-after-exiting-mizoram-101618926098171.html

20-04-2021||India||Immediate implementation of order suspending oxygen to industries: Delhi HC||The Delhi high court on Tuesday directed immediate implementation of order to suspend oxygen to industries. Amid a spike in coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in several states, the Centre had asked all states on Sunday to prohibit the supply of oxygen for industrial purposes, except for those that fall in the exempted category from April 22. Oxygen is an important element used in the treatment of certain medical conditions which arise due to the Covid-19 infection.“Industries can wait. Patients cannot. Human lives are at stake,” a bench of Justices Vipin Sanghi and Rekha Palli said to the central government.The direction came during the hearing of a petition, related to Covid-19 tests, that the high court revived on April 19 amid rise in Covid-19 cases.In its decision taken on Sunday, the Centre said that the ban was crucial as there was an increase in demand for medical oxygen in several states like Maharashtra and Delhi among others, which have been consistently reporting an increase in Covid-19 cases.“Keeping in view the rapid rise in Covid cases and resultant rapid demand for medical oxygen, particularly in high-burden states of Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Delhi, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, etc, EG-II has reviewed the supply of oxygen for industrial use in order to divert the same to meet the rising demand for medical oxygen in the country and save precious lives,” Union home secretary Ajay Bhalla wrote in a letter to all chief secretaries on Sunday.The government had then also given a break-up of the shares that will be allotted to states which face the shortage of oxygen under which Maharashtra was allotted 1,646 metric tonnes of oxygen, followed by Uttar Pradesh which was given 752 metric tonnes and Delhi which was allotted 378 metric tonnes.Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal also voiced concern over a shortage in supply of oxygen in the national capital on Sunday."Del facing acute shortage of oxygen. In view of sharply increasing cases, Del needs much more than normal supply. Rather than increasing supply, our normal supply has been sharply reduced and Delhi’s quota has been diverted to other states. OXYGEN HAS BECOME AN EMERGENCY IN DEL," Kejriwal wrote in a tweet.Chief minister Kejriwal also wrote to Union commerce & industries minister Piyush Goyal, requesting him to ensure uninterrupted supply of 700MT of oxygen on daily basis & restoration of supply of 140MT of oxygen by INOX.Delhi on Sunday recorded its biggest jump in daily Covid-19 cases with 25,462 fresh infections logged. The national capital is under six-day lockdown which began on Monday, following a weekend curfew imposed on Friday night, aimed at checking the spread of the viral disease.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/delhi-hc-says-immediate-implementation-of-order-to-suspend-oxygen-to-industries-101618922820004.html

He also said that 10,000 more hospital beds would be added by April 30.“As of now, there is no need to impose a lockdown in the State as many restrictions like night curfew in 20 cities, closed all educational institutions, malls, theatres, gyms, recreation parks are in effect,” news agency ANI quoted Rupani as saying. “By April 30, we will add 10,000 more beds. We have also increased the number of oxygen beds which has led to higher consumption of medical oxygen,” he further added.The chief minister’s remarks came after the Indian Medical Association’s (IMA) Gujarat chapter, on Tuesday, suggested to the Gujarat high court that a two-week lockdown should be implemented to check the transmission of Covid-19 in the state, news agency PTI reported.Also read | With 11,403 new Covid-19 cases, Gujarat logs record one-day spike“The government should completely ban all kinds of gatherings, be it social, political or religious. If possible, the government should impose a total lockdown for 14 days. If it is not possible, then put severe restrictions on activities,” PTI quoted IMA’s Gujarat chapter president Dr Devendra Patel as saying to the high court bench.To avoid people rushing for hospital beds between hospitals, Dr Patel also suggested that the state government should create a centralised system which has details about availability of beds for Covid-19 patients, PTI reported.In another instance on Tuesday, the HC also questioned the Gujarat government about its submission on the number of beds occupied in the state for Covid-19. The government said that 55,783 beds were occupied out of the 79,944 in the state and the remaining were unoccupied, PTI reported.“Complaints are coming, maybe you are also receiving that patients are not being admitted because there is no vacancy in hospitals. Beds are not available. The figures shared by you suggest that even designated hospitals have vacant beds,” the bench said, PTI reported. “(If that is true) then why are people running around, finding sources and recommendations for getting hospitals beds and treatment,” the bench further asked.Gujarat on Monday detected 11,403 new infections of the coronavirus disease, its highest surge in a 24-hour time span and 117 patients succumbed to the disease in the state.

A 9 mm pistol, one country-made gun, three 3 kg IED [improvised explosive device], medicines and items of daily use were recovered from the gunbattle scene.”Handa was killed days after around a dozen Maoists allegedly abducted two people, including a 15-year-old boy, and murdered them with sharp-edged weapons after branding them as police informers in the neighbouring Sukma district.

It will peak in mid-May or by the end of May and then suddenly there will be a dip,” Dr Tickoo said."The way it has gone up, the same way it will go down," he added. But till then, said Dr Tickoo, people will have to be careful and follow all Covid-19 protocols.He also said that more and more younger people are getting infected with Covid-19 this time. "They are the ones who go for work, who take public transport, and have been part of celebrations and going on holidays. They are the ones who have a kind of attitude that nothing will happen to them," said the doctor.He also highlighted the fact that the infection is getting registered early. "Earlier, it used to be in 6-7 days, but in this wave, my personal observation is that the lungs are getting affected in 4-5 days," said Dr Tickoo.The Union health ministry said on Tuesday that 10 states, including Maharashtra, Uttar Pradesh and Delhi, account for 77.67 per cent of the new Covid-19 infections reported in a day.

20-04-2021||India||Vidurashwatha Massacre, the Forgotten Jallianwala Bagh of South India||The year was 1938 and India’s freedom struggle was at its peak. On the morning of April 25, a group of villages led by leaders of the Indian National Congress (INC) had gathered at an open ground in Vidurashwatha village, close to the now Karnataka-Andhra Pradesh border, in Chikkballapur district, to hoist the national flag. Defying prohibitory orders, just as they were proceeding to hoist the flag, police opened fire, killing 32 people and injuring more than 100 others. At least 90 rounds of ammunition was fired by the police that morning.Due to its resemblance to the massacre at Jallianwala Bagh in 1919, Vidurashwatha later came to be known as the Jallianwala Bagh of the South. Decades later, the village is now a forgotten chapter in the history of the country’s freedom struggle.Gangadhara Murthy, a retired professor and author of a book ‘The forgotten Jallianwala Bagh of South India’ said the firing led to the Mirza-Patel pact, an agreement between then Diwan of Mysore Mirza Ismail and Indian statesman Vallabhbhai Patel, which resulted in the formation of the first government with the participation of the people in Mysore state.“Mahatma Gandhi himself took note of the incident and deputed senior Congress leaders Sardar Patel and Acharya Kriplani to take stock of the situation. It is an important landmark in our history,” he said.What led to the firing was a decision by the authorities not to allow the hoisting of the national flag (swaraj India flag). In 1930, the INC, in an attempt to make a determined effort towards freedom, had decided to hoist the flag in Mysore state.The INC leaders initially tried to hoist the flag during a session of the Mysore Congress at Shivpurathat year. After the leaders were arrested for defying government orders, the party decided to hold Dhwaja Satyagraha (flag satyagraha) across the state.It was the call for this protest that led to a large gathering at Vidurashwatha. “Since they were unable to hoist the flag at Shivapura, the leaders decided to do the same in this village at all cost. They knew that the police would crackdown (against them), so between April 22 and 24, they did not hoist any flag or gather a large crowd. Their plan was to hoist the flag when the police put their guard down,” Murthy said.On April 25 at 10.30 am, several people, mostly from villages around Vidurashwatha, began gathering at the ground.“It was an open ground which had a river at one end and a temple on the other. The plan of the leaders was that if the police resorted to lathi charge, they would cross the river. Across the river was Nizam’s state of Hyderabad and the police didn’t have any jurisdiction (there). But this didn’t go as per plan,” Murthy explained.Eighty-five-year-old Narsimhaiah was one of the people Murthy interviewed that day who managed to escape unhurt. “As the crowd grew bigger, around afternoon, some minor face-offs between the police and protesters erupted. Before the crowd could react, according to Naraishaiah, police opened fire. He ran in the hope that the bullets would not find him,” Murthy said.At least 96 rounds were fired by the police that day, killing 32 people. “As per the accounts from that day, it was a police sub-inspector, who was then transferred from Bengaluru, who led the firing. A man was shot dead. Soon, other policemen, including the then superintendent of police, rained bullets on the protesters,” Murthy added.The forest in Vidurashwatha turned into a cemetery in the days that followed.Gandhi, who visited Wardha on learning about the firing, released a statement on April 29, part of which read: “the sacrifices of the 32 people who died in Vidurashwatha in an attempt to achieve independence through non-violence are not in vain.”While the cops involved in the firing got a clean chit, the government claimed only 10 people lost their lives. This led to widespread agitation across Mysore state, prompting Gandhi to send Patel and Kriplani to Mysore to take stock of the situation.“After visiting several villages around Vidurashwatha, they concluded that 32 people were killed in the firing,” he said.The anger against the government was used by the Congress leaders to bring changes in the way Mysore was administered. They demanded that their leaders should get participation in governance, which led to the famous Mirza-Patel pact.“As per the pact, all restrictions on hoisting the flags were lifted, seven members of the Congress were incorporated in the Reforms Committee to suggest new norms of governance and the leaders were allowed to attend the assembly meeting,” Murthy said.At the spot of the massacre now stands a memorial which gets occasional visitors.Even though 32 lives were lost that day, Vidurashwatha never got its due in history, Murthy, who maintains the memorial, said. “We want to keep telling the story as long as we can so that the Jallianwala Bagh of South India is not forgotten by the next generations,” he added.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/jallianwala-bagh-of-the-south-vidurashwatha-massacre-a-forgotten-chapter-in-the-history-of-country-s-freedom-movement-101618915177005.html

He ruled out a complete lockdown and said the situation will be reviewed in a week. He was speaking at Shillong on Monday.The CM said while it took 114 days for Covid-19 cases to touch the 665 cases mark during the first wave last year, during the second wave this year, close to 680 cases were reported in less than a month.“The rise of cases is six times higher this time compared to the last time. Therefore, the situation is serious and there are a lot of concerns.

Represented by solicitor general Tushar Mehta, the Uttar Pradesh government mentioned the matter before the Supreme Court bench headed by Chief Justice of India (CJI) Sharad Arvind Bobde, to which the top court agreed to hear the case.

A day later on Tuesday, the grim record was surpassed with 4,761 new infections, further justifying the new restrictions on operation of schools, interstate transport and public gatherings announced a day earlier, when a decision to augment the state’s patient-handling capacity was also taken, said officials“It is seen that the number of Covid-19 cases are showing an increasing trend in the state. Therefore, the state government has decided to impose weekend shutdown in all urban areas across the state from April 24,” said special relief commissioner Pradip Jena on Monday.Currently, a weekend shutdown is being enforced in urban areas of 10 districts including Sundargarh, bordering Chhattisgarh. Sundargarh district reported 673 positive cases on Tuesday, a few less than the 722 registered on Monday, when the test positivity rate (TPR) in the district touched 26.8. The number of cases in Khurda however shot up drastically to 820 on Tuesday from the 587 recorded on Monday.The surge in cases was being fuelled by a statewide TPR of 14.71 recorded on Tuesday, up from 12.28 on Monday, and also the reproductive number or R0 of 2.39. TPR is the ratio of tests performed to cases confirmed and the R0 or the reproductive number is an indication of the transmissibility of a virus, representing the average number of new infections generated by an infectious person. For R0 > 1, the number infected is likely to increase, and for R0 < 1, transmission is likely to die out.The health authorities say the situation is very unpredictable. “We initially thought the peak of the second wave in Odisha would come by April 25. But now, it seems no one can predict for sure. None of the health experts know when the peak will come. Today the cases surged to more than 4,500, tomorrow it can go beyond 5,500. We just don’t know how the double mutant strain (of the virus) is behaving,” said PK Mohapatra, additional chief secretary (health) of Odisha.The state government on Monday stopped interstate bus movements. Intrastate transport is allowed as long as the number of passengers doesn’t exceed the seating capacity and everyone wears masks, according to an official statement. For weddings, organisers have been told to submit a list of no more than 50 invitees to local administration 24 hours in advance. The list has to be displayed at the marriage venue as well, the statement said.In schools, 50% of teaching and non-teaching staff have been permitted to perform important functions such as admissions, distribution of books, monitoring of mid day meal programmes etc.On the positive side, there was no scarcity of Covid-19 beds in hospitals in the state. Director of public health Niranjan Mishra said only 17.43% of the total Covid-19 beds, including ICUs and ventilators, were occupied till now in both government and private healthcare facilities in the state.Of the 24,578 active cases, 2,059 patients were currently under treatment in various hospitals including 945 in government healthcare facilities. 424 patients were in ICUs and 59 were on ventilator support, according to the daily Covid-19 bulletin released by the state.Currently, 7,432 general Covid-19 beds are lying vacant in Odisha including 3,887 in private and 3,545 in government hospitals. Similarly, 1,594 ICU beds including 1,174 in private and 420 in government hospitals and 723 ventilators including 562 in private and 161 in government hospitals are currently unused.Mishra said the number of beds for Covid-19 patients is being increased up to five times compared to last year. In Bhubaneswar, more private hospitals are being added to the list of Covid-19 hospitals. Nilachal and hi-tech Covid-19 hospitals become operational on Monday and Blue Wheel will become operational from Tuesday. Sparsh and KIMS Covid-19 hospitals too will soon start operations, the officer said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/odisha-orders-weekend-shutdowns-in-urban-areas-amid-all-time-high-covid-surge-101618902277430.html

"We believe in constructive cooperation and we will continue to work for the safety of our people, no matter what you say," it added.On Sunday, Singh wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi in which he offered his advice on the Covid-19 situation in the country. He also listed out five suggestions and urged the Centre to expand the vaccination drive to people beyond the age of 45. It is to be noted that the Centre has opened the vaccination drive to all above 18 years of age on Sunday. This will come into effect from May 1.Singh also asked the Centre to place "enough" vaccine orders in advance and retain 10 per cent for distribution based on emergency needs. "Other than that, states should have a clear signal of likely availability so that they can plan their roll out," he wrote in the letter.The letter triggered a sharp response from the Union health minister as he lashed out at the Congress leader and told Singh to ask his party workers to follow the same advice in their own respective states. "History will be kinder to you Dr Manmohan Singh ji if your offer of ‘constructive cooperation and valuable advice was followed by his party leaders as well. "It is saddening, Dr Singh, that while you very well understand the importance of vaccination as an important method of fighting the COVID-19 battle, people in responsible positions in your party as well as in the state governments formed by your party do not seem to share your view," Harsh Vardhan said.India has been reporting a frightening spike in Covid-19 cases over the past few weeks. For the last five consecutive days, the daily number of cases has surged to above 200,000 and it is still continuing on the upward trajectory. As of Tuesday morning, the country has 15,321,089 cases of the coronavirus disease as it added 259,170 fresh infections in the last 24-hours.

Responding to the order, UP additional chief secretary (information), Navneet Sehgal said strict curbs are necessary to control the spread of the virus and that the government has taken several steps in that direction. He, however, said that protecting livelihoods is equally important to save lives, adding that a complete lockdown in these cities was not necessary for now since people are "automatically closing many places".The total number of coronavirus disease (Covid-19) cases in Uttar Pradesh currently stands at 879,831, as per the official tally provided by the state government at 10:45pm on Monday. Of these, 208,523 are active cases while the statewide death toll has almost touched 10,000.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/up-govt-moves-sc-against-allahabad-hc-order-imposing-covid-19-curbs-in-5-cities-101618899165292.html

Modi said the Centre has been working hard from over a year to ensure that maximum numbers of people are able to get the vaccine in the shortest possible of time.“India is vaccinating people at world record pace and we will continue this with even greater momentum,” Prime Minister Narendra Modi said during the meeting where the decision to vaccinate all adults in the country was taken.ALSO READ: What changes from May 1 in Covid-19 vaccination drive? FAQs answeredLast week, Poonawalla had urged the United States to lift export ban from critical raw materials required for the production of vaccines against the coronavirus disease.The long list of raw materials that SII imports from the US include filters, bags, and adjuvant. Large, sterile plastic bags are used to grow vaccine cells. An adjuvant is a substance that is used to increase the efficacy of a vaccine and helps the immune system generate antibodies.The United States in February invoked the Defense Production Act, which gives the power to control the distribution of products, to curb the export of raw materials critical for vaccine production.India recently approved Russian made Sputnik V and is also planning to approve vaccines made by Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson.ALSO READ: India to waive import duty on Covid-19 vaccinesIndia set the milestone of vaccinating more than 126 million people in a period of 92 days.

Besides seeking a ban on the movie -- “Nyay: The Justice”, "Suicide or Murder: A star was lost" and “Shashank”, his father Krishna Kishore Singh has also sought an injunction against any other film, publication, caricature, etc based on the actor's life.Justice Manoj Kumar Ohri issued the notice on a suit by Singh contending that any publication, production, or depiction of the private life of the late actor is a blatant and willful breach of the fundamental right to privacy and it cannot be undertaken without the prior approval of his legal heir.Senior advocate Vikas Singh, appearing for Rajput’s father, told the court that the movie in question has been launched in a planned and orchestrated manner by close confidants of the alleged accused in case of abetment of suicide to influence a pending investigation, witness and other officials.The plea added that releasing any movie depicting Rajput's personal life will influence the witness in the cases and also change the public perception. Rajput’s father has said that many people took the death of his son as an "opportunity to get fame by developing different theories/stories", at the cost of his and his family’s reputation.After learning about movies based on the late actor, like “Nyay: The Justice”, "Suicide or Murder: A star was lost" and “Shashank”, the actor’s father said that he apprehends that various plays, movies, web series, books, interviews or other material may be published which would harm the reputation of Sushant Singh Rajput and his family."Thus, the publication of movie depicting his personal life, name/images/caricature and misappropriating his personality in a distorted manner, without the consent of the plaintiff, would influence the witness of the case and also would change public perception and the case is at a very nascent stage even the investigation has not been completed," the plea stated.Advocate Akshay Dev, another counsel for Rajput's father said, that they are seeking an injunction against any filmmaker or against the publication of any book from putting out anything since that is likely to influence the ongoing investigation.The matter would be now heard on May 24.Singh was found dead in his apartment in Mumbai’s Bandra in June last year following which the Mumbai Police conducted a probe and said that he died by suicide. The case was later handed over to the Central Investigation Bureau (CBI) and the Enforcement Directorate and Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) were also roped in to investigate the money laundering and drugs angle in the case.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/sushant-singh-rajput-movie-delhi-hc-issues-notice-to-makers-on-plea-by-actor-s-father-seeking-ban-101618899801011.html

20-04-2021||India||Can’t give bail just because he is rich, says SC on plea of Arsalan scion||The Supreme Court on Monday dismissed a petition by Biryani restaurant chain Arsalan owner, Akhtar Parwez, seeking the release of his son on bail in a 2019 hit-and-run case, saying the accused cannot expect a concession only because he is rich.A bench of justices Sanjay Kishan Kaul and Hemant Gupta rejected the bail plea after underlining that the accused, Raghib, was driving his Jaguar SUV at a speed of 130-135 km/hour on August 16, 2019, when he smashed into a Mercedes-Benz and led to the death of two Bangladeshis standing nearby.“Is it not true that you were driving at a speed of more than 130 km/hour? Is it not true that you had a history of violating traffic signals 48 times during the seven months prior to this incident? You want a concession only because you are rich. But we will not do that,” the bench told senior advocate Kapil Sibal, who appeared for Arsalan’s owner.Parwez has been representing his son during the trial, claiming Raghib suffers from a psychological disorder and that he is not capable of facing the trial because of his mental illness.The Calcutta high court on April 13 ordered Raghib to stand trial after a board of National Institute of Health and Neurosciences, Bengaluru, said that his psychological conditions were not such that he could not face it.Relying on this report, the high court cancelled Raghib’s interim bail and directed him to surrender by April 20, failing which he will be arrested. The high court noted that Raghib “after committing the ghastly incident... fled to a foreign country (Dubai).”Before the top court, Sibal cited Raghib’s mental conditions and added he could not understand the trial procedures and that should be allowed to remain on bail. The senior counsel added that Raghib was incarcerated for eight months after his arrest in 2019 and that no purpose would be served to send him back to jail after the charge sheet has been filed.But the bench remained unmoved: “Do you mean to say we should release everyone where a charge sheet has been filed? This is always a case-by-case basis. It also depends on the seriousness of the crime. It cannot be that in every case where a charge sheet has been filed, we should give bail to everyone. Is it not correct that you tried to escape and made someone else a scapegoat?”The court pointed out that claims regarding insanity and mental illness have not been established so far and that an expert committee in fact gave a contradictory opinion. “You take this defence at the trial. We cannot pass any comment on this,” it told Sibal.Initially, Arsalan Parvez, Raghib’s younger brother, confessed to having been at the wheel at the time of the accident.The family claimed Raghib was in Australia for higher studies. But after analysing the data recorder of the Jaguar, police got the phone number of the person who was last at the wheel. From the phone number’s WhatsApp account, police found Raghib’s photograph. A subsequent scan of CCTV cameras also showed Raghib taking out the Jaguar from his home.Raghib, who had fled to Dubai after the incident, returned to Kolkata two days later and was arrested from a nursing home where he had got admitted after his return.In April last year, Raghib was given interim bail by the high court after a medical report said he required psychological help.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/no-concession-because-he-is-rich-says-sc-while-rejecting-bail-plea-101618892377031.html

The Centre on Monday opened up the vaccination for everyone above 18 from May 1.A state unit chief said Nadda has set a target of “mera booth, corona mukt [my booth, corona free]” for them and identified a three-pronged approach. “First, to ensure compliance with Covid protocol by distributing masks and sanitisers and ensuring there is no vaccine hesitancy.”The state units have been asked to carry out special programmes in the rural areas to encourage vaccination. “We have noticed vaccine hesitancy in rural areas particularly. For instance, if we have a capacity for 50 lakh [five million] doses, only 30-35 lakh [three to 3.5 million] people show up. [The] places where we carried out special drives, the numbers went up. So, this will be scaled up,” said the person quoted above.Also Read | BJP, TMC scale down campaigns amid spikeTwo other functionaries, who attended his virtual meeting with state functionaries on Sunday, said Nadda underlined the need to set up helplines in every district to facilitate hospital admissions and help those under home quarantine with the supply of essentials.“...[Nadda] said the cadre must resume relief work to help people in need. When the lockdown was first announced last year, the cadre had taken on the responsibility of providing food and medicines to people in need. Now as the cases of Covid 19 are steadily going up, he said there is a need to help people connect with doctors and get access to healthcare,” said the state unit chief quoted above.The functionaries were specifically asked not to hoard or procure medicines, but to help people with information on their availability and in case of need to ferry them to hospitals.“He explained that it is the government’s job to procure medicines such as Remdesivir that is in high demand. He said party functionaries should not try to procure the drug as it could be construed as hoarding. They can, however, help people with information,” said a second functionary.The Maharashtra government last week accused the BJP of trying to procure Remdesivir without informing it. The BJP maintained it was procuring the drug for the state government for further supply.In March last year, Nadda tasked the party cadre to feed over 50 million people during the Covid-19 lockdown.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/dont-hoard-medicines-resume-help-nadda-to-bjp-workers-101618888956066.html

20-04-2021||India||Deep Sidhu sent to jail for 14 days in R-Day case||A Delhi court on Monday dismissed a plea by the city police seeking four days custody for Punjabi actor Deep Sidhu in connection with a case registered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in the damage caused to the Red Fort during a tractor rally by farmers on the Republic Day, and instead sent him to jail for 14 days.Chief Metropolitan Magistrate Gajendra Singh Nagar turned down the police remand for Sidhu’s custodial interrogation, saying there was no sufficient ground to allow the custody.In the current case, Sidhu was arrested on Saturday, hours after he was granted bail in connection with another case related to the violence on Republic Day. A tractor rally taken out by farmers protesting against the three contentious farm bills descended into chaos after the protestes broke police barricades and clashed with the cops at several places including Red Fort.Also read: CBI to probe ₹207 crore alleged ‘scam’ in DUSIBThe Delhi Police arrested Sidhu on February 9 for his alleged involvement in the January 26 events. The agency told the court that Sidhu was the “main instigator” and one of the rioters, a charge that he has denied. He was granted bail in this case on Friday.On Monday, public prosecutor Rajiv Kamboj told the court that they were seeking four days police custody for Sidhu, saying investigation was pending.Sidhu’s counsel Abhishek Gupta and Jasdeep Dhillon said that both the FIRs were registered on similar allegations, and since Sidhu had already been interrogated by the police in the matter, there was no need for fresh police remand now.Sidhu also addressed the judge and said that he has been cooperating with the investigation and will continue doing that.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/deep-sidhu-sent-to-jail-for-14-days-in-r-day-case-101618878998700.html

20-04-2021||India||Covid-19: What you need to know today||No one should be writing letters (or, for that matter, columns, other than people whose job it is to) in the midst of the pandemic.There’s work to be done, and because such is the nature of governance — the others can volunteer, and do good, if they want to, but are unlikely to have as much impact as the State — much of it will have to be done by those in power, in the Centre and the states.I’m sure some of these are already being done, but since epistolary duties can be distracting, here is a quick list of what needs doing — right now. This is important not just to help India tide over this wave of the coronavirus disease pandemic, but to also prepare it for the next. That a lot of what follows wasn’t done (or wasn’t done at scale) is evident from the crisis on our hands. Daily cases are nearing 300,000. Only one country, the US, has seen more, and that too on only one day. We look set to beat the record. Deaths are already at record highs (with the exception of one day last June when both Delhi and Maharashtra deemed it fit to get their death numbers in order). Hindustan Times has reported from Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh (bit.ly/3eujgCf; bit.ly/2REevOs) that there is a clear disconnect between the fatalities claimed by the state (and therefore, those on the HT dashboard) and the numbers being reported by local crematoriums and graveyards. Everything is in short supply — oxygen, ICU beds, and ambulances. I’m not mentioning Remdesivir, because despite India’s obsession with it, there is really no evidence proving its effectiveness or that of plasma (the research in this case is quite clear: it doesn’t work for Covid-19).Provoked by a piece in Scroll.in that pointed out that a plan to install 162 oxygen plants in district hospitals in India — something that would have definitely helped at a time like this — wasn’t going to script (https://scroll.in/article/992537/india-is-running-out-of-oxygen-covid-19-patients-are-dying-because-the-government-wasted-time), the health ministry pointed out that 33 are ready, and that another 47 will be ready by the end of May (with 26 of these being completed by the end of April). That’s just around half the planned number. The story refers to an announcement made last week by the government about a plan to set up another 100 oxygen plants. Even as everyone comes together to address the current oxygen shortage, it is important to keep an eye on this. India needs those oxygen plants.The other thing it desperately needs to do is sequence more viral genomes. Among the burning topics of discussion in the international scientific community right now is the nature of behaviour of the strain of the virus with the double mutation (B.1.617) that was first identified in India. Another topic of discussion is either the rampant gaming of RT-PCR tests by passengers flying out of India or the poor quality of Indian RT-PCR tests. Hong Kong, on Monday, banned flights from India till May 3 after a large number of passengers on a flight from Mumbai tested positive. If India doesn’t address both issues immediately, it may face similar bans from other countries. Canada, for instance, is reporting similar problems with passengers from India.Also read: Capital back in lockdownAnd finally, with cases surging, India has to take a hard call on vaccines. At least 90% of those eligible for their second shots of the vaccine between now and May 31 have been administered Covishield. There’s enough scientific evidence to show that: one, even one dose gives people a much better chance at fighting off severe infections; and two, a three-month gap between the first and second dose of Covishield does not reduce the vaccine’s efficacy. According to HT’s calculations, this number is 71.3 million. In addition, assuming an aggressive target of 4 million vaccinations a day (the government, till a few weeks ago, was speaking about 5 million, but that looks unlikely), 100.7 million people will get their first doses in this period (April 20-May 31). That will take the total number of people who have received at least once dose of vaccine in India to 278.4 million by the end of May.The government’s move to open up supply of vaccines, and expand the eligibility criteria to everyone over the age of 18 years (long delayed, but it came finally on Monday) from May 1 will help meet this target, perhaps even exceed it. At that number, the results, in terms of a fall in infections (or, at the least, hospitalisations), will start making themselves evident.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/covid19-what-you-need-to-know-today-101618872038311.html
20-04-2021||India||Can’t continue to obstruct others, SC tells farm leaders||The Supreme Court on Monday called upon the farm leaders to reflect on whether their protests over three contentious agricultural laws should continue to obstruct others’ right to commute freely on public roads.A bench, headed by justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, took a grim view of the continuing road blockades by thousands of farmers who have camped at Delhi’s borders with Haryana and Uttar Pradesh since November last year in protest against the central laws, adding to commuters’ travel times in the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR).“Just because you are not in sync with a particular policy that doesn’t mean that the others should suffer and you obstruct their way. You want to create a village; do it by all means, but don’t obstruct others,” said the bench, which included justice Hemant Gupta.The top court was hearing a petition by a single mother, complaining that it has been taking her almost two hours, instead of 20 minutes, to travel from Noida to Delhi due to frequent blockades and protests. The court on March 26 issued notices to the Centre and Delhi Police “to ensure that the road area is kept clear so that the passage from one place to the other is not affected”.On Monday, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, appearing for the Union government and Delhi Police, said that although the priority has been shifted due to the sudden surge in Covid cases, the authorities were trying their best to remove blockades and make the commute in Delhi-NCR smooth.As Mehta sought adjournment of the hearing by two weeks owing to the focus on Covid management, justice Kaul retorted: “We will give you time. But we should also tell you what our concern is. People may have a right (to protest) but what concerns us is the tendency to block roads which impacts a large section of the society.”The bench added that it was also not sure if crowding was a good idea at a time like these when corona infections have seen a sudden spurt. To this, the S-G replied that he was also of the view that protesters should not crowd.“In other places we may not have this extent of the problem,” said justice Kaul, as the bench adjourned the hearing of the matter to May 7.Addressing a monthly mahapanchayat at the Delhi-Ghazipur border on Saturday, Bharatiya Kisan Union national president Naresh Tikait declared that farmers will not end the protest until the farm laws are not repealed.The central government claims that the laws are part of the long-pending reforms in the agriculture sector. The farmers’ groups led by BKU, however, complain that it will put them at the mercy of corporates, resulting into an impasse over the two sides since November last.On April 9, too, the bench emphasised that protesters cannot block roads and continually inconvenience the public while regretting that despite several judicial pronouncements on keeping public roads free, the situation did not seem to improve.“This is a single mother before us who has to face many problems because of blocked roads,” the court had then said, asking the S-G to resolve the issue “politically or administratively or judicially”.Petitioner Monicca Agarwaal, who works in an information technology firm, has stated in her petition that she needs to commute between Delhi and Noida for work, but said the travel has become a “nightmare” for her.She rued that various directions passed by the top court in several cases, including the Shaheen Bagh protest matter, to keep public roads clear, have not been followed. Her plea added that the petitioner being a single mother with medical issues was facing harrowing time on account of failure of the authorities in complying with the Supreme Court’s orders.Even though there was no specific response to the SC observation by the Samyukta Kisan Morcha, the farmer unions collective announced a “resistance week” beginning Tuesday and invited more farmers to reach the protest site with the slogan “phir Dilli chalo”.” Because it is the harvesting season, many farmers had returned to villages. There are indications that the government is plotting to end the peasant movement on the pretext of the Covid pandemic. There have been several reports in the media that as soon as the state assembly elections are over, the Haryana government and the Centre have planned to attack the protest sites and evacuate them,” SKM said in a statement .||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/cant-continue-to-obstruct-others-sc-tells-farm-leaders-101618870563787.html

Doctors also shared their personal experiences,” said one of the doctors who attended the meeting.Modi also discussed the progress in Covid-19 vaccinations with the doctors.“Last year, during the same time, it was due to our doctors’ hard work and the nation’s strategy that we were able to control the coronavirus wave. Now that the country is facing the second wave of coronavirus, all the doctors, our frontline workers are confronting the pandemic with full force, and are saving the lives of millions of people,” an official statement quoted the Prime Minister as saying.He said that vaccination was the biggest weapon in the fight against Covid-19, and urged the doctors to encourage more and more patients to get vaccinated, and help allay unfounded fears related to vaccines. “…it is very important that people do not become a victim of panic. For this, along with proper treatment, emphasis must also be on counselling of patients admitted in hospitals...,” Modi said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/pm-meets-pharma-firms-and-doctors-101618867461429.html

20-04-2021||India||Ensure supply of oxygen, Remdesivir: Madhya Pradesh HC||The Madhya Pradesh high court on Monday asked the state government to ensure continuous and regular supply of life-saving drugs, including medical oxygen and Remdesivir used in the treatment of Covid-19 patients.Hearing five petitions alleging failure of the state government in dealing with the surge in Covid-19 cases, a bench comprising Chief Justice Mohammad Rafiq and justice Atul Sreedharan directed the government to deal with the existing crises.“The state government may regulate the supply of Remdesivir injections and other lifesaving drugs, but the process adopted for this purpose should be hassle-free and should not be cumbersome so as to ensure the supply of the drug in such a way that the time limit from requisition by the treating doctors and supply of medicines does not exceed an hour,” said the order.“The state government should consider increasing the per day testing number of Covid infected persons for their early detection so as to prevent further spread of the coronavirus. Test reports should be provided to concerned patients positively within 36 hours from the time of collection of the sample,” said the order.It further urged the central government to “consider stepping in to ensure an increase in the production of Remdesivir and till such time it is not done, it should consider procuring Remdesivir by importing it...”||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ensure-supply-of-oxygen-remdesivir-madhya-pradesh-hc-101618863341951.html
20-04-2021||India||Compensation pending, SC adjourns Italy marines case||The Supreme Court on Monday adjourned to next week a plea by the central government to close all proceedings in India against the Italian marines who killed two fishermen off the coast of Kerala in 2012.A bench headed by Chief Justice of India SA Bobde took note of a submission by the government’s lawyer Rajat Nair that they were yet to receive the compensation amount from the Italian government. “We will deposit the money in this court within 24 hours of receiving it from the Italian counterpart. Although the process of transferring the money has been initiated, we are yet to receive it,” Nair told the bench, which also included justices AS Bopanna and V Ramasubramanian.At this, the bench recalled that it was always of the opinion that the case should be listed on a later date but it was the government which was in a hurry to have a hearing as soon as possible. On April 9, the court had asked Italy to deposit ₹10 crore with the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) as agreed upon by the Italian government for disbursal to the families of the slain fishermen and the injured boat owner. While the bench contemplated deferring the matter for 15 days to complete these formalities, solicitor general Tushar Mehta, who represented the Centre, asked for an “earliest possible date” since the MEA would deposit the money in the court registry within three days of receiving it.Amused by the zeal of the government for the closure of proceedings against the two marines before the top court and a criminal trial pending before a special court in Delhi, the Supreme Court then remarked that it expected the government to act with the same speed in other cases too.“We will like it if you act with the same speed in other matters too. Here, (in this case) you are asking for three days. Normally, you ask at least for two weeks or four weeks’ time,” CJI Bobde had commented.The court was dealing with an application by the Centre filed in July 2020 wherein it said that all proceedings in India against the two marines, Massimiliano Latorre and Salvatore Girone, should be closed since the Union government has accepted the May 2020 decision of the international arbitral tribunal. The tribunal ruled that the marines enjoyed immunity and hence only Italy could try them whereas India was entitled to compensation.Subsequently, during a hearing in August 2020, the bench had clarified that it would close the proceedings only after the families of the victims were heard and given “adequate” compensation, after it noted that the victims’ families were not parties to the case before the Supreme Court.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/compensation-pending-sc-adjourns-italy-marines-case-101618863040518.html
20-04-2021||India||Night curfew, tightened curbs as Covid-19 rages across country||Several states across India clamped stricter curbs on assembly and movement of people, shut popular establishments and imposed night curfews on Monday in an attempt to arrest an alarming spike in Covid-19 infections that has gripped India.Punjab extended its night curfew duration by an hour and shut gyms, pubs and spas, Rajasthan closed down all offices and markets until May 3, Kerala imposed a curfew between 9pm and 6am every day and Odisha ordered a weekend lockdown in all urban areas from April 24 till further notice. The national capital announced a weeklong lockdown until April 26. As of Monday night, there were a total of 2,030,725 active cases across the country, the highest active caseload ever recorded in India since the start of the outbreak in March last year, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.A Punjab government order said that fresh restrictions will come into effect from Tuesday, adding that curfew timings will now be from 8pm to 5am, instead of the earlier 9pm to 5am. The new restrictions, which also include closure of all malls, shops and markets on Sundays, coupled with the ones imposed earlier, will remain in effect till April 30, Punjab chief minister Amarinder Singh said.“I understand that the restrictions we are imposing from tomorrow because of spike in #Covid19 may inconvenience people. However, these steps are necessary to prevent the spread of #Covid19 & to save lives. Request you to abide by them & to take care of yourself,” the chief minister tweeted.On Monday, there were 4,622 new cases in the state and 83 fatalities. At present, there are 304,660 Covid cases in Punjab.In Rajasthan, the government ordered the closure of all offices and markets till May 3. According to an official release issued by home secretary Abhay Kumar, only shops and offices providing essential services will remain open during the 15-day period which the government has called Jan Anushasan Pakhwada (public discipline fortnight). Those entering Rajasthan will have to show a negative RT-PCR report issued 72 hours prior to the travel. On Monday, there were 11,715 new cases in the state, taking the overall tally to 426,584. “We are in a dangerous situation and everyone must follow the guidelines and adopt Covid-appropriate behaviour,” said chief minister Ashok Gehlot. Kerala imposed curfew between 9pm and 6am from Tuesday. The decision was taken at a high-level meeting chaired by chief secretary V P Joy. Kerala logged 13,644 cases on Monday, pushing the tally to 1,253,068The state government has also directed all domestic travellers coming to the state to undergo RT-PCR tests. Odisha announced a weekend lockdown in all urban areas from April 24 as the state reported a record single-day surge of 4,445 new infections.“It is seen that the number of Covid cases are showing increasing trend in the state. Therefore, the state government has decided to impose weekend shutdown in all urban areas across the state from April 24,” said special relief commissioner Pradip Jena. “We initially thought the peak of the second wave in Odisha would come by April 25. But now it seems no one can predict for sure. None of the health experts know when will the peak come. Today the cases surged to more than 4,500. Tomorrow it can go beyond 5,500. We just don’t how the double mutant strain is behaving,” said PK Mohapatra, additional chief secretary (health) of Odisha. The state on Monday stopped interstate bus movement and limited the number of guests at weddings to 50.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/night-curfew-tightened-curbs-as-covid-19-rages-across-country-101618861413253.html
20-04-2021||India||Vaccines for all from May||All adults will become eligible for a coronavirus vaccine and doses can be sold via the market from May 1, the Union government said on Monday, heeding to a growing clamour for wider access as the country grapples with a devastating surge of Covid-19 infections.The decision, taken during a meeting chaired by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, makes India one of the first countries to allow all adults to seek a vaccine, although people under the age of 45 will only be able to receive doses once private sales begin or if state governments procure stocks for distribution to these age groups.“The government has been working hard from over a year to ensure that maximum numbers of Indians are able to get the vaccine in the shortest possible of time,” a statement by the Press Information Bureau quoted Modi as saying.According to officials aware of developments, Modi made the decision to open up vaccinations after meeting officials overseeing the process. The PM also called a number of chief ministers to discuss the matter in wake of the Covid-19 surge.The statement added that under the third phase of the vaccination strategy, the government will make pricing, procurement, eligibility, and administration open and flexible.According to the details in the statement, vaccine makers will be able to sell half of what they produce at a price of their choosing to the open market and to state governments. The remainder will need to be supplied to Centre for the state-sponsored component of the vaccination programme, which remains limited to the 45-and-over age group only.If the vaccines have been imported as ready-to-use, the government will allow all of the stocks to be sold on the open market or to the states. The pricing for any doses sold in the open market will need to be “transparent”, although the government’s release did not indicate a cap.“India has been following a dynamic mapping model based on availability of vaccines & coverage of vulnerable priority groups to take decisions of when to open up vaccinations to other age-groups. A good amount of coverage of vulnerable groups is expected by 30th April,” the statement said.While the two Indian companies supplying doses at present — Serum Institute of India (SII) and Bharat Biotech — didn’t respond to requests for a comment, their supply capacities suggest a little over 45 million doses per month may be available for private sales (or to state governments) beginning May.SII at present produces 70 million doses a month and its CEO Adar Poonawalla recently said the company is looking to expand capacity to 100 million by May-end. Bharat Biotech is estimated to have produced 10 million doses in April and, after a department of biotechnology collaboration announced last week, the company expects to up monthly production to 60-70 million by July-August.The PM is scheduled to meet some of the makers on Tuesday. This follows his discussions with doctors and pharmaceutical companies on Monday, in which he discussed the outbreak situation and the availability of medicines and medical oxygen, the people quoted above said.Also read: Two held for Remdesivir black marketing after sting operation by news channelThe PIB statement said the state-sponsored campaign that is underway, and in which doses have been paid for by Centre, will continue to cover those above the age of 45, and health care and front line workers.“Second dose of all existing priority groups i.e. HCWs (health care workers), FLWs (frontline workers) and population above 45 years, wherever it has become due, would be given priority, for which a specific and focused strategy would be communicated to all stakeholders,” the government said.Allocation of doses to states and Union territories will be on the basis of their active case load and their performance in vaccinating people, while wastage will be taken into affect as criteria that can affect a state negatively when doses are being distributed by Centre.“This policy would come into effect from 1st May 2021 and will be reviewed from time to time,” the statement added.Experts said the move raises questions over how much supplies may immediately be available for such an opening up and the government will have to make sure there is no access disparity. “If the vaccine supply chain can be maintained, and everyone who wants it gets it, it is a welcome steep. While for above 45, the government is taking care of the vaccinations, below 45 years is meant essentially through the private sector. The states will have to step up to ensure poor people below the age of 45 are not left without the vaccine. Access disparity should be avoided,” said Dr K Srinath Reddy, founder, Public Health Foundation of India. “From vaccination to protection is several weeks, so [vaccination for all is] not an immediate solution, but if we can immunise everyone, it will make a difference,” said Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of country’s top vaccinologists.Monday’s announcement comes less than a week after India on April 13 said it will fast-track emergency approvals for vaccines authorised by Western countries and Japan, paving the way for possible imports of Pfizer, Johnson & Johnson, and Moderna shots. None of the companies have announced plans to enter the Indian market under the fast-track routes as yet, although J&J and Novavax already have licensed Indian companies (J&J has authorised Biological E and Novavax has authorised Serum Institute of India) to produce millions of doses. India, the world’s biggest maker of vaccines, has so far administered a little over 124 million doses of Covishield and Covaxin – the first two shots to be approved in the country. A third, Sputnik V made by Russia’s Gamaleya Institute, was approved formally on April 13 and its initial doses are expected to be imported.The PIB statement added that all vaccinations will still need to be managed under the National Vaccination Programme, and companies will have to follow workflows on the Co-WIN platform, which includes the registration and certification process and captures Adverse Events Following Immunisation (AEFI).||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/vaccines-for-all-from-may-101618859241615.html
20-04-2021||India||Thrissur Pooram to be held but no spectators allowed||Thiruvanthapuram Amid a relentless surge in Covid cases, the Kerala government and temple authorities on Monday agreed to celebrate Thrissur Pooram, the largest festival of the state at Vadakkunnathan temple in Thrissur, on April 23 with tight restrictions without any spectators, along the lines of the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL). The district medical officer and intelligentsia had appealed to call off the annual festival even as the government said it was under pressure from temple authorities to hold the same. Chief secretary V P Joy on Monday held a series of talks with officials of two temples -- Thiruvambady and Paramekavu -- and decided to livestream the function and rituals while making it mandatory for artists and mahouts to produce Covid-19 negative certificates 24 hours before the event. Devotees and onlookers will not be allowed to enter the temple premises during the festival. “We agreed to most of the restrictions in the prevailing scenario. But this chorus was not visible during major rallies at the same venue during the elections,” G Rajesh, one of the organisers of the festival, said. However, DMO K J Reena claimed that the Covid situation wasn’t this bad when permission was granted for campaigns for the assembly polls which was held in a single phase on April 6. “We need festivals but at the same time we cannot play with lives,” she said. The developments come a day after state health minister K K Shailaja said that planning and preparations for “pooram” had begun much earlier and that it was difficult to call it off now. Temple authorities also had a second thought after the government imposed night curfew for a week from Tuesday.“Good that the rituals are being held as per tradition. Some of the temple boards suffered badly due to abrupt restrictions. Hope the government will help them,” Congress MP from Thrissur, T N Prathapan, said. While the main festival is on April 23, thousands attended the flag hoisting ceremonies at Vadakkunnathan temple on Saturday. Regarded as the mother of all festivals, Thrissur Pooram was cancelled for the first time last year when the pandemic broke out. The largest cultural pageant of the state, Pooram was started in the late 18th century by erstwhile King of Kochi Sakthan Thamburan. More than two million devotees take part in the 10-day celebration which culminates with a musical ensemble, a parade of caparisoned elephants and grand fireworks. Meanwhile, the government on Monday announced a night curfew from Tuesday from 9 pm to 5 am and advised people to leave their homes only when necessary. The decision was taken after a high-level meeting chaired by the chief secretary. Besides this, the government also decided to strict enforcement of restrictions and made it mandatory for all domestic travellers entering the state to undergo RT-PCR tests. On Monday, the state reported 13,644 cases with a test positivity rate of 15.63%. The active caseload has crossed one lakh (103,004), according to data released by the state health ministry. Kozhikode district topped the chart with 2,022 cases followed by Ernakulam which has registered 1,781 cases. With 21 fatalities in 24 hours, the death toll in the state climbed to 4,950.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/thrissur-pooram-to-be-held-but-no-spectators-allowed-101618859372556.html
20-04-2021||India||19 Odisha women rescued from TN garment factory||Chennai: The Tirupur district administration rescued and sent 19 women, who were working at a garment unit at Velampalayam on low wages, to their hometown in Odisha, said officials familiar with the development. The move came after their families in Odisha alerted local officials, who in turn contacted Tirupur police on Saturday. The women, who were shifted to a temporary shelter at a wedding home on Sunday, boarded the train on Monday at 1.15pm to their hometown in Rayagada district. The women arrived at the garment unit in December 2020 for a three-month training programme and were offered employment. Police, however, rejected the reports that the women were forced to stay and work against their will. “Initially, the women had agreed to work but after the second wave of Covid-19 infection started, one of them contacted her family and said she wanted to return…,” Velampalayam police inspector P N Rajan said, adding, “When we went to enquire yesterday, all of them wanted to return home, so we arranged for the same.” Meanwhile, activists pointed out that there were several such cases where women are brought from Jharkhand, Odisha, Uttar Pradesh and Bihar to work in garment factories, where labour laws are violated, and the women want to go back. “They are put through excessive working hours and double shifts, but their wage is 30-40% lower than that of Tamil workers,” said Viyakula Mary, executive director of Tirupur-based SAVE (Social Awareness and Voluntary Education), which works for promotion of fair labour standards. “Their movement is restricted. Basically, they’re under control of their owners,” she added. Mary said that they visited the wedding hall but were not allowed to meet or speak to the rescued women. “We were told that low wages were the problem,” she added. In December, the organisation had rescued and sent back 38 women, who had also complained of low wages, to Jharkhand. Those women had also contacted local activists back home who got in touch with the police. “Since the outbreak of the pandemic, a lot of migrant workers are directly making distress calls to helplines and local police are altered, which is a huge development in awareness amongst them,” said Mary. The general procedure, Mary said, was for the labour department to take action. Police said the labour department would inquire into the incident under provisions of the labour law. Mary said these women, who are mostly in their 20s, accept the jobs due to lack of work back home. Former Tirupur police commissioner Sanjay Kumar, who headed several operations of sending migrant workers back during the first wave of the pandemic, said he began creating a database of migrant workers and their dependents in 2019. “We have no idea about the whereabouts of migrant workers in the state,” Kumar said. “Even if we want to help them, send them back we have no identification and authentication. The government portal would have a figure, but the actual number is much more. The Tirupur, Erode, Coimbatore industrial belt is fed by migrants and a large number of them are from north east states. We need to start registering them.” SAVE has also petitioned the government to open up self-registration for migrant workers. “Now, the system is for the factory owners to register their migrant workers, but they either don’t do it or do it for only a handful of workers,” said Mary. “If a migrant worker can register themselves with the Tamil Nadu labour department, they will have a receipt for themselves and we will also be aware of the interstate workers. Now, who even knew that these 19 women were working in Tamil Nadu?” Mary said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/19-odisha-women-rescued-from-tn-garment-factory-101618859312527.html
20-04-2021||India||Prioritise vaccination for the disabled, high court tells TN||Chennai: The Madras high court on Monday directed the Tamil Nadu government to prioritise Covid-19 vaccination and open special counters in all government centres for the disabled, irrespective of whether they attained the age of 45 years. The first bench of chief justice Sanjib Banerjee and justice Senthilkumar Ramamorrthy passed the order based on a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by disability rights activist and co-founder of Chennai-based Equals Centre for Promotion of Social Justice, Meenakshi Balasubramanian. The court also asked the state government to draft guidelines and decide the minimum age limit within three days and if necessary, hold consultations with the central government and vaccine manufacturers to avoid adverse effects. There should be a separate counter, priority queuing and vaccination centres should be accessible such as constructing ramps as prescribed in the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act 2016, the court noted. “At any rate, persons with disabilities should be given priority in being vaccinated even if the numbers do not warrant an exclusive counter being set up at every government vaccination centre,” the court added. In her petition, Balasubramanian said that people with disabilities may not be able to maintain physical distance and wear masks amid the Covid-19 pandemic. She pointed out that those with development and intellectual disabilities such as cerebral palsy and autism aren’t used to masks and drooling often made it unusable. Caregivers also have to be in close contact with them, she said. The court also took note of documents submitted by the Centre which showed that that certain categories of persons with disabilities who require high support, intellectual disabilities, muscular dystrophy, acid attack victims whose respiratory system has been affected, among others, are already being viewed as persons who are at greater risk of being infected. The state today submitted to the court that only certain categories of people with disabilities were being prioritised by the central government and that it had written to the Centre to open the drive to all categories but were yet to receive a response.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/prioritise-vaccination-for-the-disabled-high-court-tells-tn-101618859252497.html
20-04-2021||India||Kochi man held from K’taka over murder of his daughter||Thiruvananthapuram: Nearly a month after a 13-year-old girl was found dead in a river in Kochi, the Kerala Police on Monday confirmed the arrest of her father for her murder from Karwar in Karnataka. Kochi police commissioner CH Nagaraju said the preliminary probe revealed that the accused, identified as 45-year-old Sanu Mohan, a resident of Aluva in Kochi, had planned to end his life after killing his daughter due to the financial setback he suffered in his business in Pune. He allegedly suffocated his daughter on March 20 and dumped her body in the river, police said. Mohan then tried to drown himself, but got scared and came out of Muttar river, the police commissioner said, adding that he then fled in his car. The post-mortem report of the girl confirmed the cause of her death as drowning, with the police suspecting that the girl was dumped in the river before her death. The commissioner said there were several gaps in Mohan’s preliminary statements, adding that they need to be investigated thoroughly. The police have ruled out any involvement of a third party in the case as of now. Nagaraju said police moved an application in a local court on Monday for two-week custody of Mohan. Police have recovered his car from Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu. After CCTV visuals at Walayar check-post along the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border confirmed his car crossing the check-post in the early hours of March 21, police began their hunt for the accused, covering three states, the top cop said. “We have information that he travelled to three-four states to dodge police and there were many attempts to mislead investigators,” he said. Police said that the accused told them that he tried to cut his vein in a bid to end his life but later took medical help. In Goa, where he also claimed to have attempted to end his life, he told the interrogators that he jumped into the sea but rescued by lifeguards. But police said these were excuses to earn sympathy, adding that he was changing his statements frequently. The Kochi police commissioner said four teams were formed and they were chasing the accused scanning three states. He said the final breakthrough in the case came when Mohan was spotted in a lodge in Mookambika temple in Karnataka. But before police reached the spot, he fled from there. Police said Mohan stopped using his mobile phone a few days before his disappearance on March 21. When he was detained in Karwar on Sunday, he was found using another mobile phone, the top police officer said. An electronic equipment dealer, Mohan left Pune a couple of years ago after his business suffered losses. Police said a case was registered against him in Pune for financial malpractices. Occupants of the flat where he stayed in Kochi said he was a well-behaved man and attached to his daughter, who was interested in dancing and extra- curricular activities. The mother of the victim is yet to record her statement, police said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/kochi-man-held-from-k-taka-over-murder-of-his-daughter-101618859192490.html
20-04-2021||India||Karnataka govt ignored second wave warning, say experts||Ats a time when Karnataka is in the grip of the deadlier second wave of coronavirus disease (Covid-19), a senior member of the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) said the government was warned about the second wave.“The onset of the second wave was warned by the experts in Karnataka on November 30, 2020. We missed the timing and the quantum is higher than expected. Governments had all the time to review and prepare,” tweeted Dr Girighara Babu, an epidemiologist at the Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI) and a member of the state TAC on Covid-19.On Sunday, Bengaluru recorded its highest ever number of cases with 12,793 infections.“The bed capacity is hardly sufficient for few days. It is also necessary to reduce the speed of transmission. There are only few options any Government can have when the cases surge rapidly and resources are limited. We need stricter mitigation and containment, starting now,” Babu said in another tweet.Babu has been one of the leading advisors to the Karnataka government on Covid-19.Many other experts like Babu have been raising concerns about the government’s inaction, which they believe, led to the Covid-19 situation going out of control. “The government was given first set of recommendation asking for stricter measures to be put in place to tackle the second wave. They ignored it. They were asked to implement several measures including reducing the footfall at cinemas, schools and many others. These recommendations were made in February and March again, but it was shot down,” said an expert purview to development, who did not wish to be named.The expert also pointed out that despite the projections from the TAC, the government was planning for the second wave using the numbers of the previous surge. “On the second day of the second wave, we crossed the highest number reported in the first wave. We are now reporting more than 100% more cases than the last wave. The government failed to listen to the experts there as well,” the expert added.Besides, the allocation on health in the state budget, too, did not reflect the government’s readiness to prepare for the second wave, an expert said.“For starters, even though the pandemic was the biggest challenge faced by the government, the budget allocation for health remained at 4%. It was as though nothing had changed. They announced to build Intensive Care Units, but it was not to be immediate. The plan was to develop them over two years. When the government knew, a second wave was coming, why it didn’t plan for more hospital facilities?” asked a faculty member of the medical college in Bengaluru, currently deployed on Covid-19 duty.A senior government official, who attended the review meeting on Monday, in which restrictions to be imposed in the city were discussed, said that more than any constructive discussion, the meeting saw legislators indulging in mudslinging. “The opposition was asking the government why there was no lockdown, and the governing party was arguing over why they (Opposition) were supporting a lockdown,” he said.Another member of the TAC said that expert opinion has been that a lockdown is required in Bengaluru to control the current Covid-19 situation. “We have no other choice. The number of cases is only going to increase, stretching our healthcare system. We need to announce a lockdown and built infrastructure in the meanwhile. We hope that in the meeting with the governor, which will have lesser members than today (Monday), some sensible decisions will be taken,” added the TAC member.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/ktaka-govt-ignored-second-wave-warning-say-experts-101618858537650.html

However, it does seem that those who drafted your letter or advised you, have done a great disservice to your standing by misleading you regarding material that is already in public domain,” said the minister.The Congress hit back, with party leader Ashok Chavan demanding an apology, and calling the letter a cheap retort lacking in grace.Party spokesperson Supriya Shrinate dismissed the allegation that Congress-ruled states created vaccine hesitancy.“It’s a natural concern and despite being a doctor, it is sad that the minister labelled it as a politically fuelled hesitancy.”Rajasthan chief minister Ashok Gehlot hit out at Vardhan for his “politically motivated” response.“It is unfortunate and condemnable of the health minister to have written a politically motivated reply to the former prime minister,” he tweeted.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/harsh-vardhan-targets-manmohan-over-letter-congress-charges-back-101618857932996.html
20-04-2021||India||Young not more prone to Covid-19 in 2nd wave: Govt||Young people aren’t more vulnerable to the second wave of coronavirus infections in India when compared to the first, said top government medical experts on Monday, citing official hospital data to establish that there was no dramatic shift in the age profile of Covid-19 patients from last year.In an official briefing, Dr VK Paul, member (health), Niti Aayog and Dr Balram Bhargava, director general of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) said data coming from the ground showed that young people contributed roughly the same caseload to the current outbreak as the one that ravaged India last year. They claimed that need for oxygen and shortness of breath was seen more among patients in this wave.“If we look at age profiles, we will see in the last year people under 30 years contributed 31 per cent of the cases and now it is 32 per cent, so essentially there is no difference. There is no overarching excess of young people becoming Covid positive. The main point we are making is essentially we do not see a shift in the age prevalence of Covid-19 overall in the country,” said Paul.Also read: Over 2 million active cases stretch health infrastructure to limitsBhargava said only a marginally high proportion of patients were younger and that the average of patients in the first wave was 50 and in this wave, was 49. “From zero to 19 years - the difference was 5.8% versus 4.2%, and in 20-40 years, the difference was 25 per cent versus 23 per cent. There is a marginal difference in this,” he said.The data set was taken from the National Clinical Covid-19 Registry that ICMR launched in September last year. The data of 9,485 patients, from August 2020 to April 2021, was taken for the analysis. “The changes that we have seen are that oxygen utilisation has increased to 54.5% in the second wave, from 41.1% that was seen during the first wave last year. And requirement for ventilation has gone down from 37.3 to 27.8% between the two waves,” said Bhargava.Shortness of breath was seen in 47.5% hospitalised positive cases this year as compared to 41.7% last year, he added. The first wave data was taken from September to November 2020, and second wave data between February and April, 2021.“The good news is that the death profile has not seen much change...It is 9.6% hospitalised patients in the first wave and 9.7% among patients in the second wave,” he said.The analysis also found that in both the waves, 70% of those hospitalised were above 40. Among 20-40, 23.7% hospitalisations were seen during the first wave, and 25.5% in the second.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/young-not-more-prone-to-covid-in-2nd-wave-govt-101618857932384.html
20-04-2021||India||Govt okays extending aid to vaccine makers||The finance ministry has approved in-principle a move by the Union health ministry to extend advance to vaccine manufacturers involved in making coronavirus disease (Covid-19) vaccine doses to boost the nationwide inoculation drive, a finance ministry official said on condition of anonymity.A CNBC report on Monday said the government sanctioned ₹4,500 crore supply credit to Covid-19 vaccine manufacturers — Serum Institute of India ( ₹3,000 crore) and Bharat Biotech ( ₹1,500 crore). “The health ministry will work company specific details and provide them advance money so that they ramp up their manufacturing capacities and continue vaccine supplies without interruption,” the official quoted above said.India is currently inoculating its citizens using two vaccines -- the Oxford/AztraZeneca vaccine manufactured by SII under the brand name Covishield, and Covaxin created by Bharat Biotech and the Indian Council of Medical Research and manufactured by Bharat Biotech.Also read: Capital back in lockdownBoth the companies were seeking to ramp up their vaccine production in the wake of rising demand for Covid-19 vaccines, and looking to raise finances.The chief executive officer of SII, Adar Poonawalla, in an interview to NDTV this month, said that the company will require around ₹3,000 crore to ramp up production capacity. The company at the moment produces about 50-60 million vaccine doses per month, and has plans of ramping it up to about 100 million doses per month, he added in the interviewIn the case of Covaxin, the Centre on Friday announced that it will help double the production capacity of India’s first made-in-India Covid-19 vaccine by May-June 2021 from the existing 10 million doses per month, with a target of helping produce nearly 100 million doses per month by September.On Friday, the Centre announced releasing ₹65 crore to Bharat Biotech, the maker of Covaxin, to upgrade its production capacity.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/govt-okays-extending-aid-to-vaccine-makers-101618857873529.html
20-04-2021||India||Over 2 million active Covid-19 cases stretch health infrastructure to limits||The number of active cases in India on Monday crossed the two million mark as the mammoth surge of new infections continued to push the overburdened health care system to limits, with reports emerging from across the country of hospitals running out of ICU beds, and crucial supplies such as oxygen cylinders.The latest in the series of grim landmarks for the country comes only 10 days after active cases in the country crossed the 1 million active cases mark on April 10.As of Monday night, there were a total of 2,030,725 active cases across the country, the highest active caseload ever recorded in India since the start of the outbreak in March last year, according to HT’s Covid-19 dashboard.For the third day running, India’s daily case tally remained above the quarter million mark as 256,596 new cases were reported, while a record 1,757 daily deaths were lodged. India’s overall caseload has now reached 15.3 million – the second-highest after the United States – and 154,320 people have lost their lives to the disease, according to HT’s dashboard.Active cases – those Covid-19 patients still carrying the virus, and thus under treatment – is a crucial metric representing the country’s battle against the disease because it directly reflects the pressure on the health care system in a region.While the total number of active cases is alarming, the rate at which this number is rising is even more so. In the past week, the country has added nearly 770,000 active cases to its tally.When the first wave of the Covid-19 outbreak was raging at its peak, India’s active cases only hovered over the 1 million mark briefly (for a period of five days between September 15 and September 20 last year).This means that the current active caseload, and by extension the burden on the country’s hospitals and nursing homes, is more than double what the country saw even during the peak for the first wave.This also makes India only the second country after the US to have more than 2 million active cases at any given point of time.In Brazil, which is the world’s third worst-hit country, active cases topped out at 1.3 million two weeks ago, and appear to be on dropping now.To be sure, there are currently 6.9 million active cases in the US, where it touched a peak of 9.1 million in late January, when the country’s third wave was at its peak.The metric is even more crucial in current circumstances because the country’s health care system is being weighed down by cases, particularly in regions that have massive chunks of active cases such as Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Delhi, many of which have been reporting not only shortage of supplies such as oxygen tanks, but are also running out of ICU beds, and even space in morgues and funeral homes.Also read: Night curfew, tightened curbs as Covid-19 rages across countryOne of the major reasons to have caused an acute area-specific shortage of life-saving supplies is the uneven distribution of the active cases in the country. Maharashtra, for instance, is home to only 9% of the country’s population, but is currently bearing the load of one of every three (33.4%) active cases in India. The western state, the worst-hit by Covid-19, had 678,198 active cases as of Monday night.Just the top 10 states by active cases are responsible for over 80% of all such cases.Uttar Pradesh had 208,523 active cases (10% of the country’s caseload), Karnataka 142,084 (7%), Chhattisgarh 129,000 active cases (6.4%) and Kerala with 103,327 active cases (5.1%) made the top five along with Maharashtra.Delhi, which is home to 0.3% of the country’s population, has 3.8% of India active cases – 76,887.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/over-2-million-active-covid-19-cases-stretch-health-infra-to-limits-101618857872303.html
20-04-2021||India||Two top poll panel officials test Covid-19 positive||Chief election commissioner Sushil Chandra and election commissioner Rajiv Kumar have both tested positive for Covid-19, as the bitterly fought elections in West Bengal continue, people familiar with the matter said on Monday.The post of the third commissioner has been vacant since April 13, when former CEC Sunil Arora demitted office. People familiar with the matter said that other senior officials, such as some deputy election commissioners, also contracted the virus and all those who have tested positive are in quarantine.Despite all odds, the EC is constantly in touch with all required officials via video call to ensure the smooth conduct of the remaining three phases of the West Bengal elections, said the people cited above.HT on April 9 reported that in the politically fraught battle in Bengal, the EC received over 19,000 complaints, of which only 99 remained to be resolved as of April 8. The high stakes political battle has had various party leaders knocking on the EC’s door to intervene in cases of violation of the poll code.On Sunday, the commission imposed a 24-hour campaigning ban on Sujata Mondal and Sayantan Basu for code violation.EC seeks officials’ reply on feasibility of pollsThe Election Commission of India on Monday has sought feedback from poll officials in West Bengal regarding the feasibility of allowing election rallies, a person familiar with the matter said. This comes amid a sharp rise in Covid-19 cases across the country which has parties demanding that public rallies be suspended and the remaining phases [in West Bengal] be clubbed into one.A person familiar with the matter said, “Every state is different. The EC has already effectively suspended campaigning for the eighth phase. And today is the last day for campaigning for the sixth phase. EC will hear from officials in the state.”The last three phases of the polls are scheduled for April 22, April 26, and April 29 respectively.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/two-top-poll-panel-officials-test-covid-ve-101618857392315.html
20-04-2021||India||BJP, TMC scale down campaigns amid spike||New Delhi The Trinamool Congress (TMC) and Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) decided on Monday to scale back their campaigns for the ongoing West Bengal elections in the face of rising coronavirus cases in the eastern state and sharp criticism of rampant violation of Covid-19 protocols in rallies.TMC said chief minister Mamata Banerjee will address no events in state capital Kolkata, save one symbolic rally on the last day of campaigning on April 26. Its main rival, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), said it will limit audience at public events to 500, and hold meetings only in open spaces and in accordance with Covid guidelines.The announcements came on a day the state posted 8,426 cases and 38 deaths, pushing its tally to 668,353 and death toll to 10,606, respectively.“Mamata Banerjee will not campaign in Kolkata anymore. Only one ‘symbolic’ meeting on the last day of campaigning in the city on April 26 will be held. She slashed time for all her election rallies in all districts and is now restricted to just 30 minutes,” party MP Derek O’Brien said in a tweet.Later in the day, the BJP announced curbs of its own.“It has been decided that only small public meetings with not more than 500 people will be held by PM Modi and other central ministers in West Bengal. All these public meetings will be held in open spaces following Covid-19 guidelines,” BJP said, adding that breaking the chain of infections was needed in such a difficult time.Party’s social media in-charge Amit Malaviya said that the party will leverage its digital footprint to take BJP’s message to the people. “We will ensure that BJP leverages its massive digital footprint and takes message of PM and other leaders to lakhs of people. We did that successfully during Bihar elections, which too was conducted under the cloud of Covid. Opposition had then complaint that it gave us an edge,” Malaviya tweeted.Political parties in Bengal have faced flak from experts because of rampant violation of mask mandates and distancing protocols in rallies. Last week, the Election Commission warned that all parties will have to strictly adhere to guidelines during campaigning even as health experts criticised the poll watchdog for failing to strictly implement norms.On Sunday, senior Congress leader Rahul Gandhi said he will not address any rallies in the state.The sixth phase of West Bengal elections will be held on April 22, seventh on April 26 and the final phase on April 29. The Commission has already extended the silent period from 48 to 72 hours, in view of the rising cases, therefore not allowing any campaigning between the seventh and the eight phases. Last week, EC also banned public meetings and road shows between 7 pm and 10 am and threatened penal provisions against any political party or candidate found violating Covid-19 protocol at public events. On Monday – the last day of campaigning for the sixth phase -- Banerjee trained her guns at BJP and EC for the rising coronavirus cases.“With folded hands, I request EC to hold the next three phases of polls on a single day. If not one, conduct it in two days and save one day. Please don’t take your decision based on what the BJP says. Please ensure that you protect public health by curtailing the poll schedule, even if it is by one day,” the TMC supremo said at her rally in Chakulia.The BJP hit back. Union home minister Amit Shah said that each candidate has to be given a certain number of days to campaign and it is constitutional duty of the commission to ensure that an appropriate amount of time is provided. “Constitutionally, the EC has no other option but to conduct elections. Mamata Ji makes comments without reading the Constitution,” Shah said.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/bjp-tmc-scale-down-campaigns-amid-spike-101618857332251.html
20-04-2021||India||HC wants curbs in 5 UP cities; not possible: Govt||The Allahabad high court on Monday directed the Uttar Pradesh government to strictly enforce closure of all establishments (government or private) in Prayagraj, Lucknow, Varanasi, Kanpur Nagar and Gorakhpur till April 26 in view of the surge in Covid-19 cases.While the court clarified that it was not imposing a complete lockdown in the entire state by its order, the Yogi Adityanath government asserted that there will not be any “imposition of statewide lockdown or any fresh restrictions in the five cities (Lucknow, Prayagraj, Varanasi, Kanpur City, and Gorakhpur)”.“There should be no confusion.

People themselves [are] proactive and doing closures,” the spokesperson added.Additional chief secretary (information) Navneet Sehgal said, “The UP government is submitting its reply before the HC on its observations.”The government’s statement came hours after a bench comprising justices Siddhartha Varma and Ajit Kumar passed the order in a suo motu public interest litigation on conditions of quarantine centres in the state and the treatment of Covid-19 patients.“We... direct the government to consider imposition of a complete lockdown in the entire state for at least a period of two weeks,” the bench said.The court’s directive came on a day on when UP recorded 167 deaths and 28,287 fresh Covid-19 cases. The state capital alone saw 22 deaths and 5,897 fresh cases.Financial institutions and departments, medical and health services, industrial and scientific establishments, essential services, including municipal functions, and public transport will be exempted from the closure ordered by the court till April 26.Also read: Two top poll panel officials test Covid-19 positiveThe court further asked the state government to ensure that grocery shops and other commercial shops, excluding medicine shops, with more than three workers shall remain closed till April 26.

The ministry spokesperson said trains will continue to run even during the curfew.“Today evening there was some speculation about the crowd coming to station or rush building up. It is requested that all may avoid such reports as the reality is different...Rush and crowd happen when there is a speculation that trains would not be available at all or will be stopped. There is no such situation now. Trains are not going to be stopped and I think public knows about it. They know that, if they don’t get to travel today, they can go the next day or later on. Even under the curfew guidelines, one is allowed to travel to the station with a valid ticket. There is nothing to panic,” railway ministry spokesperson DJ Narain said.However, the sale of platform tickets at railway stations in Delhi has been suspended to regulate entry of the passengers and avoid crowding at platforms. “Due to surge in Covid-19 cases, Delhi Division of Northern Railway has decided to stop the sale of platform tickets with immediate effect till further orders to regulate the entry of passengers at platforms and station premises,” Northern Railways’ DRM tweeted.Also read: Covid-19 vaccine for everyone above 18 from May 1, PM Modi gives go aheadKeen to avoid a situation like last year, the Indian Railways is adding additional summer special trains to cater to the rush of migrants headed home, taking the current train service operations to around 70% of pre-Covid times, HT reported last Friday.Last March, railways suspended regular passenger train services during the nationwide lockdown.Over the past week the railways have planned 69 additional ‘summer special trains’ to cater to the rush being reported across stations. Till April 30, the national transporter has planned 133 additional trains with 88 ‘summer specials’ and 45 ‘festival special’ trains.According to railway ministry’s data till Wednesday, the national carrier has approved total of 9,622 special trains and at present it is running an average of 7,745 trains as compared to an average 11,283 trains during pre-Covid times.

By virtue of citizenship, one becomes a member of a sovereign country and becomes entitled to various rights and privileges granted by law in that country,” said the order. “If any question arises about citizenship of a person, in our opinion, the same should be adjudicated as far as possible on the basis of merit and on hearing the person concerned,” it added.Also Read | East India extremely vulnerable to climate change: AnalysisAs per the Assam Accord of 1985, anyone who has been staying in the state prior to March 24, 1971, or can establish lineage to people residing on or before that date is considered as Indian citizen — a requirement also accepted for inclusion in the National Register of Citizens (NRC) updated in 2019.Names of around 1.9 million people who failed to prove theirs or their ancestor’s residency in Assam on that date and those who were declared foreigners by foreigners’ tribunals (as well their relatives) were excluded from the NRC.The HC found that though a notice was served by the tribunal to Khatun, her son appeared on her behalf without her knowledge. “Unfortunately, the petitioner’s son neglected to appear before the tribunal on various dates fixed by the tribunal resulting in passing of the ex-parte order. From the records, it is evident that the learned tribunal passed the order without hearing the petitioner,” the HC order of April 8 read.

20-04-2021||India||8 states most prone to climate crisis: Study||Eight states in the eastern parts of India are most vulnerable to the impact of climate change and should be prioritised for interventions, a new assessment has found. The states are Jharkhand, Mizoram, Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Assam, Bihar, Arunachal Pradesh and West Bengal.The assessment by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of Technology at Mandi and Guwahati, funded by the Department of Science and Technology, has used the intergovernmental panel on climate change’s Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) to define vulnerability and make state and district-wise assessments.The AR5 defines the risk of climate change as the interaction of “hazard”, “exposure” and “vulnerability”, where vulnerability is conceptualised as the “propensity or predisposition of the system to be adversely affected”.“Vulnerability is basically a function of sensitivity and adaptive capacity. All states in India are vulnerable to climate change as per our assessment. But these eastern and central states are more vulnerable because of their poverty levels; lack of irrigation; low forest cover in some cases; low adaptive capacity of the health sector among other drivers. This assessment can basically guide which states should be prioritised for use of adaptation fund. It should also guide aid agencies and international financial institutions like the World Bank and others on where money is needed the most,” said NH Ravindranath, retired professor, Indian Institute of Science, and a co-researcher of the assessment.Sensitivity determines the first-order impact of a climate hazard. The effect may be direct (for instance, change in crop yield in response to a change in the mean, range, or variability of temperature) or indirect (such as damages caused by an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding due to sea-level rise), the report says. Some key indicators were selected for the assessment through discussions with state governments and scientists. These include: Percentage of population living below the poverty line; income share from natural resources; the proportion of marginal and small land holdings, women’s participation in the workforce; yield variability of food grains; the area under rainfed agriculture, forest area per 1,000 rural population; area covered under crop insurance; density of health care workers and others. Weights were assigned to each of these indicators to calculate a score and all states were found to cross the threshold making all of them vulnerable.“Approximately 90% districts in Assam, 80% in Bihar, and 60% in Jharkhand fall in Quartile I (i.e, in the category of 153 most vulnerable districts) exhibiting a high level of concentration of vulnerable districts,” the assessment states, adding that the least vulnerable states as per the assessment released on Saturday are Himachal Pradesh, Telangana, Sikkim, Punjab, Uttarakhand, Haryana, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Nagaland, Goa and Maharashtra.Also read: Amid Covid surge, Kalka-Shimla heritage track sees 70% drop in passenger trafficThe authors clarify that vulnerability indicators are relative measures and that it does not imply that, say, Maharashtra is not vulnerable in an absolute sense. “It should also be noted that this vulnerability ranking is based on a set of indicators that were used in this assessment with a specific objective. These indicators predominantly focused on socio-economic drivers as well as those related to primary sector-based livelihood along with some biophysical and institutional factors,” the report said.For Jharkhand which is the most vulnerable state according to the assessment, a high proportion of BPL (below poverty line) population, prevalence of rainfed agriculture, and high incidence of vector-borne diseases are the major drivers of vulnerability.A relatively high rate of implementation of the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme, a high road density and extensive railway network, a greater number of health care workers per 1,000 population, and a low prevalence of vector-borne diseases were among indicators found in less vulnerable states. The authors have recommended a climate risk index to be developed for all states based on hazards and vulnerability of states.Another international study has flagged India’s vulnerability to climate change this week. Monsoon rainfall in India is likely to become stronger and more erratic according to an analysis by a team of German researchers at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) and Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich, Germany (LMU) which compared more than 30 climate models. The study published in the Journal of Earth System Dynamics predicts more extremely wet years in the future with grave consequences for India’s economy, food systems and agriculture.“We have found robust evidence for an exponential dependence: For every degree Celsius of warming, monsoon rainfall will likely increase by about 5%,” said lead author Anja Katzenberger from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK) in a statement.“The study reiterates the need for the 2020s to become a decade of climate action and building climate resilience. As a next step, it is also important to highlight the complexity and non-linearity of climate risks across Indian states. The focus needs to be on climate-proofing of geographies, economies and infrastructure at the state and district level. A CEEW analysis has already found that more than 75% of Indian districts are vulnerable to extreme climate events. Identification of risks at a granular level via building a climate risk atlas would be crucial,” said Abinash Mohanty, programme lead, CEEW.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/8-states-most-prone-to-climate-crisis-study-101618772427958.html
20-04-2021||Today's||To level the playing field at work, start by levelling it at home||On April 15, the Chief Justice of India (CJI) SA Bobde, while hearing a case on judicial appointments, remarked that the time had come for a woman CJI. But, he said, chief justices of high courts stated that women lawyers have often refrained from taking up judgeship citing domestic and parental responsibilities. After the initial outrage wore off, I looked at the statement again.It is true that women in all professions disproportionately bear the responsibility of being a primary parent to their children.Yes, women can multi-task, yes, they can have it all, and yes, they can reach the pinnacles of their chosen careers. Many women on the Bench today have raised children, been caregivers to ailing family members, yet shown how it’s done professionally.But the statement still hurt. A lot. I convinced myself it doesn’t apply to me. I play ball with the boys. While I am a mother, and the primary parent to my son and daughter, I believe I work as hard as my male counterparts. I convinced myself it doesn’t apply to me because my husband fills in parenting gaps with pleasure when my career requires him to. Thinking back, however, reminded me how that wasn’t exactly true.Also Read | Courts must dispel gender stereotypesI thought back to my first pregnancy, which was over a decade ago. Visibly pregnant at eight-and-a-half months, standing in a crowded court room in the Supreme Court for several hours. I never asked anyone for a chair, because I believe that if you want to be treated as genderless, you must treat yourself as exactly that. Nor was any chair ever offered.I thought back to a few months after that, and the sight of a female colleague walking out of a Supreme Court courtroom in tears. She had delivered a baby three weeks earlier, and the presiding judge said he would like to hear the matter after he was done with all the other cases. She explained her situation, baby in the parking lot waiting for her, in his grandmother’s arms. Still, the court did not think it appropriate to adjourn the matter for a few weeks at her request.I thought back to the time a senior counsel retorted, “that is the most ridiculous excuse I have heard” when a female colleague told a judge that she could not stay beyond 4.30pm as she had to breastfeed her newborn baby.Today those days feel like a different life. My children are older and my career more established. But those were the years in your career when a woman is not fungible with her spouse in carrying and feeding a baby. Those are years when you need the system to support you, in order to stay in the system.While we look today at the minuscule number of female judges and designated senior counsel, we should recognise that these women did it despite the odds. The system did not make it easy for them or support them through the difficult years. These are the ones that made it through. I am now on to the next phase, a phase where both parents are equally equipped to parent. The CJI cited Class 12 Board exams. There is no reason why parenting cannot be an equal partnership at that stage.I am fortunate to practice in perhaps the most gender-neutral environment of any court in the country. Today, the Delhi High Court is not a “boys club”, either at the bar or the bench, but this is not true of courts in other cities and states. We need to change that.Historically, parenting, care-giving and domestic activities finding mention in work life was perceived to be weak or unprofessional. That’s because someone outside the workplace was performing them. Women are not asking for special treatment at the workplace. Barring the few sensitive years of childbearing, they don’t need it, if they simply receive equal treatment at home.Shyel Trehan is a graduate of NLSIU, Bangalore and Columbia Law School.

20-04-2021||Today's||Robert Mundell and RBI’s impossible trinity||In the first week of April, legendary economist Robert Mundell passed away. In 1999, Mundell was awarded the Nobel Prize for his work on how monetary and fiscal policy works under different exchange rate systems. He is also seen as the father of the Euro.For generations of economists and policymakers, Mundell holds an exalted position for his work on the impossible trinity. He said that policymakers can choose any two, but not all three, macroeconomic objectives — foreign capital mobility, fixed exchange rates and inflation management.What was a mere academic idea soon acquired practical relevance as economies had to choose from these three objectives. This was particularly true in the 1990s when foreign capital mobility became a popular policy reform. Economies made choices based on their conditions and aspirations.The United States (US) chose inflation and foreign capital mobility and kept exchange rates flexible maintaining the status of the US dollar. China chose inflation and fixed exchange rates to keep its exports competitive while keeping capital controls. Hong Kong, positioning itself as an international financial centre, chose free capital mobility and fixed exchange rates.Also Read | With RBI keeping interest rates on hold, quantitative easing to unfold: FitchInterestingly, India did not make these choices. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) maintained foreign exchange reserves and intervened in foreign exchange markets to stabilise the rupee. The capital account was not fully liberalised, preventing hot inflow and outflow of foreign capital. In 2003, the government also announced the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS), which absorbed the excessive liquidity resulting from RBI’s interventions in the forex market.In 2016, RBI adopted the inflation targeting framework (ITF). Under ITF, central banks typically choose price inflation and free capital mobility and leave the exchange rate to markets. However, learning from the 2008 and 2013 taper tantrum crises, RBI continued to build foreign exchange reserves to safeguard from excess volatility of rupee and capital flows.Over time, Mundell’s classical macroeconomics trinity has been adopted to understand trinities (or trilemmas) in other sectors. Dani Rodrik’s political-economy trinity is based on democracy, national sovereignty and global economic integration. Dirk Schoenmaker shows the incompatibility among financial stability, financial integration and national financial policies.Recent central bank policies can also be reframed as another trinity — of inflation targeting, liquidity and government bond interest rates or yields. Large government deficits are pushing yields upwards. Higher yields lead to overall higher interest rates, which, in turn, threaten economic recovery.Central banks are caught in this crossfire to keep the yields low. If central banks increase liquidity to bond yields, they give up on inflation targeting. If central banks focus on inflation and liquidity, they give up on yields.The central banks of Japan and Australia explicitly target yield curves by flooding liquidity whereas those of England, the US and Europe do so implicitly. It is interesting that inflation has not really risen despite such easy monetary policies by these central banks.In the case of RBI, the trinity choices are not as straightforward. The pandemic led to a large increase in government borrowing, which put upward pressure on bond yields. RBI managed this trinity by increasing liquidity via multiple programmes, keeping bond yields low. This was at the cost of almost ignoring the inflation target, which remained above the upper target range of 6% from April, 2020 to November, 2020. The markets also ignored high inflation and supported RBI’s efforts to support the weak economy.The government announced high borrowing for 2021-22 as well, continuing to put pressure on RBI. This time, the bond markets demanded higher yields as the economy was recovering sharply — though the impact of the second wave of Covid will have to be seen. However, the government wished to keep the 10-year yield at 6%.RBI was once again caught in the middle of this battle. It was as if RBI was Brahma mediating between Shiva and Vishnu (and I leave it to readers to decide who is who). As earlier programmes had diminishing marginal utility, in its recent April policy, RBI announced a new programme named Government Security Acquisition Programme (GSAP 1.0).GSAP is nothing but old wine in a new bottle as it provides a calendar for the age-old Open Market Operations (OMO) that absorb and infuse liquidity in markets. Post-GSAP, the bond yields eased to 6% levels but again rose to the 6.10%- 6.15% range, tracking the rise in inflation. We are also witnessing interesting games between the government, RBI and bond markets in every bond auction.But how long can RBI ignore inflation, given it is an inflation-targeting central bank? In a recent bulletin article, RBI economists said that the central bank is “striving to ensure an orderly evolution of the yield curve, but it takes two to tango and forestall a tandav”. This was indeed a colourful way to express the tussle, with RBI putting the onus back on the markets. But the central bank should realise that the markets are seeing the inconsistency in the RBI’s choices.Mundell showed this nearly 60 years ago — when confronted with three objectives, you can, sometimes, just choose two. Given RBI’s objectives, it should pick inflation and liquidity and leave bond yields. Otherwise, the tango will eventually turn out to be a tandav.Amol Agrawal is a faculty member at Ahmedabad University.

20-04-2021||Today's||To beat the second wave, understand it||It would be comic if it were not so deathly serious. The home-grown variant B.1.617 was visible in the United Kingdom (UK) in February, when here, it was claimed surges were not due to new strains. Cabinet ministers derided an Opposition politician for suggesting an expanded vaccine portfolio, labelling him a broker for pharmaceutical firms, before expanding the portfolio three days later. Apparently, there is no shortage, but states are shutting down vaccination centres. An empowered group of senior officers says there is no oxygen shortage, but the Prime Minister’s Office cancels a meeting with a key international visitor to review the situation.All these point to tightly controlled information, unhelpful to transparent and collective pandemic management. What information can be released to help combat the pandemic?First, the share of antigen tests available with Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). This is an imperfect measure of missed infections, due to the nature of the test. Cities and districts with higher share of antigen tests need more attention because it’s likely that they may be missing infected people, who go on to infect others.Second, the reasons for testing (also with ICMR) — of self-testing, surveillance (e.g. fever clinics) contact tracing, etc — some indicate under-detection. A high share of contact tracing is better than high self-reporting, which depends on an individual’s intent to test.Third, the proportion of different variants (from the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Consortium on Genomics, hopefully better-funded now). Punjab reported a high share of the UK variant, B.1.117. This does not have an immune-escape mutation and is thus more responsive to vaccination. In Maharashtra and other states with a high share of B.1.617, immunisation may reduce the severity of infection but it may not stop the infection itself, as it has a possible immune-escape mutation. This has implications for disease management and how the benefits of immunisation are communicated. If a large number of people get infected after immunisation, then vaccine hesitancy may rise, affecting the expansion of vaccination.Fourth, the location of cases (from analysis of ICMR data and states’ administrative reports). Whether it is big cities, small towns or rural areas matters for the spread and plans to move people and materials to manage the pandemic. Sketchy data from Maharashtra seems to indicate a move away from the bigger cities, but it is unclear whether it is to smaller towns, peri-urban areas or villages. This can also matter for the geographical prioritisation of vaccination.Fifth, the age structure of cases (from ICMR) and deaths (from states). We are assuming that younger people are less likely to have severe disease and this underpins our vaccination strategy. It seems that young people are getting infected in this surge, but not much. Numbers from Mumbai indicate that the share of those below 50 is now around 65%, whereas previously it was around 57%. Is this related to vaccination or the variant?Reports from Pune, Mumbai, Delhi, among others, indicate that hospitals are filling up. While the case fatality numbers from Mumbai seem lower, it is higher in many districts which needs attention. High hospital occupancy and low fatality indicate that more people are coming in for treatment but are also getting cured, even for older persons. This, with the age structure, affects how patients are prioritised and open communication would reassure families running around for oxygen and remdesvir.Sixth, are vaccinated people in hospital with severe infection? With 11 million health care and frontline workers fully vaccinated, and nearly 90 million people above 45 getting at least one jab, a substantial proportion of the age group, especially in urban areas has been vaccinated. If they are not showing up in hospital, even if they are infected (which could be determined if the ICMR form captured vaccination status, as recommended by the Lancet Commission Task Force), it is good news.Seventh, there is need to build vaccine-confidence by reporting adverse events following immunisation (AEFI), currently not released with the vaccination data. Some cases of blood clots from the AstraZeneca (Covishield) and the Janssen vaccine (which share a common viral vector platform with Sputnik V) have been reported internationally. With over a 100 million vaccinations in India, it is unusual not to see such reports here. This does not breed vaccine-confidence — rather, it increases the likelihood of misinformation increasing vaccine hesitancy because the government is seen as trying to conceal negative information.Eighth, recognise vaccine shortage and modify our strategy. We can release vaccination information by rural and urban and formally prioritise by geography, given the disease’s spread. The initial favouring of urban areas may have helped. We can redefine frontline workers to include construction and manufacturing workers and street vendors in cities, who, even if sick, are likely not to test, to avoid losing income. The geography and age profile of infection will help in this decision.Ninth, we need to mitigate the spread from large gatherings like the Kumbh, as with returning migrants last year, with quarantine and testing. The will not work in election states, where it is prudent to expect a sharp rise in cases and be prepared to combat the surge, by moving patients if needed. We will be lucky if it does not occur, but won’t be caught napping if it does.Tenth, the media must ask far more questions and not accept “trust us”. If governments are pushed to answer, they may be forced to think. It is time for them to trust us.Partha Mukhopadhyay is senior fellow, Centre for Policy ResearchThe views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/to-beat-the-second-wave-understand-it-101618760787481.html
20-04-2021||Today's||Why a Gauhati HC order on a citizenship case is important||Over the last two years, several reports have exposed the flawed workings of Assam’s Foreigners’ Tribunals, where individuals accused of being “illegal immigrants” have to prove their citizenship. The reports suggest that these tribunals have followed arbitrary processes, placed the burden of producing extensive documentary proof on marginalised individuals, exercised little genuine independence vis-a-vis the executive, and that their tenure is linked to how many people they can declare to be “non-citizens”. This is particularly serious, given that the stripping of citizenship means the loss of all basic rights, and vulnerability to deportation.In this context, a recent Gauhati High Court (HC) judgment comes as an important corrective, and raises some hope for bringing the foreigners’ tribunal process more in line with the rule of law.The tribunal had declared one Haidar Ali to be a non-citizen, despite extensive documentation — including voter lists and property documents — being placed to show that Ali’s parents and grandparents were Indian citizens, and had been so for decades. The tribunal did so on the basis of perverse reasoning — for example, that along with Ali’s parents, there were certain other names in the voting lists that had not been explained; that Ali had stated during oral evidence that he had certain siblings while he had not done so in his written evidence, and that this justified drawing an “adverse inference” against him; and that despite Ali’s father himself testifying to their relationship before the tribunal, a “sufficient link” between the two had not been proven.The Gauhati HC — speaking through Justice N Kotiswar Singh — set aside the order, and declared Ali to be an Indian citizen. Apart from a careful consideration of the documentary evidence, it noted that the structure of the Foreigners’ Tribunal proceedings was such that those accused of being a foreigner had no knowledge about the circumstances under which they had been referred to the tribunal or the nature of the accusations against them — no documents or evidence had to be furnished to them. In HC’s words, the individual “is totally in [the] dark as to how he came to be considered a foreigner and not an Indian.”For this reason, the court held that if an individual “introduces new facts to discharge his onus [of proof], it cannot be said to take the State by surprise ... in fact, all opportunities should be given to a proceedee to enable him to produce all such documents which come to his possession even at a later stage also, to substantiate his claim that he is an Indian. No pedantic view should be taken, if there has been some delay or if the same is not mentioned in the written statement.”HC’s observations are important, as it is an oft-repeated statement that “strict procedural rules” do not apply to the workings of the Foreigners’ Tribunals. More often than not, however, this laxity in procedure is used to the disadvantage of accused individuals — for example, by denying the application of the rules of natural justice. HC, however, restored parity by specifying that in the same manner, strict procedural rules should not be used to shut out an individual’s ability to prove her citizenship.Justice Singh also made two further important observations. First, he noted that in cases where individuals were illiterate, or where their birth had not been recorded, documentary evidence would be impossible to obtain. In such cases, facts about date or place of birth could be proved by oral evidence. And second, as the standard of proof was one of “preponderance of probabilities”, a few inconsistencies ought not to be used to defeat an individual’s claim to citizenship. Both observations — while not new — bore reiteration by HC, especially in view of the conduct of the Foreigners’ Tribunals.While the judgment of the Gauhati HC will not solve all the issues that continue to plague the Foreigners’ Tribunals — and inflict great hardship and suffering on ordinary people — it, and more judgments like it, will at least help to restore a semblance of the rule of law to the process.Gautam Bhatia is a Delhi-based advocate The views expressed are personal||https://www.hindustantimes.com/opinion/why-a-gauhati-hc-order-on-a-citizenship-case-is-important-101618760307557.html
20-04-2021||Editorials||The migrant crisis needs attention now||Restrictions imposed to curb the spread of Covid-19 infections have sparked the exit of migrant workers from cities, yet again. On Monday, thousands of migrant workers crowded Delhi’s interstate bus terminals. This happened even after Delhi’s chief minister Arvind Kejriwal’s appeal to them to stay on, and promise that the government will address their needs. Similar stories of reverse migration are being reported from across the country, even as industries and traders have expressed their concerns over its economic consequences.While the scale of the departure of workers is not like the exodus of last year, yet, the fact that migrants have been quick to move out, even at the cost of their health, shows their lack of faith in the Indian State. The government has failed to set up a strong social security net for migrant workers, despite serious proposals on the table. Niti Aayog’s 2021 policy framework on migrant labour has a range of workable recommendations. These include developing a central database for migrants; setting up a social security safety net — health cards, access to schools, extension of public distribution system (PDS) services, and provision of psycho-social assistance and adequate housing, among other steps. While the pandemic presents a massive logistical challenge, and many of these recommendations may need time to be operationalised, the State must do all it can to prevent humanitarian distress. It must consider universalising PDS, expanding the rural employment guarantee scheme to urban areas, and providing direct cash transfers. The pandemic has been brutal for all, but it has been the most brutal for India’s poorest working citizens. Last year, India pledged that the migrant workers would never have to go through the same human suffering again. It is time to redeem that pledge.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/the-migrant-crisis-needs-attention-now-101618928501539.html
20-04-2021||Editorials||A shift in the vaccine strategy||From May 1, India will become one of the first large countries in the world to let all adults seek coronavirus vaccines, as well as allow doses to be sold through private channels. Experts and public health officials long sought decisive steps to open up recipient eligibility and availability of doses, and the government has taken the right call. Allowing anyone who wants a vaccine to get it will improve uptake, and a greater private sector role will improve availability. India has a formidable pharma manufacturing and services industry it can leverage, leaving government resources to focus on containing and mitigating the outbreak. Monday’s decision complements an earlier decision to expedite approvals for foreign vaccines authorised by credible health regulators, and signals a recognition that an unparalleled crisis needs steps that could involve breaking conventions.The two key conventions India breaks from next month are: First, making the programme decentralised and, second, letting the private sector choose how it sells and prices its doses (for India-based manufa-cturers, this prerogative extends only to 50% of what they produce in a month). This is important to tap into private networks and provide adequate incentives; letting India’s diverse states and market forces interact is good. But it also carries some risks — in particular, because of a crucial fine print in the announcement. Those in the 18-45 age bracket will need to pay for a vaccine, unless their state decides to sponsor it. The free doses available at present will continue to be available only for people above 45, frontline workers and health care workers.Experts have flagged concerns about the potential for vaccine inequity in such an approach. Consider Serum Institute of India CEO Adar Poonawalla’s comments that he expects to sell doses of Covishield at the rate of ₹1,000 when private sales open up. This may be among the cheapest of prices, but will likely put the vaccine out of reach for the bottom 20% of households on the economic ladder (the Longitudinal Ageing Study in India released by the government in January estimated this category earns ₹25,825 per year — or ₹2,152 per month — per capita). The onus will now be on the states to serve these populations. As a new — and welcome — vaccine strategy takes shape, it will be important to address concerns about equity, and ensure that the drive is free from profiteering and corruption.||https://www.hindustantimes.com/editorials/a-shift-in-the-vaccine-strategy-101618928442550.html
